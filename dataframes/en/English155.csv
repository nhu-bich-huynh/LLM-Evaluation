"Text"
"However, of all the public utilities that could be privatized and that could be opened to competition, the postal sector is the one that has the most immediate and direct impact in a local economy, simply because the local postman or postmistress lives, works, and raises their children in the area and also in many parts of Europe is the only direct contact that people have with what is going on in the outside world."
"It seems totally illogical to me that on the one hand we are spending hundreds of billions of ecu every year trying to regenerate rural and outlying areas yet, on the other hand, we are taking away the very basic and essential services which allow communities to survive and prosper."
"That is something we must focus on: to get a greater synergy and a greater logic to the way we tackle these European-wide problems."
"Finally, the implication for jobs which this liberalization could have."
"President Santer and the Commission have signed up to his pact for employment."
"This Commission proposal, as presently constituted and if Mr Simpson's amendments are not accepted, could lead to a loss of between 500, 000 to 750, 000 jobs across Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has taken a long time from the Green Paper on the development of the postal services to today's date when we can finally discuss the Commission's proposal for a directive at first reading."
"And it is high time we do so, given that the Commission is still threatening to set up competition rules for the postal services pursuant to Article 90(3), which would totally destroy our work here in the European Parliament."
"Let me begin by raising four points which we in the Group of the European People's Party regarded as central to our work on this proposal for a directive."
"First, the efforts which some Member States have already made to liberalize their postal services must not be cancelled out by the European Union."
"The postal services are fully or almost fully liberalized in Scandinavia while there are some other European countries that have not yet made any efforts as regards their postal services."
"That is why we must make sure that the margin for play set by this directive is broad enough to ensure that liberalized markets are not monopolized again and that those countries that have not so far made any efforts in this direction finally take action to improve their postal service."
"The margin for play must, however, lie with the Member States, we cannot prescribe what to do from Europe."
"Secondly, we want as much competition as possible, as much monopoly as necessary."
"I place great value on that too."
"On the one hand we need competition to improve quality - you can speak later, Florus, will you please let me speak in peace now! - and also in order to control prices."
"On the other hand we need a long-term secure provision for the rural and peripheral areas of the European Union."
"And that is why we also need a monopoly."
"Thirdly, we note that the quality of cross-border postal traffic is pathetic. I say that quite plainly: it is pathetic."
"Let me give you an example."
"For the past 500 years it has taken five days to send a letter from Augsburg where I live to Brussels; in spite of trains, in spite of planes, the speed remains the same as in the days of the mail coach."
"You are all familiar with the rule that holiday postcards to friends and relatives always arrive a week after your return from holiday."
"We could never establish the situation as it unfortunately actually is through a directive."
"We want uniform and good quality standards throughout Europe."
"Fourthly, we want a fair distribution of charges for cross-border post, a very important point that has already been made."
"Unfortunately the Commission did not grasp this nettle."
"I think we will take a good decision on this question in Parliament today, which I hope the Council will also accept."
"These principles I have sketched out are reflected in the amendments which the Group of the European People's Party has tabled again."
"Amendments Nos 70 and 79 ensure that the universal service is restricted to what is absolutely necessary, so that we can have a good basic provision in Europe, for we consider that important too, but can also allow as much competition as possible in Europe."
"Amendment No 71 to Article 13 is intended to ensure that in areas where competition already exists within the universal service, it is not cancelled out again by a uniform tariff, however rational that may be in other areas."
"Naturally we do not want that."
"Amendment No 81 to Article 14 determines how the question of remailing and the payment of terminal dues for incoming mail from abroad should be regulated for the long term."
"I call on the Commission here and now to submit the appropriate proposals, based on our amendments, which I know the Socialists intend to support, as soon as possible so that we can tackle this problem."
"I would also like to point out that we should take the German version of this amendment as our basis, because the different language versions interpret it differently; I consider that very important."
"Finally, in Amendment No 72 to Article 15 we propose that the question of crosssubsidies between the reserved sector and the competition sector should be examined not by the national regulative body but by an independent auditor."
"The advantage of that is that the universal service does not then have to make all its calculations available to the public."
"We do not want to allow crosssubsidies but nor do we want measures that distort competition to be prescribed here."
"The Group of the European People's Party will support the compromises we reached in the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the reserved sector - although we see that as a maximum definition - and on the question of open access to the network."
"I regard that as a good road to pursue."
"Let me thank all Members, and particularly Mr Simpson, for their cooperative attitude and for enabling us to discuss the various points in a spirit of friendly cooperation."
"Madam President, what we see today is a very good example of New Labour."
"This is not Clause 4 economics, it is Santa Claus economics."
"I should like to put one or two questions to the Commission."
"How does the consumer come off, including those in the outermost areas, if we introduce the new electronic means, fax, electronic mail; Mr Newman's fellow trade unionists will then be out of a job."
"Fortunately Mr Newman himself has made sure of a job in Parliament at the union's expense."
"Madam President, I should like to ask the Commission why there must still be a national level of post in an internal and open market."
"I should like to ask the Commission what is the status of Mr Van Miert's communication if today's Simpson report goes through; what will the Commission do now that so little remains of its original ideas?"
"Madam President, I should like to ask the Commission how it can be that when there has been talk on the left of job losses that the integrators, the privately-run services show the most rapid growth in job opportunities in Europe."
"Madam President, I should like to ask the Commission how it can be that a taxpayer has to keep on paying for abominable service."
"Let us take Italy."
"29 % of the post arrives according to the standards laid down."
"That can only improve if we have open and free provision of services."
"If we do not improve the post and we as a Parliament no longer champion the consumer, what have we been elected for?"
"Why cannot we champion the consumer?"
"We, as the Liberal Group, are the only ones willing to do so today."
"The proposals of the Union of European consumers have not even been taken into account by the rapporteur."
"It is too depressing for words."
"I have got two minutes here."
"I have raised one or two questions, but I shall just leave it at that, because only keeping quiet and crying serve any purpose here."
"Madam President, first I should like to convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to Mr Simpson for a wonderful report based on common sense and pragmatism."
"I hope those aspects of the report will be taken on board by the Commission."
"There appears to be a total lack of understanding there of what postal services are all about."
"The Simpson report strikes the balance between improving the present service levels and ensuring that a universal service can be offered to all the citizens of the European Union, irrespective of where they live."
"I come from a country where we are very proud of our public services."
"Indeed, our postal service is one of the best in Europe."
"It is highly efficient, a daily service to all sectors of the community in all parts of the country at a reasonable price."
"We have good postal services accompanied by a quality social service which is of immense value."
"These two services go hand in hand and cannot be separated."
"Therefore it is imperative that we protect our postal system."
"I readily admit that there is always room for improvement."
"Public customer demand will ensure that this is never forgotten and there is always constant pressure on our postal administrations to meet these public pressures."
"I genuinely believe that the Commission proposals in this area would be disastrous if implemented."
"We might benefit in the heavily populated urban areas, the normally profitable areas, but at a very great cost to the non-urban areas."
"Quite obviously the profitable areas are needed to support the non-profitable areas, otherwise the postal system, as we know it, collapses."
"If the Commission were allowed to go ahead - and I am quite sure it will not -it would do more damage to non-urban areas in the European Union than anybody here could imagine."
"Madam President, after having launched deregulation in telecommunications, energy and transport, the European Commission now wants to subject the postal services to the rules of competition."
"The aim is to cream off the most profitable sectors for the benefit of large private companies, reducing the public service to a minimum level, as expressed by the notion of a 'universal service' ."
"Once again the Commission has made no assessment of the social consequences of the directive."
"And yet the direction taken is extremely serious."
"If the directive were adopted in its present form, its application would destroy uniform tariffs, that is, equal treatment and access for users."
"It would result in the dismantling of the public monopoly, with the hiving off or privatization of the most profitable activities."
"Users, and individuals and small businesses in particular, would then receive a poorer quality service."
"The status of employees would be called into question and job losses would follow, as they did in the case of liberalization in Spain, Finland and Sweden."
"Also, the Commission itself recognizes in its explanatory memorandum that 'the process of adaptation will lead to job cuts for the postal operators' ."
"These operators employ one and a half million people."
"No reformer or humanist can view communication as a simple commodity to be subjected exclusively to the laws of the marketplace."
"It is a right which must be recognized by everybody."
"It plays an essential role in social and economic cohesion."
"In France, postal workers and trade unions were actively involved in the social movement at the end of 1995 in order to defend the public service."
"Reflecting their action, our group brought a number of amendments within the Committee on Transport and Tourism which contribute to the recognition of the public service, the strengthening of the reserved sector with the inclusion of direct mail and incoming cross-border mail, and the respect of uniform tariffs."
"Acting on our proposal, the Committee on Transport and Tourism is calling for the development of postal services to be coupled with an improvement in the living and working conditions of postal workers."
"Our group is therefore firmly opposed to the Commission's proposal for a directive and supports most of the amendments of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, while expressing the view that the national post offices should be able to continue to set weight and price limits above those indicated in the directive."
"We refuse to subject postal services to the rule of money."
"We are in favour of upward harmonization by developing cooperation between national operators."
"We demand the maintenance and development of a quality public service, free of strictly financial dictates and respecting the status of employees and the equal treatment of all users."
"Madam President, Mr Simpson's report is right in trying to water down a little the Commission's proposal for a directive on the postal services."
"As far as I am concerned liberalization and throwing open the market for postal services must have a clear objective and liberalization must not be an end in itself, not an ideology or an article of faith."
"I therefore recommend setting to work carefully and choosing a pragmatic approach and in such a way that any negative aspects of liberalization can be countered or that the liberalization process itself can even be reversed if the performance of services seems to be suffering, because it is no accident that the postal service has so far been provided by State monopolies."
"If you look at the pre-conditions for liberalization, scarcely anything has been done at European level."
"So it is no longer a question of letters not dropping into letter boxes but more of sub-post-offices disappearing more and more in recent years in many Member States and particularly in the peripheral areas."
"Mr Wijsenbeek perhaps lives round the corner from the Netherlands Government and the Queen."
"There the post may well come every day and the sub-post-office there will not disappear, but Mr Wijsenbeek does not take account at all of the people who live in the peripheral areas and do not have all services round the corner."
"Naturally the reorganization of postal services and operation of the market is motivated by increased efficiency and that naturally occurs also under the pressure of normal market forces."
"Users are losing an important part of the service and employees are losing their jobs."
"To be honest, is it not better and more sensible, if we have to make a Delors plan to create work requiring a tremendous amount of money, to choose just this type of service which is labourintensive but which costs considerably less money than the senseless plans to lay trans-European networks all over Europe?"
"The Commission recognizes the universal nature of the postal service but it is trying to push its liberalization ideology through."
"Usually the two things by definition do not always go together."
"That seems obvious to me."
"I think the rapporteur's approach is reasonable."
"Madam President, today we can coin a new slogan: New Labour, New Unemployment."
"I enjoyed Mr Simpson's speech enormously."
"I regret however, that at no time did he give any consideration to the consumer or the user of the service."
"Perhaps he could put my mind at rest that Socialists are not frightened of competition or the introduction of new technologies."
"I welcome the Commission proposal and am against the Socialist position as it is perceived today, namely blatant protectionism."
"I have some difficulty with the position in Holland and Sweden as they have gone furthest down the road to liberalization."
"The UK position is that we welcome the Commission proposal with a limited introduction of competition and would like to consider new technologies."
"I invite the rapporteur and members of the Socialist Group to be bold and to welcome a limited degree of competition."
"I would like to see maintenance of the universal service which is especially important to the delivery of post in remote rural areas. Also, there will continue to be a limited area in reserve."
"This should be reviewed in 1998 as envisaged in the directive but we should not have any preconceived ideas at this stage about the nature and extent of further liberalization."
"I invite the rapporteur to put the interests of the consumer and the user of the service first. I commend the proposal to the House and I beg its support for my Amendments Nos 73 and 74."
"European Year Against Racism"
"Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur for this excellent report."
"I would like to point out that Parliament has not just waiting until the conclusions of the Cannes European Council to take an initiative on these terrible questions."
"As early as the 1980s the European Parliament was convinced that this problem of racism must be combated. During the last legislative term Mr Nordmann was the chairman of the committee of inquiry."
"I hope the Commission is aware that ECU 4.7 m are earmarked for 1997, which is still a modest amount. I believe that the nine-month preparation period is not just too long but also swallows up too much money."
"Confusion reigns as to the number of officials to be involved: first the Commission refers to one grade A and one grade C official, then to 3 A grade officials."
"It would be desirable to link up with item B3-300 in the field of information."
"That would reduce the strain on this specific item, namely measures to combat racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism and allow it to be used more effectively."
"A link-up with other institutions such as the Council of Europe would produce considerably more efficiency in future."
"Finally, a brief correction: the phrase programme de diffusion d'images was mistranslated in the German text, namely by Bildmaterial ."
"I would like to adhere to the French version, even though Austria lost the football match against France yesterday!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Oostlander's report is a good one in which he makes an in-depth effort to sound an alarm, a real alarm which comes from our Assembly. It tries to make suggestions for possible actions to put the brake on this phenomenon."
"Certainly the attitudes of racism and xenophobia are for the most part today linked to situations of social marginalization, to run-down urban areas, to joblessness, to feelings of danger, of instability for the future, to ignorance, lack of knowledge, of information on both sides, to the spread of the values of the me -society, often excessively materialistic."
"But essential questions remain unanswered. On the other hand there is a great risk that we shall merely mouth the usual ritual condemnations: for example references to the shortcomings of today's political parties, to the collapse of communism, to the dangers which come only from the extreme right; they seem to me absolutely obsolete, worn-out stereotypes."
"Perhaps some have not realized that in a group with the long democratic tradition of integration such as the European liberal party there is active a party like the Northern League which expressly says that it wishes to take the foot-prints of non-members of the Community. That says a lot about the fact that the schemes of the right and of the left are entirely left out."
"We say 'yes' to the European Year against racism, ' yes' to actions designed above all to help the integration of the various cultures in their diversity, with respect for the individuality of each."
"We have less belief, we must say, in observatories which have frequently become in Europe only a means of squandering a little public money and of giving some friend a salary. I think that one very important basic fact has been undervalued: the cultural fact."
"Mr President, many people today, not least teachers and youth leaders, are confronted with neo-Nazis, skinheads and other groups with unconcealed racist and anti-Semitic views. Few know how to distance themselves from and create something constructive out of such situations."
"A great and important task should be assigned to this centre. It should devise, support, and sometimes itself hold courses aimed mainly at teachers and youth leaders, disseminate knowledge on what feeds racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia and how such phenomena can best be countered and combated."
"With such courses arranged on a broad front, Europe would be better equipped for the work of giving our children and young people tolerant and humanistic ideals. No teacher or youth leader in Europe who seeks an understanding of the anatomy of racism and hatred must be allowed to stand in need of such knowledge."
"Mr President, one proposal in the report is out of harmony with the others. Legislation against racially motivated crimes is self-evident."
"But we Liberals are strongly opposed to legislating against views and prejudices as such."
"They are best combated by argument and by spiritual and material wellbeing. We in the Liberal Group reject legislation against parties."
"It would be a victory for the anti-democrats and a defeat for faith in the power of argument."
"In the Commission's proposal for a European Year against Racism and in the Oostlander report, there is much good sense from which we can gain inspiration in our fight against racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia."
"But the development and conclusion contributed by Mr Wiebenga's amendment should further strengthen the proposal."
"Statement by the President"
"Mr President, the word bannissement in French comes out differently in some translations. So we are against the word bannissement , which would represent a legal provision."
"We have checked all that."
"The text of this resolution is admissible and we have now voted."
"Following the liberalization of a large section of the telecommunications market in Europe and the rest of the world, the Commission now puts forward its proposal to deregulate parts of the legislation that currently governs possibilities for starting and operating a business in the field of mail services."
"The Commission's proposal has met with opposition in a number of quarters, which is also noted in the report produced by Mr Simpson."
"The debate has drawn in views from the major postal administrations in Europe and from the trade union movement. Smaller state postal operators and private mail services have not contributed overmuch to the debate."
"The discussion on competition as a means of promoting the development of this sector and bringing down prices to consumers has also remained in the background."
"We think that liberalization would be good for existing postal businesses, since it would create incentives to them to improve their service and offer it at lower prices."
"A multitude of new enterprises would also be created, which would provide jobs for many people."
"These positive effects have been experienced in countries that have liberalized their postal markets."
"In view of the above, we vote against the Simpson report."
"Adjournment of the session"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 9 May 1996."
"Mr President, this morning a terrorist attack was carried out in Cordoba. It was the work of the ETA terrorist group and resulted in the death of an army sergeant, Miguel Ayllón."
"Our group wishes to express its revulsion and condemn this terrorist attack, requesting that condolences be sent to the victim's family while emphasising the importance of unity among democrats against terrorism in order to bring about a closer relationship among Europeans."
"Mr Marset Campos, the House has condemned this kind of terrorist attack on several occasions."
"We do so again in this case and I will express condolences and sympathy to the families on behalf of us all."
"Order of business"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 15 May 1996 pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Sitting of 20-24 May in Strasbourg"
"Please note that the deadline for tabling motions for resolutions on Cuba is set at 12 noon on Tuesday; the deadline for tabling amendments is 12 noon on Wednesday."
"Regarding speaking time: with a view to a more flexible allocation of speaking time on Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday evening, the Union for Europe Group has proposed setting an overall amount of speaking time for the periods 3 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. and 9 p.m. to 12 midnight, instead of allocating a separate speaking time for the agricultural debate as is presently the case."
"Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, one speaker may now speak in favour and one against."
"Mr Pasty has asked for the floor."
"I assume he is speaking in favour."
"Mr President, in my opinion, the debate we shall have at the beginning of next Wednesday afternoon on the 29 agricultural rules for the next season is probably one of the most important of all the debates we have during our parliamentary year."
"Why? Because the common agricultural policy is, with the fisheries policy, one of the few really common policies within the European Union and also because agricultural expenditure accounts, as you know, for half the European Union's budget."
"It therefore seems to me extraordinary that a shortened speaking time is to be shared between the groups: 75 minutes for nine parliamentary groups is obviously not enough in view of all the Members wishing to speak on the subject."
"That is why, without wishing to upset the conduct of our business on Wednesday afternoon, I ask for aggregation of the speaking time to allow groups the chance to register those who wish to speak in the agricultural debate."
"Mr President, I understand very clearly what Mr Pasty is asking for."
"There is a problem which needs to be addressed if that is going to happen, namely that there is another very important report immediately after the Santini report, the Dankert report on the discharge for the European Parliament's budget for the year 1994."
"As originally agreed in the conference of presidents, with two hours speaking time allocated to agricultural prices, the Dankert report would have started at 5 o'clock and there was some prospect of that debate being held with some integrity."
"With what is now proposed, we have no idea when that debate is going to start."
"That means that if the Dankert report starts in the evening because the Santini report extends over time, then we will be in a position where it very unlikely that any senior member of the administration of this Parliament will be present when we debate the discharge of Parliament's budget for 1994."
"That seems to us entirely incongruous."
"We have no difficulty with the debate on the Dankert report beginning at 9 o'clock, provided we can be assured that the senior members of the administration, from the Secretary-General downwards, are here for the discharge debate on Parliament's budget."
"Do not take this amiss, Mr President."
"Mr Pasty has put forward a proposal."
"You have heard one speaker against it."
"I should like to speak for Mr Pasty's proposal, for two reasons: firstly because I think Mr Pasty has put forward a proposal which makes good political sense."
"It is true that the agriculture debate is very important to many Members of the House, not just members of Mr Pasty' Group, but for members of other groups as well."
"So if it is possible to introduce a measure of flexibility into our agenda by juggling speaking time around a little, it seems to me that is a proposal which makes political sense, in the interests of the good name of the House."
"Of course we have to have enough time to debate other matters, but I was rather surprised by Mrs Green's remarks."
"We cannot have the House's agenda determined by whether or not officials of Parliament choose to be here."
"This House is sovereign."
"If we, Parliament, decide to place a subject on the agenda which concerns the House, it goes without saying that we should be able to count on you, Mr President, to ensure that the officials concerned are present."
"That really is enough."
"The Rules of Procedure are quite explicit."
"I had not quite realised that Mr Pasty was speaking as the mover of the request but took him to be the speaker 'in favour' ."
"And as the mover of the request he has the right to justify it."
"Then Mrs Green spoke against."
"Mr De Vries spoke in favour and I think that is sufficient."
"We have to vote now."
"Mr President, I just want clarification."
"My Group would support the motion if we could have an assurance that should the debate on the Dankert report, which is on our own Parliament's discharge, be held later or not start until 9 o'clock, the senior members of the administration of this Parliament will be present."
"This is a crucially important debate for us."
"So, if we could have that assurance, my Group will vote in favour."
"Mr President, I just wish to make the point that some of us are here at 9 o'clock for the night sittings and know exactly who comes to these night sittings!"
"It is not the case that people are usually here when important discussions are going on."
"The Secretary-General has indeed realised that, quite directly so to speak, for he is sitting beside me."
"He will no doubt say the necessary to his colleagues."
"Sitting of 5-6 June 1996 in Brussels"
"We have one more point, in relation to the sittings of 5 and 6 June in Brussels."
"The Group of the European People's Party has requested that the Council make a statement on the decision not to admit Croatia to the Council of Europe."
"That would of course be entered on the agenda of Wednesday afternoon."
"I call Mrs Oomen-Ruijten to move the request."
"Mr President, we should very much like to have a statement from the Council on its decision in the Council of Europe, apparently reached jointly by all the fifteen."
"Even though the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly gave its approval, fifteen of the members voted against and we would like to have a statement on that."
"Mr President, it may be that the Council will make one in the course of this week on the basis of Article 37, but if it does not, I am serving notice now that we shall be requesting either a statement or - and this may perhaps appeal to other Members of the House - an oral question with debate."
"I would ask you to make time available for that, Mr President."
"It should be possible to have this instead of the debate on the ombudsman."
"Your request is that we take this during the June I part-session."
"That would mean we try to include this item on the agenda of Wednesday, 5 June, beginning with a Council statement."
"Since nobody has asked to speak against, I assume the House agrees."
"The order of business is thus established."
"Return and export of cultural goods"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0110/96 by Mr Escudero, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive (COM(95)0479 - C4-0463/95-95/0254(COD)) amending the Annex to Council Directive 93/7/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State; -A4-0111/96 by Mr Escudero, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal fro a Council Regulation (COM(95)0479 - C4-0558/95-95/0253(CNS)) amending the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92 of 9 December 1992 on the export of cultural goods."
"The EEC Treaty set up an area without borders for the single market in which the free circulation of goods was guaranteed."
"However, in turn, it became clear that it was necessary to make this free circulation of goods compatible with responsibility for cultural goods which are symbols of Europe's rich and varied cultural idiosyncrasy."
"This means that whereas goods in general could be the subject of free traffic there is a need to guarantee the protection of cultural goods and preserve each country's artistic heritage, avoiding situations where the poorer areas are dispossessed of their signs of cultural identity or the richer countries, through trading power, make off with the artistic heritage of the harder up."
"To this end the EEC Treaty recognised that these states could impose prohibitions or restrictions on the import and export of cultural goods."
"In fact under Community rules, not only are Member States authorised to determine which of their cultural goods are to be exempted from the general rule of free trade but the Commission has taken it upon itself to institute in general terms a complementary protection system for the export, import and transit of cultural goods."
"This complementary Community protection is exercised by the means of two legal instruments: a 1992 Regulation on the export of cultural goods and the 1993 Directive on the return of cultural goods unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State."
"Cultural goods are those goods qualifying for protection and defined as those listed in an Appendix common to both the Regulation and the Directive offering an economic evaluation."
"In addition to this economic evaluation, cultural goods need, according to the regulation, a licence in order to be exported and, in addition to quantity - according to the Directive - goods may be reclaimed if, according to the law, they have been the subject of illegal export."
"These categories of cultural goods include paintings - Category 3 - and drawings - Category 4."
"The financial threshold for paintings is 150, 000 ECU and for drawings 15, 000 ECU."
"However, the problem has arisen as to the category of one type of cultural goods, namely water colours, pastels and gouache, which for reasons which would be too troublesome to go into this afternoon, some countries regard as paintings and others as drawings."
"In order to find a solution to this problem, the Commission might have proposed integrating pastels and gouache into Category 3, in other words setting the same financial threshold as for paintings, or into Category 4, giving them the same financial threshold as drawings."
"But this would have gone against the positions of the Member States whose definition was rejected and will also not have been a viable solution in financial terms."
"We know in fact that as a whole, to generalise, the price of water colours is much lower than that for paintings and much higher than that for drawings."
"Were the threshold the same as that for paintings a high proportion of water colours, pastels and gouache would circulate unrestricted."
"Were the threshold for drawings, 15 000 ECU, to apply, far too great a number of such works would require Community export licences, leading to red-tape problems, economic chaos and budgetary difficulties."
"If, in the end, water colours, pastels and gouache cannot be classified in all cases as either paintings or drawings, both for purely terminological reasons and on financial grounds, only one solution remains: these types of work must be placed in a separate intermediate category."
"Given that, as we have already shown water colours, pastels and gouache generally fetch prices closer to those of drawings than those of paintings, as is recognised by those dealing in such cultural assets, I propose this afternoon that the financial threshold for Category 3a should not be equidistant between the other two but should be closer to that for drawings: in other words, it should be fixed at 30 000 ECU."
"I hope, Mr President, that this is a way of solving the difficult problem of categorising and trading in these cultural assets and that this will be in keeping with the fundamental principle of any legal order: in other words, everyone must deal with the same things in the same way otherwise no legal order, as everyone knows, could survive."
"Simply, I would like to finish by pointing out that this proposal for reforming the Directive and Regulation on the Export of Cultural Goods is a reform which is fundamentally a technical one, fundamentally based on a problem which had been felt in practice and which should not stand in the way of the revision and reexamination of the Directive and Regulation, something which this Assembly should also look at."
"Mr President, I think that Mr Escudero's report has a certain value and I ask him to accept my congratulations."
"However, Mr President, speaking for my group at least, I feel that I must draw attention to the fundamental underlying pretence of the directive and regulation that are being proposed."
"Firstly, I do not believe that creativity is strengthened by emphasizing and protecting objects rather than their creators."
"You will say that this has nothing to do with the texts that we are debating, but I just wish to make the point."
"Many such creators of cultural objects, among those who are alive now at least, are quite emphatic about that."
"Secondly, Mr President, I truly cannot fathom out this attempt - if my understanding of it is correct - to restrict international trade in cultural objects."
"What is the meaning of it?"
"In saying that such and such a cultural object must not be taken out of the country are we saying that cultural goods ought really to be available for broadly based public and social enjoyment?"
"Then what does it matter then if a private citizen in the territory of a country which prohibits the export of cultural objects wishes to keep such an object at home purely for his own enjoyment?"
"I fear that, essentially, the directive and regulation will do nothing but bring about a lowering of the value of objects kept at home by private collectors."
"But why?"
"Is it because we expect that as time goes by someone, the state that is, will be able to buy them and make them available for the pleasure of the general public?"
"If that were the case there would be a meaning in it."
"If that also is not the thinking - and I see no reason why the states should necessarily be envisaging that - the only thing that can be said about this policy is that it runs counter to the laws of the market, egregious as they are in this field too."
"I do not think that cultural heritage problems which stem from the organization of the market and the circulation of capital can be solved like this."
"Mr President, the rapporteur is quite right to point out that this is primarily a technical matter."
"But he is equally right to point out that in the end we are concerned with the protection of cultural goods."
"In that regard I take the view that the proposal he has submitted, i.e. to introduce a special category for water colours, gouaches and pastels, is right, in order to prevent any inappropriate equal treatment or inappropriate unequal treatment in future."
"But we should also follow the proposal from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and review the effectiveness of both the directive and the regulation after three years."
"I think a separate comment has to be made on the wording with regard to the return of national cultural goods."
"So long as a member country of the Council of Europe produces legislation on what is called plundered art it is in my view also essential to pose the question what the ownership or possession of cultural goods actually means."
"I think we have to discuss this right from the start in relation to the general accessibility of cultural goods, protection against misuse and forming part of a regional or local cultural context."
"Who is the owner of the symphony from which we have taken our European anthem?"
"I think the answer to that question is also relevant to the fine arts."
"Mr President, I believe we can all be pleased with the two proposals submitted for our scrutiny today."
"For although our Union is founded on the principle of the free movement of goods, we are all aware that it would be dangerous to apply it to cultural matters, since cultural goods are not merchandise like other goods and the lifting of restrictions on trade between Member States could lead to the spiriting away of works of art."
"A remedy therefore had to be found for this practice, which I'm afraid has been common in the past."
"Remember the way the Nazis organized the pillage of works of art in the countries they occupied."
"What is more, this practice has not completely disappeared."
"That is why the introduction of Article 36 undoubtedly represented progress: it gives Member States the discretionary power to invoke a clause limiting the import or export of certain cultural goods on grounds of protecting national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value."
"Two additional bricks have been added to the edifice by this Regulation and Directive, as they introduce the concept of 'national treasures' making it possible to give them protection under Community law."
"Once again, we can only welcome these proposals and we hope to see them adopted like the report of Mr Escudero, whom I must congratulate for the work he has put in. A comment and a regret, however."
"If it is absolutely fundamental that cultural goods should be protected, it is all the more regrettable that the RAPHAEL programme has been blocked."
"After all, this aims to protect Europe's cultural heritage and it must be borne in mind that such protection assumes a minimum of rules and objectives that only a programme can provide."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, the tree formed by these two measures is an undoubted improvement, but this should not make us lose sight of the wood of our shortcomings in protecting our heritage."
"Mr President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur on his two reports, at least for emphasizing the importance of affording protection to all of the diverse cultural objects that reflect the artistic creativity and the historic heritage and identity of each people."
"Of course, this cultural heritage has value and importance only when it is actually at the disposal to the people who created it; because, as Mr Papayannakis has asked, what value can an object have when it is locked away in the private collection of some tycoon of the times and protected in that sense, and with its value not falling but, in actual fact, rising because of the restrictions?"
"In our view, anyway, cultural objects ought not to be treated as mere goods, and their import, export and movement should be controlled or prohibited so that the artistic, historic and archaeological heritage of nations can be protected."
"Speaking from that standpoint, I would like to urge the Commission just a little bit more to venture at some juncture to put its fingers on the stigmata."
"Is the priceless cultural heritage, passed down from the depths of history, which has been stolen from countries such as mine for instance, going to be protected?"
"Are those countries which are currently in possession of priceless archaeological treasures going to be made to return those cultural objects to the countries from which they were stolen?"
"Even parts of the Parthenon, that immense creation of the human mind, are being kept far away from their rightful place, and their return is being refused!"
"In the impending substantial revision of the directive can we not insert a demand, at long last, for the return of such treasures to the countries they belong to?"
"That is my question to the Commission, Mr President, and I would like a reply."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for once this report describes to us a legal mechanism that is perfectly in balance."
"This is the mechanism of Articles 30 and 34, laying down the principle of free trade, and of Article 36, laying down the conditions for the protection of national heritages of cultural goods."
"Why this Article 36?"
"In the end it exists, firstly, to prevent an attack on cultural diversity and, secondly, to avoid dispossessing the poorest of their cultural identity."
"At this point, I can't help thinking of a famous saying of the French socialist Jean Jaurès: ' The poor have only their country' ."
"For with very little in the way of personal goods, they, more than other citizens, have only their national cultural heritage to enjoy."
"Thus, the present cultural mechanism, which consists of a Regulation on the export of cultural goods and a Directive on the return of cultural goods, seems to us to be well balanced."
"The rapporteur's proposals for the creation of a third category of works of art for the practical application of this mechanism seem to us to be going in the right direction and we shall vote for this text."
"At this point, however, I should like to raise a question of principle."
"Does free trade always bring maximum satisfaction to all the partners?"
"Is it not a unilateral principle, originating therefore from a sort of hemiplegic thinking as absurd as its opposite: the autarkic thinking which would abolish all free trade?"
"Does not the truth lie, as Aristotle saw, exactly in a happy medium, aiming at the common good?"
"Why should what is true for cultural goods not be true for other types of goods, since it is obviously far from being clear how far the concept of 'cultural goods' extends."
"Some very high quality goods, in the world of fashion for example or in the agri-foodstuffs area for certain wines, show clearly that protective mechanisms are needed to prevent levelling down by market forces."
"This is also true every time the production of a high quality product does not automatically generate a profit for the producers."
"And then there is also the problem of access for the poorest."
"For all these reasons, therefore, I believe that there must be a balance between the two principles of freedom and protection, and it seems to us that, while retaining free trade as the principle for economic wealth creation, it is essential to introduce the concept of 'national preference' and of 'European preference' as originally embodied in the Treaty of Rome."
"Mr President, of course it is extremely important for those cultural goods that form or will one day form the artistic heritage of the Member States to remain in their original environment."
"The fact that there are divergent artistic views on many subjects, e.g., the definition of the various types of pictures, is proof of the Member States' cultural independence."
"This fact alone suggests that it should be up to the national states to fix the financial threshold for certain categories of art works."
"It should be left to the national states to decide what priorities they set and what financial thresholds they observe in order to counter the risk of an artistic sell-out."
"During the planned general review of the regulation and the directive, it should be up to the Member States to fix the financial thresholds for works of art, as it is up to them to classify them as national cultural goods."
"Thank you, Mrs Bonino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Humanitarian aid"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0125/96) on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position of the Council (C4-0098/96-95/0119(SYN)) on the proposal for a Council Regulation on humanitarian aid (rapporteur: Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a huge and vital subject: humanitarian aid, in the eyes of Europeans, is one of the most positive images Europe is creating for us."
"Mrs Sauquillo has been able, with patience and determination, to make the most of the options available to the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the importance of humanitarian action and of cooperation between those involved: the Community, Member States, international organizations, NGOs."
"This work is a credit to the European Union, which, alone in the world, I repeat, is endowed with such determination and such instruments."
"First save bodies, said Albert Camus, channel aid to those who need it most, develop rehabilitation and reconstruction work, genuine development programmes, which can only start later; try to mitigate the disastrous consequences of the displacement of populations, etc."
"Mrs Sauquillo's work backs up ECHO and those involved in humanitarian aid of the utmost urgency."
"We should like these proposals to be extended to humanitarian mine-clearing operations and we are not happy with the results of the Vienna Conference in this respect."
"In order to carry out all these actions, coordination with NGOs and international organizations had to be improved."
"That is now done, and Parliament will receive an annual report on such aid."
"We willingly accept that the Commission and ECHO can alone decide emergency measures not exceeding a budget of ECU 10 million."
"On the other hand, we shall be much firmer and more watchful over the comitology procedure - I can't get used to this name - adopted by the Council."
"The Procedure 3a suggested seems to us quite obviously cumbersome, expensive and sometimes difficult to implement."
"I cannot say this too strongly: watch out for emergencies, watch out for delays, we would not be forgiven for them."
"In Liberia, do you see States discussing whether a boat should be sent when people are drowning?"
"Finally, and I have been fighting for this for more than twenty years, I see this House still preoccupied with the prevention of conflicts, a form of legal and moral interference which always has to be undertaken beforehand, and which must not cost much money, which must of course be efficient, much more efficient than the rest of the world, but always arrives too late."
"Thank you for your efforts, Mrs Sauquillo."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on behalf of our group."
"We are concerned here with humanitarian aid, that is to say, the suffering of many millions of people in the world."
"We all know that the money from this budget line cannot in itself reduce all the suffering in the world let alone eliminate it completely."
"That is why I would like to use this opportunity to point out once again that we must remove the roots of the suffering and the roots of the humanitarian problems by pursuing an effective foreign and security policy that regards peace and the prevention of military conflict and respect for human rights as the primary objective."
"A final decision must be taken on this at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, and on the abolition of the unanimity rule."
"On the other hand, of course we must also ensure through long-term projects that the situation in many countries stabilizes and that these humanitarian disasters do not therefore occur in the first place."
"Natural disasters will continue to exist, but here too I do not believe that they are acts of God."
"As a result of the climatic changes we are already seeing an increase in the number of tornados and the scientists are predicting very definitely that we will be witnessing more natural disasters unless something decisive is done to protect the climate."
"That is why the European Union must carry out a much wider-scale preventive environmental policy than before in order to prevent such disasters in future."
"On the budget line I take the following view: if we agree that we cannot remove all the suffering in the world just with this money, then that means on the one hand that we must remove the causes."
"On the other hand, it means that this money must be allocated especially effectively, because we are dealing here with human lives."
"Every Deutschmark that is wasted cannot be used to save human lives."
"Moreover, we face the dilemma that we have to act as quickly as possible and that certain control measures, which are necessary or are carried out in other areas, cannot be implemented in this area."
"We discussed that at great length in committee and also followed the Council's discussions of this subject."
"We really must reconcile these two interests."
"The rapporteur herself mentioned that this committee procedure is regarded with some criticism, presumably partly because the European Parliament does not have any chance of participation here."
"Of course the best solution would be for us to be just as involved in all the political decisions of the Commission as the Council representatives are, but I do not think that is feasible at this moment."
"The alternative, namely to let the Commission decide quite freely here, without being tied by any political instructions, has its dangers too."
"Speaking just for myself I must say that some comments made by the responsible Commission officials - I do not mean you, Madam Commissioner - did rather irritate me."
"For instance, I did not always receive a confidence-inspiring answer to the question of how to ensure that the money is allocated effectively."
"Yet I believe that control is most important in this area too and that the Council has found a compromise that is flexible to the extent that we do not in fact have to wait for years for funds to be granted in cases of disaster."
"Our group has therefore decided not to support Amendment No 2 because we believe that it is better for all concerned, including the Commission, for procedures to be laid down and the responsibility to be distributed across several shoulders so that the measures can be implemented all the more resolutely."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mrs Sauquillo on the excellent and detailed work that she has done; as I have said on several occasions in this House, the role of humanitarian aid begins when, unfortunately, political or diplomatic efforts have failed or, at least, proved to be ineffective."
"It is therefore crucially important, on the one hand to restore the role of preventive democracy, so that it can assume its real function of crisis prevention and, on the other, to ensure that coherent and coordinated humanitarian strategies are devised, designed to tackle, using rapid and effective methods, situations of conflict which it has not been possible to avert."
"Underdevelopment and poverty are almost always at the root of crises; the humanitarian actions in which the European Union has participated in recent years have largely been the result of conflicts that have come to the surface in developing countries, mainly of a domestic nature."
"The difficulty is to assess how the Union can intervene more effectively, bearing in mind that there is no right of interference in the domestic affairs of a state; we need therefore to try to reinforce the right to interfere for humanitarian purposes, with which some colleagues are very familiar, so that assistance to victims is not related to any kind of party-political consideration, and this proposal for a regulation seeks to underpin the existing budget lines, earmarked for humanitarian aid, with a legal basis commensurate with needs and recent developments in Community action in this sector."
"The UN's basic expertise lies in crisis management rather than crisis prevention."
"We have therefore to effect a change in that approach, now that the political base-lines have changed with the collapse of the Berlin Wall and it is possible to set in place a policy of prevention that is not constrained by the split resulting from the East-West conflict."
"But the UN does not currently have the human and material resources it needs to put into effect a warning system that is both credible and independent."
"Its excessively centralized administration does not lend itself to implementing rapid preventive measures."
"It is for Western Europe to play a balancing role in the state of affairs that has now come into being - particularly Parliament which we here represent - by seeking to encourage measures that form part of a global strategy to resolve the problem which has to be based on genuinely reinforcing preventive diplomacy."
"Mr President, I will begin where the rapporteur, Mrs Sauquillo, left off, and I must compliment her on her work."
"Indeed, humanitarian aid workers would not be necessary if it were possible to bring preventive action to a satisfactory conclusion."
"I would thus argue in favour of more material support, including private initiatives from this House, given that Mrs Sauquillo is a member of the forum for preventive diplomacy."
"Perhaps then, Mrs Baldi, we might have some follow-up to the report on the right of intervention which was adopted here unanimously - with my name on it - because that report has been hanging around for three years already."
"The European Union is extremely active in providing humanitarian aid to crisis areas, and that can only be good."
"Former Yugoslavia, Angola, the Great Lakes Region of Africa, we are there."
"I am very proud of that and so are all the members of my Group and perhaps all Dutchmen too."
"We are in favour of moves to give this policy a legal basis at last."
"The Union needs flexible rules for decision-making in this area."
"In my view the common position of the Council sticks too much to over-complex and time-consuming comitology procedures."
"For this reason too the Liberals support the rapporteur's amendments."
"The same goes for the rapporteur's other amendments; for example, and let us be clear on this, it is just too crazy for words to agree to taxes being charged on humanitarian aid by countries through which it passes and countries which receive it."
"That penalizes the needy population, but it offends my own conscience too."
"The objective is to get as much help as possible to the population and not to comply with a few rules."
"The Union has constantly to continue optimizing its emergency aid, we know that."
"The Union could improve its policy further by maintaining more emergency stocks than it currently maintains in crisis-prone areas, so that aid can reach the spot quickly."
"Furthermore, as far as possible supplies should be purchased in the region or elsewhere in other developing countries."
"This would provide a good boost, for example to local agriculture."
"Lastly, I welcome the reference which Mr Kouchner made to the need for humanitarian aid to include land mine clearance, so that unnecessary civilian casualties are prevented and development is not impeded."
"I have to say, the emptiness of the Chamber is out of all proportion to the importance of this debate."
"Mr President, humanitarian aid is an act of humanity in emergency situations, either in crisis situations resulting from natural disasters, in which case we have to ask ourselves whether we are partly responsible, or when preventive diplomacy and political action as a whole have failed."
"Since 1992 we have had the European Union's Humanitarian Aid Office - ECHO."
"Mrs Sauquillo has submitted an important report that sets out specific objectives and general criteria for the Community's humanitarian aid."
"We have noted that difficulties arose with other Commission departments and that problems have occurred in the cooperation between ECHO and the other Commission services responsible for development policy."
"We were told that they have been or will be dealt with."
"However, to date we have not seen a specific document defining the areas of competence."
"I believe we must differentiate between emergency aid, aid for reconstruction, i.e., rehabilitation, and development aid - that is not in the report."
"Only on the basis of a common programme can we achieve anything in the field of humanitarian aid."
"It was also said here that this is an area of foreign policy."
"Here I think the European Community, if it formulates a new foreign and security policy at the Intergovernmental Conference, must take care not to use humanitarian aid as a new means of defining its foreign policy profile at the cost of humanitarian aid."
"There is no evidence of harmonization with UN organizations; so the possibility of giving the European Union a higher profile must not mean putting an end to on-going forms of cooperation and we must not set up separate bodies."
"Finally, in my view we need a little more modesty and a little more cooperation with the NGOs."
"The NGOs in particular have often criticized ECHO for taking a centralist approach."
"Here we must encourage dialogue, here we are a critical partner; then we will be able to provide humanitarian aid in real emergency situations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's action represents an important stage in legislation because we are finally reaching the end of a process which will at last enable us to establish a legal basis for the European Union's humanitarian aid. That aid - and we should not forget this - is the most substantial of its kind at an international level, and this report is therefore very welcome."
"I wish, of course, to add my thanks and congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Sauquillo, but I wish also to extend them to Commissioner Bonino herself, not just because of what she is doing and has done in the field of humanitarian aid - her very hard work in the various areas and on the various fronts of humanitarian aid which has made it possible to move beyond aid to the prevention that so many of us had wanted to see - but also because, through Wednesday's vote and the final decision, she has brought the dossier to fruition."
"Personally, and on behalf of my group, I have to say that I intend to vote for our amendments, in particular that relating to comitology and am therefore astounded at the position today adopted in the House by the EPP group which is at total variance with the stance taken by the group in committee, given that the report was adopted unanimously."
"I hope that they will reconsider because, as the Commissioner will recall, there has been reference to the code of conduct and the importance of Parliament's votes on second reading being able to be accepted by the Commission."
"I know that there is a compromise and, since we are waiting for the IGC to provide us with an improved definition of the committees, I think it important that Parliament should confirm its intention of opposing committee 3a in this sector in particular in which - and Mr Kouchner was right to point this out - matters are urgent, and the Commission has to have a free hand and be able to take decisions more flexibly than is currently allowed by the Council."
"Mr President, the Commissioner has heard from the rapporteur, the chairman of the committee and representatives of all the groups that he has compromised too far on the comitology issue."
"The Council's adherence to setting up new, delaying and secretive comitology committees prejudices this whole regulation."
"It is a regulation about humanitarian aid, which, in particular, should be about bringing speedy relief to the innocent victims of disaster and conflict throughout the world."
"Yet all the decisions about the protection of humanitarian aid, goods and staff - despite the fact that defence implications are specifically excluded, as well as all actions taken directly by the Commission and by the specialized Member State organizations - will now be referred to and controlled by the Council under its excessive 3a procedure."
"It could have been even worse, and I pay tribute to Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, our rapporteur, who has ensured an urgency procedure for projects up to ECU 10m, with global plans of humanitarian aid like those being planned at present for Angola, Sierra Leone and the Sudan dealt with under a lesser procedure."
"Nevertheless, in supporting Amendment No 2 today this Parliament remains steadfast in its opposition to any extension of these excessive 3a committees. Not only does it transfer decision-making away from the Commission and bring it to the Council, but it does so via meetings for which there are no prior published papers or minutes, from which the European Parliament and all those committed to openness and transparency in decision-making are excluded, and where the need to write papers diverts already stretched Commission staff away from their proper job of managing humanitarian aid effectively."
"The delay in translating those papers into eleven different languages can be measured in terms of extra deaths."
"It seems to us that the Council is more interested in playing the politics of Europe than in assisting people in distress."
"We ask the Commissioner to support Parliament in our resolve on this issue."
"Mr President, I also would like to add my congratulations to Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco for an excellent report."
"But, as Mr Howitt has said, this regulation represents yet again the wish of Member States to usurp the executive responsibilities of the Commission."
"The comitology procedures which are proposed are restrictive and challenge the democratic role of this Parliament to which the Commission should be accountable."
"The 3a committee procedure proposed is certainly not an example of either openness or democracy."
"The proceedings take place in secret and the members are nominated by governments."
"As my colleague, Mr Wynn, said here on another occasion, being unelected and almost always meeting in secret and therefore not being subject to supervision by the budgetary or legislative authorities, these committees may subvert the legislative process."
"It is indeed regrettable that the nine most significant European Parliament amendments were not incorporated into the Council's common position."
"Parliament should not be fobbed off by the Commission's willingness to submit an annual report."
"The European Parliament is not associated in any way with the onceyearly discussion on general guidelines on operations."
"Neither - and we regret that - are we associated with the regular assessments which will establish whether objectives have been achieved and how guidelines should be changed to improve the effectiveness of subsequent operations."
"The suggested procedures for ECHO are extraordinarily complicated and will deter the speedy and effective action that ECHO so often needs to take."
"There will be elaborate procedures and delays."
"ECHO is already under enormous strain - up to 15, 000 contracts in 1995 alone."
"It is inevitable that the policies, strategies and coordination of ECHO will be damaged by these proposals."
"More paperwork will mean more bureaucratic delay and will certainly reduce the likelihood that our programmes will be properly prepared or properly targeted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Sauquillo, the chairman of the committee and all of you for the contributions you have made and also for the speed with which you have considered this report."
"I hope that, following tomorrow's vote, the 'development' Council, which meets on 28 May, will be able finally to close this dossier."
"The rapporteur has said how long and - let me assure you - extremely difficult the negotiations have been."
"You are familiar with the Commission's original proposal concerning a consultative committee; among other things, the work of the committees is normally confidential or secret, regardless whether we are dealing with a consultative committee, a 2a committee or a 3a committee: that is a factor common to all committees."
"Basically, there are three points that I wish to make."
"First of all, along with the Commission, I personally agree with the stress many of you have placed on the need for preventive diplomacy, the humanitarian right to interfere or the right to interfere for humanitarian purposes; I also agree with the stress many of you have placed on the issue of mines and the need to eliminate them, as well as the need to try to clear land of mines."
"It seems to me that these are issues, on the one hand of an institutional nature, which will be tackled in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference and, on the other, particularly as regards mines, that are now the subject of international consideration, although very considerable difficulties are involved."
"The Commission wishes at any rate to assure the House that we truly share that approach."
"Having said that, as far as what we are able to tackle today, in this report, is concerned, I believe that there needed to be a legal basis for the emergency aid, at any event we were asked for that: on that point, I think we have done a good job."
"Turning to the three remaining amendments, I wish to make the following points. As regards the first, concerning exemption from tax, levies and customs duties etc, the Commission will be incorporating it into its proposal because, frankly, it seems to us absolutely right."
"I do not wish to enter here into the issue of certain recent cases of humanitarian aid concerning one region in particular, in which that problem has arisen: there have also been negotiations with the country in question - with which you are very familiar - and the Commission therefore accepts the amendment in question."
"Turning to the second amendment on comitology: you know that the Commission was in favour of a consultative committee; you will also be well aware that the negotiations were very long and that, in the end, we arrived at a compromise that you are familiar with and are seeking to improve on."
"Let me make just two points here: first of all, we have listened, in the House, to many different views, but they have been far more univocal than those expressed in the Council, albeit in the more limited sense of the term."
"I have therefore to say here that, as regards the 3a procedure, this concerns genuinely special cases: in particular it concerns cases involving the protection of victims or direct action by the European Community."
"I have also to say that, when it comes to emergency cases, the Commission is empowered to take its own decisions."
"Admittedly, we too would have preferred a different position, but it seems to us that, at this point, we ought to accept this type of compromise on the common position."
"As regards the third amendment, I have to say that the Commission has tried, and is trying, on a voluntary basis also, to have ever more contacts for the purposes of consultation with the non-governmental organizations."
"Frankly, however, it seems to me to be difficult to insert the proposal in question into a Council regulation."
"The Commission is proposing to you a declaration in which it undertakes to cooperate and consult with the non-governmental organizations."
"It does not accept the amendment simply because it does not believe that the proposal fits into the Council regulation."
"The Commission - let me repeat this - intends, through its declaration, to enter into a very specific political commitment vis-à-vis the House and our partners who are in fact the nongovernmental organizations."
"I further take the view that as regards the relationship between humanitarian aid and rehabilitation, the two debates that are to follow during the course of this afternoon will give us an opportunity to go more deeply into certain aspects, given that the two reports still to come deal with those very issues."
"Allow me, finally, to stress that humanitarian aid does not go to developing countries exclusively: humanitarian aid currently goes - increasingly, I regret to say - to countries such as the former Yugoslavia or countries stricken by natural disasters or to other countries which, objectively speaking, do not have the problems of the developing countries."
"I therefore urge the House to bear in mind that humanitarian aid is geographically channelled to where it is needed and not, in fact, limited to the developing countries."
"In conclusion, I would again thank the House and the rapporteur, and I hope that, once the legal basis is established, our work will be able not only to continue but to improve."
"Thank you, Mrs Bonino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Food-aid policy and management"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0126/96) on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position established by the Council with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on food-aid policy and food-aid management and special operations in support of food-aid (C4-0097/96-95/0160(SYN)) (rapporteur: Mr Telkämper)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report concerns the European Union's food aid policy and creates a new legal basis for that policy."
"Before discussing the report in more detail, I would like to add a few words on food aid policies, for they mean more than what we are defining and deciding here through the various budget lines."
"What is the situation at present on the world market?"
"There are more than 800 million chronically undernourished people."
"The number of children who die every day is equal to the population of a medium-sized town in our Community."
"This number will rise dramatically."
"It will rise dramatically and new famines will occur, caused by factors we do not generally tackle."
"What are the causes?"
"They are natural disasters, whose origins we often do not question, such as whirlwinds."
"Reference was made to climatic disasters in relation to the previous report."
"When we in the European Union decide on measures in the field of transport, such as the trans-European networks with the emissions associated with them - CO2 , nitric oxides - we are contributing to the continuation of these climatic disasters and therefore these famines."
"That means that the policy pursued in this area ought to begin with the reorganization of industrial society."
"We are seeing a growing number of wars."
"Over recent years we have always had more than 50 wars on this planet, with many people in the European Union becoming very rich from arms exports."
"I think we should stop these arms exports and the production of weapons."
"It would be more sensible to safeguard jobs by reorganizing the arms sector and in any case we should ensure that arms exports are registered."
"Then there is indebtedness, debts from which our banks make good profits and that prevent the southern countries from being able to develop and therefore condemn them to famine and disasters."
"We have the GATT negotiations, a ruthless bunch of people operating on a world scale; because of the world-scale deregulation we have an increasing number of regions that simply cannot produce enough food for themselves."
"That is our point of departure."
"We have devised a programme of food aid policy here that is sensible enough in itself but that cannot really take effect unless we also adapt the other policy areas."
"I think that must be said from the outset if we really want to clarify the scale of the problem facing us."
"This new regulation is useful, this new regulation sets targets and encourages self-sufficiency."
"That is a step in the right direction for the countries concerned."
"The special feature - and this is something development politicians have been demanding for years - is that with this regulation we are dissociating food exports from the promotion of food production and distribution in the developing countries concerned."
"I think this dissociation from the EU agricultural market represents major progress and is most important."
"A further sign of progress is that we have incorporated in the regulation something development politicians have been demanding for decades, namely the support and encouragement for triangular operations."
"It makes sense to rebuild this subsistence economy at local level and through regional markets, to ensure that one country can supply food to a neighbouring country suffering from famine."
"Precedence is being given to extensive farming."
"What we need is a reform of the UN World Food Programme."
"It must go hand in hand with this programme which we are proposing as a legislative basis."
"We have incorporated consultation and control mechanisms in the internal implementing regulation, which preclude any conflicting agricultural or development aid policy."
"We need more financial resources and if we manage to reorganize agricultural policy here in the European Union and to continue to reduce agricultural subsidies, then we should use that money to promote ecological farming, for instance, and small and medium-sized undertakings in the south."
"We were very concerned with the regional dimension, as we were to emphasize the role of women in production."
"In many forms of society women play an important role in the field of agriculture, nutrition and food, and that needs to be supported through joint programmes."
"As with the previous report, it is a pity that this Parliament does not have adequate powers."
"I think that for the future formulation of this policy we need a co-decision procedure."
"That is a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Council should get that into its head, but the citizens of our Member States and the members of our national parliaments should also take it in."
"They must try to convince their governments, to ensure that we can achieve genuinely democratic structures here."
"I think we will be faced with major famines again, and for the reasons I cited earlier."
"One first indication is the price of wheat."
"New markets are emerging, China is buying up wheat, the price of wheat has doubled and supplies have therefore become scarce."
"This is a challenge to us right now."
"We can only change this situation if we change the international structures."
"We can only have a genuine food aid policy if, among others, we reorganize agricultural production in our European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how could one fail to agree with Mr Telkämper?"
"You know the old refrain: the Northern countries have for thirty years been living through a recurrent crisis of agricultural overproduction, but the world still has 800 million starving people."
"How could one fail to agree with him?"
"He is right: the food is there, but the problem in many countries is to procure it when their individual annual income is less than 200 dollars, or even less than 100 dollars."
"The main problem as regards starvation and malnutrition is certainly not the general problem of world production, but instead that of distributing food and sharing it among the inhabitants of the world."
"What is there to add to that?"
"Mr Telkämper has mentioned some very specific points about these recommendations and I am of course in agreement with him."
"I should like to single out a vital element of response. This concerns what is called the transnational dimension of a region wishing purchases to be made, as far as possible, either in a neighbouring country or in the country itself, or else in another part of the country where there is no famine."
"These operations, described as triangular, are absolutely essential, first to ensure the sure supply of food that is our concern and to avoid changing the eating habits of the region, but also to develop something we are fighting for: local production and local trade."
"This point can never be sufficiently stressed."
"Europe has tried successfully to make the promotion of human rights the cornerstone of its development policy."
"Might we do the same as regards the fight against famine and poverty by accepting that democracy will not be possible if there is not enough food?"
"And I would personally see no objection, either, to the possibility of transferring the debt of poor countries to development schemes and the fight against famine and malnutrition, managed by countries to which they are indebted."
"Finally, I should like, with your support, to make a serious proposal here for holding a major conference on water."
"This is the essential element without which there will be no preventive or even curative policy on malnutrition and food problems."
"If, all together, we were to tackle the water problem at the dawn of the twenty-first century, it would redound to the credit of the Members of this Parliament and would, I am sure, prove to be effective."
"Mr President, first of all I should like as usual to congratulate Mr Telkämper."
"On development issues he is one of the safest pairs of hands as far as I can see."
"I entirely agree with his analysis of the situation."
"I had the opportunity of travelling to Angola with him quite recently."
"I do not think we disagreed on any of the issues we saw there, so his analysis is my analysis and I fully support it."
"The fundamental rationale of all EU food aid policy must obviously be to guarantee that the food in question gets to the communities and regions where it is most needed."
"However, while short-term food aid is vital to respond to emergencies and rapidly deteriorating situations, EU food aid policy must work towards long-term security in food supply for the countries in question."
"The formulation of a long-term objective of food security must be strategically based, with specific targeting of aid."
"This would involve a more regional approach to food aid, helping specific regions to build up their food-producing infrastructure."
"Support must be given to the small farmers and food producers in the regions in question."
"Part and parcel of such an approach will be the further development of sectoral policies including those for agriculture, the environment, health, family planning and education."
"Macro-economic policy such as structural adjustment programmes should be brought into line with the requirements of guaranteeing long-term food security for all."
"Securing guarantees of food supply will help to combat the corrosive poverty which exists in these countries and serve as a basis for long-term development and restructuring."
"In essence we need an integrated approach, not a piecemeal one; an approach that binds together and builds up existing programmes and policy initiatives in order to create a more effective whole."
"If we are to seriously pursue our long-term aim of food security then clearly we need resources to match our aspirations."
"Let me say that the criticism that appears to be directed at Mr Telkämper is totally unjustified."
"I support him entirely in his approach and I thank him for it."
"Mr President, in opening I wish briefly to refer to my speech earlier and to highlight the fact that this regulation on food aid requires the setting-up of a new comitology, committee 2."
"Although, thanks to the rapporteur, this is restricted to level 2(b), it is still one which will bring extra delay and bureaucracy to the very simple process of providing food to people who are hungry."
"We cannot let this decision pass by without raising the same objection that we expressed earlier."
"But let me be positive in supporting this report too, and in particular in supporting Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 21 which have been accepted in full or in part in the common position."
"These amendments provide welcome recognition that women play a vital role in producing food as well as providing it for their dependants."
"Often in crisis situations it is women who become the sole providers and they therefore deserve particular recognition and support for this role within our development programmes."
"Even before the crisis begins, women and other groups experience the different food entitlements which are common in many societies."
"Social position affects how quickly women suffer from malnutrition and from starvation."
"This is also true, of course, for other groups like the elderly, the disabled and children."
"Reproductive health and family planning are also an integral part of our approach in this field."
"They are crucial if food security is to become a reality."
"Growing population in turn places an increasing burden on food supplies which, if crops fail, leads to crisis and starvation."
"Malnutrition in pregnancy causes high mortality rates and, by increasing the chances of vitamin deficiency, leads to disabilities."
"All of these factors must be taken into account if we are to realize a true policy for food aid and sustainability through the passing of this regulation."
"Rehabilitation programmes for developing countries"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0136/96) on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position established by the Council with a view to adopting a Council regulation on rehabilitation and reconstruction operations in developing countries (C40099/96-95/0165(SYN)) (rapporteurs: Mr Andrews and Mrs Baldi)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the need to promote the further development of the developing countries in the world and to encourage the process of achieving democratic maturity requires that we rethink methods of funding and funding management procedures."
"In 1993, the European Parliament drew attention to the need for aid for the structural recovery of the countries in question and, in order to deal with those needs, considered it appropriate to set in place two budget lines, intended to finance the programmes for the resettlement of southern Africa - B7-5071 - and measures for recovery and construction in the developing countries - B7-5076 - which the Council decided, on 29 January 1996, to adopt together in the common position we are discussing, in which the Council will - I hope - pay special attention to southern Africa."
"That is how the main objectives of, the conditions and the criteria applicable to that aid have been defined, to be set under way and put into effect by means of detailed and active coordination between the Commission and the Council."
"There is a very close relationship between human relations, democracy and development: human rights are more likely to be successfully established where there is a stable democracy, underpinned by policies of sustainable development, whereas economic difficulties are frequently used as a pretext to interfere with democratic life."
"We need therefore to use the available resources to encourage and sustain the development of economic activities which make possible a lasting recovery of those countries' systems of production, beginning by renovating basic infrastructures - physically and functionally - including mine clearance operations, the social reintegration of refugees, displaced persons, the disabled and ex-combatants, in an effort to counter the devastating effects of civil war."
"It is our duty to enter into specific commitments towards those who are suffering, and we cannot remain untouched by starvation and genocide, whether these are present far away from us or on Europe's threshold; both Europe and the international community must devote greater efforts to policies to eradicate economic poverty and social marginalization, the prime obstacles to the establishment of a constitutional state. We need to reinforce, including through close coordination, the programmes of the European Union on training, education and rehabilitation so that those countries are able, depending on the circumstances, to return to or move towards sustainable development."
"If we want those states to become stable partners in the Europe of tomorrow, then we have to replace humanitarian aid with measures for structural recovery and reconstruction, in order to re-establish in those countries an economy that works and is environmentally benign, able to pave the way towards sustainable development."
"Within a medium or long-term development scheme, those measures revolve around three main axes: firstly, extending the scope of rehabilitation measures, particularly as regards mine clearance and assisting refugees and displaced persons to return; secondly, attaching priority to strengthening the potential available locally that can reactivate the economy, particularly via training measures; and, thirdly, expanding the coordination and evaluation of rehabilitation projects and redefining the procedures for keeping the European Parliament informed."
"Together, the European Union and the Member States constitute the prime source of official development aid, more than the United States and Japan put together."
"It is, however, important to remember that development does not consist in economic development only: the UN Conference on the environment and development that took place in Rio in 1992 referred to sustainable development - that is to say development that respects human beings and is in harmony with the environment, with the earth's system - designed to reconcile population growth, development of the poor countries and respect for the environment."
"At a time when the European Union is adopting its programme of aid to the developing countries, it must take account of the need to reconcile economic growth and sustainable development, if the result is to be genuinely to improve the living conditions of the most disadvantaged population groups."
"Mr President, rehabilitation is now, or should be, in my opinion, a major link in the development process."
"War, civil unrest or natural disasters are affecting an increasing number of developing countries."
"The European Parliament, as well as the ACP-EU Joint Assembly strongly supported the idea of a special economic rehabilitation and social reconstruction programme."
"Such a programme was considered necessary mainly because the Community lacked a specific instrument which would deal with situations between purely humanitarian actions and medium to long-term aid."
"In view of the large, varying and complex situations in the different developing countries and the close connection which exists between humanitarian, rehabilitation and ordinary development actions, we need concepts on which to base the decision."
"That is the objective of the present proposal."
"These concepts must allow flexibility - and that seems to be an 'in' word here tonight, flexibility in development - and quick action without sacrificing the necessary coherence between the actions undertaken."
"Rehabilitation should enable the disaster-stricken population and conflictafflicted areas to contribute to reconstruction of the economy and the improvement of their living conditions."
"This should be achieved by adequate technical assistance, supplies of tools, equipment to assist in the restoration of water, electricity, basic health centres, roads and all the other infrastructures in such a way that the period for granting humanitarian aid and the long-term dependence on external aid may be reduced."
"Basically, we need to create a framework of conditions to improve the production and services sector - the vital infrastructure - and the social, institutional and administrative conditions as quickly as possible."
"The earlier we act, the sooner the population will be in a position to help themselves and, what is equally important, the conditions for medium and long-term development efforts enhanced."
"As long as humanitarian aid workers' lives and the results of the planned action are not at stake, rehabilitation measures should begin as early as possible."
"This is important not only for the people directly concerned but also to prevent possible further spreading of conflicts that might otherwise continue merely because of the miserable living conditions."
"Lastly, I wish to suggest to the Commissioner that the 'can do' approach of ECHO should be adopted in this particular process."
"I commend this report to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner has given us a most able account of her difficulties with the Council and I fully understand her."
"We have the same problems, often even greater ones, and we just have to make the best of it."
"But I note the great dedication of the few contributors - although the best - to this debate, which concerns most of the world and the poorest parts of it."
"We are all convinced that it is the European Union which directs the greatest residual attention to emergency humanitarian aid, to rehabilitation and to sure supplies of food."
"These figures are extraordinary."
"Just now, we talked about the quantity of aid."
"Well, let me tell you that we, the European Union, give ECU 500 000 per day to the Great Lakes region in Africa."
"We obviously find money for the Great Lakes region: Goma, Burundi, Rwanda, but after the event; we also find money for rehabilitation."
"But for prevention there is never any money, never any attention, never any policy decisions."
"At this very moment, Burundi is going downhill but we are doing nothing, and one day, when the pictures and the tragedies reach us, we shall give yet another ECU 500 000."
"In the Committee on Development, we have talked a great deal about these three subjects, which are to the credit of our Parliament, and which, I repeat, make me worry about what will happen."
"When we were the European Community, one of the great policies was that of development."
"Today, less attention and less money is devoted to this."
"I am extremely concerned when I see that the European Development Fund is not included in the budget, and that less attention is given to such work."
"Apart from that, of course I congratulate Mrs Baldi, Mr Andrews and the other rapporteurs for this day which has been devoted to the poorest parts of the world, but I am worried about tomorrow, because this enormous part of humanity concerns us less and less."
"We must not however forget, in spite of our difficulties, that we are still the wealthiest part of the world."
"Mr President, it is a sad fact that whatever continent one looks at there seems to be civil war and genocide with its appalling consequences."
"Half the world seems intent on destroying itself while the other half bears the costs of trying to bring about reconciliation and reconstruction."
"The reality is that we spend billions of ecu each year just keeping people alive."
"Help has to be given to rebuild not just their physical requirements but also their institutional organizations to give them the ability to run their countries."
"That is why I welcome this Council regulation on rehabilitation and reconstruction and I congratulate Mrs Baldi and Mr Andrews on the work they have done in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"The scale of the task is enormous and must be tackled step by step, namely food security, shelter, structural institutions and employment."
"I must pay tribute to the NGOs on the ground without whose dedication very little would be accomplished."
"The NGOs' workers often live in appalling conditions in fear of their lives, and yet by their work in the medical and social fields they are responsible for saving millions of lives."
"Any programme of reconstruction needs close cooperation between donor and recipient states."
"While it is natural that tenders and the awarding of contracts should be open to Member States and recipient countries, regional cooperation between developing nations is also vital."
"If neighbouring countries can provide services or supplies this should be encouraged as it would bring further stability to the regions."
"All this work will need careful planning and adoption followed by constant monitoring and naturally the Committee on Development and Cooperation feels its members should be closely involved."
"It is also important that, where possible, local partners should invest a financial contribution so that there is sustainability for the project after Community funding has ceased."
"If a project cannot be sustained without continual funding it should only be supported if it has humanitarian benefits such as food security."
"This whole programme must be treated as a matter of utmost importance and urgency for the restoration of basic social facilities for millions of people in dozens of countries."
"We trust and hope that action will be taken soon."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Bernard Kouchner is of course right to say that cooperation with developing countries has long since passed its peak."
"That is the general trend: less money, less concern."
"The upshot of that is that these countries seek to gain the best foothold they can in world markets. That is the new solution."
"And of course we are seeing the results of that."
"Last year Africa attracted 1.5 % of world investment."
"When we talk here today about rehabilitation and reconstruction projects we are indeed talking of little more than ancillary measures, but they too are important, however bitter that may sound."
"No one doubts how important they are."
"We ought to stress, and Mrs Baldi's report makes the point, that prompt action on reconstruction is of the utmost importance."
"We believe these reconstruction measures should act as a real bridge between a past emergency situation and future sustainable development, which is the right way to go."
"In the language of sustainable development we find that there is increasing consensus over the practical ways to achieve it and this raises a number of questions."
"But we are pleased that the Council, all in all, has adopted a good common position which also took account of the many amendments made by Parliament, though not all of them."
"We regret the omission of a number of elements which Parliament had thought important, for example the need to increase national and local capacities by means of training."
"The Council position also fails to take sufficient account of how to target specific groups, but nevertheless we think that the position is deserving of our support, and Mrs Baldi's report certainly is too."
"Mr President, I wish first of all to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"The programme of action proposed by the Council for rationalizing rehabilitation and reconstruction operations to the benefit of developing countries is important, because it should make possible a speedier and hence more effective response to the needs of developing countries that are victims of natural disasters and war, giving priority to the poorest of them."
"I should nevertheless like to stress two points which could, I believe, hinder the progress of this programme."
"The first relates to the cumbersome nature of the structures set up to assist the Commission."
"The consultative committees which are to advise the Commission are unquestionably useful, but in the form envisaged in the initial text and made more complicated by the rapporteurs' amendments, they seem to me likely to make the whole programme very cumbersome to operate."
"In my view, this problem also goes well beyond the single case of the text submitted to us."
"The second point concerns the implementation of these programmes."
"The European Union should take the greatest care to monitor everyone involved in implementation."
"NGOs, enterprises and associations should, above all, be chosen from within the developing countries concerned and within countries of the European Union."
"Too often, unfortunately, we find that community funds are being used by organizations which are in reality only facades for large American firms."
"Commissioner, on this regulation, in introducing new comitology we remain furthest apart."
"Council in this instance requires a 3a committee for all actions above ECU 2m, whereas you join with us in seeking a 1a advisory committee for all actions."
"I have to put to you: do you have the courage to act on your convictions and on this Parliament's beliefs?"
"Putting all these regulations together I have to ask whether considering our firm resolution, which I am confident we will pass with big majorities tomorrow, you should consider threatening to withdraw each and every one of these three regulations unless the Council is willing to agree to a better compromise."
"I would ask you to respond specifically to that point in reply to our debate."
"However, let me use my remaining time to highlight another crucial, but often disregarded area, namely, Amendment No 5 to Article 2, which seeks to integrate disabled persons into the rehabilitation process."
"I am concerned that the common position says it has accepted Amendment No 5, but that once again disabled people have dropped out of the text."
"In the development situation, as elsewhere throughout this world, the main problem for disabled people is in the attitudes and lack of awareness of other able-bodied people rather than any aspect of their physical and psychological impairment."
"Disability is currently an invisible issue in too many of our development programmes and making disabled people visible will require positive action, risk and experiment."
"In developing countries people experience disabilities caused, for example, by landmines; for every child killed by a landmine three more are permanently injured."
"Other disabilities arise out of malnutrition, for example blindness, and vitamin deficiency."
"These disabled adults and children share the same need for employment and housing and in other areas of their lives which we seek to ensure through the rehabilitation process."
"Some disabled people's lives can be transformed through specialist rehabilitation; through exercise, mobility aids, prosthetics, and so on. Disabled people can then be enabled to become contributors to their communities rather than being forced into dependence."
"But our main aim with our amendment is to seek to assist disabled people through mainstream programmes, for example through education, where children should be educated within the mainstream education process and where very basic training for teachers can be more effective not just for those children, but for all children who have suffered emotional problems."
"We ask you to look again at the wording of Amendment No 5 and we ask you to reply on the issue of comitology."
"Mr President, in the course of this decade we have seen a shift in the emphasis as far as global development priorities are concerned."
"Increasingly, we have funded military action as tension and conflict get out of control."
"In the absence of timely political action, humanitarian aid then steps in to pick up the pieces."
"But long-term investment in properly targeted development assistance seems not to enjoy that same priority."
"We do not seem to be putting in first place the importance of targeting proper poverty-alleviation programmes."
"I know that the Commissioner would agree that humanitarian aid should not at any time be seen as a substitute for political action."
"Of course I support the principle behind the initiative we are discussing this evening."
"Financing operations to progressively take over from humanitarian action and paving the way for long-term development planning is very welcome."
"The regulation shows, in fact, that the Commission recognizes that there is a necessity for better coordination between available instruments and that the elaboration of a more holistic approach to development is also very welcome."
"However, as Mr Howitt has said, we have to criticize the arrangements Council is proposing for the implementation."
"For grants of more than ECU 2m a type 3a committee is to be used. The Council should not be mistaken."
"Standardization is by no means synonymous with simplification."
"This is certainly the case here where the most restrictive comitology possible is set in place and it will certainly prevent the Commission from acting swiftly and effectively."
"Many of us will remember all too well the failure of the special initiative for African recovery."
"It is quite clear that comitology played its part in what turned out to be a totally ineffective operation."
"I therefore, as Mr Howitt has done, urge the Commissioner to respond to the request for clarification of what the Commission view will be on what I am sure will be a very strong European Parliament response to the comitology procedures suggested here."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner, but there is one point that I should like us to look at again together."
"With specific reference to the political interest in and special attention to be paid to the developing countries, I would point out that, as far as southern Africa is concerned, this House worked together with the Commission, just last year, on budget line B7-5071, because we wanted to move forward a programme in a particular way."
"Only in January of this year did the Council decide to join the two proposals for a regulation, and that was why we felt it was politically important to retain at least one reference to that region which currently stands in great need of this, among other things."
"In referring to mine clearance and specific operations in certain areas of the world, it was our intention to provide a definition of our aid and political interest, as, moreover, unanimously expressed by the House last year - something the Commission too was interested to hear."
"That is why we wish to retain a particular interest in that region - because it is genuinely of great importance to us."
"The Commission agrees with you, Mrs Baldi, about the very special importance of that region."
"Our only reason here is to ensure the instrument we are discussing is consistent - the instrument itself and its content. There is no political distinction between your concern and interest and ours - it is simply a matter of a lack of consistency in the instrument under discussion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon ."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.15 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 24 May 1996."
"Mr President, I should like to refer to the Rules of Procedure, more particularly Rule 5."
"After our part-session in Strasbourg the Belga press agency published a telex message under the heading 'Members of the European Parliament do not want to economize on their own allowances' , in which it was stated amongst other things that at the moment Members of the European Parliament receive a lump sum allowance for their travelling expenses."
"A Greek or a Finnish Member, for example, automatically receives a huge travel bonus, business class, the minute he or she attends meetings in Brussels or Strasbourg."
"No check is made as to whether Members actually travel to and from their country or whether they pocket money by travelling cheaply."
"Our fellow-Members Mrs Aelvoet and Mr Lannoye have also made statements to the same effect, which have received extensive coverage in the Belgian press."
"Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure provides that the Bureau is to lay down rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members."
"Rule 4 of the Bureau's rules provides amongst other things, first that Members are entitled to the lump sum travel allowance mentioned in Article 1(1) for only one return journey each week."
"Secondly, if a Member makes more than one return journey in a working week he receives for the extra journeys an allowance for the travelling expenses actually incurred."
"They are reimbursed on the basis of an air ticket or a first-class rail ticket upon presentation of the relevant ticket to the Members' allowances branch."
"Car journeys are reimbursed on the basis of the first class rail fare."
"I ask you, Mr President, whether or not the provisions of Rule 4 of these rules on Members' expenses and allowances are being applied."
"I am of course informed of remarks and public statements by our colleagues on the practice of Members with regard to the payment of expenses and allowances."
"I can tell you here and now that Rules 4 and 5 of the Rules of Procedure will be applied, and applied to the letter."
"Moreover, the Bureau recently decided that travel expenses would only be paid to Members who actually attended sittings and only if they personally signed a declaration stating that the journey had actually been undertaken."
"The Bureau is prepared to examine proposals for further tightening of the controls."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, where there is hard and fast evidence of failure to observe the Rules of Procedure, you should let me have such evidence so that I can investigate the allegations in the proper manner."
"I believe that sweeping allegations, which bring not only individual Members but our whole Parliament into public disrepute, are most unhelpful."
"On a personal matter Mr President."
"My name has been mentioned here and I wish to make a reply."
"I will read you Article 6 of the Treaty."
"It says: ' Within the scope of application of this Treaty, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited' ."
"Mr President, am I regarded as doing different work from my neighbour, Mr Giansily?"
"Am I regarded as doing different work from my 625 other fellow-Members here?"
"The Bureau must for once have the courage to put forward one common set of rules for all Members of this Parliament and then, Mr President, all speeches such as the one Mr Martens has just made will be superfluous."
"But you are not bold enough for that."
"Proposals have already been made three times both by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and by others in this House and the Bureau has never assumed its responsibility."
"You will have to apply Article 6 of the Treaty."
"Mr Wijsenbeek, allow me to advise you and all other Members that the Bureau took the decision I have outlined on the basis of the political responsibility it bears."
"Should you disagree with it, every group and every Member is free to make appropriate proposals to the Bureau, and I guarantee that we shall discuss them."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, my name has not been included in the attendance register in the Minutes, but I was present."
"You can check that by looking at the results of the roll."
"I ask that the register be amended accordingly."
"We shall correct that, Mr Malangré."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Mr President, I ask to speak under Rule 108 of our Rules of Procedure, which states very clearly that Members have the right to ask to make a personal statement."
"That is normally allowed once the item under discussion on the agenda has been dealt with."
"The item under discussion on the agenda was the speech by Mr Martens, who referred to a Belga report but also mentioned statements."
"I have the right under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure speak in order to refute any remarks made about my person."
"This is what I have to say."
"We as Greens have not once made a press announcement with regard to the amendment we had tabled proposing a change in the rules on Members' travel allowances."
"The statement I made and Paul Lannoye's too were correct as regards the system applying today."
"We have simply proposed another system."
"I do not think it is right for Mr Martens to associate our names with statements by the Belga press agency, which were partially incorrect."
"Welcome"
"Before we turn to the next item on our agenda, it gives me great pleasure to welcome to the gallery Mrs Bärbel Höhn, Minister for the Environment and Agriculture of Land North Rhine/Westphalia in the Federal Republic of Germany."
"We bid you and your delegation a warm welcome."
"Urgent political matters"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on urgent political matters of major importance."
"Before calling Mr Santer, I should like to remind you of the rules."
"The rules are that after the Commission statement questions may be asked."
"Each questioner is allowed one minute, and in view of the large number of questions to be asked I shall ensure that this one minute is not exceeded."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to talk to you about a subject of the utmost importance to our Union - the campaign against unemployment."
"More specifically, I am here to present the communication which the Commission adopted this morning and whose purpose is to give concrete form to the ideas I presented to you on 31 January this year in connection with a European Pact of Trust for employment."
"However, before I deal with that subject, I think that it is my duty, in view of the extreme topicality of the matter, to inform you of the decision on principle which the Commission took this morning regarding the matter of BSE, more commonly known as the 'mad cow' affair."
"As you know, the Council of Ministers of Agriculture was unable, last Monday, to rule on the Commission's proposal that the embargo on British exports of gelatin, tallow and semen should be lifted."
"The reason was that the Council was unable to achieve either the qualified majority needed to approve the decision or the simple majority needed to reject it."
"According to our comitological rules, it now becomes a matter for the Commission to take the decision, doing so on the basis of its own proposal - a proposal, incidentally, that was made several weeks ago, well before the start of the British policy of non-cooperation."
"This is what the Commission did this morning, adhering to the consistent line it has followed since the start of this crisis."
"The Commission's decision is fully and exclusively based on scientific data which guarantee the protection of health, and has nothing to do with the unfortunate political events from which we have suffered recently, and to which I shall return in due course."
"I emphasize the fact that the decision taken by the Commission this morning is a decision on principle, given that the period during which the Council may express an opinion on this matter does not end until next Sunday."
"It follows that the Commission cannot take a formal decision until immediately after that, in other words on 10 June."
"As for the implementation of the decision, I would remind you that a number of very strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to ensure the protection of health."
"Those conditions relate to the methods of production, monitoring and control, and the identification of undertakings authorized to export."
"As soon as the British authorities have made the necessary arrangements and the Commission has been able to verify that those arrangements are effective, the partial raising of the embargo will become a fact."
"The Commission, then, has complied with its responsibilities."
"It will continue to do so, with the aim of arriving as soon as possible at normalization of trade with the United Kingdom in the beef and veal sector."
"However, there is no doubt that British authorities still bear the primary responsibility for enabling the entire Union - because this is a Union problem, not just a United Kingdom problem - to move forward towards that normalization."
"That is the message I delivered yesterday when I met with the British Foreign Secretary and Minister of Agriculture, Mr Rifkind and Mr Hogg."
"The meeting was a constructive one, in that - for the first time - the British put forward certain ideas which enable us to contemplate the drafting of a framework programme which, gradually, would lead to the reestablishment of consumer confidence, the stabilization of markets and, consequently, the creation of the necessary conditions for trade to return to normal."
"We have agreed that the Commissioner, Mr Fischler, and his experts will remain in close contact with the British authorities about the specific form to be taken by these various ideas, and I sincerely hope that this procedure will lead us rapidly towards solving the problem."
"But, talking about normalization, we cannot ignore the extremely serious situation that currently exists at the Council because of the blatant and deliberate policy of obstruction being pursued by the United Kingdom."
"The Commission debated this matter in depth this morning."
"It expresses its grave concern regarding the obstacles thus created to the proper functioning of our institutions."
"Such attitudes have no place in a Union based on law and solidarity - which, by definition, is reciprocal."
"Such attitudes are contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Treaty. With your permission, ladies and gentlemen, I shall quote from Article 5 of the Treaty, which reads as follows:"
"' Member States shall take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of this Treaty or resulting from action taken by institutions of the Community."
"They shall facilitate the achievement of the Community's tasks."
"' They shall abstain from any measure which could jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of this Treaty.'"
"Such attitudes benefit no one."
"Ultimately, they lead to ridiculous situations in which the United Kingdom is blocking decisions which have always figured among its own priorities: the campaign against fraud, the simplification of Community legislation, the efforts to combat racism."
"It is therefore the duty of the Commission to make an urgent appeal to the British authorities to abandon this policy and enable the institutions to get on with their work."
"(Applause) Now that the Commission has accepted its responsibilities by partially lifting the ban, it looks to the United Kingdom for an immediate stand-down from its position of confrontation."
"In the absence of such a stand-down, future efforts to find a general framework of cooperation in order to take effective action against BSE and, consequently, to continue the lifting of the ban will be in danger of being seriously affected."
"But Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would not want to anticipate the in-depth debate on this matter that you will be holding tomorrow. The Commission, in the person of Commissioner Fischler, will be participating in that debate and will give you any additional information you may require."
"I now come to the main subject of my statement today, and which one which seems to me to be of crucial importance to the future of Europe: employment."
"This morning, the Commission held a discussion in depth of its ideas on employment."
"As a result, I am happy to be able to present to you now our communication entitled 'Action for employment in Europe - a Pact of Trust' ."
"What is our approach?"
"First, the Union really must make employment a matter of common interest."
"We must take action because, in the light of the overwhelming unemployment figures, the risk of doing nothing is the biggest risk of all."
"How can we create one Europe when the social fabric of another is collapsing?"
"The challenge of unemployment is not just economic but social and moral too."
"We cannot expect to achieve a leap forward in creativity and dynamism to maintain our living standard within an open world market if at the same time 15 to 20 % of our fellow citizens are on the sidelines."
"So we must take action."
"But what action?"
"The pact we are proposing to make comprises launching a joint initiative involving the public authorities and the social partners and defining their respective roles in a global, coordinated strategy in which each partner will have to live up to its responsibilities and enter into specific commitments at its own level."
"Let us take this fact as a starting point: the strategy set out in the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment in 1993 is a good strategy, but its implementation needs to be improved."
"It has to move into a higher gear."
"To achieve this, the Pact defines a threefold objective: mobilizing all the actors concerned in a genuine strategy for employment, taking greater advantage of the European multiplier effect, and integrating the campaign against unemployment into a medium- and long-term vision of society."
"The individual measures are praiseworthy, but ineffective or socially unacceptable."
"The citizens, for their part, expect their leaders to anticipate the changes outlining tomorrow's society."
"In this context, Europe holds some powerful trumps, but the potential of the integration process is not yet being used to its best advantage."
"This applies on the macroeconomic level, to the internal market, to the employment systems and to the European structural policies - the four areas that form the framework of application of the Pact of Trust proposed by the Commission."
"Let me say a word about each of these areas."
"First, the macroeconomic framework."
"Growth is essential in order to create jobs."
"But that does not mean growth at any price."
"It must be sustainable and based on monetary stability and a sound financial policy."
"In this sense, the single currency is the ally of future generations."
"Today, there is a broad consensus between the political authorities and the social partners on the right road to take."
"So we must hold to our course, but at the same time we need to develop a number of additional tracks to strengthen and refine the strategy."
"Efforts at budgetary consolidation must be stepped up, and stepped up in a manner favourable to employment."
"Those efforts, of course, are a matter for national jurisdiction."
"However, the Commission considers that this consolidation should be guided by three principles: reducing expenditure is preferable to increasing taxation; active employment measures must be given precedence over passive expenditure on unemployment insurance; the tax on labour increased by 20 % between 1980 and 1993, whereas the tax burden on the other production factors fell by 10 %."
"This trend needs to be adjusted, because it is detrimental to employment."
"As I said earlier, the single currency is the ally of future generations, and that alliance will, in particular, take the form of the convergence programmes and the visible effect of reconstruction they are already producing."
"But it is necessary for the Member States to update their programmes and to do more to emphasize consistency between the various national measures in favour of convergence and the promotion of employment."
"It is also necessary for that consistency to be evaluated at Union level, and for the Council to be able to issue more specific recommendations within the context of the broad guidelines of economic policy."
"The lines of action I have listed are also designed to strengthen our competitiveness."
"We have another trump card as far as competitiveness is concerned - our internal market."
"We must fully exploit its potential - all its potential."
"And let us be honest about this: the internal market is still incomplete or unevenly realized."
"The time has come to complete it."
"Too much business has been left unfinished for too long, and too many obstacles are still standing in the way of the action taken by enterprises."
"At the same time, the benefits of the internal market are being unevenly distributed: small- and medium-sized enterprises have more difficulty in exploiting the full potential of the internal market than do the major economic operators."
"The Commission thus proposes that action be taken along four lines: completing and making better use of the internal market; improving the global European competitive environment; providing more effective assistance to small- and medium-sized enterprises; and improving access for European businesses to the world market."
"For the sake of clarity, a number of things need to be done before the end of 1996."
"Three measures of particularly high priority have been blocked for years: the status of the European company, the absence of which, according to the Ciampi report - is costing the European economy ECU 30 thousand million per year; the legal framework for biotechnological inventions, the absence of which is a deterrent to investment in this leading-edge sector; and, finally, the internal electricity market, the absence of which is subjecting us to serious competitive disadvantages."
"These measures need to be adopted before the end of 1996."
"But adopting directives will not be enough."
"Those directives also need to be transposed into national law, and applied as such."
"Now, the situation is particularly worrying in certain key sectors."
"And my hope is that all the Member States concerned will commit themselves to bringing before their Parliaments, before the end of 1996, the texts transposing those directives in the areas of public contracts, investment policies, insurance, intellectual property and company law."
"The administrative and regulatory constraints which exist in Europe are giving rise to costs in excess of ECU 100 thousand million per year, to the particular detriment of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"We have launched an initiative designed to simplify the legislation."
"We are going to extent it."
"How many times has it been emphasized at the highest level that the completion of our infrastructure is essential in order to strengthen our competitiveness?"
"How many times have the Heads of State and Government sung the praises of the transEuropean networks?"
"What I want is to see these fine words converted into action and, once and for all, a decision taken on the proposals for supplementary financing made by the Commission."
"As I have said, we need to do more to help our enterprises, and especially the small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"The adoption of the new action programme for small- and medium-sized enterprises before the end of this year would show that our governments are seriously pursuing that objective."
"Furthermore, the level of state aid is amounting to several tens of thousands of millions of ecus per year within the Union."
"We need to reconsider how this aid can best contribute to the creation of lasting jobs, while still safeguarding fair competition."
"To strengthen our competitiveness is vital."
"And we also need to ensure that our competitive enterprises have fair access to the export markets."
"Trade has to be made a tool for the benefit of employment."
"And that calls for the strengthening of the multilateral system, access to the market, the defence of intellectual property and the reform of the common trade policy."
"Those, ladies and gentlemen, are our areas of action for the months immediately ahead."
"I have given you, then, a broad outline of the action to be taken for the benefit of employment in the macroeconomic framework and the context of the internal market."
"I now come to the third aspect of the Commission's communication, which is certainly the most delicate and difficult: the reform of the employment systems in each Member State."
"Obviously, and I emphasize it again, the essential burden of this task rests upon governments, national administrations and the social partners."
"But the Union does have its part to play, as was demonstrated by the European Council in Essen when it outlined the common framework for structural reform of the employment market in the form of five action priorities."
"A procedure for monitoring the implementation of those five priorities has been adopted through the national multiannual programmes."
"This procedure builds a bridge between overall macroeconomic coordination and the future prospects for employment and unemployment."
"And, in the context of our action for employment, our Pact of Trust, we propose that this procedure should be strengthened by recommendations from the Council and the Commission designed to promote, for example, the use of the Structural Funds."
"This monitoring procedure will have to be definitively established within the Union's institutions on the occasion of the intergovernmental conference."
"The analysis of the Member States' multiannual programmes prompts us to define two objectives in our communication: national employment policies need to be better activated, and the major projects for the future of employment need to be opened up."
"In order to active the national employment policies, we recommend that the administrative systems for employment should be reformed, for example by simplifying aid to recruitment or to the creation of microenterprises."
"We recommend that the local actors should be mobilized, for example by the decentralization of employment systems and the promotion of local development and employment initiatives."
"We recommend joint initiatives by the social partners on the integration of young people, and that programmes like Leonardo and Youth Start should be seen as an inspiration for the development of new initiatives."
"Finally, we recommend the development of common guidelines on the future of social protection by way of the harmonization of direct taxation and of the replacement revenues."
"As regards the major projects for the future, the Pact explores new approaches to the organization of labour and of education/training as levers to create access to employment."
"Let me give you a few key phrases in this context."
"A conventional European framework for the organization and flexibility of labour: the social partners must commit themselves to this."
"The consequences for labour of the information society: this needs to be dealt with."
"Education and training: a number of schemes need to be undertaken in connection with access and validation of skills."
"We are particularly strong supporters of the creation of a European apprenticeship and an Erasmus apprenticeship programme."
"Now I come to the fourth and last section of our communication."
"The European structural policies, need, as a priority, to be placed at the service of employment."
"Three-quarters - and I repeat, three-quarters - of the sums initially earmarked for these policies for the period 1994-1999, amounting to ECU 170 thousand million, have yet to be committed by the Member States and the regions."
"So there is still substantial room for manoeuvre."
"That room must be used."
"It is a matter for the Member States, the regions, the local authorities and the economic and social partners to accept their responsibilities and use this room for manoeuvre in order to increase the impact of the structural policies on employment."
"The Commission, for its part, would like the Member States to commit themselves to devoting to employment the ECU 5, 500 million for the period 1996-1999 deriving from the application of the deflator to all the programmes and objectives of the structural policy."
"Furthermore, the Commission proposes that the ECU 8, 000 million available for the Objective 2 planning over the period 1997-1999 be allocated to retraining schemes designed to maintain employment and to create new jobs in the regions in question."
"The Commission will be drawing up the new Objective 2 programmes on this basis."
"A deadline is coming up as early as next month, with the mid-term revision of the structural action programmes relating to Objectives 1, 3, 4 and 5b."
"In the course of that revision, we would like the Member States to commit themselves in the light of the evaluation of the impact of the programmes on employment."
"Early in 1997, the Commission will decide upon the revision of the programme, taking account of that impact."
"In applying the Structural Funds we must choose priorities that benefit employment."
"Thus, we want to give precedence to innovative action in favour of small- and medium-sized enterprises and a closer partnership between the Structural Funds and the European Investment Bank."
"It is also necessary to emphasize the anticipation of industrial change and changes in employment by making it a priority to support the most seriously affected sections of society, and innovative schemes."
"Finally, in this context, we need to encourage local development and employment initiatives."
"The Commission will take particular responsibility for these priorities and for cooperation with the European Investment Bank in the new or revised programmes."
"The full efficiency of the reforms of the employment system, like the efficiency of innovative steps by businesses, depends on the mobilization of the public and private actors on the appropriate territorial scale."
"We do not want to create new structures."
"But we do need to launch and develop a political dynamic at local level, based on realistic economic and job-creation objectives."
"The European Council in Florence should give the political starting signal for a selection process to find pilot regions and cities willing to commit themselves to a local pact on employment."
"The objective would be, by the time of the European Council in Dublin, to identify a significant number of cities or regions in each Member State capable of illustrating the exemplary nature of local mobilization."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that is a summary of our ambitions as set out in our Action for employment in Europe - our Pact of Trust."
"I am convinced that these ambitions are a match for the challenges they will have to confront."
"I am equally convinced that there is no get-out clause, and that it will be disastrous to adopt an ostrich-like policy in the face of unemployment, the crucial problem facing our society."
"I appeal, therefore, to all our governments, to the social partners at all levels and to all our institutions to accept their responsibilities and play their respective roles, each at its own level."
"In due course, in Florence, I shall be calling upon the Heads of State and Government to approve our approach at the highest level, and to enter into the initial commitments and provide the necessary stimuli to ensure that, at the European Council in Dublin, they can record positive steps towards the implementation of the Pact."
"The reason why I have chosen to make you, Mr President and honourable Members of the European Parliament, the first to hear this presentation of our proposals is to acknowledge the primary role that you are called upon to play, because the ambition of this Pact is to serve the citizens whose elective representatives you are."
"(Applause)"
"President Santer, first of all may I express our sincere thanks for the information you have given us on this morning's decision by the Commission to lift the export ban on gelatine, tallow and bulls' semen from the United Kingdom."
"I should like to remind the House that we have this subject on tomorrow's agenda and that the agreement reached by the groups is that we should discuss the topic of employment policy and the decision taken by the Commission on that subject this morning."
"You now know the rules, of course."
"Questions will be taken on the basis of requests to speak that are made in the course of Question Time and not on the basis of a list of speakers."
"I now open Question Time with the President of the Commission."
"President Santer, I very much welcome your statement today and your continuing efforts to promote the idea of added value at Community level in the field of employment."
"I hope you fare well in Rome at the forthcoming tripartite conference."
"I want to make three brief points on what you have said: firstly, some of us in this House are a little concerned about the Commission's recommendation on the broad economic guidelines."
"We feel there is a little complacency and a lack of balance."
"For example, the urging of continued wage restraint, on the one hand, is only sensible, so long as on the other hand the record profits are put into productive use, and if we know what the Commission has in mind to put these record profits into productive use."
"On your pact, in relation to the social dialogue process, what measures are in hand to make sure that the social partners themselves enter into meaningful, practical, concrete pacts to give your pact meaning on, for example, the issue of youth unemployment?"
"Finally, you mentioned the Essen follow-up process."
"One of the important elements coming out of Madrid was the idea of common uniform employment indicators."
"Could you tell us please what progress you are making vis-à-vis Member States."
"That is a very important democratizing element to the Essen follow-up process."
"Mr President, first of all, we are of course presenting this action at Commission level, at Community level, in order - as you said just now, Mr Hughes - to promote the value added to the efforts made by the Member States."
"On the other hand, of course, it is necessary for the actions we are proposing today to be translated into specific agreements, especially as regards the employability of the young."
"It is necessary, then, for very specific commitments to be entered into by all those concerned, not only at government level but also at the level of the social partners."
"Furthermore, we are conducting a dialogue with the social partners on a number of these matters."
"Now, as regards the elements arising from Essen, this is one of the integral parts of the action we are taking to promote employment, and on the basis of the multiannual programmes of the Member States - the first which, as you rightly said, was presented in Madrid - we are going to add further detail to the employment indicators."
"Progress has been achieved in this respect, but to make that kind of progress on all the points arising out of Essen is not enough."
"It is statistical progress, but it needs to be given more substance if we are to make real progress along the road to the reduction of unemployment."
"Mr President, I should like to ask Commission President Santer what message your communication sends to young unemployed people."
"Responsibility appears to lie with politicians and parties only and I wonder at the fact that the Commission does not to a greater extent gear itself to the driving forces which concern individuals; the politicians should now be removing obstacles to enterprise, employment and investment in Europe."
"I am quite well aware that employment can be created artificially but new jobs cannot be talked into existence."
"I should therefore like to see more measures to ensure the necessary structural changes, more deregulation, liberalisation and the abolition of old national monopolies in Europe."
"Mr President, in our communication we provided for a number of schemes relating to the employability of young people, placing more emphasis on a common initiative by the social partners for the integration of the young."
"We are also going to submit to the social partners the entire complex of problems associated with the integration of the young."
"And we are asking for the development of mechanisms based - as I have said just now - on the Youth Start and Leonardo programmes."
"This is an initiative to be developed jointly with the Commission and Member States."
"Otherwise, I naturally agree with you when you say that the internal market has yet to find, through a certain policy of liberalization, the resources to provide new, stable jobs - sustainable jobs from which the young people of tomorrow will be able to benefit."
"President Santer, I hope your perseverance will obtain concrete results at the Florence summit."
"And with regard to the training and education policy I have not heard anything about a proposal - which was in the white paper - about lifelong learning."
"Do you not think that the Commission should tackle that subject of employment and the training for our human capital, which is so important for the future?"
"Mr President, Mr Barón Crespo is right to stress this point."
"It does indeed appear in our communication, and in the White Paper which was presented by Mrs Cresson."
"We must indeed place a very special emphasis on education and continuing vocational training, or the lifelong learning process."
"In this context, you will find that our communication has something to say about education and training as levers to open access to employment."
"I entirely agree with you that these elements are becoming a key factor in the framework of these activities designed to reduce unemployment, especially among the young."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate President Santer on his continuing efforts to get national governments as well as the European institutions to give this serious problem the priority it deserves."
"In doing that I hope we will not give the national governments an opportunity to create the impression that the responsibility for high rates of unemployment lies with Europe."
"Since national governments control taxation policies, social welfare policies, working hours and rates of pay, obviously it is there that the greater part of the responsibility lies."
"The President of the Commission pointed out that the parts of the structural funds not being spent are an embarrassment since we need greater investment to create more employment."
"Would the President agree with me that perhaps the additionality clause in the regulations needs to be looked at?"
"On the one hand we are saying to governments that they must reduce their deficits and taxation, on the other they must increase spending in order to match European money."
"Does he think that this policy needs to be reviewed and that an individual regulation to suit each Member State is required in the spending of structural funds?"
"Mr President, you will notice, in the communication which we have presented to you and which you have had the opportunity to examine, that significant space is given to the reallocation and restructuring of the structural funds, again with reference to the objective of employment."
"I believe that these funds still offer a great many opportunities, because three-quarters of them are used in regions where two-thirds of our unemployment is concentrated."
"To put it another way, the funds are one of the main ways of guaranteeing the reduction of unemployment and greater employability in those regions within the framework of joint programmes - together with the Member States, naturally."
"In that same context, you also refer to taxation."
"I can tell you that the Commission has drafted a communication on taxation, in connection with which we are currently discussing the relations between direct taxation, indirect taxation and the tax on employment."
"We have also begun thinking about a number of ways of reducing the tax burden on employment - the social costs, as they are called - because they have increased over recent years; we want to see how they might be replaced by other forms of deduction."
"This, then, is an overall programme, and when it is studied is important not to take individual points out of context."
"You are right to lay particular stress on the importance of the structural funds which, perhaps, are not being sufficiently used to reduce unemployment in the regions in question."
"First of all, President Santer, bravo."
"You see before you a Parliament of elected representatives who, each time they meet their constituents, have to justify the collective impotence of the Member States and of the Union when it comes to unemployment, which is becoming more and more of a scourge."
"We are glad to find you sensitive to this, to welcome the Pact for employment that you have adopted, and to believe that you are bolder and more receptive to sweeping solutions, shall we say, than the average government of one of the Member States of the Union."
"You can attend the forthcoming summit meetings confident in the strong support of this Parliament."
"However, I cannot refrain from expressing my major fear."
"All these measures are small-scale ones."
"Flexibilization, tax improvements, better training - all these things are necessary."
"The ideas are right."
"What troubles me is the tempo, which will take between 20 and 25 years to eliminate European unemployment."
"President Santer, why don't you include a serious question to the Member States, a suggestion that working hours should be massively reduced, which is the only weapon we have not yet used?"
"Mr President, Prime Minister Rocard is certainly right to stress a number of matters which, indeed, must be included in our overall strategy if it is to produce concrete results."
"First, I should say that our communication, and our strategy, are not intended to replace the responsibility of our Member States, because we are fully aware that it is with the Member States that the primary responsibility lies, and that they and the national governments have their own homework to do."
"On the other hand, it is appropriate to include a number of factors such as the length and arrangement of working hours, and we have examined this question in section 3 (15) of our communication."
"We consider that this is a special project which needs to be debated, negotiated and discussed between the social partners, and I alerted them to the fact at the Round Table on 28 and 29 April."
"The objective must be - building on what has already been achieved in the agreement on parental leave which the various social partners have succeeded in concluding for the first time - to go further in the quest for new ways of reconciling personal time and company time."
"This is an important debate which concerns all our Member States, and not one in which the Commission can impose a decision."
"It is necessary for our social partners themselves to embark on this route and to discover every possible way of exploiting this vast area, which also covers other arrangements such as part-time working, the calculation of working hours on a yearly basis, flexible retirement, the use of the time thus made available for the development of training, and sabbatical leave."
"In other words, this is a whole group of problems which covers what you have called working hours."
"We need to be innovative in this area, and I hope this is one of the major lines of thought which our social partners will be pursuing."
"Mr President, I would like to make a request which links both parts of President Santer's report: the part on BSE and the part on employment."
"I was particularly interested in one thing President Santer said, and I am sure everyone who works in the agriculture sector will be too. He said Great Britain has, for the first time, come up with proposals useful for restoring confidence."
"Well, the agriculture coordinators have reached agreement, considered and discussed at length, on a joint resolution which we will present tomorrow, and I think it would be helpful if we could possibly be told a bit more about these new proposals for restoring confidence in advance, to check whether certain concerns we have expressed in this document are still current and, especially, whether any of the solutions we are calling for have perhaps already been found."
"Mr President, as far as employment is concerned, it is of course possible to establish certain links between BSE and the culling of livestock."
"A number of social problems have also been created, especially in rural areas and in the agricultural sector."
"I am certainly not unaware of the scale of this problem as regards the matter with which we are currently concerned."
"On the other hand, I must tell you that the matters proposed to us yesterday by the British delegation will the subject of further discussions."
"What is at issue is a step-by-step approach to the ultimate lifting of the embargo."
"So a framework has been established."
"I believe this is the right approach, and indeed it is the approach which we have been constantly recommending since the crisis began, ever since 20 or 21 March."
"The first essential is to restore consumer confidence so as to bring market stability via specific activities designed to eradicate BSE - mad cow disease - completely."
"The British delegation has made a number of proposals to us. Commissioner Fischler will be presenting them to you tomorrow."
"He is the expert in these matters, not me."
"My only regret, and I say this frankly before your Parliament, is that we have wasted at least six to eight weeks before reaching any specific solutions."
"That is my regret, and that is why I share your apprehension."
"Mr President, two short questions."
"Yesterday the Council of Ministers, without the United Kingdom, adopted the directive on parental leave."
"The Commission is very alert to competition problems."
"Does it not feel that the absence of the child-minding directive in a single country might distort competition between the states?"
"My second question is this: our states are caught between two fires."
"One is compliance with the convergence criteria, and the other is the reduction of tax capabilities."
"You said that the Commission was going to think about matters of taxation, but how much time is that thinking going to take, and when are you really going to address the problem of European taxation of unearned income?"
"Mr President, in response to Mrs Dury's first question, I can say that, unfortunately, this decision was taken by 14 states, but that is connected with the social chapter and the United Kingdom's opt-out clause."
"As you are well aware, the Commission - in common with Parliament - requested that the social chapter should be integrated into the Treaty at the intergovernmental conference."
"I believe this is the right thing to do, and we shall support it fully; I hope that an agreement on this matter will be reached at the intergovernmental conference."
"For the moment, we can only live within the jurisdiction we have, in accordance with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, where in point of fact the social chapter applied only to 14 states, not 15."
"As regards your second question, we have developed, within the Commission, a complete and consistent programme on taxation, incorporating both indirect taxation, to ensure the introduction of the final system for VAT, and direct taxation, including taxation of earned income."
"This programme contains lines of thought which Commissioner Monti has identified and which were the subject of discussions at the informal Ecofin Council held in Verona six weeks ago."
"On that occasion, the Finance Ministers decided to set up a committee of personal representatives, chaired by the Commission, to enable what I hope will be decisive progress to be made in the field which must concern us all."
"This approach ensures that joint consideration will have been given to the balance between the taxes on earned and unearned income."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Santer on putting such a high priority on unemployment."
"But I am rather afraid that the confidence pact will seem to be an idol with feet of clay, because I still do not see any real pact."
"I think several parties are needed for a pact and as far as I know the social partners are not really ready at this time to conclude a pact and the position with the Member States is the same."
"I should like to ask Mr Santer how he thinks of bringing about a really serious pact."
"Besides, my view is that the Commission must set the example."
"The LEONARDO programme has been a failure on a number of occasions as an example where cooperation is possible between social partners and the business world."
"But I am amazed to find that in the preliminary draft budget that programme, which has been redrafted several times, is never increased but has its resources cut."
"I think we cannot be serious if we approach a pact in this way."
"Of course, Mr President, in order to embark upon a course of action on the scale I have described, it is necessary for the social partners - and this is the essence of our discussions - to be included on an equal basis."
"In this connection, following the discussions I had in the various capital cities after the tripartite conference of 28 and 29 April, I am quite hopeful that the social partners will in fact embark upon the road I outlined."
"This commitment to negotiations between the social partners could initially be reached on four matters, which seem to me essential, as of now. Negotiations must begin."
"We have the result of initial negotiations on parental leave."
"We have need to go further."
"One line of approach, it seems to me, relates to part-time working, which is atypical, and would in itself represent a significant support for the concept of the pact."
"Secondly, the social partners are going to try to produce a joint manifesto - that is what they have agreed to do - on the integration of young people in the employment market."
"Thirdly, they are going to produce a framework text on training, which is equally essential as a lever for providing access to employment."
"And fourthly, they are going to produce a joint opinion on the structural funds."
"All this in itself seems to me to represent a very decisive commitment by the social partners at that level."
"From a different angle, on the matter of the budgetary resources relating to some of our programmes to which I, personally, am very attached, I shall be asking the European Parliament, as a budgetary authority, to take every care to ensure that sufficient resources are provided."
"Mr President, as the third pillar in your proposals for improving labour-market policy you referred to the electricity sector, the creation of the single electricity market."
"I should like to ask how you assess the value of the single energy market in terms of new job opportunities."
"Is energy, as a cost factor of location in Europe, not perhaps being overpriced here?"
"Should not rather the alternative and regenerative forms of energy technology be developed and encouraged more vigorously, so that such innovations can lead to real new jobs in Europe and new export opportunities for companies based in Europe?"
"Have we not been grossly underestimating the importance of environmental protection as a means of securing and creating jobs?"
"Mr President, I can say that I am in agreement with what the honourable Member has said where it is not in conflict with what I have just said."
"What we want to do with the internal market is to take full advantage of all its potential."
"That market has been created by a number of directives, but it is not yet functioning as an internal market, since some sectors are still protected."
"We have decided to liberalize telecommunications."
"We have now made proposals to the effect that the electricity market should also be liberalized, but that is not the same as saying that we are opposed to alternative energy sources."
"Quite the reverse."
"What we are trying to achieve is a situation where this internal market really functions as an integrated internal market, on the model of the American market, which operates as an internal market with a single currency."
"We have not yet reached that point."
"That is why European business is still unable to exploit all the potential inherent in this internal market."
"But this certainly does not exclude, far from it, the compatibility of the policy of competition with new initiatives, especially alternative energy sources and, as you have said, the creation of new jobs, the key to the future, on the basis of a sound environmental policy."
"Not taking any risks is the greatest risk, President Santer, as you so rightly said."
"So it is not a matter of merely producing piecemeal measures but of ensuring that we create a common framework."
"As for the Member States, which fear different paths to unity more than the devil fears holy water and which only once, namely in Essen, where they identified five new key areas for action, have got round to pulling the various strands together, should we not make it clear to them that we do not want anything new?"
"We do not want any new structural-fund resources but rather more effective application of the existing structural funds."
"We do not want to create any new local employment initiatives in competition with SMEs; such action should be taken as a parallel effort accompanying in a fair and balanced manner our promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Is it not equally necessary to tell them that we must devote more of our resources to practical education and to the promotion of vocational training?"
"But in our view this also means that we must not reduce still further the already meagre Leonardo funds."
"We must therefore make it clear to these countries that it is not a matter of pursuing new whimsical policies but quite simply of distributing more prudently the funds that are available."
"Mr President, I am in agreement with the honourable Member, because - as I have been at pains to make clear - we are not intending to reinvent the wheel."
"We want to build on the substance of the 1993 White Paper on Competitiveness, Employment and Competition, but we are not trying to extend our jurisdiction."
"What we are aiming at is better allocation of the resources that will be available to us between now and 1999, and this applies equally to the structural funds and to the transeuropean networks."
"I am surprised, incidentally, that no Member has yet mentioned the question of the transeuropean networks, a question that has arisen at every European Council."
"We do not want more money."
"All we want is to have the necessary financial resources within the framework of the present budget to be able to finance the 14 priority transeuropean networks which we have decided to set up, so that the citizens of Europe can see that decisions taken at the highest level do produce results."
"That is our approach, and it is within that framework that we specifically want to implement, step by step and in the context of an overall strategy, all the elements of the 1993 White Paper."
"Mr President, I must ask Commission President Santer to elucidate two points relating to the communication concerning the employment pact."
"You said that the Commission is to launch a joint pact in which the parties will be compelled to participate in the confidence pact."
"In view of the fact that the discussions which have taken place to date have not been particularly successful, I wonder what kind of ace it is that the Commission has up its sleeve, what means it intends to use, to compel the parties to agree in this way."
"The other matter I should like to have explained concerns what you said about the importance of sound economic management, that EMU is our ally and that there is a broad consensus in favour of EMU."
"However, criticism is in fact growing among economists, among politicians and, above all, among the general public."
"So, what kind of consensus is it, Mr President?"
"Is there not rather a yawning chasm separating us from anything resembling consensus?"
"Mr President, as far as the first question is concerned, we certainly do not want to compel the social partners to reach an agreement - quite the reverse."
"It is a matter for them, through the device of a social dialogue on their own terms, to find avenues, channels of thought, to bring them to specific results on the basis of a number of proposals which we are making to them."
"There is no question whatever of constraint, at any stage."
"It is in this spirit that we have to mobilize all the economic actors - not just the governments of the Member States at national or local level, not just the Community institutions, but the social partners too, so that collective negotiation will lead by way of social dialogue to certain concrete results."
"There is no question at all of constraint, quite the reverse."
"This is a matter of considered approach."
"I can assure you, the social partners whom I have met in all the Member States, without exception, are ready to meet this challenge."
"They are ready to commit themselves because they are the parties most closely concerned, and they are aware of the challenge that has to be met in the interests of tomorrow's society."
"As far as the second question is concerned, it is of course true that economic and monetary union is one of the crucial elements for completing the internal market."
"I know of no other internal market in the world - as we are the largest - with 370 million inhabitants - that functions with 14 different currencies."
"We need to realize clearly what that means."
"So we have an interest in the coming of monetary union, as soon as possible and on the basis of the convergence criteria, to enable us to exploit the full potential of this internal market, so that our currency, the Euro, can play its part between the yen and the dollar, and so that our national currencies do not all reflect the fluctuations of the dollar and suffer from them whereas we have no control over it."
"That is the aim of monetary union."
"Monetary union as such is not an end in itself; it is the instrument of a policy of economic and social development."
"That is how we need to think of it."
"And that is the spirit of the commitment we must enter into."
"We must do away with the idea that monetary union is the enemy of employment."
"Quite the reverse."
"Monetary union, as we want to see it, as it has been planned by the negotiations of the Maastricht Treaty, will - thanks to sound public finances and the reduction of interest rates - stimulate the necessary investment to bring more growth and more jobs."
"I speak as Parliament's rapporteur on the 1996 annual economic report and on the broad economic guidelines."
"I should like to ask the President of the Commission to what extent Parliament's conclusions as set out in its resolution of 9 May were taken into account in drawing up the document referred to today, especially Parliament's references to the need to eliminate existing rigidities in the labour market, its reference to a reduction in non-wage labour costs and to the adaptation of working time and work organization."
"I notice that the President of the Commission referred to reduction in working time, not adaptation of working time."
"Mr President, I do of course believe that these matters form an entity within the discussion and must be taken into consideration."
"When you read our communication, you will find these matters examined in the context of greater flexibility for our employment market."
"We believe that it is necessary to ensure that flexibility is reconciled with security - some people have called this 'flexisecurity' ."
"I think this is a matter that needs to be taken into account."
"It goes without saying that I am also in favour of reducing the cost of labour, but we shall then have to see how these costs are replaced by other measures, other means."
"The third element you mentioned, which also appears in our document as I mentioned just now when answering Mr Rocard's question, is the adaptation of working time with a view to reducing working hours by collective negotiation between the social partners."
"But the adaptation of working hours by using new forms of so-called atypical work is already becoming the normal, typical way of working in some of our Member States."
"Mr President, President Santer has set out an argument which at the end of the day, as far as I am concerned, represents a voluntary declaration, with specific objectives to be achieved."
"But I have been asking myself a question, and now I am going to ask President Santer the same question. How are you going to restore hope to people when the reality experienced by millions of men and women consists of redundancies, closures, industrial restructuring, declining activity, all in the name of competitiveness?"
"And you yourself, today, are speaking in the name of competitiveness and proposing to combat unemployment in that name."
"So I wonder whether your speech is not addressed more to the market forces than to the citizens, who for their part are wondering whether the economy is in the service of man or man is a slave to the economy."
"First, Mr President, it is important to realize that competitiveness is not the enemy of employment."
"I state that categorically."
"And you need only read, or reread, the report by the Ciampi group, headed by the former Prime Minister and current Minister of Finance in the Italian Government who also chairs our advisory board on competitiveness, to see that competitiveness is not the enemy of employment."
"Quite the reverse."
"Unless you strengthen the competitiveness of a business, you will not increase the number of jobs in the medium and long term."
"Indeed, the objective today is to strengthen the competitiveness of European business so that it can create new jobs, jobs for the future."
"That is the essence of our policy, which is designed to alleviate the sickness from which Europe is now suffering."
"We are suffering from having lost market shares around the world, because our companies are not as competitive as those in other regions."
"That is why we have to boost competitiveness, but in conjunction with the transition to employment."
"It is not competitiveness that is killing off jobs, but there is a need to find the link between competitiveness and the creation of new jobs."
"That is what we are trying to achieve in Chapter 3 of our communication, which I invite you to study very thoroughly."
"Mr President, my question relates to the Swedish debate and the Swedish Government's proposal for an employment union."
"The original idea of the proposal was that Member States should be able to coordinate their financial policies, particularly in a recession, in such a way as to allow demand to be maintained through measures to stimulate the economy (investment, stimulating demand), thus preventing unemployment rising."
"Personally, I think it is an excellent idea."
"My question concerns how the Commission President sees it; does he think it is compatible with today's convergence policy and the convergence criteria for monetary union that demand and investment should today be maintained through the Member States' national budgets?"
"Mr President, I can tell the honourable Member that we are in full agreement with the proposals made on this matter by the Swedish Government in the context of the intergovernmental conference."
"I had the opportunity to discuss this subject with the Swedish Prime Minister."
"The Commission supports the Swedish proposals which are not in conflict with the objectives of convergence as laid down."
"Within that framework, we must strengthen and definitively establish, at the intergovernmental conference, the follow-up procedure regarding the five points agreed on at Essen."
"By doing so, we will achieve a better balance between the internal market on the one hand and the social aspect on the other, to live up to our citizens' expectations."
"The Swedish proposals are on the same lines as the proposals we ourselves made for the benefit of the intergovernmental conference."
"I welcome President Santer's discussion of the role of cities, towns and regions in the economic reconstruction of Europe."
"So much of our discussion about dealing with the unemployment problem takes place at the macro-economic level which seems very remote from the unemployed people we seek to help."
"Is your announcement of pilot towns and cities mere window-dressing or will it unleash the potential of those towns and cities throughout Europe to contribute to the process of economic development?"
"Will it be like the URBAN programme and the URBAN pilot projects, with just twenty or twenty-five towns able to participate or will there be the opportunity for towns and cities throughout our continent to take part?"
"Will there be the objections we have heard from Member States on the grounds of subsidiarity which means they want to hold on to the money and do not want to let our towns and cities take part?"
"Finally, will there be new money which will go to our towns and cities and which will help them unleash that potential to put people back to work?"
"Mr President, I do indeed believe that we should be moving more towards regional pacts and municipal pacts."
"In a number of cases the Member States have had highly encouraging experience of this, through a gradual process of decentralization of employment."
"In this context, we have suggested that regional pacts should be introduced to give a political starting signal for this type of pact at the appropriate regional level, based on a process of selecting, in each Member State, a significant number of pilot regions, towns or rural areas interested in these pacts."
"I hope that we will be able to obtain initial approval of these regional pacts when they are presented by the Commission at the European Council in Dublin."
"We shall be making appropriate proposals about this to you when the time comes."
"I believe that the local development initiatives must be of overriding importance."
"That is why we have also emphasized the decentralization of our training systems and the employment systems, which appears us to be essential in order to ensure the employability of certain categories of people, especially the young."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that ends Question Time."
"I thank everyone who took part, especially the President of the Commission, Mr Santer, who addressed us and answered our questions this afternoon."
"I shall now take a point of order from Mr Holm."
"Mr President, that is the second time you have called me by the wrong name."
"I have already corrected you in the Bureau too, and I find it rather irritating that this mistake makes you pass me over at Question Time, despite my having corrected the error."
"I believe it is reasonable to expect the Members who are in the Bureau to know each other's names!"
"My name is Voggenhuber."
"I accept your criticism."
"I am sorry, but in the papers I have here your name and the number of your seat do not correspond."
"Mistakes can easily happen in that situation."
"I do apologize."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say that I myself would have been delighted to hear you call me by name, even the wrong name, but you pronounced it perfectly just now."
"You have let some fifteen speakers take the floor."
"I must have raised my hand some fifteen times and been amongst the first at least a dozen times; I am concerned that you might be a little short-sighted in your right eye."
"The ladies and gentlemen who have been watching me here over the past few months will know that I am not short-sighted on the left or the right side but on both sides!"
"There are a great many Members who raise their hands 15 times and more during Question Time to no avail, because the number of prospective questioners - thankfully - exceeds the number of question slots."
"Agreement with Morocco - Human rights in Morocco and Western Sahara"
"Mr President, Morocco is a very important State to us."
"We need only look at the map to realize how important it is, with one coastline on the Atlantic and another on the Mediterranean."
"At a time when we are treating the Mediterranean region as a priority area, it is absolutely necessary that we take further steps to develop our relations with Morocco, because even geographical considerations alone make Morocco an important country from our point of view."
"There are also political factors."
"In the Maghreb there are two Islamic states which are moderate - Morocco and Tunisia - and one which presents a real danger, because it is a time bomb that has started to tick, and that state is Algeria."
"It is therefore essential that we should support the forces of moderation in North Africa, which is vitally important to us, because from a historical point of view the Mediterranean has not been the southern frontier of Europe but the wheel on which Europe's destiny has been shaped."
"Throughout that entire area we should be defending the forces of moderation against extremism and strengthening them."
"Quite apart from that, we also have numerous cultural points in common."
"Anyone travelling across Spain today on the way to Morocco, through Seville and on to Marrakesh, for example, will observe that the Kutubiyah Mosque is very similar to the Giralda."
"We have common architecture, a common tradition, and though we have waged war on each other, there is still one example, or so I believe, of peaceful coexistence of religions, namely the Kingdom of the Three Faiths in Toledo."
"The Jewish, Islamic and Christian religions were represented there simultaneously, as can surely be recognized in the Cathedral of Toledo."
"So we have various reasons for developing our common ground with Morocco."
"In addition, it is a fact that there are two states in the Arab and Islamic world which are very close to us."
"One of them is the Sultanate of Oman in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula and the other is Morocco."
"It is said time and again about Morocco, of course, that there are human rights abuses in that country."
"I do not deny that; it is undoubtedly the case."
"The fact is that there are various levels of culture and development."
"We should not simply say that everything has to be done in accordance with our standard."
"The crucial thing is how a country develops, and it must be said that Morocco has made enormous progress, especially in recent decades, including progress towards greater democracy."
"That is why I believe that Morocco is really entitled to our attention, that we should make serious efforts to provide Morocco with the necessary connections and give it tangible support."
"The Sahara question is also aired very frequently."
"I think I am probably the only one here in Parliament who can say that I made my first visit to the Sahara more than fifty years ago."
"There is no particular merit in that; I am, after all, the grandfather of this Parliament."
"But it does enable me to say one thing, namely that I can see the developments that have taken place there."
"When people speak today about voters and registration of voters, they should be fully aware of the situation."
"There have been repeated calls to proceed on the basis of a particular register that was drawn up back in the Spanish era."
"That would be totally wrong."
"Many new settlers have arrived since then, and their contribution has been truly enormous."
"Here in Europe we still consider it unthinkable to eject people who helped to build our continent."
"We should bear that in mind in relation to the Sahara too."
"Then, of course, the old arguments against Islam are trotted out time and again, with repeated references to what happened in Iran at the time of Khomeini."
"The various shades of opinion within Islam must not simply be lumped together; it must be recognized that there are various groups within Islam and that many of them merit our respect."
"There are, however, many who oppose it simply because they are basically racists but who do not have the courage to admit that openly."
"This is a fine piece of camouflage under which they introduce this additional factor into the equation."
"That is why we should really encourage Morocco."
"We should accept this agreement, which, incidentally, has been very well negotiated, and we should recognize in particular that if we want to work together there ought to be a certain spirit of friendly openness."
"There is an old German proverb which says that flies are not caught with vinegar but with honey."
"May I ask the House to take that message to heart and to open the door to the Moroccans."
"They really do deserve it."
"I believe that, for all the reservations certain Members of Parliament may have - and most of those Members are not well acquainted with the situation - we should show the Moroccans that we are their friends."
"We want to support the moderate Islamic states, and above all we want to make the Mediterranean a region of peace."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has unanimously asked the Commission to make a statement on one particular point: our view of the human rights situation in Morocco and the Commission's position with regard to the Western Sahara."
"First, and as regards the subject of human rights and democratic principles in Morocco, the Commission regards it as important - and this is the point of view we put to the European Parliament -that these matters have developed favourably in the past few years."
"In fact since 1991 marked signs of a political opening-up and a perceptible improvement in the human rights situation have been noted in Morocco, particularly as regards legislation on imprisonment and freedom of the press, two questions which have given this House concern in the past."
"The Commission thinks that no-one of good will can deny the substantial progress made in recent years on the subject of human rights in Morocco."
"The pace of the reforms, their content or their speed leave room for discussion."
"But, I repeat, no-one of good will could deny that recently, and particularly in the last few years, the situation in Morocco, as regards the European Parliament's traditional criticisms, has improved considerably."
"Of course that does not mean that it has reached a situation which can be regarded as perfect."
"And the Moroccan authorities themselves, in their political dialogue with the Commission, acknowledge in fact that the desired level of observance of human rights has not yet been reached."
"They know too that progress must be made in this matter."
"But, Mr President, I should like to give a special and detailed explanation of the reasons why the Commission thinks the European Parliament should make a positive response to the association agreement, whilst respecting the different points of view with regard to pace, content or intensity but accepting that progress in the matter of human rights is clear and definite."
"This year, 1996, is decisive for the Moroccan constitutional system."
"You know that King Hassan II has announced a package of measures concerning reform of the constitution with the object of bringing the Moroccan democratic system up to a level which most of you would regard as appropriate."
"And precisely because you are Members of Parliament you will have to acknowledge a crucial feature of that reform: the direct election by the citizens of Morocco of the 333 members of the parliament and the establishment of a new chamber of regional representatives, the Senate."
"One feature which has always attracted some of the European Parliament's major criticisms with regard to the Moroccan parliamentary system is even now undergoing a constitutional reform, so that after the new parliamentary elections the parliament will contain solely members elected by their fellow citizens."
"So parliamentary democracy is, in this very year, 1996, at the centre of the Moroccan internal debate."
"I have myself visited the Moroccan Parliament and have been able to appreciate the intensity of this reform phenomenon, which it is proposed to implement during the second half year."
"There are two political approaches to this situation: one is to go on criticizing; the other is to engage in dialogue and to promote this kind of change which is so fundamental in the Moroccan constitution."
"The Commission is clearly in favour of dialogue and helping the Moroccans' own political forces so that they may make the final leap, independently and respecting their own sovereignty, for the realization of a constitutional reform which will finally endorse the Moroccan system as regards what some of you - whether you are for or against - will recognize as a parliamentary system governed by the rule of law."
"Moreover it is necessary to vote in favour of the association agreement for another fundamental reason: one of the decisive parts of the association agreement consists precisely of all the provisions with regard to respect for human rights."
"It is an integral part of the association agreement and constitutes an essential feature of the future of relations between the European Union and Morocco and it is expressly mentioned in the agreement for which we are going to ask you to vote."
"Consequently it seems to us in the Commission that the European Parliament's most subtle and intelligent course is specifically to see that this association agreement comes into force because in this way we shall have established a dialogue with the Moroccan political forces with the very clear objective of helping them to take the final decisive steps, without our meddling or interfering in the internal process, which is very sensitive and complex, to bring about this change which is at this moment under way in Moroccan society."
"The second sensitive issue is the Western Sahara."
"The Commission has always contended that the initiative and leadership with regard to the Western Sahara is a matter for the United Nations."
"That has always seemed to us the natural setting in which possible negotiations should take place."
"You know that unfortunately the Secretary General, Mr Boutros Ghali, has been obliged to acknowledge that the United Nations mission, Minurso, is not in a position to complete the process of deciding who might take part in the referendum."
"The Commission regrets that Security Council decision, but it is a fact that Minurso, further reduced, will continue its duties of monitoring the cease-fire."
"I imagine that the European Union's position will depend on the final report which the Secretary General of the United Nations has to draw up, to be submitted, as you know, on 31 August."
"We therefore still think that the only way of resolving the problem of the Sahara is through negotiation; that such negotiations should take place and efforts should be redoubled within the framework of the United Nations; and that we shall have to wait until 31 August when Mr Boutros Ghali submits his final report."
"In any case it is clear that, whether as a result of the initiative of this Parliament or of some Member State, the European Union will have to concern itself with this question at the end of the summer once the Security Council has finally given its views."
"With regard to the basic arguments concerning the association agreement, the Commission has not the slightest hesitation in associating itself with Mr von Habsburg's report and speech, which has exactly pinpointed the fundamental geopolitical aspect of this agreement for Mediterranean stability."
"Since we are laying down a stable and solid southern frontier for Europe, the European Parliament will help us to consolidate the pieces little by little and one fundamental piece in the consolidation of a stable southern frontier is precisely the Kingdom of Morocco."
"Mr President, we thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Marín, for the detailed explanations he has given us."
"The opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations is to a large extent based on some of the aspects he has mentioned, for example:"
"1.The importance of consolidating the European Union's links with the Southern Mediterranean by means of the new policy of association with the Maghreb and the Mashreq.2.This new policy should contribute to the stability of the region in a framework of security and the promotion of democratization and human rights; also greater institutional pluralism and economic development will help to improve the standard of living of all its citizens as regards social aspects and employment.3.The need to show yet again that the European Union wishes to bring the tolerant cultural traditions of the north and the south closer together.The agreement with Morocco, following those of Tunisia and Israel, is an example of that effort, aimed at providing a suitable framework for the political dialogue and for developing more balanced economic and trade relations which will take the form, after transitional periods, of the liberalization of trade in goods, services and capital."
"This agreement, as the Vice-President of the Commission has said, includes the conditionality clause on which all relations must be based, that is, on respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"We are thankful for the effort Morocco has made in this direction."
"However, we are concerned about the impasse reached with regard to holding the referendum on the Western Sahara, because such paralysation might entail real risks for stability in the most western part of the Maghreb."
"The European Union has demonstrated its political will."
"For Morocco this agreement is a fundamental political option aimed at anchoring its economy and society firmly to Europe, but it must not be forgotten that there are also economic risks inherent in carrying out the agreement."
"With all this in mind the Committee on External Economic Relations has given its approval with an opinion in favour of the association agreement between the European Union and Morocco."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, I should like to add my speech to the previous ones, giving express support to this agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco."
"We must pay attention to the point made by both the Commissioner and the rapporteur, stressing the basic geostrategic situation of the Kingdom of Morocco."
"And we must appreciate the desirability of mutual understanding between two cultures - European and Moroccan in this case - for establishing important collaboration."
"From my committee's point of view we think that specific agreements might be reached and I should like to mention to begin with the energy cooperation agreement and above all the opportunities opening up in the field of renewable energy sources."
"There is a possibility of exchange of scientific information and of exchanges in the policy of training of research workers which I think might be enormously profitable for both the Kingdom of Morocco and the European Union."
"We must not forget sources of energy vital to the European Union necessarily pass through Morocco."
"We must not forget that the European Union has important responsibilities to ensure that Morocco, which has managed to make moderation its trade mark, is also treated appropriately."
"We therefore heartily applaud the association agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco."
"Mr President, this is a debate of particular importance and also of particular sensitivity for those of us who represent countries which, like Spain, have special ties not only of neighbourliness but also cultural and economic ties with the Kingdom of Morocco."
"We cannot agree with those who prefer to reject this agreement for purely political reasons, citing the democratic deficit of that country, the question of human rights or of the Sahara."
"It is true that Morocco is not an exemplary country in that direction, but a politician neither can nor must ignore reality or practicality, trying to make everything fit the ideal of certain objectives which may be achieved with words and good intentions but which are closely bound up with economic and social development."
"Morocco at present is calling insistently at the gates of the European Union for help to achieve economic growth."
"However, demographic growth there is unstoppable and, if it is not accompanied by job creation, the pressure of migration will continue to rise, with all the accompanying problems."
"On the other hand the Moroccan economy needs alternatives to the proliferation of a corrupt economy sustained by the cultivation of drugs, which increases as a function of the needs of the population as a result of their level of poverty and underdevelopment, not to mention the needs in infrastructures such as transport, health services or modernization of their own administration."
"This agreement is aimed at collaboration in the full development of all those fields I have mentioned and indirectly to increasing stability and democratic development to make the country more prosperous and with a higher social and cultural level."
"All that does not mean it is a blank cheque to the Kingdom of Morocco but implies more stringent monitoring as regards compliance with agreements and the rules of the International Labour Organization in the social sphere, particularly those relating to child labour and working women, respect for freedom of trade unions, dialogue and social protection which at the moment are clearly insufficient."
"Morocco must also take steps to control not only its own emigration but the emigration taking place across its territory from African third countries and must collaborate to put an end once and for all to the degrading spectacle of the little boats in the straits of Gibraltar and Central African pressure on the Spanish frontiers of the Union such as Ceuta and Melilla."
"In brief, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is wise to vote in favour of this association agreement, because it will have a positive effect not only in giving Morocco a larger slice of freedom and democracy and the means to demand more, but in guaranteeing greater stability, peace and security in the whole Mediterranean region as was agreed at the last Euro-Mediterranean Conference held in Barcelona."
"Mr President, Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation urges ratification of the agreement with Morocco, as another important step in the new Euro-Mediterranean strategy identified at Barcelona last November."
"This involves moving to a new strategic equilibrium in the external relations of the European Union after the priority given to the central and eastern European countries in recent years."
"In fact the stability of Europe's southern flank affects the whole Union, and not just the more geographically exposed Member States."
"The dialogue with the Mediterranean should primarily be a structured political dialogue, not one that is merely based on the exchange of goods. It should be an institutionalized dialogue leading to continuous political consultation between two cultures which need to have useful contacts."
"Precisely because of this, because we are making Morocco a privileged partner of the European Union, we are obliged to stress two matters of concern deliberately ignored in the report, but emphasized by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and we would like the Commission to take them into consideration. First, the serious violations of human rights perpetrated in Morocco, and which are going on now, not in the past."
"Secondly, the deadlock on the independence referendum for the Saharan people. A few weeks ago the latest Amnesty International report stated that the Moroccan security forces in Western Sahara have carried out serious violations of human rights."
"Condemning this is not a form of racism. In addition, Amnesty states that the Moroccan government is showing no intention of investigating these violations."
"Another source of deep concern is the fact that the Moroccan government is blocking the United Nations Security Council's peace process, specifically based on organizing a referendum on self-determination."
"The committee also calls on the Polisario Front to seize the opportunity for peace that exists and continue along the path of dialogue and contact with the United Nations."
"Mr President, the Committee on Fisheries has given its opinion in favour of the Association Agreement with Morocco, which was considered by both parties as inseparable from the conclusion of a fisheries agreement with that country for a period of four years."
"However, whilst no question arises as to the raison d'être of that agreement, it must be mentioned that the sardine processing sector is a real martyr to that agreement."
"The sardine processing sector has in fact been contending with a long-standing crisis which may lead, with the complete liberalization of the market - unless something is done - to its disappearance, with consequent unemployment and the consequent tragedy for some 15 000 workers in Portugal and many others in countries such as France, Spain and Italy."
"As a result the Committee on Fisheries in its opinion has recommended certain priority measures to the competent Community bodies."
"Amongst them the following should be stressed:"
"first, the introduction of a compensatory indemnity system for sardines intended for the Community processing industry; -secondly, to allow the industry to be directly eligible for the storage premium since a pre-determined price is paid for production; -thirdly more stringent controls on imported products in order to guarantee that the European Union's health rules are complied with.We hope that these measures will be taken internationally since we have no doubt that Europeans as a whole and the Moroccans as well can only benefit from this partnership and cooperation agreement."
"Welcome"
"Before calling the speakers for the respective groups, may I welcome to the European Parliament the following representatives of the Albanian Parliament: Sernet Pellunpy, Socialist, Vice-President, Skender Gjinushi, leader of the Social Democrats, Neritan Ceka, leader of the Democratic Alliance Party, Petrit Kalakculla, leader of the Democratic Party."
"I welcome them here and extend to them my best wishes for successful work with us."
"Agreement with Morocco - Human Rights in Morocco and Western Sahara (continuation)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and geostrategic importance of the association agreement on which we are being asked to vote is obvious."
"So I will talk about other aspects."
"Once again, we find ourselves in a position to measure our hopes against the hard yardstick of reality."
"This Parliament has consistently, and on very many occasions, demonstrated its desire to bring about genuine convergence, a complete synergy between the various facets of development, living standards and productivity, trade and respect for human rights."
"Reconciling these factors is difficult."
"No one is perfect."
"In fact - and we previously had a rather similar debate on the subject of Turkey - when it comes to association agreements with countries with an unsatisfactory human rights record, our own choice is between refusal, equivalent to imposing a penalty, and resigned approval."
"Neither solution is entirely satisfactory."
"The whole problem is knowing where to draw the line, how our politicians should make their decisions so that our requirements in terms of civilization and human rights remain unmistakably obvious and firm, without thereby undermining or obstructing the efforts of those countries which, although their initial situations may be undesirable and open to criticism, are undeniably demonstrating the desire to improve."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy and respect for the human rights, which are so dear to us, are not just constitutional and legal abstractions: they are also the expression of a culture, a way of living and thinking built up over a great many years."
"In our case, these values and forms of behaviour took nearly 200 years to come into existence."
"In the Islamic cultural sphere, the movement to introduce democracy began much more recently."
"We can reasonably criticize those who reject it, but not those who are merely lagging behind."
"The current position is that the human rights situation in Morocco is unsatisfactory."
"There are many political prisoners."
"No one can be sure that torture is not continuing."
"The course of justice is being obstructed in the search for certain missing persons."
"The peace process in Western Sahara is deadlocked."
"That is the immediate position."
"Over the course of time, though, Morocco has made important advances: many prisoners released, secret camps shut down, huge advances towards freedom of the press, an institutional process which is moving slowly towards constitutional monarchy, and a parliamentary opposition which is increasingly influential and is asking us, urgently, to vote in favour."
"In comparison terms, Mr President, Morocco has slowly become one of the least dictatorial of the Arab States."
"In the Arab world, which has had a raw deal from history, the only territory governed by an elected democracy is the Palestinian authority."
"Its closest rivals in the progression towards international standards of democracy are the two kingdoms of Jordan and Morocco."
"Are we going to treat Morocco as if it was Iraq?"
"Do we want to support the reactionary Islamic forces within that country which are opposing closer links with the West, even trade links?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should vote in favour of this agreement, as a sign of encouragement, as a positive bet on the future, and also as a means of keeping up pressure whenever negotiations take place regarding application or renewal."
"We in the Socialist Group have been very hesitant about this."
"Eventually, we adopted the position I have had the pleasure of presenting to you."
"We must vote in favour."
"Mr President, for us the approval of the Euro-Maghreb agreement under discussion today has the greatest importance."
"Following the signing of the agreements with Israel and Tunisia this agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco must be regarded as one of the objectives announced at the European Council of Essen and developed at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Barcelona."
"On the other hand this represents a demand put forward years ago by the European Parliament and particularly by its Committees on Foreign Affairs and on Development and Cooperation."
"Progress is thus being made in the rebalancing of the Union's policies to make it possible to deal with our relations with our neighbours in Central and Eastern Europe and in a similar manner with our neighbours on the southern flank of Europe."
"The agreement we are discussing has an economic and commercial content, aimed fundamentally at the economic and social development of the Kingdom of Morocco and the growth of economic and commercial relations between Morocco and the European Union."
"But I should like to emphasize that the agreement itself lays down, as one of its first provisions, that one essential feature of the new framework of our relations is to be respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"On the other hand, Mr President, we are sorry that the United Nations did not succeed in the task assigned to them of keeping peace in the Western Sahara and organizing the referendum on self-determination to bring the long process of decolonization of the territory to a close."
"For a Member of Parliament such as I am, elected as a native and resident of the Canary Islands, the question of the Sahara is not a problem of greater or lesser theoretical importance but a conflict which places the Islands on the margin of a zone of warlike tension for which the Canaries have paid a high price in political and economic terms, but above all in terms of human lives with the blood of some of our fishermen on the Canary-Sahara fishing banks."
"I cannot finish, Mr President, without referring to the concern felt at the terms of the agreement with Morocco in certain economic sectors, particularly amongst growers of tomatoes, fruit, vegetables, flowers and plants in certain European regions - regions certainly among the least developed in Europe, which might in the end be placed at an unfair disadvantage by an agreement which, as a whole, is obviously of benefit to the signatories and which we, of course, support without reserve."
"Mr President, the agreement with Morocco arrives third, after the agreements with Tunisia and Israel. So it constitutes an important stage and is a signal of consistency with the Euro-Mediterranean inaugurated in Barcelona, a concrete demonstration of the will of the European Union to become as present and active in the south as it is in the north and the east."
"Moreover this agreement is not, as was said by other rapporteurs earlier, only an economic agreement. Like the other two agreements which have preceded it, as well as an economic dimension it has another, equally significant, of foreign and security policy."
"With this are being created the conditions to fill a void in these two policies for Europe, a void which has been untenable up to now."
"Morocco, in particular, like Tunisia, is also a precious area of stability, which contributes significantly to the containment of the violence which is unfortunately still present in Algeria and hence contributes not only to regional but also Mediterranean and European stability."
"True, there is the painful aspect of human rights."
"And it is right to demand that they be strictly protected and also demand the acceleration of the process of democratic reform."
"We owe it to ourselves however also to take account of the fact that the persistence of conditions that are not at all satisfactory runs parallel to the existence of a risk of serious emergency."
"Indeed, as Commissioner Marín has said, reform is proceeding at a fairly rapid pace and we are convinced that the greater the stability the greater will be the speed of implementing reform. Expecting everything immediately does not seem wise."
"I therefore associate myself with the opinion Mr von Habsburg has expressed in his excellent report and I propose, on behalf of my group, approval of the ratification of the association agreement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should all like to live in the Kingdom of Utopia so well described by Sir Thomas More, except that Utopia is always taken to be something illusory."
"To try to establish any kind of agreement between the European Union and a third country and to require the ideal - I repeat the ideal - of democracy and human rights draws us inevitably into the Kingdom of Utopia - that is, into an illusion."
"But if this country has taken concrete, objective steps in the direction we require for political, economic and social democracy, it would be politically criminal to impede the progress which has been made and to reverse the positive trend. development."
"For these reasons I think the agreement which the European Union is intending to conclude with Morocco, consolidating and developing what has already been achieved in the sphere I mentioned, is essential."
"Apart from that, and in fulfilment of the undertakings of the Barcelona Conference, this agreement brings Morocco closer to the European Union and is one more step towards the good relations which the European Union wishes to establish with the countries of the Maghreb."
"The excellent report of our colleague and friend, Mr von Habsburg, is in favour of the conclusion of the association agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco and, for the reasons I have given, deserves our support."
"Mr President, we do not regard ourselves as a Group of ill-will, or racist or short of intelligence; nevertheless we are by no means ready to support the development of political Islamism."
"We shall therefore vote against this association agreement between the European Union and Morocco."
"We shall say 'no' because we believe that this type of agreement should further the economic and social development of the countries with which they are concluded, but it should also further their political development, which includes strict regard for human rights."
"How sad it is to hear in this House that progress has been made because a few political prisoners have been released!"
"How sad to hear in this House that there is less infringement of human rights!"
"How sad to hear in this House that although democracy has not been established by a particular government and human rights are not fully respected, nevertheless relations with that government must be privileged!"
"How sad in this House to hear it regretted for example that the United Nations Security Council has decided de facto to withdraw the Minurso, yet not to hear in this House that it is the Moroccan Government which is basically responsible for blocking the process of self-determination for the Sahrawi people because for some years it has been preventing the work of the United Nations missions!"
"How sad to hear in this House, once more, that political realism leads us to vote in favour of an agreement which will not serve either peace or stability in the region or even the development of democracy or human rights in Morocco."
"Mr President, the Green Group will vote against this proposal."
"I myself shall do the same, not because I am an anti-Arab racist but because in my own country I am known as perhaps one of the foremost friends of the Arabs."
"I cannot accept the inverted racism which means that the suppression of freedom in Arab countries is acceptable on account of their culture and traditions."
"Those who take this line are no true friends of the Arab world."
"For us Western Sahara is a crucial point."
"The question is when it will be appropriate to enter into an association agreement with Morocco."
"The Security Council recently decided to extend the Minurso mandate in the hope that it will be possible to resume identification work."
"In that connection the Security Council particularly stressed that Saharan political prisoners in Morocco must be released."
"The view that it is Morocco which is primarily responsible for the breaking off of the peace process is shared by practically all experts, from the OAU, the Organisation of African Unity, to the European Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"We in the Green Group regard greater cooperation around the Mediterranean in a very positive light."
"There should be no doubt about that."
"However, we believe that right now it would be extraordinarily inappropriate to give King Hassan and his regime political support by approving the agreement."
"It would also be an insult to the legitimate battle for freedom being conducted by the people of Western Sahara."
"Mr President, Michel Rocard said earlier that we must choose between our unreasonably high expectations and bitter reality."
"I often think that we find ourselves having to choose between commercial interests and democratic values."
"It is indeed tragic that the European Parliament, when push comes to shove, so often chooses commercial interests in preference to democratic values."
"Mr President, in the seething cauldron of the Mediterranean, where Algeria is running with fire and blood, where Turkey is rent by internal warfare, where Israel and Palestine face the constant threat of latent violence, and where Libya is under the sway of a known terrorist government - in this region, a theatre of hostilities where death and injury are commonplace, Morocco, like it or not, is a relative haven of tranquillity, one of the few countries where an acceptable degree of collective security prevails."
"To attempt to give lessons to that country and select it as the appropriate locale for urgent intervention is either an error of judgment, which is what I hope, or deliberate, blind partisanship, which is what I fear."
"The fact is that there are two factors that can militate against the adoption of the text before us today."
"First, it is true - let us not bury our heads in the sand - that the defence of human rights in Morocco today still involves police action, court judgments and conditions of imprisonment which are often unacceptable."
"The basic freedoms, those formal freedoms that our communist comrades used to talk about, are still granted grudgingly, if at all."
"To be resolutely hostile to government policy is no sinecure, no kind of picnic at all."
"All these things are still true but, to be a little more specific, they are becoming less and less true."
"And we need to help our democratic friends in Morocco to ensure that these things are no longer true at all."
"We should note though, in passing, that those who vow to bring down the regime and the Moroccan kingdom are not all apostles of liberty - far from it."
"The second point which seems to be deterring some of our colleagues from endorsing the text produced by our rapporteur, Otto von Habsburg - who, incidentally, I must congratulate - is the matter of Western Sahara."
"The 'green march' and the de facto annexation of the territory more than 20 years ago have led to results that cannot be accepted as things stand."
"Clearly, it is necessary to consult the views of the people."
"But to accuse Morocco of sabotaging the referendum process is simplistic, to put it mildly."
"The Polisario Front, which - as I have said before and as I say again now - is detaining several thousand families -the Saharan refugees are literally detainees - this Polisario Front, then, which has taken away their papers, which indoctrinates them as a matter of routine and uses whatever threats are necessary against those who show any inclination to return to their homes is hardly in a position to lecture us on the subject."
"If no referendum has taken place, in accordance with the United Nations' decisions, it is frankly wrong - I didn't say dishonest, I said wrong - to hold the Kingdom of Morocco alone responsible for the unacceptable delays in organizing that referendum."
"Let us be close to the Moroccans."
"Let us move even closer to them."
"It may be good business, but it is certainly right."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has to be realistic."
"The Union's external policy has to draw the logical conclusions from the general situation in the Mediterranean, where economic and political instability and the rise of fundamentalism coexist with the growth of genuine development areas and real hope of stability."
"In the Maghreb, the tragic events which have just brought bloodshed to Algeria, the cold-blooded murder of seven Trappist monks, the relentless civil war taking place there, all these must strengthen us in our determination to support those who, on our southern borders, opted for stability, development and friendship with Europe."
"Since the first days of independence, Morocco has pursued a dual objective: defending its own identity while developing in partnership with Europe."
"This bold and courageous choice was not, and is not, free of risk for the policy makers who made that choice and are still pursuing it."
"If our Parliament refuses to give its assent to the association agreement, it will amount to abandoning those who made that choice in Morocco, and would weaken their position at a time when every country on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, including Morocco, is now being tormented by fundamentalism."
"The stability of Morocco cannot be taken for granted: it is the product of the determination of Morocco's rulers, and our cooperation has its part to play there."
"Furthermore, the opening-up of Morocco, from Pope John Paul II's visit to Casablanca to the festival of sacred art in Fez, is in any case too rare an example among the countries in that region not to deserve enthusiastic encouragement."
"After all, at a time when the Member States of the European Union are using all their resources to fight against illegal immigration and the marginalization that it generates, Morocco has embarked upon the road of selfcentred development which proposes to make full use of all its human resources."
"By supporting this kind of development, then, we shall at the same time be helping to combat illegal immigration."
"Development, stability, openness, progress towards democracy even if that progress is sometimes hesitant - all these trends at any rate deserve our encouragement and support."
"We have an opportunity to express that encouragement and support clearly and specifically by approving Mr von Habsburg's report and the association agreement upon which we are being asked to vote."
"Let us not miss that opportunity."
"Mr President, we approve the proposals put forward by Mr von Habsburg regarding the strategic importance of Morocco, a great and proud nation, and a friendly one, which has supported and still is supporting a dazzling civilization."
"Yet the association agreement you are offering us gives rise to serious reservations on our part, the same reservations that we have entered in all similar cases."
"I should say at once that those reservations have nothing to do either with the Sahara question or with the political regime in Morocco; nor do they have anything to do with those human rights which we talk about so often and implement so badly."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before we presume to give lessons to the King of Morocco, let us start by putting our own house in order."
"Just four days ago, under the laws of the thought police, an examining magistrate by the name of Tchalian in my country, France, ordered the arrest of the director of an independent newspaper, the journalist Debeketsch, for expressing the wrong opinion."
"In many ways, there is more freedom of expression in Morocco than there is in Europe."
"So the Moroccans can do without your lessons on the right way to behave, as can we."
"The main thrust of our reservations concerns the underlying nature of the Maastricht system."
"It is presented as being a stabilizing factor in Moroccan society."
"If the European Union were to produce that effect, it would be something new."
"On the contrary, how can anyone fail to see that unrestricted free trade produces a destructive effect, a point that was noted in former times by Karl Marx, who incidentally was a supporter of it for that reason."
"What about your political imperialism, the arrogance of our subculture, the destruction of our spiritual values?"
"Do you want to impose all that on Morocco?"
"The second reason relates to Title VI and Article 64: the alignment of the rights of Moroccan nationals with those of our own nationals."
"Clearly, Moroccans do have rights abroad, just as foreigners have rights in Morocco."
"But it seems to us that those rights should be determined by ordinary international civil law."
"We have just been talking about unemployment in Europe."
"But you refuse to see that extending our welfare systems and economic systems to nationals of non-member states of the European Union serves to attract people in those countries, at a time when the European Union, the economic area with the world's lowest growth rate at present, is in no position to accept them."
"As far as this is concerned, the corrective factors referred to in Article 71 are unlikely to be much of a barrier."
"Thirdly, we have always believed that the European Union should confine itself to a European political, economic and cultural area."
"If not, and it is embarrassing to have to make such obvious points, it ceases to be a European entity and becomes one step on the road towards the construction of a global entity."
"In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we needed here was not a general free-trade agreement but an agreement on cooperation, close cooperation."
"It is true that the Mediterranean countries are as deserving of our attention as those of central Europe, but you have not gone the right way about strengthening our links with this great country."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the Barcelona initiative is to promote security and stability in the area of the Mediterranean Sea, the south flank of the European Union - stability which may benefit both the Union and the North African countries."
"Here Morocco plays a very important part as a bridge between the Maghreb and the Union."
"In the past few years a cautious beginning has been made in the sphere of democracy."
"Commissioner Marín has just confirmed that."
"Admittedly it is all a small start."
"But when such a man as Abraham Serfati who spent more than ten years in Moroccan jails confirms these small steps in the field of human rights, who are we to dismiss them out of hand and refuse to count their weight in balancing our scales for or against an agreement."
"The human rights situation in Morocco is still far from ideal, but, ladies and gentlemen, a rejection of the association agreement before us will certainly not bring respect for human rights any closer."
"Only a critical dialogue with all levels of Moroccan society can bring closer the advancement of the State governed by the rule of law which we so keenly wish to see."
"It smacks of Realpolitik and I support what Mr De Melo said about it - approving the association agreement on the basis of a joint resolution on democracy and human rights, rather than slamming the door on a country whose citizens are daily in our midst."
"Above all to approve it in order to avoid even the slightest risk of seeing Morocco slide down into an Algerian situation."
"That must be avoided."
"I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I should like to consider this subject from the point of view of finance since, if I did so from the point of view of politics I might be as inconsistent as the Member who expressed disagreement here today and yet voted in favour of an association agreement with Cuba."
"In the Committee on Budgets we gave an opinion favourable to the association agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco in a letter signed by the chairman of the committee himself."
"From the financial point of view the agreement is covered until 1999 by the appropriations earmarked for the MEDA programme, but that does not mean that our hands are tied since Article 90(2) of the agreement permits the Union to take any appropriate measures if the other party fails to fulfil the obligations set out in the association agreement."
"For those reasons therefore this agreement may be approved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement we have been asked to approve today is an especially important one both for our Member States and for the Kingdom of Morocco."
"This is no longer just a matter of renewing the previous 1976 agreement, but a matter of redefining the economic and politic relationships between the European Union and the Mediterranean seaboard States as was decided at the European Councils at Essen in 1994, and at Cannes in 1995, and since then at the Barcelona conference, which laid the groundwork for closer multilateral cooperation designed to create a Euromediterranean region of stability, peace and prosperity."
"It is this last point, the creation of a region of peace and prosperity, that I would like to stress."
"We all know how the political situation in a country depends on its economy, and so we are also all in agreement that economic aid from the Union can help a country to maintain a precarious but essential political equilibrium."
"As far as the Kingdom of Morocco is concerned, we want to encourage it to pursue its economic reforms and political liberalization."
"Following the model of the two previous texts of the same type, concluded with Israel and Tunisia, this new generation of agreements is more than just an attempt to establish a genuine economic partnership between Europe and the country concerned; it has a political aspect, too."
"Provision is in fact made for a regular political dialogue to be set up between our Union and the Kingdom of Morocco."
"And, within that dialogue, respect for human rights and principles of democracy will play an essential part."
"That is why, incidentally, the agreement includes a clause authorizing its suspension in the event of any violation of these fundamental principles."
"Mr President, it would not be reasonable, then, to expect the European Parliament not to give its assent to the agreement between the Union and Morocco."
"To the contrary, we have a duty to support - as does the rapporteur Mr von Habsburg, whom we thank - we have a duty to support the Kingdom of Morocco and do everything we can to help it, because it is still a bastion against the rise of the extremists, extremists on the very borders of Morocco who, for their part, have not the least concept of the most basic of all human rights - respect for life."
"Mr President, with regard to the European Union's desired agreement with Morocco, some people have been advancing the equality argument, saying that we must conclude the agreement because the EU is concluding the same type of agreement with other Mediterranean coastal states."
"But there are differences."
"Libya, for instance, is not one of the states involved in the MEDA programme."
"Morocco differs from the other Mediterranean states in that it has occupied the Western Sahara."
"The European Parliament has always taken a clear and unequivocal position on Morocco and the Western Sahara."
"The realization of the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination has always been a matter of priority for us."
"We bear special political responsibility here too. The Sahrawi people have lived in refugee camps for 20 years."
"That is the result of an irresponsible policy pursued in the postcolonial era."
"That we should give humanitarian aid to the refugees and to the refugee camps is therefore a dictate of our humanity and part of our historical obligation."
"But before we can sign or approve this agreement here today, we need a political solution for the Western Sahara, and that means Moroccan withdrawal from the Western Sahara."
"The peace process was a good start."
"The ceasefire agreement was important."
"But the referendum is also important to us."
"Some people are still saying that dialogue is needed."
"We can see how dialogue works in the wake of the agreement with Turkey."
"There is dialogue. There are Spanish and French tourist organizations represented in Morocco, there are fisheries, arms exports, police training in Germany."
"I believe that if we want to move forward here, it is essential that peace should reign in the region, that human rights should be respected and especially that the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination should be supported."
"We want peace in the Mediterranean Basin, but only on condition that Morocco demonstrates real commitment to it."
"Otherwise we advocate waiting until the referendum has actually taken place."
"We agree with the rapporteur, Mr von Habsburg, that Morocco is one of the most advanced of the Maghreb countries and that the situation in Morocco cannot be measured with the same yardstick as for the countries of the Union."
"But that must not prevent us from drawing attention to the human rights situation in that country."
"I am thinking above all of cases of persecution of religious minorities, particularly Christians."
"Only recently we received information about that from the European Evangelical Alliance."
"That is remarkable because religious freedom is basically guaranteed in Morocco, which has also signed various international human rights conventions."
"There therefore appears to be a serious discrepancy between the national authorities' policy of tolerance and the application of that policy by the local authorities."
"It must be discussed with the national authorities."
"In addition Morocco must show signs of greater cooperation as regards Moroccans wanting to return from Europe to their home country."
"Returning is not at present an attractive prospect since the Moroccan authorities do hardly anything in the way of reception and guidance."
"Finally it would be a good thing for curbing the drugs trade if support were provided from the European Union for developing alternative sources of income for the farmers who are now almost entirely dependent on the cultivation of cannabis."
"In spite of what I have said we shall give our support to the association agreement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage of the proceedings perhaps I may concentrate on the salient points of this debate, because actually we are asked for an opinion on the association agreement with Morocco."
"I must say very clearly that the most important thing is its historic significance."
"We have before us the most important agreement ever signed with the Kingdom of Morocco, and the first one based on the essential principles of reciprocity and association, the only agreement to launch a political dialogue, which must take the form of a new parliamentary dialogue between the European Parliament and the parliament of Morocco."
"The fact that this agreement is going to have to be ratified by the 15 Parliaments of the Member States of the Union may give us an idea of its parliamentary importance."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, let us give it a chance and let us have patience to sort things out."
"We are speaking about an agreement which has not yet come into being."
"It is an agreement looking towards the future. Everything in it relates to commitments for the immediate short-, medium- or long-term future."
"It is an association agreement designed to bring about a different state of affairs."
"Let us not fall into the trap of turning this into a test for good behaviour."
"On the contrary, it is a question of making this association agreement what it is: a means of overcoming the past and taking a step towards a new situation in the future."
"How sad it is, ladies and gentlemen, to see that there are political Groups capable only of understanding the politics of frustration, yet not capable of understanding that what is before us is a new road to progress to build together the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco!"
"Precisely for that reason, because it deserves this confidence, because we believe in a democratic Morocco, more democratic than the present one, because we believe in a Morocco in which there will be room for economic and social progress, for that very reason we have to say 'yes' to this agreement."
"How odd that the extreme parliamentary Groups on both sides should finally agree on the same position, by different routes but both of them on a negative vote!"
"Let us look towards progress!"
"Let us vote in favour!"
"Mr President, this agreement with Morocco is a good example of lack of transparency."
"Although it is essential for the European Parliament and all the national parliaments to give their approval, the trade component - and I am speaking directly to you, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, with regard to the question you raised - has already come into force without any ratification."
"There are two possible alternatives - either the European Parliament has the courage to take up a clear political position and reject the agreement, or the Commission and the Council will continue to take the decisions without fully respecting the powers of this and other chambers."
"In addition, in the case of this agreement there are other weighty reasons for rejecting it."
"To start with political reasons, notably the systematic procrastination and undermining of international decisions on the independence of the Sahara; it also has a profoundly unbalanced economy."
"Once again productive sectors of the poorest countries in the Union are affected, particularly in Portugal, with the unfortunate but active participation of the present government, with thousands of jobs placed in jeopardy by a trade liberalization which even manages to breach the conditions of GATT which themselves are so onerous."
"We reject the hypocrisy of those who state that these are economically unimportant sectors."
"We regard them as fundamental activities for supporting thousands of families with a strong cultural and social impact on vast strata of the population and typical of one particular national identity."
"Mr President, we all want to strengthen our links with Morocco."
"We admire the courage and energy of our many Moroccan friends, including the Moroccan MPs who are with us yet again in Parliament, with whom we have a very active dialogue. If Morocco had spent a fraction of the time it has spent on lobbying the European Parliament on cooperating with the peace process in the Western Sahara, the conflict and suffering would have ended many years ago."
"I should like to congratulate Mr von Habsburg, our colleague who describes Morocco as a plural democracy."
"He has again shown he is a good friend of the King of Morocco and, unfortunately, an apologist for the illegal occupation of the Western Sahara by Morocco."
"This Parliament has consistently deplored that illegal occupation which has resulted in loss of life, political prisoners, torture and suffering for some of the most vulnerable people in the world for far too long."
"In seeking closer links with Morocco for our mutual benefit, this Parliament is entitled to expect Morocco to show respect for international law, for human rights and for self-determination for the people of the Western Sahara."
"I trust that Parliament, the European Union and the Moroccan Government will not abandon the people of the Western Sahara who have suffered so much for so long and that we will use all our efforts and responsibilities to support the people of the Western Sahara in their search for freedom and self-determination."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I shall vote, with conviction and hope for the future, in favour of this report."
"Not because I believe, like Mr von Habsburg, that support for any government which is moderate in matters of religion - whether we like it or not - is a good thing for curbing Islamic fundamentalism, but rather because I believe in openness and in the capacity of citizens who are ever more free to overcome such problems."
"I have not the honour, like Mr von Habsburg, of being one of the oldest Members in this hemicycle, but I can remember perfectly well how in my country we still used to have situations in which religion controlled society, situations which were humiliating - for women, for instance."
"In view of Spain's subsequent experience I am in favour of this agreement and of support for the most active sectors of society."
"Of course I feel, like so many others, frustration at the present situation of the conflict in the Sahara."
"I think that the Union must keep on paying great attention, as it is doing - and of course doing so very well - to the humanitarian situation of refugees, to the situation of many children, men and women in the camps, and we shall have to do our utmost, as the Commissioner was saying, to resolve this conflict."
"But I think that this agreement is one step further in that most important process initiated in Barcelona and we must welcome that."
"The Mediterranean countries are asking us to play our part in the region, and we must do so and make the greatest possible use of the means which this agreement offers for turning the Mediterranean into a zone of dialogue for mutual understanding and so that our sea may be a more prosperous and a freer area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have heard all the arguments in favour of this report and against this report, and for my part I shall disregard my notes and tell you that I shall be voting in favour of Mr von Habsburg's text, because I like the Moroccans."
"Oh yes, I like lots of other countries and lots of other people!"
"But if I talk about the Moroccans it is because I have heard them in recent times, like all of us, on the various committees, saying to us - majority and opposition alike - that they have confidence in us and that this means of moving closer together was necessary precisely for the reasons that concern us: the human rights situation, and the situation in Western Sahara."
"So, after the necessity to follow up the resolutions of the Essen summit, let us also follow up - and I pay tribute to Manuel Marín, the originator of these efforts - the efforts of the Barcelona conference."
"We need this stability; we need economic, institutional and cultural ties with the Mediterranean."
"That is true."
"And especially with Morocco, that is even more true."
"I would like to dwell on the two points which are causing a problem."
"First human rights, and then of course the reference to Turkey."
"We are not all that sure, ladies and gentlemen, that we did the right thing when we voted in favour of Turkey's entry into the customs union; we are not sure."
"A fortnight ago we were very dubious, and every day we worried that we may have been wrong."
"The situation is not the same for those who know the Moroccan people."
"And in fact I think it is not the same for those who know the history of that ancient land, that ancient people, that ancient kingdom and, I would say, that young nation."
"No, it is not the same."
"Let us bank on it being very different."
"Then, of course, there is also the matter of the Saharans."
"I have no great enthusiasm for the way they are being treated, I must say, by Algeria and in the camps with which I am familiar."
"I have no great enthusiasm for it - quite the reverse."
"But I know that they fought courageously."
"I know that some of them are deeply sincere, and I know that causes a problem."
"But I have read the documents, the document that the Saharans have just sent us, the document that the Moroccan Socialist Opposition has passed to us, and Mr Boutros Ghali's document."
"And I believe that neither side can be accused of 100 % responsibility for blocking the peace process."
"Let us put our trust in the UN."
"Let us keep the pressure on."
"This referendum is necessary."
"Let us not abandon the Saharans."
"Certainly not!"
"I am taking this gamble, yes, because I believe that there are times in politics when we should follow the dictates of our hearts because our heads are not sure of the way."
"That is why my vote will be in favour of the Moroccans."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Non-admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe"
"The next item is the statement by the Council on the non-admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe."
"Mr President, as Members are aware, Croatia applied for membership of the Council of Europe in September 1992 and in December of the same year the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe asked the Assembly for assent."
"The state of war which developed in former Yugoslavia obviously made the procedure for ascertaining that all the requirements necessary for Croatia's membership of the Council of Europe were in place more complex and lengthy."
"Anyway, in 1995 the Assembly gave assent, after a rather complex passage, but made that assent subject to certain conditions, in particular relating to full recognition and respect for human rights, with particular reference to refugees and minorities, to total commitment by the Zagreb government to implementing the peace agreements and to full cooperation by the Croatian government with the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague."
"The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe took note of that position and sent the assent on, explaining the request to fulfil a series of conditions even more precisely to the Zagreb government."
"I shall mention them specifically: cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal in the territory of former Yugoslavia, including the immediate arrest and handover to that tribunal of persons suspected of having committed war crimes or other violations of international humanitarian law; full compliance, in its capacity as co-signatory of the Paris/Dayton agreements, with the provisions relating to the establishment and operation of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina; cooperation in the holding of free and fair elections, which include the city of Mostar; the invitation to respect human rights and rights of minorities and refugees and to introduce an amnesty law, and finally, the request to respect the freedom of the press and the media, to cooperate with the Council of Europe in revising the rules of local government and to adopt a timetable for holding elections in the city of Zagreb."
"We draw particular attention to this last request, not because the previous ones are not important, but because on the others - particularly those relating to the Paris/Dayton peace agreements and the consequences of the war in former Yugoslavia - the Zagreb government has repeatedly given assurances, at least in principle, of its willingness to comply, and the request by the Council of Europe for effective fulfilment of these conditions also corresponds to the stated intention of the Zagreb government. However, on freedom of the press and freedom and democracy inside Croatia, we are obliged to highlight a certain disparity between the requests made by the Council of Europe and the attitude frequently demonstrated by the Croatian government."
"It is particularly important that membership of the Council of Europe should be consequent on total compliance by the Croatian government with all the conditions called for by the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers and confirmed at the recent meeting of the standing committee of the Council of Europe in Salonika."
"The European Union agrees with the Council of Europe's approach. In fact, the positions of the fifteen States of the European Union, members of the Council of Europe, have tended to be coordinated in support of the position the Council of Europe has taken."
"The coordinated position of the European Union supports the Council of Europe's approach and was reflected in the positions that emerged at the meeting of the European Union General Affairs Council on 13 May, which confirmed, on the one hand, the importance of supporting Croatia's membership of the Council of Europe through a more general strategy of consolidation of the democratic transition of the central European countries, and reinforcement of all the measures and instruments that can help consolidate democracy in those countries, but, on the other, the need for the Zagreb government to comply with all the requests from the Council of Europe as the guarantee of achieving full democracy in Croatia and full application of all the political and civil principles of the rule of law."
"There will probably be another meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the European Union on this agenda before the summer to coordinate current positions and assess the state of application by the Zagreb government of the conditions laid down by the Council of Europe, and clearly if these conditions are respected the European Union will of course take steps to hasten Croatia's membership of the Council of Europe."
"Mr President, it will not surprise this President-in-Office of the Council that I entirely agree with him."
"My Group was indignant about the proposal from the Assembly of the Council of Europe to admit Croatia, albeit conditionally, as a full member of the Council of Europe."
"It looked as though that country was to be rewarded for its part in the peace process, and as though political arguments thus played a large part in the proposal then made."
"But that would amount to toying with human rights criteria by the Council Assembly whereas the Council of Europe's most important task is to put human rights to the test."
"In our view Croatia, or must we say the Croatian Government, does not at present meet the criteria."
"Not long since, the President refused to accept the democratically elected mayor of Zagreb and did everything in his power to prevent the appointment."
"The independent media are seriously hampered in Croatia, and as has been said, the situation of the refugees and the minorities is very unsatisfactory."
"There are thus reasons enough for keeping up the pressure on the Croatian Government."
"That actually applies as well to Croatia's role in the peace process."
"As long as full cooperation with for example the war crimes tribunal at The Hague is not established and the crisis round Mostar is not settled, Europe must not be in a hurry with its recognition of Croatia."
"My Group supports the policy of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers to defer a decision about the admission of Croatia."
"We welcome the response of the European Union."
"We are also glad that the Political Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe supports this proposal."
"Next month and subsequently the Croatian Government will have the opportunity, as regards the questions I mentioned, which are also the criteria formulated by the Council of Europe, to prove itself as a potential member of the Council of Europe."
"The European Parliament, and this is also in the joint resolution put before us, is willing to help Croatia in the field of human rights, to free funds from the rightly frozen PHARE programme for the development of democracy."
"We shall follow developments closely and we ask the Council of Europe to keep us informed of its findings in the coming months."
"And more generally we shall follow closely the Council of Europe's admission policy."
"Previously we debated the admission of the Russian Federation to the Council of Europe."
"I also think it is disturbing that the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe came close to adopting opposite views on this matter."
"That is a pity because the Council of Europe may in a sense be an antechamber for the European Union in particular where assessing human rights situations is concerned."
"If this Parliament and the Assembly of the Council of Europe are going to interpret criteria differently we shall have a serious problem."
"I hope the content of the European Parliament's resolution will cause our colleagues there to think again."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I should like to begin by observing that our debate today on whether or not the Council of Europe should admit Croatia as a member reflects the two sides of relations between the European Union and Croatia."
"On the one hand, we know how important it is for the Croatian people, their parliament, their governments and all political, economic and social groups in that country to be admitted to the Council of Europe and, having gone through the necessary stages, eventually to attain membership of the European Union."
"We in the European People's Party and the Group of the European People's Party support Croatia and its people, as well as its Parliament and Government, in this aspiration."
"On the other hand, we know that the only way to their goal involves complete democratization."
"Like all other states of central Europe, Croatia must establish the same democratic rights and rules of play that apply in the countries of the European Union itself."
"Croatia has already made great progress towards becoming a democratic and pluralist society."
"In the peace process it has taken a moderate line, and its position is now one of commitment to peaceful solutions."
"The economic and social groups - employers, trade unions and the other associations - are free and active."
"Croatia, in our opinion, is pursuing a prudent economic and monetary policy."
"Most of the conditions are in place for reconstruction to be carried out in a climate of stability."
"However, now that hostilities have largely ceased, we want the Croatian Government itself to keep all the rules of democracy."
"Freedom of the press and respect for democratic decisions and election results at all levels are indispensable prerequisites."
"We are opposed to discriminatory treatment of Croatia in the domain of human rights."
"We should regard it as hypocritical, for instance, if the Council of Europe were to admit Russia despite the war in Chechnya but ultimately refused to admit Croatia even if the Croats fulfilled the required conditions."
"But it is precisely because we favour the early admission of Croatia to our circle of European nations that we appeal to the Croatian President and his Government to do all in their power to end the intimidation and harassment of journalists forthwith and to ensure that freedom of the press and media not only exist on paper but are fully respected in practice."
"For the municipal government of Zagreb too, a solution must be found which is politically sound and which respects the outcome of democratic elections."
"The European Union, for its part, should do everything possible to ensure that the resources available under the PHARE programme are committed at long last to the specific aims of developing the economy and democracy."
"To sum up, we believe that the ball is now in the Croatian court."
"We also ask the Council of Europe to keep us informed of any changes in its position on the human rights issue and in the criteria it has laid down, for the Council of Europe's criteria often serve as the basis of our decisions."
"Mr President, in recent years this Parliament has pressed the governments of the Union to intervene to re-establish peace and respect for human rights in the countries of former Yugoslavia."
"In these years we have never hesitated to point the finger at the Serb Republic as primarily responsible for the tragedies that have occurred, especially in Bosnia, and our resolutions have frequently defended the right of Croatia to have the territory occupied by the Serbs restored to it. But precisely because of this, at a time when a more peaceful situation is developing in former Yugoslavia after the Dayton agreements - and this situation must develop - we cannot fail to condemn today, as forcefully as we have condemned mistakes and crimes in other countries, what is going on in Croatia itself as regards respect for human rights, respect for ethnic minorities, press freedom, press pluralism and, last but not least, the point you mentioned, Mr Fassino, about Croatia's commitment to cooperate with the Hague Tribunal and hand over those suspected of serious crimes."
"None of this has happened, so we are totally in agreement with the decision by the Council of Europe and the Union governments you have announced and we are convinced that if the international community fails to establish a climate of transparency and respect for human rights while the IFOR troops are there, it will become extremely difficult for us to leave knowing that as soon as IFOR departs there is the risk of everything going up in flames again."
"So it is urgent to make this stand and it is right to make it firm and clear."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, my group appreciates the efforts the Italian presidency has made to remind the Balkan states of the principles of promotion and defence of human rights and democracy, and we also take a positive view of the decision by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to delay Croatia's membership of that important European Assembly precisely because of the clear violation of the right to free expression."
"We are in favour of conditional cooperation with Croatia, which must provide further guarantees of the irreversible democratic development of its institutions."
"So we view with concern any authoritarian drift by the Zagreb government, the unacceptable boycott of the city elections, the fact that it has ignored the 21 commitments made in applying for membership of the Council of Europe, and its lack of cooperation with the Hague International Tribunal. All this means the Croatian government needs to show further signs of respect for democratic principles."
"Every obstacle to Croatia's membership of the Council of Europe should be removed once Zagreb has provided guarantees of the existence of real press freedom, once it has permitted the return of the Serb refugees and once it has taken steps to resolve the crisis affecting the city of Mostar."
"When this Parliament approved the extension of the PHARE programme to Croatia, it was unanimously made conditional on respect for democratic principles."
"So I believe the Council, and especially the Commission, should not hesitate to demand the suspension of PHARE if Zagreb continues in the direction it has taken."
"On this last point I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to make the position clear to ensure that later, as we all hope, we can proceed to the agreements."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Green Group entirely agrees with the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers in their decision provisionally to defer acceptance of Croatia as a member of that Council."
"There is indeed every reason for doing so."
"More than a year ago it was already decided in this Parliament by a considerable majority that there were serious problems in connection with democratic execution of policy in Croatia."
"First I would cite the independent media which certainly suffer under Croatian Government repression."
"Then Mr Tudjman, the President, has still not appointed a mayor previously put forward by a majority of the people of Zagreb; there is poor cooperation with the International Tribunal, there are still serious problems in connection with the return of Serbs and in this respect laws have been approved in Zagreb and are also often applied, the direct effect of which is that return is made impossible."
"So that is why we say: we agree about looking very carefully at developments in the future."
"I can understand my honourable friend Mr Schwaiger when he asks why we are more demanding towards Croatia than towards Russia; that is entirely connected with geopolitical considerations which often get the upper hand in this House."
"Mr President, at first sight it is possible to justify the fact that a country like Russia should recently have been admitted to the Council of Europe and Romania and Bulgaria even before that, whilst the membership of Croatia is deferred."
"But Croatia's application needs to be assessed on its own merits."
"Otherwise the credibility of the Council of Europe would be still further impaired."
"It is generally known that the protection of fundamental freedoms in Croatia still leaves a good deal to be desired."
"The media are under severe restraint and the independence of the judiciary is not guaranteed."
"In addition President Tudjman's conduct is controversial and there is little cooperation with the International Tribunal on war crimes."
"But the state of the peace process in the former Yugoslavia above all makes us cautious for the present."
"Croatia's membership of the Council of Europe would favourably encourage a change of conduct, but in view of the sluggish process of implementation of the Dayton agreement we think accession would at the moment be premature."
"Compliance with Croatia's application might moreover act as a precedent with regard to Bosnia and what is left of Yugoslavia."
"So, although we think that Croatia must be able to join the Council of Europe, we can agree with the decision to defer it provisionally."
"Mr President, my understanding was that as a general rule our Parliament was against exclusion, but there is one area where Europe favours exclusion - the exclusion of Croatia."
"As far back as 1991 Europe's leaders had refused to recognize the independence of that country, which was then freeing itself from the federal and socialist yoke of Yugoslavia."
"They did not allow that nation to join the international Community until January 1992, when a third of its territory was occupied by the Yugoslav federal army."
"Today, Croatia has gained its freedom, but it is still not in good odour with this House or with the Council of Europe."
"Indeed, the Council of Europe is refusing to allow Croatia to join the club."
"The reason cited is the Croatian government's failure to respect human rights, in particular freedom of the press."
"As if those principles were applied in every one of the thirty-nine member states!"
"Is freedom of the press, or even freedom of elections, better respected in Russia than in Croatia?"
"It's doubtful, to say the least."
"Similarly, what right has the French government to give lectures on freedom of the press when, six days ago, the editor of an opposition newspaper, Mr Debeketsch, was prosecuted merely for holding certain opinions, arrested, and taken in handcuffs to a police station where he was stripped and then body-searched?"
"As if that were not enough, the journalist in question is seriously ill."
"These appalling events happened not in Zagreb but in Paris."
"So perhaps it is time for European governments to respect human rights at home instead of being so fussy about what happens elsewhere."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first I should like to say that I support, as does my Group, the decision which has been taken to postpone Croatia's admission to the Council of Europe."
"I consider myself a friend of Croatia, since I have lived there and in the former Yugoslavia during the hard years of the armed struggle, but I think that the message now being sent to Croatia will have a positive effect in overcoming the difficulties which still persist whilst the democratic political life of the country is returning to normal and also in the part which Croatia has played, is playing and will have to play with regard to the conflict in Bosnia."
"Two days ago I had the opportunity to meet the Croatian Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Mate Granich, following a week-long tour of Bosnia-Herzegovina where, after seeing the situation in Mostar in fair detail and having spoken to refugees of Serbian origin who had left Croatia, I was able to discuss with the minister the various issues, which Mr Fassino also mentioned, such as the main reasons for deferring Croatia's accession to the Council of Europe."
"I understand, as the President-in-Office of the Council was saying, that the freedom of the communication media and the subject of the mayoralty of Zagreb are the questions which are the most direct, clear and obvious responsibility of the Croatian Government."
"But I should like to emphasize other aspects which have an enormous importance for the future of peace in the region and particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, both in relation to the electoral process in Mostar and the attitude of Croatia in general to the Republic of Bosnia."
"I should also like to mention the subject of the minorities."
"The problem of the treatment of minorities in Croatia is serious and must be solved urgently in relation to those who have left."
"But the same problem must also be solved in relation to Eastern Slavonia which is due to come under Croatian sovereignty and where a considerable portion of the Serbian population - at present 100 % - live following the expulsion by the Serbs of all the non-Serbs in that region."
"The solution to this problem lies in treating the matter of the minority groups with sincerity and honesty and not by mere statements on the part of the Croatian Government; in addition the amnesty law must actually extend to all those who have not committed war crimes."
"Moreover I think that the involvement of Croatia in Herzegovina and in support for the bands of mafiosi and ultra-radical fascists operating in the region of Herzegovina will not escape anyone who knows Bosnia."
"Croatia has a direct responsibility for that and only by the will of Croatia can the present situation be prevented from dragging on."
"Finally I should like to say that equally firm, but different, measures will have to be applied to Serbia."
"Mr President, it is a pity that Mrs Aelvoet had to finish before she needed to."
"Otherwise she would almost certainly have said as well that it is such a shame that considerations of Realpolitik of the crudest kind can so frequently outweigh moral and legal considerations in particular as regards even membership of the Council of Europe."
"With us membership of the Council of Europe has always been something of a hallmark for a State where the rule of law prevails, a genuine democracy."
"We find it particularly disappointing and it is also particularly displeasing to us, to the European Union, that the Council of Europe no longer acts as that kind of hallmark."
"That is why we as a Group take such an interest in paragraph 5 of the resolution in which the Council of Europe is requested to state what its accession policy actually is."
"If there are alterations we should be glad to hear of them."
"To some extent when it comes to enlarging the European Union we are a little dependent on the policy they follow."
"Then we naturally think of Turkey, of Russia and sometimes of other countries too."
"We always have mixed feelings about Croatia."
"On the one hand there are politicians who are clearly on our side, people who are genuinely from a State where the rule of law and a democratic environment prevail and then there are others."
"So we continually have problems with Croatia because we do not really know what choice they are actually making."
"From that point of view it is also a good thing that the Council of Europe, certainly not to the surprise and not clearly to the annoyance of the Assembly's rapporteur, René van der Linden, has thought that the accession of Croatia must still be deferred - a very good thing because in this way policy can still be corrected or if necessary even enforced."
"It was remarkable that the idea wrongly arose that admission was already agreed, so that all at once the impression was created that the policy might be harmful to press freedom in Croatia."
"I think that that is the most important point of our whole resolution, together with collaboration with the Hague Tribunal."
"Mr President, I think we must in particular use the present situation to persuade the Government of Croatia to cooperate with us much more seriously in order to muzzle the wretched semi-political mafia in Mostar so as to improve the situation considerably through the influence of Croatia, which is very great in Mostar."
"Mr President, there is increasing confusion in this Chamber and Parliament's credibility is evaporating fast."
"On the one hand, the decision to approve at the first reading a draft law which forbids Croatian children to go to minority language schools is rightly deplored; on the other, a few months ago customs relations were opened with Turkey regardless of the fact that the death penalty is in force there, mutilation is permitted, it is compulsory to state one's religion on the identity card, and in their spare time the Turks bomb the Kurds."
"The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe was right to defer Croatia's membership for not respecting the freedom of expression of the independent press and media. One need only think of the way the Croatian government has intimidated 'The Voice of the People' and 'Glas Istre ' ."
"Croatia is also pursuing serious systematic humiliation of national and minority groups and discrimination against them. Then there are the many commitments made by Tudjman and the President of the Croatian Parliament and never respected, for example, its unwillingness to cooperate in arresting war criminals."
"Turkey's customs union with Europe has not been assessed with equal seriousness and objectivity!"
"But unfortunately these are not the only contradictions in this Parliament: human rights come second to the interests of the few and I am afraid hypocrisy triumphs."
"Mr President, the decision to postpone admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe is important and correct."
"It is important that the countries which are admitted to the Council of Europe respect the fundamental rules and principles which the institution is in fact there to safeguard."
"Croatia at present does not do this."
"Anything else would completely undermine the Council of Europe's credibility."
"Croatia is guilty of ethnic cleansing in that large sections of the Serbian population in Krajina and elsewhere have been driven out through a reign of terror against civilians, through the systematic destruction of their homes and through the obstruction of their return home."
"There are also extremely worrying developments in Croatia as regards press freedom."
"In practice, the government is attempting to silence those critical newspapers which exist."
"This applies to Novi list, which is published in Rijeka, the only independent daily newspaper left."
"It applies to the satirical weekly paper, Feral Tribune, against whose staff legal proceedings have been brought for criticising the president, something which is illegal under section 77 of the Croatian criminal code."
"Such provisions are totally inappropriate in a democratic state."
"Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights stipulates that freedom of expression shall be guaranteed."
"Croatia is unfortunately not complying with this provision, and we therefore support the decision not to admit the country to the Council of Europe at present."
"Mr President, along with Mr Mendiluce Pereiro I went to Bosnia last week to study the situation for myself."
"We travelled by road from Croatia into the state of Bosnia."
"As we entered Bosnia we saw a huge election poster for President Tudjman of Croatia."
"At first I thought this was a mistake but the deeper we went into the Bosnian state the more we saw of these huge posters."
"They symbolized the extent to which President Tudjman is prepared to ignore the Dayton accords and is prepared to fulfil his own agenda in undermining the peace agreement in Bosnia."
"That symbolism was reinforced for us when we went to Mostar where we were told by the authorities that one of the biggest stumbling blocks to a lasting peace and fair elections in Mostar remains the Croatian community which is clearly encouraged in its defiance of Dayton by the government in Zagreb."
"Obviously the international community cannot ignore such deliberate defiance."
"I support the decision taken by the Council of Europe."
"We have to make it clear to all the parties in former Yugoslavia that they must adhere to the Dayton agreements and that we want to see the free movement of people which is being denied by the Croatian authorities in Bosnia."
"We want to see the return of refugees and we want to see free and fair elections."
"The essential prerequisite for free and fair elections is a free media."
"This is manifestly not in existence on the Croatian side."
"Therefore I support this decision by the Council of Europe."
"I hope it will continue to drive home its message, as will the European Union, that the Dayton accords are the basis on which there will be peace and stability in the former states of Yugoslavia in the future."
"Mr President, Croatia is an emergent democracy, and that is why we support the demands made by the Council."
"Allow me, however, to address the President-in-Office of the Council and to put to him the urgent plea that the Council apply the same yardsticks, the same criteria."
"I was the rapporteur on Romania for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe."
"The list of unfulfilled demands made by the Council of Europe was far longer than the list referred to here for Croatia."
"Yet Romania was admitted, and of course is now under obligation to meet these requirements gradually."
"The same terms, I submit, must be granted to Romania."
"It is not my intention to speak of the admission of Russia, which was based on political considerations with blatant disregard for the findings of the judges of the European Court of Human Rights, who delivered a written ruling that the government of Russia is not based on the rule of law and that Russia cannot be admitted under the Statute of the Council of Europe."
"The same criteria must be applied here, and that is why Mr Oostlander and Mr Schwaiger have both cited point 5 of the resolution."
"But I should also like to refer to point 4, Mr President-in-Office, in which we explicitly and jointly demand that PHARE resources be allocated now - and not just at some later date - to promote the democratization process in Croatia."
"I consider it quite vital that we provide such help in this specific sector in order to play our part in ensuring that Croatia is admitted as soon as possible under the same conditions and criteria that have applied to other countries."
"There is no point in trying to be more Catholic than the Pope here."
"If goodwill is shown, we should be prepared to honour the decision taken by a two-thirds majority of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, in other words by the national parliamentarians of our Member States."
"Thank you for those speeches. I have taken note of the points made and the presidency will make sure the Council is informed."
"I just want to emphasize two points here."
"We know how complex and difficult the transition is for the countries of central and eastern Europe, and hence our attitude is not so much one of judgement but of support and assistance in a process."
"We need to see a proper rule of law established, full democracy, full protection of the rights of individuals, of the community, and of minorities. We need to act in such a way that the process of democratic transition becomes ever more consolidated and rooted, so that democracy can grow with deep roots in these countries."
"To do this we must be capable of sustaining and assisting the process."
"I have made this point to explain that we agreed with the decision of the Council of Europe to ask Croatia to fulfil certain conditions before allowing it to join, not because of any punitive attitude towards Croatia, not because we want to discriminate against Croatia, but because we believe it is necessary to ask Zagreb and the Croatian government, just as other countries should be asked, not to delay achieving full democracy, and not to introduce factors that slow down or block a democratic process which should instead be pursued to completion with determination and speed."
"So at the same time as the Council of Europe was asking that - and we share its approach - we ourselves asked Croatia to establish conditions which guarantee full respect for all civil, political and democratic rights in that country. We feel we have a duty to do everything possible to ensure that these rights can be guaranteed, assured and achieved."
"I think we should take the same attitude towards every country engaged in transition."
"Later we will be discussing Albania, where there is a similar problem not only of evaluating the transition, but also of deciding on a more practical and effective strategy to ensure that the transition has a positive democratic outcome."
"That is why we have supported the position of the Council of Europe, that is why we are hoping that Croatia will soon be in a position to demonstrate that it is fulfilling the obligations required of it and that is why we hope that before the end of the summer there can be a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Council of Europe, which will then be in a position to make a positive decision on Croatia's membership of the Council of Europe."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 11 a.m. tomorrow."
"Elections in Albania"
"The next item is the statement by the Council on the elections in Albania."
"Members are naturally aware of the progress of events so I do not need to go over what has happened in the last few weeks in Albania."
"What I need to do here is to bring you up to date with the assessment made on 29 May and to take account of the developments of the last few days to decide on the most useful approach at this stage."
"The presidency of the European Union has been in constant consultation with the OESC which had its own observers in Albania, with our principal European partners, with the diplomatic representatives in Tirana, with the Albanian political parties, both in government and in opposition, and we have also kept in constant touch with the government of the United States to agree a position which follows on from last week's Euro-American statement on democratic transition in Albania."
"This series of contacts has allowed us to bring together a number of points which are set out in the statement issued by the Italian presidency last Friday on behalf of the European Union. The facts are well-known: there was a high turnout in the first round of the elections, but that first round was marked - as all the on-the-spot observers have testified - by widespread and serious irregularities, both in the voting and at the count."
"This situation led the opposition to take particularly serious action, with accusations of ballot-rigging even before the polls had closed in the first round and the announcement of their withdrawal from the elections, which produced a state of grave tension between the government and the opposition, culminating in demonstrations and serious incidents. On the basis of all this evidence, the presidency of the European Union sought to respond to this state of tension by asking the Albanian government to comply with three measures: immediate cessation of any authoritarian repression which might result in a further increase in tension; cancelling the elections and rerunning them in those seats where proven and confirmed voting and counting irregularities occurred; guaranteeing that the second round would take place absolutely correctly and normally."
"Last Sunday the second round took place and was certainly characterized by a much more correct and peaceful climate than the first, but also by a dramatic fall in participation as a result of the opposition parties' appeal to the Albanian electorate to abstain."
"So even if the climate was much calmer, there is no doubt that the second round was nullified by the abnormal situation."
"In short, the completion of the first and second rounds of the election has not resolved the crisis situation in Albania."
"The position is still open, both as regards the outcome of the election because this anomaly, this crisis, has meant it is not yet possible to allocate the seats proportionally under the Albanian electoral system, and also because the opposition parties are contesting the validity of the election and the procedure has not been exhausted. Some parties entered appeals at an early stage involving 41 constituencies and, according to the latest information received today, further appeals entered in the last few hours involve 97 constituencies."
"Faced with this situation two decisions by the government need to be kept in mind: the willingness shown by President Berisha and the Albanian government to re-run elections in four constituencies is significant."
"More importantly, the central electoral commission seems to have autonomously decided, according to the news received today, and independently of the appeals, to carry out a general review of the counts in all the seats. I emphasize that this is a particularly important step because if it is true and if it is carried out sufficiently quickly, it may turn out to be an essential and decisive move for the final evaluation of these elections, for understanding to what extent they can be considered valid and where the irregularities are such as to require a re-run."
"It seems to me that these considerations lead to two conclusions, which I set out here for Members. The first is that the electoral procedure is not finally completed so we must continue to monitor the situation and update our assessment in due course since our judgement may change and our final assessment may alter on the basis of the events of the next few hours and days, in particular the review of all the counts the central commission seems prepared to carry out."
"We need to understand what is going on and what is likely to happen, so the view I have expressed today will have to be updated later."
"The second conclusion is that whatever happens in the next few hours strictly in relation to the electoral procedure, it seems clear in any case that the political and institutional crisis which has developed in Albania means a stage of political dialogue must be opened up, whether these elections are considered valid to all effects, whether they need to be partially re-run or whether the future determines otherwise. In the last few days Albanian society has split from top to bottom, with a crisis between the Albanian political parties which cannot be overcome in procedural terms alone but requires political dialogue between all the political parties of Albania, both in government and in opposition, to construct a political solution to this crisis which allows all Albanians to feel represented in the process of consolidating democracy in their country."
"Mr President, I think that in contrast to the previous item on Croatia, I am in this case a little less in agreement with the President-in-Office of the Council, whom I regard as extremely cautious in his approach to and assessment of what is happening in Albania, whereas with Croatia he had such a clear point of view."
"The elections in Albania were a fiasco."
"We were afraid from the beginning that the government was not dealing absolutely gently with the opposition and there were many signs of that."
"I think we may say that the Albanian Government may also be held responsible for the way in which those elections were conducted."
"There were serious irregularities."
"We heard of intimidation and any protest at the way things were going was put down with violence."
"We think the elections were simply not fair and most observers agree."
"Political life was made impossible for the opposition."
"It is understandable that they are prepared to not work in a fraudulently elected parliament."
"President Berisha may be held personally responsible for this tragedy."
"He creates the impression that he is busy trying to consolidate an autocratic regime as if Albania had not had enough of that."
"With that he is forcing his country afresh into isolation."
"The Council's first appraisal is very reserved."
"They want to wait to see what official reports bring in the next few weeks."
"So the Council is not willing to go further in its assessment than is the case today."
"That is also why we are getting no answer to all our questions."
"Nevertheless we demand to know whether the Council is ready to make a comprehensive statement at Parliament's next plenary part-session in Strasbourg and to say what political conclusions it draws with regard to Albania if it appears, as we think, that those elections have not been correctly conducted."
"On behalf of my Group I should like to say this with regard to those political conclusions: President Berisha must declare the result of the elections void, and not only in the four districts just mentioned, and he must organize fresh elections according to internationally valid standards."
"Until that happens the Council and the Commission must in our opinion suspend all cooperation with Albania; we also appeal to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to re-consider Albania's membership of the Council of Europe."
"It must be made clear to the Albanian Government that its conduct has been entirely unacceptable."
"It has ridden roughshod over European standards."
"We must also, I think, be entitled to draw conclusions from that."
"We hope President Berisha will do so too, otherwise I foresee a very difficult period in relations between Albania and the European Union."
"We ask the Commission and the Council to make this view clear to President Berisha in unmistakable terms."
"The elections must be held again to rectify the situation which has now arisen."
"A call for dialogue between the parties is to our minds a weak response."
"Mr President, unlike Mr Wiersma I am quite favourably impressed by the answer from the presidency of the Council."
"I think it is very fair to wait and see what developments the next few days bring."
"This Council presidency has clearly pinpointed the sensitive areas and has spoken of the need for a possible partial re-run of the elections in some districts."
"There are indications that the Council may also quite likely be able to give a more detailed commentary at the next plenary part-session as Mr Wiersma asked."
"Of course Albania has been a problem for us all for a long time."
"True, it is a small country, and it is close at hand, but as regards development it is still a country which is a long way down on the list of world powers."
"Naturally that goes hand in hand with a very badly developed public administration."
"Knowing how things have gone with the administration of justice, with the staffing of the judiciary, which was no longer acceptable after the revolution and which has been taken over by half-trained personnel, we realize that in that sphere too there is an enormous leeway to make up, a leeway caused in particular by a very long-standing communist dictatorship, a kind of dictatorship which guarantees under-development rather than progress, which was the illusion at the time."
"We must take that into account."
"When we see how the parties over there stand against one another, government parties and opposition parties of various shades, we can only be surprised about their destructive attitude towards one another."
"We see that the idea of the public interest on which a different view might perhaps be taken, actually hardly exists."
"The experience of an upbringing purely with class interests or else for example purely with ethnic interests, is at present tremendously divisive and leads to chaotic electoral procedures marked by that self-same stark polarization."
"That of course does not mean that we must resign ourselves to it."
"But I should actually be very pleased if something could be done in particular by the Commission, especially so that a study could be made of the situation in Albania and what we could do to promote the rule of law and democracy there."
"I wonder whether it would not be useful for the Commission to give Parliament a policy report with regard to a country like Albania."
"But in that sphere too - we have just had the experience with Croatia -it is particularly necessary for PHARE democracy funds to be used to the best advantage."
"So whatever may possibly be done with regard to Albania, an extra special effort must be made in that respect because it is not only political morals which leave much to be desired with the parties and possibly with other government institutions but also training in citizenship; public morality amongst the citizens themselves requires considerable nourishment from the opportunities and the facilities of the European Union."
"Help with legislation, training and extra contact are all matters in which we can take care that such pitiful things as the abortive or half-abortive elections in Albania can no longer take place."
"I should be glad to hear the Commission's view and possibly those of the Council as well."
"Mr President, many of us have placed great hopes in the new Italian government and in the Italian presidency, and I am sure that those hopes, which are sincerely felt, will not be dashed, and that problems that are arising in the immediate vicinity of the European Union will be approached in an honest and principled manner and with respect for democratic norms."
"In the light of that, and with reference to Albania, I think we can fairly say that the elections there were conducted in an atmosphere of violence that would not be acceptable in Italy or Greece and should not be acceptable for Albania either."
"We are speaking about a country that is being rent apart, about the destabilization of a country that borders on to the Balkan situation, that is next door to Kosovo, to the former republic of Yugoslavia and to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; about a situation that is pregnant with danger."
"I cannot see how the Council, the Commission and this Parliament can do other than what Mr Wiersma of the Socialist Group has proposed, namely to refuse to accept the whole election, to demand new elections right across the country - talk about just a few electoral districts is ridiculous - based on the democratic conditions that we apply in our own countries, and until then to freeze all economic and trade agreements with Albania."
"I think that we owe that to the Albanian people and that it is the only proper way to proceed."
"I am grateful to Mr Fassino for his speech, but in the view of all the observers present - before, during and after the elections, and while the votes were being counted - the most elementary rights of the opposition were flouted. The political parties did not have equality of opportunity in the election campaign, the rights of voters were violated and all sorts of ballot-rigging occurred."
"Examples of all this have already been given in the debate we had in Strasbourg."
"On that occasion we showed - for example in my speech in Strasbourg - that there was no equality of access to the media during the election campaign, and that certain parties and political figures were excluded. In addition, during the elections the electoral commission was made up entirely of spokespersons from the governing party and opposition parties were kept away from the polling stations and the count."
"In many seats a turnout of 100 % was recorded, despite the fact that some electors were prevented from voting. At the same time certain voters, known to be members of the governing party, received multiple ballot papers."
"What I want to say is that there is no question of resolving the matter with just four constituencies. The whole election should be re-run, yet we do not even know who will control the electoral commission, if it carries out a review in all the constituencies."
"That is why I am asking for pressure to be put on Albania to re-run the elections and the Greens will table a motion along those lines at Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I think it is important to speak and thank Under-Secretary Fassino for what he has said, because at a time when Albania, which is effectively part of Europe, should be receiving our particular attention, we need to look at the negative and the positive aspects before we make choices and judgements. So it is important for the political dialogue to be geared precisely to understanding what is going on."
"I agree with what Mr Oostlander said because in my opinion, in our opinion, it is essential to understand exactly what is going on before making decisions, because it seems to us that some observers mentioned negative factors, others positive."
"So we need to begin a careful evaluation, be present on the ground and see if there is some way we can intervene."
"So that is what we think is important, before making any choice, ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I have listened to honourable Members but, if I may say so, I have the impression that honourable Members did not listen to me!"
"I have the impression that people said what they thought about the election in Albania - fair enough - but disregarded what I had said."
"So I would like to take a few minutes to confirm the position I have maintained on behalf of the presidency of the European Union."
"Whether or not there was ballot-rigging is not in question."
"It says in my report - and I said so in my speech - that the elections were marked by widespread and general ballot-rigging, and voting and counting irregularities."
"I did not say we had to accept the Berisha proposal to re-run the elections in four constituencies, in fact I said that considering the 41 appeals entered up to two days ago, and the 97 appeals entered today, the Berisha proposal to re-run elections in four constituencies was totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable."
"Our problem is not to decide whether the elections were properly conducted or not, because I do not think they were properly conducted."
"The problem is to find the most effective and appropriate strategy now to end this crisis."
"I do not want us to be judges as well as politicians. It is not up to us to pass sentence, it is up to us to find a solution to a very serious crisis."
"I think it would be legitimate to say that the best thing to do is re-run the whole election, but the question is how do we get a decision to re-run the election?"
"That is the real question!"
"It is not enough for us to say that the election must be re-run."
"If we say the election must be re-run and one of the parties involved refuses, we are immediately left without a strategy."
"And the crisis gets more and more acute and serious!"
"No! I have in mind a specific formula, the need to identify a setting, a table, for political dialogue involving the participation of all the parties, in government and in opposition, attended by some international figures, if appropriate and if the parties think they should accept that, to find a way out of this crisis together."
"And personally I think one of the things to be discussed in this setting is precisely whether it is possible to agree a re-run of the election."
"But the political problem is not just to form judgements or set up objectives, it is primarily to establish the route to certain objectives."
"The problem in Albania today is precisely that the elections were certainly not properly conducted. The irregularities in the elections have opened up a dramatic rift and it is hard to see how this rift can be closed in the current situation."
"I do not think it is our role to minimize criticism of this election but, at the same time, we must implement effective and necessary strategies to help overcome this crisis."
"So I think it is important to see what happens in the next few days."
"I agree with Mr Wiersma's proposal that we should assess the situation again during the Strasbourg session. I think that by then we will have the information we need to make a final evaluation and take a clearer, more precise and more definite position than we can at the moment."
"Mr President, since Mr Oostlander has addressed himself to the Commission I should like to mention one or two points in answer."
"First of all, in the past few years, and I am speaking of the period from 1991 to 1995, Albania has as a whole received very considerable aid amounting to more than ECU 400 million, and per capita that is very considerable assistance."
"Secondly, there is also a Community project with the Council of Europe to try to launch a real reform of the judicial system from a democratic point of view."
"So that seems to me to be worth while."
"Those are two pieces of information which I wanted to give, but I should like to end with a general political reflection."
"There must naturally be no doubt at all that the further development of relations between Albania and the European Union depends essentially and crucially upon the quality of the democratic process."
"It must be made clear to Albania that naturally the European Union cannot go further with that project unless that distorted situation which now undoubtedly exists is set democratically to rights in one way or another."
"Obviously there must be a pragmatic approach, but there must be no doubt that the democratic process must be substantially correct so that the European Union may continue with its efforts."
"The debate is closed."
"Common transport policy - action programme 1995-2000"
"The next item is the report (A4-0075/96) by Mr Parodi, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions (COM(95)0302 - C4-0351/95) on the common transport policy action programme 1995-2000."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the members of my group, Union for Europe, for giving me two minutes more than I was allocated so that I can explain this report more fully."
"The progress Europe has achieved throughout its history has been founded on the quality and extent of its communications networks."
"Transport demand has experienced virtually uninterrupted growth since the 1970s; with the creation of the single market and the free movement of persons and goods, it is destined to grow even more."
"Without an efficient, accessible and competitive transport system, the European Union as a whole will be unable to pursue its social and economic development in a harmonious and balanced manner."
"It will be impossible to achieve sustainable, non-inflationary and environmentally friendly growth; neither will it be possible to achieve a high level of employment and social protection, or an improved quality of life and higher living standards. Lastly, it will be impossible to achieve greater solidarity and economic and social cohesion."
"To meet this challenge, the Commission submitted a medium and long term action programme focusing on three principal areas: first, improving the quality of the European transport system; secondly, integrating transport policy into the single market, by respecting and applying current standards, especially as regards competition and state aid; thirdly, strengthening the external dimension of the common transport policy."
"On the basis of this programme I have set out an action plan for transport up to 2000, aimed at informing the European Parliament about the problem areas within the transport system and the options for finalizing objectives in any given sector."
"Indeed, the report deals with all the problem areas brought to our attention by the European Commission and all the specific points connected with particular means of transport, and it offers a series of proposals geared to improving the system and mobility generally."
"In particular, the report stresses the need to promote interoperability and intermodality between different means of transport, so that the various components - infrastructure, means of transport, market organization, computer systems - at both national and Community level, are combined to form a single system."
"Here optimum and competitive use of means of transport must be encouraged so as to achieve maximum economic efficiency and minimum environmental impact, especially acoustic and atmospheric, promoting any means of transport with frequently under-utilized or not yet fully exploited capacity."
"Secondly, it emphasizes the need to introduce effective European measures to achieve greater safety throughout the transport system: establishing a permanent safety observatory, applying the existing regulations, harmonizing vocational training, working conditions and hours, applying new technology, making patent medicines available on motorways and, where possible, providing better links with health and emergency services."
"Thirdly, it deals with reducing traffic congestion, particularly for road traffic, and alternative means of access and mobility in the urban areas, where better public transport is a very high priority."
"Fourthly, there is a need to develop a genuine transport culture, promoting educational programmes in schools on the use of means of transport, safety and respect for the rules."
"I think this report represents a firm and precise starting point for the future of transport."
"In that respect it links with the reports recently produced by the Committee on Transport and Tourism: the Piecyk report on the trans-European networks, the Farassino report on the driving licence, the Tamino report on combined transport, the Jarzembowski report on inspection of ships in ports, and so on."
"Fifthly, and in my view very important, there is the possible spin-off for increased employment and new job opportunities resulting from more information and integration between the various regions, the likely upward trends in tourism and participation in the protection of an environment which embodies the culture and history of the European Union."
"In fact, this report - which I do not consider mine but rather the product of lengthy discussion between all the members of the Committee on Transport - indicates the problems but also the solutions to the many emergencies and needs which face citizens of the Union every day."
"Actually it is a report about major harmonization of the infrastructure of our European Union, about priority political choices, rules and conduct in the area of transport."
"It is now up to the Commission to take this report forward by drawing up specific measures, with special reference to the financial implications, and a timetable for carrying them out, so that from the Baltic to the Mediterranean an accessible integrated safe and efficient communications system can be developed and become a reality."
"Madam President the objectives of this action programme must be to offer basic mobility to all citizens without damaging nature and the environment."
"From this definition it is clear that our current transport policies are unsustainable and need a radical shift in direction."
"Yet this communication adopts a business-asusual approach, regardless of the dangers of current trends."
"The Environment Committee is particularly concerned about the impact of road transport on the environment."
"At present, cars and lorries are responsible for about a quarter of the European Union's CO2 emissions."
"With the projected increase in transport on the roads, this large figure is likely to double by the year 2010, making a mockery of our EU commitment to stabilize CO2 levels and revealing our failure to meet the real targets."
"Clearly what is needed are EU-wide targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the transport sector."
"To be fair, the Commission does talk about the necessary shift of traffic from the roads."
"But integrating the environment into transport policy must be more consistent and more focused."
"Principles already in place, like the polluter-pays and precautionary principles must be part of all transport legislation."
"One way to ensure such integration could be to annex an environmental impact sheet to all new transport proposals outlining what environmental problems are at stake and what actions can be taken to solve them."
"All the Commission has for the period 1997-2000 in this action programme are three proposals on air transport and one on maritime transport."
"This neglects the fact that the impact of road transport on the environment is one of the most serious problems being faced by the European Union and it will get worse if nothing is done."
"However, the planned environment proposals are very welcome, as are the recently published Green Papers on the citizens' network and the internalization of external costs."
"The latter proposal, in particular, should make it possible for less polluting forms of transport to compete on a more equal footing with polluting ones."
"Radical and far-sighted policies are urgently needed in this sector and unfortunately there are not too many signs of those in this communication."
"My committee therefore gives it qualified support."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, may I express our gratification that the proposals made by the Committee on Budgets are reflected in the present resolution."
"The main observations we made were that the financial programming envisaged by the Commission is purely indicative and that at the time of its adoption the Financial Perspective contained no provision for the funding of trans-European networks or of structural improvement measures in inland waterway transport."
"We therefore call on the Commission to submit a proposal amending this Financial Perspective, and we welcome the fact that the Council shares Parliament's view that a revision of the Financial Perspective is necessary to ensure the financing of the networks."
"We welcome Parliament's endorsement of the 14 priorities, because the trans-European networks naturally have two key functions."
"First of all, the Commission believes - and we agree - that they are an important aspect of employment policy."
"Secondly, they should help to reinforce Europe's appeal as a business location."
"So it is important that we concentrate on these and do not dissipate our energies."
"As an Austrian I welcome the fact that these 14 projects include the Alpine crossing, namely the Brenner Tunnel and its feeder lines, because we shall be confronted in 2004, as a result of the Swiss people's petition, with a virtual ban on road haulage traffic through Switzerland, which has already been severely curtailed by the introduction of a 28-tonne weight limit."
"I should also like to mention the need to win over the Council for a replenishment of the networks budget within the limits of the own-resources ceiling which will enter into force after ratification by the Netherlands, so that we can proceed quickly to the actual implementation of these important projects."
"The second thing I welcome as an Austrian is the plan to extend the envisaged high-speed Paris-Munich rail link to Vienna."
"I am delighted at that, not only for my native city of Vienna but also because I believe that it is important to the Union as a whole that we should prepare the way for links with the East, with those associated states that will accede to full membership in due course; it is, of course, vital to them that the infrastructure is already being planned with their accession in mind."
"Parliament should therefore be absolutely rigorous - and I hope that the Commission will support us here - in ensuring that the required funds are made available so that the trans-European networks really can play their part in guaranteeing jobs and in securing Europe's long-term future as a business location."
"Madam President, I should like to say, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy that the action programme presented by the Commission constitutes, in our view, an essential framework-programme which is important for achieving the objectives and priorities of the white paper on the future development of the common transport policy. We think, however, that it will be desirable to make a more specific approach with the inclusion of a comprehensive statistical background which in our opinion is inadequate."
"As regards the financing of the trans-European transport networks, its importance is universally recognized by us all."
"The networks are an essential feature of the realization of the internal market."
"Their impact on employment and the social problems with which we contend every day are taking on a decisive importance."
"From this point of view we feel that the instruments and financial resources necessary for giving specific expression to these objectives must be substantially increased or we risk falling irrecoverably short of the objectives we are proposing to achieve."
"We would pinpoint in particular an increase in the resources for infrastructures and we think also that special attention should be given to encouraging partnerships in the public and private sectors so that we may overcome the difficulties known to us all."
"In the field of safety let us not forget to say that special efforts must be made to achieve a high safety standard which must be valid throughout the European Union and hence we think also that an observatory to keep track of these problems might be a particularly important instrument."
"As regards the internalization of external costs, that is, in our opinion a matter of high priority."
"The ideas outlined in the green paper on this subject show clearly what possibilities there are and they must be followed by concrete measures at the appropriate levels as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I will concentrate on social aspects of this report."
"Like the previous speakers, our committee is very concerned about the very cautious nature of the report, which was not wide-ranging enough taking into consideration that the common transport policy is very important for the Union."
"We are particularly concerned about working time and how it affects the transport sector."
"We were promised earlier last year by Commissioner Flynn that he would bring forward proposals to cover the excluded sector dealing with pilots' hours and those other aspects of transport where the workers were not covered by the original working time directive."
"That was a long time ago, in fact it was 18 months ago Mr Flynn first promised us this."
"He promised us it about January 1995 and we are now in June 1996."
"Our committee now feel that it is time that the Commission galvanizes us into action in this area."
"We are also concerned about the TENs which other people have mentioned."
"We are worried about the fact that the Edinburgh facility, the economic investment fund that was established in Edinburgh, has remained a dead letter."
"This has impeded transport development, particularly infrastructure development schemes such as the west coast line in the United Kingdom and the electrified line into Glasgow airport."
"Many of the other good ferry services we could have linking cross- Channel states of the Community have remained another dead letter because there has been no funding."
"It is important that the Commission put some pressure on the Council to ensure there is adequate funding in this area of infrastructure."
"Transport is very important for the European Union, to make sure that there is genuine freedom of movement and people and goods can go freely about the Union."
"The best way to do that is by good transport links."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this White Paper is the logical sequel to the report by our former Italian colleague Mr Porrazzini on the future development of the common transport policy as a framework for sustainable mobility."
"We welcome the fact that this effectively represents a return to an old demand made by the European Parliament for a multiannual legislative framework with a timetable and priorities, and I believe that an equally favourable judgement can be passed on the treatment of the transport sector as an integrated unit, in other words on the fact that the various modes of transport are viewed in a consolidated manner, from a global perspective."
"But we also have considerable deficits."
"I shall try to focus again on something my honourable friend Mr McMahon mentioned in passing in the opinion he drafted for the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment."
"We expect the relationship between harmonization and liberalization, which is still out of balance, to be kept under constant review."
"I intend to emphasize very clearly at every opportunity that our pleas to this effect should be addressed primarily to the Council rather than the Commission."
"We do, however, ask the Commission for its continued support in this matter."
"Our social standards are still not safeguarded; indeed, social standards are slipping, are constantly being forced downward."
"We need consultations; we need the development of consultative mechanisms so that management and labour can come up with effective legislative solutions."
"That demand, as Commissioner Van Miert will recall, was very clearly articulated at the conference on Crete in 1994, where we not only related it to the interior of the European Union but also to our dealings with the states of central and eastern Europe, which had newly achieved their independence and were in the process of developing their own structures."
"Only yesterday the relations of the European Union with the states of central and eastern Europe were under discussion when we in the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the steering committee accompanying the pan-European transport conferences welcomed a group from 17 different countries to Brussels, among whom were the parliamentary representatives of the transport committees that have been established and appointed in those countries."
"The results of these discussions will naturally be fed into the preparatory phase, as well as into the agenda itself, of the third Pan-European Transport Conference, due to take place in Helsinki in 1997."
"I may say that my honourable colleague Mr Parodi has, of course, already taken part in this preparation in his capacity as rapporteur and that the main components of this highly complex report - which could not be otherwise, given the White Paper that has been presented, for it had to address an extremely wide diversity of subjects - will be incorporated into the agenda for this third Transport Conference in Helsinki."
"It is a good basis."
"Safety problems and the quest for environmentally acceptable solutions are actually a matter for all transport operators."
"I touched briefly on external relations, and I should like to add something to that."
"I consider it very important that the Commission should be given mandates to represent the European Union in negotiations with third countries on transport matters and that this should be done more quickly than has hitherto been the case."
"In particular, of course, I am thinking of air transport negotiations with the United States, for which I was appointed rapporteur."
"That must be further expanded, for it is our only means of really guaranteeing that individual Member States of the European Union will no longer be played off against each other with adverse results, as has happened in the past."
"Wherever possible, then, we want to move away very rapidly from these bilateral structures and to see the Commission sit down much sooner at the negotiating table to look after the interests of the entire European Union."
"Our honourable colleague Mr König referred to the trans-European networks."
"Mr König, we have made far less progress in this area than you seemed to suggest."
"Another meeting of the Conciliation Committee is currently taking place between delegations from Parliament and the Council."
"The Council has scarcely budged, and at the moment the whole scheme is tending to look like a dead letter."
"I should very much regret that, but the Council has to realize that there are powers of codecision involved here; it has evidently not understood that yet."
"But over and above the 14 projects, which we in Parliament certainly support, we wish to have an additional list of priority projects."
"Going beyond the work of the Conciliation Committee, we naturally also want to develop a financial basis at long last."
"On that we are agreed."
"One of the problems at the moment is the siege mentality adopted by the Council."
"The further development of a transport policy for the whole of Europe is being curbed rather than encouraged by the Council."
"Without Parliament and the Commission the situation would indeed be bleak!"
"I believe we can only support and endorse what the President of the Commission, Mr Santer, said this afternoon about the need for us to develop a more solid financial basis."
"We require investments totalling hundreds of billions, but only a ludicrous few hundred million ecus are earmarked in our European budget."
"So we must continue to assume that these tasks will primarily be undertaken by the Member States."
"Mr Parodi's report marks an important step in the series of reports on this subject and in the ongoing development of a pan-European transport policy."
"Madam President, the European People's Party welcomes the action programme from the Commission and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission for its initiative and to congratulate our own rapporteur, Mr Parodi, on his report."
"I would like this evening to highlight one or two issues, in particular, the need to use the action programme to complete the single market and to base the action programme on safety and competition, and enhanced consumer choice."
"In relation to sea transport, I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to the request that we take positive measures to promote the European fleet, including the setting up of the Euros register."
"I would also urge that the action programme take in those measures to enhance ferry safety, allowing landbased infrastructures for satellite systems enabling a rapid response when vessels run into difficulty."
"This would enable vessels to enter a harbour to find a safe haven and would strengthen port-state and flag-state control and the designation, where appropriate, of sensitive areas."
"In the field of railways, we would like to see a better development of the European railways."
"We call specifically for the railway market to be opened up to new, private railway companies, thereby enhancing consumer choice."
"Turning to safety and the fitting of seat belts, we would emphasize especially the importance of fitting threepoint seat belts on coaches and buses, as well as roll-over bars on coaches and mini-buses."
"In the field of air transport, it is particularly important to have a unified system of air traffic control."
"We should bring to an end state aids to airlines and particularly call on Commissioner Van Miert to insist on the one-time, last-time principle being applied to state aids in the airline industry."
"In paragraph 56, we believe that the rapporteur meant to push for an external relations policy for air transport and I hope that he can support our amendment along those lines."
"As other speakers have mentioned, we support the TENs enabling a greater use of public and private partnerships and an imaginative approach to financing such schemes."
"On a personal note, could I conclude by saying the Commission's proposals reflect in my view what is already happening in the United Kingdom in the provision of transport services by road, rail, air and sea, as well as combined transport."
"I hope the House will join me in agreeing that Britain is leading the way in Europe, not least in ensuring a level playing field with the removal of state aids but also the fitting of seat belts in coaches and mini-buses and safety at sea."
"We in the European People's Party commend the report to the House, we congratulate the rapporteur and thank the Commission for this initiative."
"Madam President, I would like to compliment Mr Parodi, not just out of politeness but sincerely and enthusiastically, because I think he has provided those of us who want to go to the very end of the road to integration and rationalization of transport with a sure, definite and consistent map. It is consistent with the past, as Mr Lüttge has reminded us, but I think it also projects the new paths for the future."
"From the many stimuli it offers, I choose one, the one the rapporteur placed, perhaps not deliberately, at the end of his own presentation: finance."
"Carrying out projects is fine and exciting, but how can that be done without the necessary funds?"
"There are already grounds for satisfaction about the approach to the project in the preamble, but there is also concern because it stands on feet of clay."
"This concern arises from two figures: the funding requirement for the trans-European networks in the period 1994-99, as set out in the Delors White Paper, is ECU 200 billion, but the resources earmarked for these networks for the same period amount to ECU 1, 698 million."
"The European citizen can hardly fail to be a little confused when presented with promises impossible to keep."
"That is why the Commission, Parliament and the Council must make it clear how the money will be found and how the famous partnership, claimed as the definitive answer, is going to be constructed."
"Point 87 of the motion for a resolution proposes an innovation, not exactly original but very interesting, involving the creation of new stimuli and especially obligations on the European Union, to provide incentives for participation by the private sector."
"But here caution is necessary: in fact, after supporting the creation of Eurobonds in point 1 of its conclusions, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment also calls for a certain responsibility."
"I remember Commissioner Kinnock telling us one day to convince our citizens that participating in the creation of these networks is a bargain."
"Well, I think we need to look at this invitation again with great realism and great honesty, and first set ourselves definite, clear and transparent guidelines."
"Madam President, I am a little disappointed in both the Commission action programme and the report."
"There are a few things left out of the Commission's action programme."
"I think the association with environment policy is incomplete and in addition where security for example is concerned I think the response to the security problems on road transport and also on air transport does not go far enough."
"Where the environment is concerned I cannot find even a reference to the aims of CO2 reduction as the European institutions themselves have previously laid them down."
"How can you maintain now that you are trying to create a sustainable mobility if in an action programme like this you do not even refer to aims of that kind and indicate how they must be achieved."
"Mr Parodi's report touches upon it but unfortunately the report has become so convoluted, such a long string of demands and wishes that we can no longer pick out the priorities."
"That is a very great pity because then it cannot be seen just where Parliament's main criticisms of this action programme lie."
"So it will not surprise you that we as a Group have tabled a number of amendments to see whether we cannot point it here and there more in the direction of a better environment policy and that means for example that we think that with air transport, as has moreover been said by the Council of Environment Ministers and as was mentioned by the Commission in its report on excise duties that air transport must now finally be subject to indirect taxes, VAT and excise duties."
"Madam President, the Commission's action programme is so general and comprehensive that there is little in it with which I can disagree."
"That is the strength, but also the weakness, of this document."
"Too many general statements with very little commitment and too few specific priorities."
"Admittedly the problems of transport are complex and very diverse."
"In all fields of policy numerous legitimate aspirations need to be expressed, but that must not prevent priority choices being made or some parameters being drawn."
"The Parodi report rightly mentions this."
"So after the pan-European transport conference in Helsinki next year the Commission will have to draw up a new action programme and lay down clearer priorities."
"In that connection I should like to point out three areas for attention."
"In the first place the enlargement of the Union which will result. we expect, in a great increase in traffic."
"The Union must address itself to that as a priority in collaboration with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Secondly, with a view to the enlargement and because of the increasing traffic within the Union itself, the proportion of transport by rail and water must be considerably increased."
"Inland navigation, coast-wise trade and rail will have to acquire a much stronger market position."
"Measures for discouraging goods and passenger transport by road including the charging of external costs are insufficient where there is no good alternative."
"Opening up the railway market and continuing construction of the trans-European networks are therefore necessary."
"Thirdly, in view of the strong growth of air transport the Union will have to do its best to arrange taxation of aircraft fuel on a world scale."
"Finally Mr Parodi is to be congratulated on the extensive piece of work he has put before us."
"I am afraid, however, that there is a risk that sight will again be lost of the priorities since the report is so extensive and so complete."
"Madam President, in its communication on the Common Transport Policy Action Programme for 1995-2000 the Commission has certainly heralded a step towards a comprehensive transport policy strategy."
"The concentration on four lines of action is indicative of the desire to take an integrated approach to transport legislation."
"What makes this all the more gratifying is that Members who serve on the competent parliamentary committee sometimes feel they are dealing with a motley assortment of unconnected legislative bills."
"Transport, and this can never be repeated too often, cannot be compartmentalized into separate modes."
"It must always be seen in its entirety and subordinated to overriding strategic aims, such as the reduction of environmental pollution."
"These remarks assume particular significance if we look at the social dimension and the question of working hours."
"Each of us knows that compliance with legally prescribed driving and rest periods is patchy."
"This not only harms and endangers the drivers in question but also involves constant subsidization of an environmentally detrimental form of transport."
"The legal remedies available to us at European level appear modest when compared with the powers available under classic competition law and with those vested in DirectorateGeneral VI."
"The communication from the Commission envisages the line of action entitled 'taking account of the social dimension' as amounting only to continued consultation of management and labour."
"However, to rebuke the Commissioner for such inadequacies is to miss the point, for the real problem is that the Member States are continuing to hide behind the mask of subsidiarity."
"But the consequences of this policy - or, to be more precise, this lack of policy - affect the whole internal market and distort competition between modes of transport."
"And so in conclusion I wish to voice my doubts as to whether the Commission can ever achieve the aim it has formulated in the White Paper by environmentally compatible means."
"Madam President, in many respects the report which we are currently debating is a positive document which takes the offensive."
"It is necessary if we are to solve Europe's traffic problems in the future, not least in view of the extensive enlargement process which lies ahead."
"We also therefore have reason to be thankful to the rapporteur, Mr Parodi, for the work he has done."
"One major challenge still faces us, however, and that is to find an appropriate way of combining increased traffic with a better environment."
"The UN has declared today World Environment Day."
"This debate and the decision we are about to take should reflect this fact."
"The environment is the biggest issue facing mankind as we approach the next millennium."
"Nothing can be more important for us than to solve the environment's various problems."
"In the same way as peace was the great vision when the EU was first established, and still is of course, the challenge of solving Europe's environmental problems should, as the 21st century draws near, be the vision which inspires all of us who are involved in some way in the European political arena."
"Road transport is indisputably to blame for many of the different problems affecting the environment."
"I believe that it is possible to say this and at the same time still understand two things, first that the number of cars will in fact continue to grow in EU countries because this is quite simply seen by the greatest majority of people as the best way of getting about, and second that we will not solve the environment's problem with cars by simply imposing punitive taxes on car drivers the whole time."
"In several countries the only effect this is having is to ensure that nobody can afford to buy new, more environmentally friendly cars."
"As a result the cars in circulation are simply getting older and older as time goes by - and from the environmental point of view, worse and worse."
"This is nevertheless the policy we are pursuing in a great many countries today."
"Instead, it is now time for the EU to formulate the long-term view that the negative environmental effects of carownership should be eliminated as one element in the process of solving Europe's environmental problems."
"This assumes that we have the courage to establish the objective and formulate the requirement that in the future cars will be powered by something other than today's internal combustion engine."
"It will presumably be battery power or some form of hybrid engine which will have to be made available commercially instead."
"This in turn presupposes purposeful research to enable the various problems to be solved."
"What we really need today is to direct all action towards a time when the problems will have been solved."
"If we allow the European motor industry to gear itself to this and also make available the necessary resources for research, I am convinced that this will work."
"It would, Madam President, be one of the best investments we could make for the next generation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, within the common transport policy the environmental aspect, as it relates to nature and the affected populations, should be accorded the same priority as the aim of improving the competitiveness of the entire European economy."
"It seems to me that the development of areas with weak infrastructures is being overemphasized at the expense of the effort to solve the acute environmental problems in heavily congested areas, problems which stem mainly from transit traffic, especially in the Alps."
"For this reason too, as the Committee on Budgets suggested, the 14 top-priority projects for trans-European transport networks should be placed in order of urgency and common financing secured for them where more than one Member State is involved and the projects are in the general European interest."
"It should also be mentioned in this context that it is absolutely essential to secure pan-European funding as soon as possible for the Brenner tunnel and its feeder lines."
"The three participating countries - Austria, Germany and Italy - cannot raise this money alone."
"The stoicism of the people living in this part of the Alps has limits that must not go on being transgressed indefinitely."
"And this is precisely where I agree with the rapporteur when he says that not only the national benefit of transEuropean infrastructural projects for the individual Member States should be taken into account but also the net benefit to the Union as a whole."
"The realization of the Brenner tunnel project in particular will not only mean economic and ecological progress for the directly affected regions but will be of enormous benefit to the entire Union."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on a fine report."
"The trans-European networks are certainly extremely important to the future of the European Union, especially to peripheral areas of that Union, and I want to deal with that in more detail in my speech here this evening."
"Good infrastructure within the European Union is important and air and sea links are imperative."
"In Northern Ireland we totally depend on the links from our ports to the mainland of the United Kingdom."
"All our imports and our exports depend on an efficient roll-on, roll-off infrastructure."
"Sea transport is our road and bridge to mainland United Kingdom and further to mainland continental Europe."
"We must not be disenfranchised by unfair support to other parts of the European Union and to other Member States through Cohesion Fund support, as is happening at the moment."
"I welcome the inclusion of seat-belts because this is a very necessary safety measure for buses and coaches within the European Union."
"When we speak of harmonisation of fuel and vehicle taxes, I have some concern."
"I believe we must have a level playing field but we must harmonise at a realistic level."
"Flags of convenience in our shipping industry have haunted us for years and we have never achieved a solution."
"This is a very serious problem and it will not disappear."
"We have not been prepared to date to face up to the consequences of increased safety on our sea routes."
"Finally, I welcome the fact that Mr Van Miert is the Commissioner here this evening."
"Many years ago, when he had the responsibility for transport, I led a deputation of Westminster MPs to see him."
"When we arrived at his office it was found that Northern Ireland did not even exist."
"There were no links from Northern Ireland to mainland United Kingdom and Europe."
"I would like to play tribute to him tonight because after our visit to him, he ensured that we had links from Belfast and Larne and the other ports."
"I am very grateful to him for that and I have no doubt the Commission will continue to pay heed to the necessity and the importance for Northern Ireland of these links."
"Madam President, this is indeed an opportunity for me to return for a short time to my old love, because, as has rightly been said, in my first term of office as a member of the Commission I did in fact have to concern myself with transport policy and I remember that that was a period when we were able to make certain progress."
"But let me start by sincerely congratulating Mr Parodi and the Committee on Transport and other committees which have collaborated in this report on the Commission's action programme."
"It has become a very extensive document which demonstrates the thoroughness with which not only the rapporteur but also other members both in the Committee on Transport and other committees of Parliament have studied the Commission's programme."
"The report, then, contains a wealth of useful suggestions and constructive criticisms which the Commission will naturally take into account in its deliberations."
"I must of course point out that not all objectives can be realized in the short term and that the development of the Community transport policy is a long-term operation."
"Moreover we know from experience that at one time Parliament itself had to go to the Court of Justice to get things moving."
"Since then we have certainly been able to achieve something, but the momentum which we had seven or eight years ago seems today unfortunately to have been rather lost."
"Inevitably it is impossible within the compass of this short debate here to go into each separate suggestion, observation or criticism in Mr Parodi's report."
"The action programme was set up in accordance with an endeavour by both Parliament and the Council to set up a multiannual legislative framework programme for transport."
"That endeavour was in turn a result of the discussions on the 1992 Commission white paper on the future development of the Community transport policy."
"As you know, that was the period for which I still had some responsibility."
"You will still remember that a very interesting report on the subject was drawn up by Mr Porrazzini."
"We have thus come back to this endeavour and our starting point was to give a concise summary of the programmes we planned for the period up to 2000, and when I say we, it was in the first place my colleague Mr Kinnock who took the responsibility for that and who is sorry he cannot be here this evening, but you will perhaps excuse him if I take his place."
"In setting up the action programme the Commission's intention is simply to present a number of possible actions."
"It is a misunderstanding to think of it as a global strategic approach; it is only a list of the initiatives which may be adopted or which the Commission thinks may be presented in the years ahead."
"The parameters for the policy and strategy were in fact already laid down in the white paper."
"It is true that the main areas of our activity are sketched out in greater detail in the action programme for the sake of clarity."
"The long list of requirements in Parliament's report must not let us lose sight of the fact that Parliament and the Commission have increasingly agreed on transport policy and the actions to be undertaken."
"I have noticed that too in most meetings; actually we are not so far apart."
"It is more a matter of appreciation, of emphasis."
"It seems to us impossible to discuss further in the framework of this debate all questions noted in the report."
"I should like to refer to various points made, but unfortunately we do not have the time."
"So I shall be very brief, but there are individual points which must be mentioned."
"Thus the motion for a resolution asks for the drafting of a whole series of documents, an amended action programme by the autumn of 1997, every two years, starting in summer 1998, a comprehensive planning and implementation document, another white paper in 2000, a report about the suitability of the Maastricht Treaty as the basis of a new Community transport policy - all this on top of our annual programme of legislation."
"That is naturally a serious message from Parliament but I should like to ask you and urge you to preserve some sense of reality, we cannot go on piling up reports and programmes."
"We must also try to be practical and to move ahead."
"The report also repeats the idea, long held within Parliament, that our general policy and our specific proposals must be based on a better statistical foundation."
"Naturally we agree, but you know how hard it is to get reliable material from the various Member States."
"In some sectors the position is better."
"I am thinking amongst other things of sea and air transport, and as that material becomes available it will naturally be used by the Commission."
"Then I should like to make an observation or a reflection with regard to various critical asides on the social and employment aspects of transport policy."
"Naturally we must be concerned about that, but there are present in this Assembly people who know very well that the Commission has tried over and over again, in the past too, to put forward concomitant measures, harmonization measures, specific social measures with regard to the liberalization policy which needs to be followed."
"But unfortunately we have had to recognize that on that plane too the willingness of the Council of Ministers and a number of governments was minimal."
"May I remind you that years ago the Commission took the initiative of trying to harmonize flying time and rest time for pilots, but we came back empty-handed."
"I could give you other examples, so I must say that it is not for lack of trying on the part of the Commission or lack of initiatives, but normally because the Council has not had the political will to make concrete progress."
"Then I should like to touch on what Mr Lüttge said and I should like to sing his praises to some extent because he is one of the foremost originators of pan-European thinking at this time."
"I remember our first conference in Prague when not only we from the European Union but also the countries of Central and Eastern Europe met together and we discussed for the first time what was necessary for trying to build bridges over all the obstacles from the past."
"But unfortunately that too is a long time ago."
"We should have been able to do a great deal more if only we had had the necessary budgetary resources put at our disposal to support specific projects."
"But we must keep hammering away at it."
"Naturally the position is the same with the trans-European networks."
"Here I assume that no-one in this Parliament can reproach the Commission with not making the necessary efforts."
"Here too moreover I should like to sing Parliament's praises."
"I remember, and this is what I should like to say to Mr König amongst other things, because he was not yet in Parliament, but the first financial resources we received for doing something with infrastructural works came from Parliament against the Council's wishes."
"That was how we received our first funds."
"Parliament together with the Commission have always had to fight the Council to get the money needed."
"With the prospect of the summit meeting of the European Council at Florence you know how hard the Commission and its President in particular will be hammering that point home again."
"I can only express the hope that mad cow disease will not put a spoke in the wheel again to delay the matter for us once again."
"I should like to conclude with that, ladies and gentlemen."
"Certainly there would be other things to say, but I think I can leave it at that."
"I should like to thank all those who have spoken for their contribution, and once more, on behalf of Neil Kinnock, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Driving licences"
"The next item is the recommendation for the second reading (A4-0123/96) on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position established by the Council (C4-0150/96-95/0109(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Directive amending Directive 91/439/EEC on driving licences (rapporteur: Mr Farassino)."
"Mr President, this directive can be summarized in a few words."
"At first reading, the European Parliament approved the Commission proposal of 16 January 1995 on the alternative plastic credit card model driving licence, making eight amendments."
"They were important amendments, and I shall mention only the most important three. The first saw the need to devise a future penalty points system; another important amendment related to the option, at the discretion of the Member States, to include on the licence medical information vital to the health of the holder or willingness to donate organs; thirdly there was the obligation on Member States to refrain from levying any annual tax on the licence; the only charge should be the actual cost of issue."
"In the light of the European Parliament's opinion, the Commission altered its initial proposal, taking over the amendments on the inclusion of colours and markings on page one, and the option to show life-saving medical data or the holder's willingness to donate organs."
"The Transport Council of 7 December 1995 agreed on the common position, which was finalized on 26 February 1996."
"Its main points are as follows: no steps are to be taken at European level to incorporate microchips into the licence for the moment, but an expert working party is to study the repercussions of their introduction and all the security and confidentiality aspects; removal of the planned ten-year validity limit on the credit card driving licence - and this is absurd in my view, because a driving licence cannot be issued at 18 and remain valid till death with the same photograph."
"Other specific optional headings have been introduced for the holder's identification number if any and if different from the driving licence number, and for further information which a host Member State might wish to add at a later stage to a licence issued by another Member State."
"Lastly, a new heading has been inserted, number 14 on page 2, to enable an issuing Member State to enter administrative information concerning a licence, for instance, the date the holder passed the driving test, or road safety."
"At the request of the holder, this new heading could also contain information not connected with the licence, like blood group, willingness to donate organs, holder's nationality, etcetera."
"The scheduled date of entry into force of the directive remains 1 July 1996."
"In substance, the Council has accepted three of the European Parliament's eight first reading amendments."
"The rapporteur is therefore proposing not only to retable some of the amendments from the first reading, but also to alter some passages where the Council has changed the initial proposal."
"First, Amendment No 1 reinstates amongst the aims and advantages of the new credit card model driving licence the references to flexibility of use, increased security and reduced risk of forgery. Amendment No 2 makes it compulsory again to mention the Member State issuing the licence, which the Council felt should be optional."
"Amendment No 3 merely slims down the Council's proposal by removing the first part."
"At this point I would also ask the session officers to note of the fact that a mistake must have been made in copying the amendment, which should read: ' The words 'Driving Licence' in all the Community languages shall be printed in pink to form the background of the licence' ."
"Mr President, the proposal to introduce a European driving licence in the form of a plastic card of credit-card dimensions is basically a sensible and practical idea for all concerned."
"The licence card is actually intended to facilitate the free movement of European citizens and to promote the mutual recognition of driving licences."
"But after examining the Council's common position, I cannot help thinking that the Council wants to take systematic action to prevent any progress towards a stronger common identity within the European Union."
"Almost every article contains one of the words optional and non-compulsory ."
"These words, though quite innocuous in themselves, nevertheless mean that it is being left to the discretion of each Member State to do what it wants when it wants."
"A directive, however, is meant to establish the framework for a national law, and such a framework should not be turned into an elasticated stretch cover by means of the words optional and non-compulsory ."
"The common position is indeed a prime example of the Council's inability to arrive at proper joint decisions."
"Only when it comes to disregarding the proposals of Parliament does the Council seem able to draw on vast reserves of solidarity."
"The Commission's proposal for the optional - and I emphasize optional - incorporation of a microchip into the card was also rejected and has been replaced by a new space on the card."
"The basis of the proposal for the credit-card model, however, was the potential controlled use of future information technology."
"Through its decision the Council has now brought more bureaucracy and expenditure upon itself, because once the conditions for the introduction of the microchips have been negotiated, the new driving licences will have to be exchanged again."
"Strangely enough, the Council, and above all the German Minister of Transport, had rejected ten-year validity in favour of unrestricted validity with a view to saving time and money."
"I wonder how mutual recognition is meant to work in Europe on this basis."
"If, for example, a German with a card that is valid indefinitely moves to a country of the EU in which a time limit applies, no-one is going to pretend to me that the German licence will be recognized."
"The problem must be resolved, even if we have to wait until an action for discrimination is brought before the European Court of Justice."
"I take the view that the term 'European driving licence' is a case of fraudulent misrepresentation."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism has adopted four amendments for the second reading."
"My group will support them."
"The directive, as we know, is due to enter into force on the first of July this year."
"We in Parliament do not wish any further delays, for the introduction of the credit-card format is already being used as an excuse, by the German Government for example, for not implementing the 1991 Directive by the prescribed date."
"Its stated intention is to wait until the plastic card is introduced."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal that the Member States be given the opportunity to introduce a model Community driving licence on 1 July 1996 in the form of a 'credit card' -type document as an alternative to the paper version."
"First of all, such a document offers the basis for national driving licences that are comprehensible and recognized throughout Europe, which means greater security for licence-holders."
"Secondly, it facilitates any spot-checks that may be necessary and thereby enhances road safety."
"Thirdly, it guarantees greater flexibility of use while reducing the risk of licence forgery."
"Fourthly, it satisfies the desire of many people nowadays for effectiveness and efficiency and for practicality and flexibility in the use of things and in dealings with authorities and institutions."
"That is precisely why I expect many Member States to take the opportunity to introduce this type of model driving licence as quickly as possible, even though it is unfortunately not compulsory."
"I should like to congratulate the Council on its decision to side with Parliament in opposing the Commission proposal to limit the validity of the licence to ten years."
"This decision gives user states the chance to decide themselves on the term of validity of the driving licence, which, though drawn up in accordance with the EU model, is still a national licence."
"At the same time, the Group of the European People's Party not only favours a far longer term but actually supports unlimited validity."
"This would help to save money and to minimize bureaucracy."
"The introduction of a separate space in which the issuing country may make optional entries is in line with the wishes of Parliament."
"The utmost care must be taken, however, with medical data in particular, in other words details of blood group, allergies and suchlike and indication of willingness to donate organs, to ensure that there is also a separate written statement of consent by the licence-holder."
"The option of including bar codes and national symbols - which, of course, must not impair comprehensibility and mutual recognition - accords with the legitimate interests of the Member States."
"Let us hope that this also contributes to speedy implementation."
"I propose that we support Mr Farassino and his report."
"Mr President, we have to be strict about not allowing Member States to collect tax on driving licences annually."
"I also support Mr Farassino in urging that a reference to the flexible use of driving licences and to the prevention of forgery should be included in the directive."
"It would also be sensible to include information on the driving licence about consent for organ donation."
"I failed completely to understand why a centralized monitoring system in the form of a register of penalty points should be introduced in connection with driving licences."
"Restricting the duration of licences to ten years would also increase bureaucracy unnecessarily."
"The requirement laid down in the directive that lorry drivers who wear glasses should lose their licence after 1 July has caused great amazement among the Finns."
"The wearing of glasses or contact lenses with a strength of +/-4 does not in any way hinder their driving."
"There are proportionally more long-sighted people working as professional drivers than in any other profession."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner how this error will be rectified."
"Parliament will have to request immediate negotiations between the bodies concerned in order to correct the directive in this respect."
"Mr President, with the prospect of more people moving around the European Union more freely, my Group and I welcome the harmonisation of driving licences."
"This proposal from the Commission, with the sensible amendments from the rapporteur, will take the harmonisation process forward by requiring a common code system for conditions under which any driver is authorised to use a vehicle."
"In the European Union we have already had mutual recognition of driving licences for some time now."
"But that has not meant that every police officer in every Member State inspecting those licences fully understands what is communicated or written on them."
"The new licences will make certain that police officers will be able in the future to appreciate and understand the information contained in them."
"The driving licences are certainly going to be of value to road safety."
"They will certainly enhance the feeling of the right of movement by EU citizens and they will also certainly benefit disabled drivers."
"The licence also contains a micro-chip and it is this that has caused the greatest debate among the Members."
"As well as codifying conditions under which the owner can drive, the micro-chip could store useful information as suggested already concerning the willingness to donate organs, as well as medical requirements and needs of the driver himself."
"I can understand and appreciate the fear that might be felt among certain people that this card would develop into an ID card, via the back door."
"To offset that danger, the rapporteur and the Commission have agreed to a special committee, which will examine the confidentiality and security implications of the micro-chip."
"In the meantime, I certainly welcome the rapporteur's report with the hope that the Commission will give that report their full support."
"I also look forward to more people, even from the island of the United Kingdom who have the habit of driving on the wrong side of the road, driving even further on the continent of Europe."
"Mr President, the common position of the Council on the amendment of the Directive on driving licences has already taken account of major proposals made by the European Parliament, which pleases us, although we should have welcomed the replacement of some discretionary clauses by peremptory clauses."
"So let us regard this proposal as a first step in the right direction, though not perhaps the last."
"But driving licences are also part of our citizens' everyday lives."
"That is why it is important in our eyes that, besides being an instrument of harmonization, driving licences should also be a means of improving control and security, that they should perhaps also contain information which might even make the difference between life and death in critical situations."
"We therefore hope that all the Member States will agree on a sound compromise between data protection and the sort of information that contributes to safety in general as well as to the safety of the individual."
"It does seem to me, however, that the most important of the amendments is the fourth, the aim of which is to outlaw the imposition of annual taxes on driving licences."
"If this amendment is not accepted, we run the risk of seeing the European driving licence pressed into service as a means of levying new vehicle taxes, which could also vary between countries."
"The beneficial effect of the introduction of a European driving licence would, in my opinion, be completely overshadowed by these disadvantages."
"That is why we also support Mr Farassino's proposal, and we hope that he will obtain a majority here in the House for all his amendments."
"Mr President, despite the unresolved issues, I believe that we can generally be satisfied with the work done on this Directive."
"The Commission, with its credit-card model, has put forward a foresighted proposal."
"It represents a successful compromise between harmonization and respect for the specific characteristics of our Member States."
"Every citizen of the EU who lives for more than three months in another Member State will come to appreciate the advantages offered by this Directive."
"In the same way, Member States will be able to switch in due course from paper licences to the credit-card format and will do so secure in the knowledge that the necessary interoperability of the 'credit-card' -style driving licence is guaranteed in all Member States."
"And from a parliamentary point of view, we too can take pleasure in the fact that some of the results of our work are reflected in the common position."
"Licence-holders who so wish, for example, will now be able to have their blood group and allergies entered on request and make a voluntary undertaking to donate organs."
"Anyone who remembers the first reading here in the House will know that even this dictate of common sense did not pass unchallenged by some Members."
"But let us hope that today at least we shall make the rapid administration of first aid our prime concern rather than exploiting the all-too-serious subject of data protection for the purpose of panicmongering."
"Mr President, let us begin by heartily congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Farassino, on his report."
"Naturally it is not the first time this matter has been discussed here in Parliament, but we are in fact close to taking a further step in the right direction."
"I am glad to note that in the Council's common position Parliament's amendments adopted in first reading and accepted and approved by the Commission at the time have been included."
"Consequently the Member States will be able to add, in a special heading designed for the purpose, data not connected with the administration of driving licences or management of road safety if the holder gives his agreement in writing."
"I have noticed in what some Members have said that they naturally have some reservations with regard to revealing that kind of information, but that is why there is a guarantee that it will be done only with the holder's written agreement."
"As a result of that rule the driving licence can even be used as an identity card, but only, I repeat, if the holder agrees."
"I would point out too that in the common position it is expressly stated that these additions can in no way make any alteration to the use of the new model as a driving licence."
"As honourable Members are aware, special space is to be reserved on the card with a view to the possible introduction in the future of a microchip or similar computer device."
"The Commission intends to set up a working group to study this question and in the light of its conclusions we shall consider whether or not to make a formal proposal."
"I hope that as a result the disquiet expressed amongst other things by many Members at first reading will be allayed."
"Another contentious point in the discussion was the length of validity of the card, which the Commission had proposed as ten years."
"Like a small majority in Parliament I regret that the Council has unanimously removed that provision."
"But I thank Parliament for giving the Commission its support at first reading."
"As regards the amendments tabled for this second reading, I must inform honourable Members that the Commission cannot entertain them."
"Three of the four amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport are identical to those already made at first reading, when the Commission said that it could not accept them."
"The Commission also explained the reasons on that occasion and I am quite ready to do that again briefly."
"Amendment No 2, which is to the effect that the full name of the Member State issuing the driving licence must be given, diverges from the existing provisions for the paper licence, for which the mention of the Member State is optional."
"A Member State will in any case have to be mentioned since the initial for the country must be printed on one side of the card."
"Amendment No 3 aims at deleting the words 'European Communities model' on the licence."
"However, the position is that mutual recognition of driving licences is ensured by those words."
"For that reason we cannot accept that amendment either."
"The subject of Amendment No 4, namely cost of issue, falls, as Members know, exclusively within the province of the Member States."
"Unfortunately no other answer can be given to the honourable Member who spoke more particularly on that point."
"Amendment No 1, it is true, is new but, I think, premature."
"Naturally I can entirely agree that the incorporation of a microchip in the driving licence provides opportunities for greater flexibility of use, increased security and reduced risk of forgery."
"However, that amendment cannot be included in the text because it would anticipate the conclusions of the working group which the Commission is to set up to produce a report on the consequences of incorporating a microchip or a similar device in the driving licence."
"That will be dealt with later, but all in good time."
"In conclusion I should like once again to thank Mr Farassino and his colleagues from the Committee on Transport."
"I hope that the whole matter will now be settled quickly even though honourable Members still put a question-mark in here and there."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Inland waterway transport"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0170/96) on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position established by the Council (C4-0096/96-95/0106(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on common rules applicable to the transport of goods or passengers by inland waterway between Member States with a view to establishing freedom to provide such transport services (rapporteur: Mr Le Rachinel)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Council Regulation on my report relates to the free provision of services in the transport of goods or passengers."
"The intention is to create a legal guarantee of free access by transport undertakings in the Community Member States to inland waterway transport."
"The Commission considers that, since Austria joined the Union, a new arrangement is required."
"This is because Austria has concluded bilateral agreements with Germany and the Netherlands."
"They make access to the international inland waterway transport market more difficult for carriers in that sector who are based in other Member States."
"These bilateral agreements are therefore incompatible with the principle of the free provision of services."
"Not only that, but they imply a discrimination based on nationality."
"In this area, the Court of Justice of the European Communities, in a judgment of 22 May 1985, specified that, where inland waterways were concerned, the Council should within an appropriate period free access to the inland waterways transport market of any discrimination based on nationality."
"Austria's membership of the European Union thus offers an opportunity to do so."
"The initial Commission proposal was adopted unamended by Parliament on first reading."
"The common position introduced only minor amendments, mainly editorial in nature, stressing however the fact that the owner of a vessel used for transport between Member States and in transit between those States must be under the flag of a Member State and have its home port in one of those States."
"I fully endorse this proposal."
"This proposal has therefore been adopted unanimously by the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the second reading."
"It is therefore this report, which poses no particular difficulties, that I have the honour of presenting today to be voted upon in this House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Green Paper on innovation"
"The next item is the report (A4-0165/96) by Mr Argyros, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the Commission Green Paper on innovation (Vol. I and Vol."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today's debate on the Green paper on innovation is timely and I hope that it will be of help to the Commission and the Member States, and also to European industry, in the determining of priorities."
"We in this House have debated the questions of competitiveness, development and employment on very many occasions, but only rarely have we focused on the importance of innovation in the pursuit of those three objectives."
"The challenge for a policy on innovation is four-pronged: firstly, to underscore the fundamental importance of innovation to prosperity; secondly, to assist the introduction to the market of new products and processes by facilitating their viability during the initial stage of an innovative investment; thirdly, to reward innovative activity through fiscal policies, and, fourthly, to ensure that the regulatory and administrative environment facilitates innovation."
"There are two truths which need to be emphasized, by way of qualification: the first is that research and technological development are not synonymous with innovation; the second is that successful innovation means, more than anything else, success in the marketplace."
"In order to be relevant and effective, the research and technological development policy of the European Union should not, I believe, seek to define technological priorities for industries that operate in rapidly changing global markets."
"Nor should it become a form of hidden state aid for sectors that cannot effectively compete in such markets."
"Lastly, we should not base our efforts on the false hypothesis that innovation is a linear result of the research and technological development process; that the more that is spent on basic research, the greater, axiomatically, will be the output of technology products, and that that, in turn, will lead to increased innovation."
"The innovation process is more complicated than that, and we in the European Union should ask ourselves whether the existing research and development policies and structures are based on an up-to-date understanding of the subject."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Research and Technological development, this policy must focus more on the diffusion of technical and scientific know-how by making technologies more accessible, relevant and exploitable across the European Union."
"And therefore a strategy focusing on the dissemination of research results must support research that is inter-disciplinary, application-orientated and network-driven."
"It must develop regional networks of non-industrial and industrial institutions and elaborate visible aims to help society understand the research and technology process and to become involved."
"In that context, three routes of action in the Commission's proposal deserve special mention."
"Firstly, the encouragement of innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises. This means that research policy must take account of the needs of SMEs and of their capacity to manage technology programmes by creating networks which will help those businesses and enhance links between the INNOVATION programme and national programmes."
"Secondly, the furthering of the mobility of researchers as an important means of diffusion of innovation via the strengthening of links between the INNOVATION programme and Activity Four of the fourth framework programme."
"This route of action must include more industrial research laboratories in its fourth activity."
"The third route of action that deserves special mention is the improvement of the financing of innovation. This is not, strictly speaking, a matter for government or for research policy."
"Rather, it is a matter for private investors and for the companies themselves, which are impeded by the prudence of institutional investors, the structure of tax systems and their own lack of technical expertise. Yet the investment structure with regard to the fostering of innovation in the European Union is so underdeveloped that the subject is an important public policy issue."
"One of Europe's main weaknesses, in fact, lies in a failure to translate technological research results and technical know-how into commercial success, chiefly because of the ineffectiveness of the financing system."
"By establishing a more effective structure the INNOVATION programme does help, but there is a manifest need for more concerted and systematic action by the Commission to improve the financing sector."
"It might be useful for the Commission to think of other ways of improving the financing situation, such as the linking of research and development programmes with financing initiatives, the nudging of public authorities in Europe in the direction of innovation through public contracts, the strengthening of actions to translate university research into commercial prototypes and to make researchers into entrepreneurs."
"Without things of that sort I think that the Union will fail in its activities."
"In concluding, Mr President, I would like to emphasize that innovation depends not so much on the financing of research collaboration programmes in the so-called 'strategic sectors' as on the existence of a dynamic single market with a clear administrative and regulatory framework."
"And I believe that the effectiveness of the Union's research and technology policy demands the promotion of collaboration and coordination via integrated strategic diffusion of the results of research and technological development."
"I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Argyros on this excellent report and the work he has put into it."
"It is a credit to this House."
"Millions of years ago the dinosaurs died out because they could not adapt fast enough to a changing world."
"Today the same fate faces European industry if we cannot make change our ally."
"Innovation is the lifeblood of the new global economy and our only hope for survival in a hostile economic environment."
"But the picture painted by the European Commission is none too bright."
"Clearly the European Union lags behind its major competitors in almost every field; research and development, the dissemination of information, attitudes to training, the business environment and so on."
"The picture is made bleaker still by the attitude of Member States such as my own where innovation is sacrificed on the altar of short-termism."
"A lack of long-term planning and an obsession with dividend payouts to shareholders mean that innovation is left a long way down the list of priorities."
"Europe's role in curing this disease is strictly limited but that is why we have to make sure that what we do, we do well."
"Above all, we have to bridge the gulf between business and science, not only in terms of disseminating information but in building a working partnership between innovators and industry."
"The two are not chalk and cheese."
"They should be flip sides of the same coin."
"Making this a reality begins at the most basic level."
"We have to create an environment that is favourable to science and innovation in every corner of society: making the most of science education for our children, providing better links between schools and the workplace, designating 1996 as the Year of Lifelong Learning, creating better research facilities for academics, financial incentives for research and innovation, and accessible scientific news for the layman."
"These are the foundations for an innovation-based society and industry."
"The Commission's proposals and the recommendations in this report could kick-start this process."
"In particular, through the creation of a sectoral taskforce, they provide a basis for bringing science and industry together in a goal-driven team."
"They also mark a move away from the old subsidy-based approach."
"Our task must be to make sure that the Member States show equal determination to fulfil their part of the bargain."
"Action in Europe is no excuse for complacency at home."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Argyros, for an altogether excellent report and for the fact that he paid considerable attention to the viewpoints of the Social Affairs Committee."
"I shall restrict myself to the social issues."
"The relationship between society and innovation is a symbiotic one."
"On the one hand, the way a society is organised plays a major role in determining whether innovations come into being at all."
"On the other, innovations can in themselves change society."
"This is the way it has always been."
"Innovations have played a large part in the treatment of disease, conditions for the disabled, improving the environment, improving working conditions for people on the production line and in creating employment in thinly populated areas."
"They can also play a significant role in the future too."
"I am often asked whether innovation will create new jobs. I usually answer that it depends on whether one takes the short-term or the long-term view, whether one sees the issue in its narrowest sense or more broadly."
"Narrowly speaking, and in the short term, innovation in a limited field can of course result in fewer jobs."
"However, history shows that societies which have been open to innovation have always been the most competitive societies, societies which have been able to carry on and create new jobs."
"I am therefore convinced that a society which favours innovation also creates jobs."
"Education and training is important, the relationship here too being two-way, since a society with a high level of education will also give rise to greater innovation, while innovation itself requires highly skilled people. For example, innovation has resulted in the information society and in a high level of training."
"Finally, a word about business and employees. It is sometimes said that employees and co-determination for employees are a burden on industry."
"Where innovation is concerned this is definitely not the case."
"In companies where employees have considerable influence and co-determination is important it is much easier to foster attitudes which are favourable to the implementation of innovations."
"This is why co-determination and employee participation is incredibly important in a society which seeks to be innovative."
"Mr President, we have to face the fact that the Community's competitive position in relation to Japan and the United States is going backwards and not forwards."
"We must also face the fact that the evidence is clear that it is not a failure in research which is the problem but the failure to apply the research to products and processes."
"This is not an assessment which is new to us on the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"We have been aware of this for some time and, indeed, we can claim that it was at the insistence of Parliament that the innovation part of the framework programme has been increasingly important in recent years."
"In fact, as we know, within the current fourth programme innovation is a fully-fledged programme in its own right."
"The Commission's Green Paper is a welcome document."
"It recognizes the need for some new thinking to encourage the innovation processes."
"Proposals for action at Community level are now awaited from the consultation process which the Green Paper has initiated."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Argyros, on the quality of his report and the very strong efforts he made to take into account fully the opinions of other committees, as Mr Andersson has acknowledged."
"The rapporteur subsequently went to the bother of tightening up the resolution to make it much more focused and that was unanimously approved by our committee."
"Because of this the Socialist Group fully agrees with the resolution and we will vote against any amendments."
"The contribution which R & D will make to economic growth and employment in the Community in the next twenty years will depend little on future R & D. It will depend on exploiting the work that has already been done."
"Over the years Community research has created a great reservoir of ideas."
"The task now is to ensure that this knowledge reaches every manufacturing and service business."
"Production processes and services activities have to be broken down into their components and analysed for methods of improvement."
"That is the culture we have to encourage."
"It is truly a formidable challenge to the concept of the information society."
"Actions at Community level will be useless unless there is a strong link with regional and local technology and innovation centres."
"Member States have a key responsibility to promote these centres and, where appropriate, the structural and cohesion funds of the Community should be used in support."
"The big idea concept will not solve our problems."
"A multitude of small applications probably will."
"In backing this report, the Socialist Group calls on the Commission to incorporate the ideas which have been expressed in the resolution and in the explanatory statement into the action plan which we await with keen interest."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also see this piece of work, the Green Paper on innovation, for which I express my special thanks to the Commission, as an important contribution to the urgent and intensive discussion on the preservation and securing of jobs."
"This problem is currently the main concern of the European Union."
"Jobs will only ever be secure if we establish ourselves in a leading position in the technologies of tomorrow."
"In this respect, I believe that three particularly important points are made in the Green Paper."
"First of all, there is the dissemination and exploitation of research results."
"This process, which we sometimes rather indiscriminately call 'technology transfer' , is still inadequate in many areas, even in those fields such as biotechnology where the division between basic research and product development is often very blurred and fluid."
"For that reason, we call for more interaction between the Innovation programme on the one hand and the specific research programmes and Commission policies on horizontal dissemination of research results on the other, as well as for the development of a methodology involving the cooperation of all bodies responsible for the dissemination and exploitation of research results, both horizontal and vertical, in order to identify models for the more rapid conversion of research results into marketable products."
"In addition, it is naturally essential that research findings should be presented in an informative and intelligible manner to the general public and that a technology culture should be promoted."
"At the same time, I am aware that these two efforts cannot be centrally directed but must come from below, so to speak, beginning in school."
"Secondly, in the European Union we have 15 research policies, many of which are formulated in isolation."
"If our innovative capacity is to be enhanced, closer cooperation at national and Union levels is necessary."
"It is also important that the dynamic balance between two factors is preserved, namely the coordination of activities and promotion schemes on the one hand but also the necessary competition for the best solutions on the other."
"This necessary competition is not simply a matter of duplicated effort at twice the cost but also releases creativity and ideas for the future, and they are just what we need!"
"Mr President, Commissioner Cresson, I cannot begin to speak about technological innovation today without mentioning the event which was unfortunately on the front pages of many of this morning's newspapers: the loss of Ariane V. I think it is in difficult moments like this in one of the Union's strategic research and development programmes, that there should indeed be clear priority objectives without giving way to frustration or emotional criticism."
"Coming now to the Commission's Green Paper, I note that it contains much valid analysis and thought: some traditional, some innovative."
"But the identification in the Green Paper of innovation in the firm with success on the market is new and strong, as are the recognition of the basic cultural problem, and that the success of the modern firm is based on technological competence, entrepreneurial competence and learning capacity, and hence, in particular, the importance of small and medium-sized firms using the emerging information networks in the now imminent challenge of the information society."
"The previous Commission also raised the issue of the economic and commercial potential of research projects, and the fourth framework programme is steeped in this principle, but this Green Paper seeks to focus even more on firm/research involvement, introducing the task force experiment."
"Thanks to the dialogue Commissioner Cresson pursues with the Committee on Research, we have finally understood and largely concurred with the reasoning behind the task force experiment and the merit grid used to identify the issues proposed by the task forces themselves: being intelligible to public opinion, the capacity for economic and competitive decline, the potential for triggering off a virtuous circle between industry and research."
"I recognize the potential of this approach and I am sure we will continue the debate and exchange of views with Commissioner Cresson when it comes to refinancing the Fourth Framework Programme."
"For the moment, we approve and encourage the Commission's efforts in the Green Paper."
"But novelty should not deter us from taking the most traditional, familiar and yet necessary measures: development of a European capital market for small firms, simplification of administrative formalities, researcher mobility."
"Finally, I would like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur on the authority with which he has put together a coherent report which respects the opinions of the European Parliament, out of a sea of additions and suggestions, to the point that he actually invented a procedure which we have christened the 'Argyros procedure' in the Committee on Research."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to compliment Mr Argyros on his report and thank him for his positive cooperation both within the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy and outside it."
"That has resulted in a brief, cohesive resolution."
"The most important message of the green paper is that the Commission, like a number of Member States, is extending technological policy into innovation policy."
"In itself it is a readable document with a good analysis and lines of action which seem likely to be effective."
"The headpiece put on it with the task force is rather incomprehensible to the Liberal Group."
"Close coordination of research efforts is necessary."
"But that must not entail covert sector support."
"For liberals that is something akin to swearing in church."
"The development of generic technologies useful for many sectors can actually increase the competitive capacity of the whole European Union."
"Secondly, the distribution of powers between national authorities and the European authority according to line of action is arguable."
"Innovation policy including technology policy needs to be developed and implemented at national level unless the extent of the problem or of the scale is of such a nature as to require an approach at European level."
"Innovation policy for the small and medium-sized businesses seems to be pre-eminently a task for the national authorities."
"Naturally certain things can and must be fitted in to the European innovation policy directed to large undertakings, but it is to be expected that the national authorities are most aware of the needs and requirements of local small- and medium-scale businesses."
"Thirdly, renewal of the economy and the economic structure must to a considerable extent be initiated by smalland medium-sized businesses, able to play a full part and not be obstructed by administrative procedures which act as a keener brake on a small firm than on a large one."
"Besides, small- and medium-sized businesses are not a homogeneous group of undertakings but an extremely diverse group."
"A different approach according to the target group is desirable."
"So I am glad that my amendment on that has been taken up."
"From various enquiries it seems that with small- and medium-sized businesses one working year's research and development provides twice as many innovations as in big business."
"But the number of innovations successfully introduced on to the market is pitifully small."
"The percentage of success for Europe as a whole is only 20 %."
"That is primarily due to strong selectivity on the technological sides of innovation and insufficient attention to market aspects."
"My Group hopes that a fundamentally different approach to the problems of innovation will lead to a new and effective policy with, as its aim, wide scope for innovative firms and new opportunities for employment."
"Mr President, the Commission's Green Paper on innovation shows an awareness of the importance of the relationship between innovation and society, but in outlining the innovation strategy it fails to deal, for example, with the relationship between innovation policy and environmental policy, nor does it discuss innovation policy in relation to social policy and labour market issues."
"In the report of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy Mr Argyros has taken due note of the points made concerning these issues in the opinions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment in particular."
"Innovations obviously have a positive impact in many ways, but not necessarily a positive social impact."
"Innovations can help to create new jobs and entire industries, but the opposite can also be the case."
"Research into the social impact of innovations should therefore form a part of innovation policy."
"An increase in production efficiency as a result of innovations should also be beneficial to employees, for example by leading to shorter working hours and a redistribution of tasks."
"It is also important to emphasize, as the committee has done, that only in organizations with well-developed communication producers and high levels of employee participation can the opportunities provided by innovations be exploited effectively."
"Finally, I should like to emphasize that the innovation policy presented by the Commission focuses too much on technology."
"Social innovations and cultural innovations should be supported by the EU, particularly since these areas are becoming more important in safeguarding individual well-being and improving employment prospects."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Argyros for a very good report, which I largely support."
"I have nevertheless tabled three amendments, as I believe there are a number of things Mr Argyros has forgotten."
"We Greens believe that it is important to create the right conditions for innovation but perhaps not so much in order to compete with the USA and Japan as to move towards a sustainable society with environmentally friendly policies."
"My first amendment concerns environmental taxes."
"I believe that if the Union can bring about an environmental tax reform at Union level, this will as a matter of course enormously increase the level of innovation in three important sectors - the environment, energy and transport."
"These are three areas in which the Member States of the EU today lack proper innovation which would help them cope with environmental problems, growth and unemployment."
"The Union should not risk falling behind on these important issues because of a fear of innovation and change."
"It is also absolutely essential that risk capital should be made available for innovators."
"I propose that the NASDAQ model should be used to achieve this."
"My final amendment is aimed at the inclusion of young people too in a European network, whereas the committee today only proposes women."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the will and the ability to innovate are the keys to the economic and social future of the entire Community."
"Europe in particular has to remain a leading player if it is to safeguard its international competitiveness, not only in terms of economic performance but also in the exploitation and widespread application of new forms of technology."
"For one thing, I advocate more vigorous support of the Scientific and Technological Option Assessment unit (STOA)."
"I regard this as an absolutely essential point, because technology assessment helps to broaden the range of instruments available for technological forecasting."
"The more complex scientific and technical developments become, the more important it is to explain the consequences of new technology to the public and to assist MEPs in their decision-making with the aid of STOA."
"STOA should cooperate closely with the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS), and the IPTS should be assigned a key role in improving the coordination of European technology assessments."
"One of the main aspects of innovation is the question of security and access to information."
"At the Euratom Conference on the Control of Nuclear Material in Novosibirsk, which I attended yesterday, it became clear how important innovation is in the domain of control."
"It is also important to be aware of the need to promote initial and advanced training in this domain."
"Innovation in the field of human resources must take place through the development of the existing programmes, such as Socrates, Leonardo and TACIS."
"I also call on the Commission to create a European network of women self-starters."
"We are undergoing a comprehensive structural transformation from industrial society to service and information society."
"The service sector is a women's domain."
"The number of women who have started businesses has increased considerably."
"The reasons for the higher proportion of women self-starters lie in the marked improvement in the vocational training of women, and another factor nowadays, of course, is that on completion of their vocational training many women have no prospect of finding a job or have to work under the constant threat of unemployment."
"The most important enabling measure for women self-starters is state-aided professional consultancy."
"A special coaching model would be highly desirable, in other words advice provided over a lengthy period by a consultant for particularly innovative self-starters, be they men or women."
"Consideration should be given to the establishment of intersectoral, supraregional and European coordinating agencies for business start-ups."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to pay tribute to Mr Argyros for the quality of his report."
"This report comes at the end of the consultation period which has provided an opportunity to an unprecedented debate on innovation throughout the European Union."
"The consultation process, for which more than 30, 000 copies of the Green Paper were distributed, involved a series of 17 national conferences attended by nearly 5, 000 executors from business and public authorities."
"I note that the comments and suggestions made by Parliament generally endorse those expressed during the consultation process, and I also observe that Parliament rightly insisted on the need to take the social aspect of innovation into consideration, in order to take account of the needs and expectations of our fellow citizens and involve the workers in the process of innovation."
"I should like to comment on the main suggestions contained in Parliament's motion for a resolution. First, the dissemination and exploitation of research and technical development results."
"Parliament calls for more support for the Innovation and Mobility programme, and suggests the creation of a Dissemination and Exploitation Task Force."
"I thank Parliament for this support for programmes which the Commission proposes to reinforce in the fifth framework programme."
"Regarding the creation of an Innovation Task Force, it is clear that - whether or not it be in the form of a task force - the fifth Framework Programme will have to ensure greater coordination between specific programmes and with the Member States."
"Parliament wants there to be greater awareness of the 'Innovation' process, with the preparation of innovation indicators and a rolling review of best national practices in the encouragement of innovation."
"The debate centred on the Green Paper has highlighted the need for deeper knowledge of innovation and the present shortcomings in this area."
"In particular, we need to have a way of comparing - within the Union and elsewhere in the world - undertakings' performance in the area of innovation, the regional and national innovation systems and the national and regional policies pursued with this aim in mind."
"The Commission will in future be preparing a regular report on innovation in Europe and on the policies that support it, drawing on completely reliable indicators."
"Parliament recommends improving the orientation of research."
"I shall come back in due course to certain observations in this chapter, especially those regarding the social aspects of innovation and the task forces."
"The fourth concern expressed in this chapter is support for the various forms of cooperation between the innovation actors."
"This recommendation by Parliament reflects the perception, shared by the Commission, that innovation is an interactive process which feeds on the relations between undertakings and research centres or support bodies, including financial bodies, as well as between the undertakings themselves."
"Collaboration between complementary professions and occupations, which is one of the basic mechanisms of innovation, will have to be reinforced in the fifth Framework Programme."
"Parliament expresses a wish for improved cooperation and coordination between national and Community research policies."
"As you know, I fully share this concern."
"At the time of my inaugural address, I clearly stated to you my intention of using every opportunity afforded by the Treaty in this area."
"This coordination exercise was systematically launched in the fourth Framework Programme, since every programme committee is required to devote a proportion of its working time to it each year."
"This first stage relates to the pooling of information on existing policies and instruments."
"The purpose of this inventory is to enable us to move onto a more active and forward-looking phase in the course of the fifth Framework Programme, to enable research and innovationsupport policies to be coordinated from the start of their preparation."
"As far as task forces are concerned, I shall come back to that point, since they are the subject of a specific comment in the report, but I can state here and now that in my view they would not fully achieve their object unless they were to give priority to broadly based dialogue with the socioeconomic and scientific protagonists and to the coordination of national and Community research projects, for example by setting common objectives."
"In reply to Mrs Heinisch's speech, I can say here and now that the Office of Scientific and Technical Options Assessment certainly has a place within this machinery, and that cooperation with the IPTS, in order words the Seville Institute, in particular, must be improved."
"Regarding the economic and financial considerations for innovation, in other words the problems of finance and taxation, the report recommends a review of the impact of taxation policies on innovation, and concerted action in this area, and in the area of finance."
"In this context, I must recall that taxation is a national prerogative."
"The Union therefore has little power of its own to influence policy in this area."
"The review recommended by Parliament, and previously proposed in the Green Paper, is one of the measures whose feasibility is being examined by the Commission."
"As for the financing of innovation, this is one of the priorities which emerges from the consultation, and the Commission intends to advance in this area, within the limits imposed by subsidiarity."
"The action to be drawn up for the autumn will include a section entitled 'Finance and innovation system' , with four objectives."
"First, encouraging investment in risk capital and equity, especially for the high-growth innovative undertakings which represent an important source of new job creation."
"Secondly, supporting the development of high-liquidity transeuropean capital markets for innovative undertakings."
"All the necessary conditions for the success of such markets, such as the federation of new markets or the ASDAQs, need to be in place."
"Particular aspects need to be considered on the legal and fiscal framework conditions and the provision of training in the necessary new professions, such as that of financial analyst."
"Thirdly, the conditions for access to long-term loans needs to be improved."
"Finally, the interfaces between technological innovation and the financial world need to be improved."
"This is where Parliament's suggestion of technical ratings come in."
"This idea, already carried out in Belgium and the Netherlands, could if successful be adopted by other countries."
"And the Commission may, in that event, be able to assist its dissemination."
"The Commission also has to ensure that the existing instruments are fully utilized."
"The Commission departments, together with the European Investment Fund, are exploring ways of steering the latter's instruments towards innovation."
"As regards the legal and administrative constraints - and you will know that simplifying administration is one of my major concerns - many measures have already been introduced or tightened up with my request in the fourth Framework Programme: for example simplified contracts, the two-stage procedure, etc."
"And a seminar on the subject has been arranged for 25 June."
"Regarding intellectual property rights, I have duly noted the fact that Parliament is expressing a desire to see the cost of such rights and the time necessary to obtain them reduced, but that it also mentions the need for variable periods of protection according to product type in order to maintain competition from generic products."
"I would recall that, as far as patents are concerned, our position is less favourable than that of our main competitors, who have the advantage of being subject to unified patent law."
"Which is more than we can say."
"The Community Patent Convention has not yet been ratified, despite the agreement concluded in 1989."
"Also, it has been suggested either that the convention should be simplified or that such a drastic measure as reintegrating patent law into Community Law should be introduced."
"The prospects that such a proposal will be adopted - as you know, it will have to be adopted unanimously - by the Council seem poor at the present time."
"But we cannot leave things as they are."
"As regards the information society, where the economic stakes are substantial, in the case of biotechnology for example, I have asked my staff to study the possibility of introducing specific measures to assist small and medium-sized enterprises and the universities to protect their inventions, along the lines of the 'small entities fees' which exist in the United States."
"Another point that was mentioned, and an important point, concerns the need to encourage innovation by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Commission is well aware of the potential represented by the SMEs in the areas of innovation, job creation, flexibility for the economy, and growth."
"Numerous steps have already been taken to benefit the SMEs: the measures known as 'technological stimulation of SMEs' , in other words the extension of the CRAFT programme, offering them the possibility of two-stage applications - a simplified first stage, enabling them to obtain a feasibility bonus, simplification of forms and contracts, and the inclusion of filing costs and renewal fees within the eligible basis for the new framework of state aid to research."
"It is equally desirable to take account of the diversity of these enterprises, and hence the need for policies adjusted to the different categories of SME."
"Many of them simply want to improve their products or processes by using the most appropriate new technologies, without necessarily having the desire or ability to conduct independent research."
"The action taken to assist enterprises of these types is mainly designed to strengthen their capability to absorb new methods and leading-edge technologies."
"All these activities aimed at the SMEs are not, however, always very clear to them. Their clarity and effectiveness need to be strengthened on the occasion of the fifth Framework Programme."
"A number of measures are being considered, such as those to merge, within a single horizontal programme, the activities aimed at the SMEs - in other words, primarily technological stimulation schemes - and the Innovation programme, which would strengthen their cohesion and make it possible to offer the SMEs a single innovation interface within the Framework Programme."
"I also consider it essential not to underestimate the potential represented by large undertakings in the field of research and innovation."
"Support for collaboration between large undertakings and SMEs is therefore a line worth pursuing."
"Among the many recommendations and new ideas that it presents, the report expresses the desire that consideration should be given to means of steering the structural funds to innovation."
"The Commission has already taken action along these lines: first by virtue of the Community initiatives or Article 10 of the ERDF, for which it is mainly responsible; and secondly by virtue of the definition of the Community support frameworks which, in a way, are a general charter negotiated between the Member States and the Commission to define the purposes for which the structural funds should be used."
"The mid-term revision of these Community support frameworks, currently covering the period 1994-1999, can provide an opportunity to emphasize this orientation."
"The report also suggests the establishment of a network for women who set up in business."
"Such a network for women who set up in business is proposed in the integrated programme for SME 1997-2000, drawn up under the authority of Mr Papoutsis, which is currently being studied by the Council and by Parliament."
"Regarding the social and training aspects of innovation, I have duly noted that Parliament recommends that the social dimension of innovation should be taken into consideration, both in order to steer the broad guidelines and evaluation of policies and to emphasize the necessary communication with the public and the educational role of television, consideration for the consumer, worker information and participation, and the training of the social partners in taking due account of innovation."
"The Commission entirely agrees with Parliament regarding the need to take account of the social dimension in innovation policies."
"I myself wanted the final socioeconomic research programme to include a section on training and one on exclusion."
"This social concern, like environmental protection, education and health, prompted the choice of themes for the first task forces."
"As regards involving workers in the process of innovation within enterprises, my conviction is that this practice must become more widespread and become one of the basic principles of human resources management and the quest for quality."
"Regarding education and continuing training after initial education, I believe we are equally convinced that this is the crucible in which individual capacity for innovation has to be forged."
"It must therefore play the greatest possible part in the acquisition of skills, such as creativity, a taste for experiment, and the aptitude for communication and teamwork."
"Technical education and vocational training must not be devalued, but the acquisition of a basic general culture is essential to facilitate the lasting suitability for new functions which innovation requires."
"In any case, it is an illusion to believe that a satisfactory education can be acquired once and for all in the early years of life."
"Training becomes a necessity that lasts all one's life."
"A great many proposals on this subject are included in the White Paper on Education and Training."
"The implementation of the Socrates and Leonardo programmes will incorporate specific measures to encourage innovation."
"Although the responsibility for this is primarily national, it is important that a stimulus should be provided at Community level."
"That is why, together with my colleague Martin Bangemann, I launched the initiative entitled 'Learning in the information society' ."
"This initiative has four main axes."
"First, the interlinking of schools throughout Europe; secondly, encouraging the development of software and syllabuses necessary to give a genuine educational value to this exchange network; thirdly, deciding with future users on the exchange topics to be organized as a priority, designed to meet both the educational needs that are common to the various states and the demands of pupils and students, while taking advantage of the existing cultural diversity; and, finally, assisting the formation of teaching teams to utilize the new technologies."
"As for the establishment of innovation training courses for the social partners, this is a field to be explored in due course within the Leonardo and Socrates programmes, on the basis of successful national experience in this field."
"Regarding the idea of a register of new qualifications created by innovation, I can tell you that I shall take due note of it."
"A study will be undertaken, after a stocktake of what is already in existence."
"I now come to the subject of the task forces."
"This is a subject which was extensively debated on the occasion of the review of the proposal to extend the fourth Framework Programme."
"That debate enabled the situation to be clarified."
"I believe, in particular, that the two objectives aimed at by the creation of this instrument have been identified."
"First, helping to solve a number of priority themes by approaching them on a global basis, with collective identification of needs and a focus on specific results."
"And secondly by stimulating, as Mr Argyros's report emphasizes, cooperation in these fields at European and national level."
"I have noted that Parliament regrets the insufficient attention paid to innovative sectors such as the information society, biotechnology and environmental technologies."
"I would remind you that it is not the purpose of the Green Paper to undertake an in-depth study of specific technological or sectoral themes."
"Nevertheless, I do of course recognize the importance of the information society and the promise held out by biotechnology and environmental technologies."
"The rapid utilization of all the potential opened up by the new information technology is certainly one of the major sources of innovation, both for business and for the public authorities and services."
"The setting up of the task force on educational multimedia and the initiative to be undertaken in the area of the information society form part of this logic."
"That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concludes the comments I have felt prompted to make by this very comprehensive and dense report, benefiting as it does from the opinions of several committees."
"Innovation is a crucial issue for the economy and for employment, and it has indeed been treated as such."
"I can only welcome that, and I have no doubt that this political conclusion will shortly be confirmed at the Florence summit."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"EURET programme"
"The next item is the report (A4-0090/96) by Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the report from the Commission on the evaluation of the EURET programme (European research on transport) - final report (COM(95)0450 final - C4-0511/95)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, the EURET programme is the first specific programme for research and technological development in the field of transport."
"It started off in 1991 under the second framework programme."
"The transport sector is pre-eminently a sector requiring a European approach."
"Research on and the introduction of new techniques and technologies are of decisive importance for solving the European transport problem."
"The start of European research in this field in 1991 must therefore at least be referred to as late."
"So it is no wonder that there is no European vision in the direction of R & D in the field of transport by land, sea or air."
"The report before us today is an evaluation of the EURET programme prepared by a panel of five independent specialists."
"This evaluation was only started a year after the programme was due to come to an end."
"Moreover at the insistence of the Commission the evaluation had to be prepared within six weeks."
"It therefore lacks depth."
"The experts say so themselves."
"After that it took a further eight months before the evaluation report was sent to the European Parliament and then only in three languages - one more assault on the principle that every European citizen should be able to read documents in his or her own language."
"Every Member of this Parliament has the right according to the Treaty of Rome to work in his or her own language."
"Nevertheless that right is regularly trampled under foot by the Commission."
"This question plays a part at Council level also, because yesterday the Netherlands ministers announced that they would take decisions exclusively on the basis of documents translated into good Dutch and ready in good time."
"The way in which the evaluation of the EURET programme has been approached is not acceptable to your rapporteur."
"It would have been possible to start with the evaluation before all projects had been wholly completed."
"It is true that an interim report was made in 1993 but even that report came out a year later than had been envisaged."
"It referred to all the gaps in the control and management structure of the projects."
"Nevertheless there was no adjustment."
"The final report on the EURET programme was drawn up only after the specific transport programme in the fourth framework programme had been approved."
"The final evaluation of EURET thus failed in its mission."
"It made no contribution to the fourth framework programme."
"The Committee on Research therefore hopes that the experts' recommendations will at least be used in the implementation of the specific programme and in the drafting of the fifth framework programme."
"According to the panel's recommendations the Commission needs to take appropriate steps to arrive at joint or at least coherent aims with regard to research and technological policy and the common transport policy."
"The 1995 external monitoring report also calls on the Commission for a more specific vision in the field of transport."
"Cohesion between the programme's various areas of research and collaboration with other DGs in this field is essential."
"Overlapping must be avoided."
"Sustainable mobility can be achieved only if the proper strategies are developed."
"The fourth framework programme is directed particularly to transport efficiency and only marginally to prevention and changes in modal distribution."
"Tele-working therefore needs to be encouraged throughout Europe because that is a specific technological application which may reduce mobility."
"A further aim of many Member States is to reduce environmental pollution such as the emission of various harmful substances, by means of energy efficiency."
"Research can make an important contribution to the development of environment-friendly technology in the transport sector."
"For that too a European vision with a planned approach would not be out of place."
"Clean engines which use considerably less energy and therefore burn more cleanly would make the car more acceptable as a means of transport."
"For that a European directive on maximum emissions is needed."
"Finally my last point."
"In 1994 when the period envisaged had expired, a further ECU 8 million was spent on extra appropriations in order to ensure that a number of projects within EURET were continued."
"Can the Commission say how that ECU 8 million breaks down?"
"And what was the percentage contributed by Member States to these projects?"
"In conclusion, Mr President, transport, together with energy, the environment and town and country planning, is a crucial sector for the European economy in the coming century."
"Well-regulated transport means energyefficient, environment-friendly transport with the infrastructure geared to town and country planning."
"It would be sensible if the Commission were to develop such a vision in consultation with the European Parliament."
"Mr President, we are taking part in a debate which shows both sides of the coin of research projects and I congratulate both Mr Argyros and the Commissioner who have been able to explain to us in detail a series of thought-provoking ideas about innovation in the European Union."
"The positive obverse side of European research lies in innovation."
"But the reverse side of the coin is the project which we are discussing at the moment on the evaluation of a series of programmes related to transport."
"Experience in this respect has been problematical but the research which is at present under way and which is due to continue, is very important."
"Transport is increasingly one more structural variable on top of so many other social, economic and all sorts of other variables."
"It has not been possible for the recommendations of the group of experts to be incorporated in the fourth framework programme, and that is really serious."
"We must put an end to such things in the European Union, because we may be brilliant at making declarations - like the green paper on innovation - and then very slow when it comes to considering evaluation studies and to the practical application of these interesting plans we draw up."
"We are dealing here with interconnection and interoperability in transport, a very fundamental subject; with the environmental effect of this transport; with accidents; with noise and atmospheric pollution; with systems of administration of air traffic."
"That is to say, a series of factors of enormous importance."
"And all that - if we may be critical - has been spoilt by inefficiency and red-tape which have ensured that studies do not arrive in time, that they cannot be used, that the money spent has been badly allocated by not arriving in time."
"I hope there will be no repetition of this and that studies on transport will nevertheless continue to be an important feature of subjects for research."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make it clear that I am replying here on behalf of Mr Neil Kinnock, who is currently travelling on official business."
"The Euret programme has replaced the Union's original research programme in the transport sector."
"That was a trial."
"To judge by the general tenor of the evaluation report by the independent experts, that trial has been considered conclusive."
"Like the evaluation report, the report prepared by Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel acknowledges the important contribution made by research to the definition and exploitation of an efficient European transport system which at the same time respects the environment."
"I welcome that."
"Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel does however make various critical remarks regarding the content of the evaluation report and the way in which that evaluation was undertaken, and those remarks are reflected in the motion for a resolution."
"Rather than considering them all one by one, I would like to comment briefly on some of them."
"In point 2 of the motion for a resolution, it is stated that the conclusions of the evaluation of the Euret programme could not be taken into consideration in the transport research programme because of poor synchronization between the timetable of this new programme and the timetable of the evaluation."
"That is only partially true."
"The first period for submitting proposals for the new programme in fact ended on 15 March 1995."
"Some of the recommendations made by the experts were thus able to be taken into consideration."
"Overall, however, the Commission shares the feeling that the evaluation report on Euret was not available at the time when it would have been most useful."
"Nor was it the only one to be in that situation, because of the provisions adopted in the third Framework Programme."
"This situation was rectified with the fourth Framework Programme."
"In the adoption decision, it is clearly stipulated that the evaluation reports must be available and disclosed to the European Parliament before the Commission presents its proposal for the fifth Framework Programme."
"The question of the coordination and complementarity of the European and national efforts, mentioned in sections 5 and 6, also has to be considered in a qualified manner."
"A minimum of coordination was guaranteed, as is always the case, through the agency of the programme committee."
"Here again, especially, I can reassure you. In the follow-up to the Commission communication, ' Achieving coordination through cooperation' , the CREST had its coordinating mandate strengthened."
"Ad hoc groups, broadly supporting programme committees, were set up."
"They were intended to make it possible to ensure good coordination and optimum complementarity between national and European activities."
"As to the problem of administrative expenditure, mentioned in section 13 of the motion for a resolution, it must be considered in the light of all the different aspects."
"Of course this figure is higher than the average, too high, and in future we will need to ensure that expenditure in this category does not rise to such a level."
"But the programme was a small-scale one and, as you know, there are fixed costs that cannot be reduced."
"It is more difficult, therefore, to keep the administrative costs of smaller programmes at the ideal level."
"Above all, this was a first programme, so that this expenditure can be regarded as investment outlay."
"Thanks to this above-average effort, the administrative costs of the 'Transport' programme amounted to only 4.9 % of the total committed credits."
"In conclusion, while we share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel's general opinion, as regards the points I have mentioned and various other points in the motion for a resolution, the Commission would have preferred to see more qualified statements, showing greater understanding of the constraints under which the Commission has to work when implementing research programmes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Cooperation in research and technological development"
"The next item is the report (A4-0160/96) by Mr Pompidou, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the communication from the Commission: ' Perspectives for international cooperation in research and technological development' (COM(95)0489 - C4-0502/95)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is being presented on an evening when we have just discussed the excellent report by my colleague Mr Argyros, and my own report is naturally complementary to his."
"The aim is to define, for the first time, the principles of a strategy for scientific and technical cooperation between the European Union and the rest of the world."
"This attempt had never been made before."
"Contacts were made haphazardly, as it were, between the European Union, especially the Commission, and its Permanent Representations in third countries."
"There was no defined strategy."
"In fact, I could ask no better proof of this than the confusion - the unacceptable confusion - that exists in the Commission's report between scientific cooperation as such and technological cooperation."
"I believe a distinction should be made between the sharing of knowledge on the one hand and the conquest of new market shares on the other, thanks to the development of new classes of products through technological innovation, research and development."
"And, as in the Commission report, which might have been discarded if Parliament had not been there, the projects are not identified."
"It seems to me necessary to identify major global projects designed to improve the overall state of the European Union, the Member States and the associated third countries, major targeted projects, research and development in respect of high-technology products intended to improve industrial production or consumer products, and then, on the other hand, research and development in respect of high value-added, innovative products, as is the case in particular with agri-foodstuff products."
"The European Union also needs to be able to develop, together with third countries, a megascience in the field of particle physics, as is already happening at CERN in Geneva, and in the observation of the universe."
"And it is nevertheless necessary to maintain and recognize those fields of excellence that are specific and particular to the European Union."
"Finally, the Commissioner, thank God, improved this report verbally this afternoon, or just now, by talking about the Argyros report and stressing the need to improve the protection of intellectual and industrial property, and we welcome that."
"After all, this is a real cause for concern, because in order for information to be able to pass between the European Union and third countries it is necessary to be able to define agreements regarding the protection of industrial and intellectual property."
"And then, of course, we are also delighted that agreements are gradually being concluded, as they develop, with the countries of central Europe, the Baltic States and the independent States that emerged from the breakup of the former Soviet Union."
"As far as the SMEs are concerned, the emphasis was on technological innovation, but I believe that - as the Commissioner said - it is necessary for there to be ties between big business and the small and medium-sized enterprises, based on observation of balanced partnership agreements, or otherwise the small would be crushed by the large."
"We can wave our arms around as much as we like, we shall achieve nothing."
"In addition, we need to develop major transverse projects - that is our committee's opinion - on energy production, so as to improve the energy efficiency of transport, new information and communication technologies, environmental protection and climatology."
"This approach calls for a number of task forces, which have been defined."
"Next, it is important to initiate targeted projects for monitoring space and the earth, for telecommunications and multimedia and, especially, for biology too, particularly in the field of genome research."
"Also, one point that has not been touched upon either in the communication on innovation or in the Commission communication on cooperation with third countries is scientific and technical surveillance."
"Here, again, I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has indicated the need to strengthen ties between STOA - the Scientific and Technological Option Assessment Unit - and the Institute for Exploration in Seville, which she supports and has set up, and that all this is leading to specific measures which will be supported by financial funds, and in particular a European-style NASDAQ - an EASDAQ, for example."
"In conclusion, Mr President, it is important to make a distinction between countries which are candidates to join the European Union and qualify for association agreements, the industrialized countries which qualify for cooperation agreements, and developing countries which qualify for assistance agreements."
"This can provide a basis for defining a genuine policy of cooperation with third countries, designed to bring to the fore a Europe of competences."
"As far as the amendments are concerned, they have all been adopted by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, as have the amendments proposed by the Committee on External Economic Relations, the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"As regards the last amendment put forward by Mr Holm, I have to confess that I don't understand it."
"It seems to me that he is firing at his own side, since research into the elimination of fissile materials will in fact lead to dangers of proliferation."
"This is the key which has made the examination of this communication by Committee on External Economic Relations so much more effective. There are the countries applying for membership, where the intention is to promote a European model of free market development; the neighbouring Mediterranean countries, where improvements in quality of life and sustainable development are sought; other third countries, including technologically advanced countries, typically our competitors; developing countries, some already competing, others needing assistance."
"Today the European Union is opening its Fourth Framework Programme to all European businesses, but the definition of a European business is not always very clear, and it is not always the most appropriate definition or the best adapted to stated policy."
"A breakdown on the basis of policy objectives ought to be considered for the Fifth Framework Programme."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations therefore recommends that whenever the Commission draws up a new external cooperation agreement the chapter on opening up trade should be systematically accompanied by a chapter regulating intellectual property for technological trade and a chapter on scientific and technological collaboration geared to general policy objectives."
"That is the thrust of the three amendments proposed by the Committee on External Economic Relations to strengthen Mr Pompidou's text further, and I congratulate him again on an excellent report."
"Mr President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Dr Pompidou, for the excellent report that he has produced. I also thank him for the special attention he has paid to the priority given by the Development Committee to the need to intensify the cooperation between the European Union and developing countries in research and technological development."
"I would also like to thank the Secretary-General of the ACP, Dr Carl Greenidge who during an interesting hearing presented to the Development Committee the ACP perspective on the most important issues."
"His contribution helped us to identify the needs of the developing countries."
"There is an increasing demand for cooperation on the part of the developing countries because of their awareness of the fundamental importance of being involved in the rapidly increasing innovation that is taking place in research and technological development."
"Some of the areas of specific interest that have to be addressed include food supply, health and environmental protection and energy issues."
"These can make an important contribution in relation to new employment opportunities, to remove the many development bottlenecks and to overcome the marginalization of developing countries in global agricultural production and manufacturing."
"Food security and the health sector represent the main priority."
"The need to strengthen cooperation between developing countries is urgent as underlined by the alarming report from the World Health Organisation on the increasing spread of epidemics and resurgence of diseases in new, resistant forms."
"A global emergency has been declared by the World Health Organisation on tuberculosis, which has killed millions of people in recent years."
"Famines which were relatively rare in Africa in the 1960s, re-emerged as endemic in the 1980s and 1990s."
"According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation, 44 out of 52 African countries are presently threatened by severe food shortages."
"Devoting resources to getting more food to a given area is therefore of high priority."
"A few guidelines should be essential to our cooperation with the developing countries, if we are to implement a research policy that truly serves development needs."
"Close association of the beneficiaries with the research activities from the earliest programming stages and sustainable development of local research capacity can lead to significant development of the skill levels available to developing countries and help ensure the dissemination of scientific results."
"The Development Committee was very happy to commend this report, as do I here tonight."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pompidou, most sincerely on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for a really excellent report, and we shall certainly follow his recommendations."
"On the report itself, I should like to say the following: when historians come to write the history of the 20th century, the section covering the last 20 years of this century will probably be headed 'Globalization' ."
"For many years, indeed, we have seen the economic structure, the financial system and even environmental hazards assuming global dimensions."
"It is not only astronauts who see the world as a single entity."
"The world itself is developing an increasing number of common visions."
"But the coordination of many activities into one global action must not blind us to the fact that continental, national and regional conflicts are on the increase."
"Some of them, as you know, are discussed here in the House too."
"The Cold War may be over, but real wars, conflicts between groups, regions and states, have not subsided."
"In addition, we are increasingly conscious of differing attitudes on to ethics, tolerance and human rights, as well as to environmental matters and technological safety."
"These have become more visible, especially against the background of global competition."
"Now science - and this is Alain Pompidou's premise - can and must help to bring about a worldwide consensus on values and attitudes, on our relationship with nature, with the animal kingdom, with plant life and with our fellow human beings too - and thereby, I might add, to promote fair competition."
"The global scientific society must follow the global economy."
"In the same context I should like to refer to a study that was compiled by the Commission a few years ago about the different attitudes of Europeans and Asians to things like the living world and the inanimate world."
"Interestingly, it was found that Europeans make a clear distinction between flora and fauna on the one hand and human beings on the other, whereas in Asia, with a Confucian culture, humans and animals are seen as very much closer to each other, and the gulf between them and plant life is far wider."
"This is not a purely philosophical discussion; the phenomenon described here has implications, for example in the pharmaceutical industry with regard to experiments on people or animals, and it can even influence the competitiveness of entire continents."
"What I mean to say is that it is extremely important for us to develop, nurture and intensify a dialogue between the various cultures on values, on basic attitudes."
"Mr Pompidou rightly pointed out that we even have instruments for that purpose, namely the European Technology Assessment Network (ETAN) or the Scientific and Technological Option Assessment unit (STOA), as well as other establishments and instruments which feature in our budget, and I therefore recommend that we do not restrict our conception of broader scientific and technological cooperation to the economic or scientific domain alone but extend its scope into the realm of values, for only in that way can we lay the foundations for a global scientific society."
"We shall be supporting the resolutions tabled by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"Mr President, research and technological development have important social, economic and political ramifications. They contribute to improvement of the quality of life on our planet and are helping to provide solutions to the major problems currently facing human society."
"For example, in energy, and with regard to renewable energy sources in particular, energy efficiency, transport, the information exchange technologies, environmental protection, multimedia, biology and biotechnology, to mention just a few sectors, we can expect important developments, discoveries and inventions whose applications will have an enormous effect on people's lives."
"The establishment by the European Union of a stable environment for research and technological development, involving, as part of the process, the promotion of international cooperation in the various sectors - cooperation, that is, with other countries - which can act as a catalyst and increase the efficiency of research workers is therefore clearly essential."
"Cooperation and the exchange of knowledge in research and technological development are a sine qua non for research workers."
"They presuppose, of course, adherence to basic principles, and especially the protection of intellectual and industrial property."
"The cooperation must embrace basic research and research in respect of high technology and innovative products between universities and research establishments, with the involvement also of industry, and cooperation, of course, on large-scale programmes concerned with space, telecommunications, the information exchange technologies, multimedia, renewable energy sources, biochemistry and molecular biology and biotechnology and the environmental technologies."
"These agreements must promote the exchange of knowledge, via the use, especially, of global information technology networks."
"The involvement of the European Union's neighbours, namely the countries of the Mediterranean basin and of central and eastern Europe, the Baltic countries and the newly developing countries of the former Soviet Union, is important."
"The huge network of agreements, programmes and cooperative ventures will help to maximize efficiency in research and technological development and will certainly advance the search for satisfactory responses to the major challenges facing Europe and the rest of the world."
"In closing, I should like to say that this report to a large extent covers the points to which I have referred. It gives me pleasure therefore to congratulate Professor Pompidou on his truly excellent work."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by complimenting Mr Pompidou on his report and in particular the distinction he draws between scientific cooperation and technological development is excellent."
"Universities have been cooperating on scientific matters for a long time past."
"Even before there was any mention of an information society the universities already had EUARN (European Academic Research Network)."
"New advanced applications often come from the academic world, where there is good collaboration in the field of information technology."
"Now all European national research networks, associated in DANTE, have applied for a project TEN 34 which aims at linking all these networks by means of 34 megabyte optical fibre cables."
"It will be possible to carry out experiments and to develop European standards which we are so looking forward to."
"So it is incomprehensible for the Liberal Group that this project, which can really help us in the competition stakes has already been blocked by DG III and DG XIII in the Commission for a year past."
"I hope that in the future the Commission too will learn to cooperate so that international cooperation will be possible in the academic world also."
"Mr President, as a number of speakers have already stated, it is a very important and good report that Mr Pompidou has produced."
"I tabled several amendments in committee which Mr Pompidou and the committee endorsed."
"However, there is still one thing on which Mr Pompidou and I do not agree, and that is my amendment concerning plutonium."
"What we want to see is not the proliferation of plutonium, of course, but global cooperation to resolve the problem of plutonium and other fissionable material."
"In the Union alone there are today 340 tonnes of plutonium, which makes the resolution of this issue of the utmost importance."
"This can be done in cooperation with other countries which unfortunately also, like those in the Union, have large quantities of plutonium."
"Plutonium is dangerous and this is an issue which affects me as a young person a great deal because I know that something could happen involving it."
"International cooperation on this subject is therefore of the utmost importance."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, the two reports we have dealt with this evening - the Argyros report and the Pompidou report - are very closely interrelated."
"That is also demonstrated by the almost identical lists of speakers."
"As this debate draws to its close I really wish to confine myself to a very few remarks."
"First of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very clear report, which has brought a great deal of order to a number of instruments that had never before been properly collated."
"The devil, however, is so much in the detail here as in the implementation."
"For example, we are going to need clear statements on codetermination and on the possible cofinancing of research projects by third countries."
"There must also be decisions regarding the right to use the results of such research and regarding entitlement to subsequent profits."
"That brings us to the question of intellectual property."
"The absence of harmonized rules governing intellectual property is not unique to Europe."
"We shall also have to incorporate the national rules that already exist, of course, into international agreements."
"We shall have to guarantee compatibility."
"We shall also have to guarantee compatibility in any joint ventures that may take place between researchers and business, something that has not really been tried out at all in our part of the world and does not exist here yet as it does in the United States, for instance."
"But we also need compatibility between all the factors associated with venture capital and with mixed public/private funding."
"A great deal has been said today about all these points."
"There are many things we cannot regulate at EU level, but I hope that we here in Parliament - and in the Commission too - can provide inspiration and ideas so that national governments can work together to promote harmonization."
"Such harmonization will serve us well when it comes to cooperating at international level."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost I must offer my warmest thanks to Mr Pompidou for the quality of his report and of his work on this complex and multifaceted subject of international cooperation in research and technological development."
"Parliament has always shown a special interest in this question, and has undertaken various initiatives in this field."
"The fact that the European Union's programme of scientific and technological cooperation has extended to include new regions, such as the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean States, is largely attributable to the efforts of Parliament."
"This report and this motion for a resolution are a logical continuation of those efforts."
"In its communication of last October, the Commission tried to establish, for the first time, a general framework of thought and action regarding the Union's international activities in scientific and technological cooperation and to launch a debate on this subject between the institutions."
"Mr Pompidou's report comprises a very valuable attempt at clarification, and the motion for a resolution - while broadly supporting the Commission's approach - introduces a number of ideas which undeniably deserve consideration."
"Overall, then, the Commission can only express its agreement."
"Without going into detail about the very numerous articles contained in the resolution, I would like to make a few brief comments on three points."
"The resolution calls on the Commission to specify the arrangements for cooperation, by distinguishing between the various types of collaboration and the major categories of countries."
"I would remind you that between now and the end of the year the Commission will be presenting specialized communications on cooperation with, respectively, the States of Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean States and what we refer to today as the emerging economies."
"The resolution also calls for the Union's scientific and technical cooperation to be the subject of a prospective and collective evaluation by the Institute for Forecasting in Seville, the European Science and Technology Assembly, and the ETAN and STOA networks."
"I can tell you that a seminar on international scientific and technological cooperation, attended by representatives of all these bodies and of the Commission, will be held during the second half of this year."
"Finally, the resolution rightly emphasizes the need for closer cooperation between the activities of the Union and those of its Member States in this field."
"Work on this question has begun."
"The hope is that it will shortly result in the establishment of an initial basis for improved coordination, and I shall be sure to keep you informed of the developments that occur in this field."
"Together with the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence policy, on External Economic Relations and on Development and Cooperation have unanimously stressed the importance to the Union of international scientific and technological cooperation."
"The Commission intends this importance to be clearly reflected in its future actions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0166/96) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council (C4-0223/96-95/0093(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 1973/92 establishing a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (rapporteur: Mrs Marinucci)."
"Mr President, in Italy the name LIFE is currently being used by a group of secessionist tax refusers, so its reputation is none too good."
"In Europe, on the other hand, LIFE has become the banner of environmental protection, a programme which certainly does not have the range of the structural funds which should be used to restore and protect the environment, yet the experience of the first three years has shown that the projects financed by LIFE have produced great added value, especially in terms of demonstration and example."
"In fact, LIFE's role is to contribute to the development and implementation of Community policy and legislation on the environment, through specific measures geared to environmental problems in the various social and economic development sectors, measures which should give life and direction to investments made with the support of other Community or national financial instruments."
"To achieve this result, the LIFE rules need to be clarified, gaps filled in and obstacles eliminated."
"So the proposal for a regulation we are debating is intended to redefine, in the light of acquired experience, the projects eligible for financial support under LIFE, extend its field of application to the associate countries of central and eastern Europe, clarify the procedures for managing projects by making a distinction between nature protection and other activities, and improve the project selection process by defining new eligibility criteria."
"After unanimous approval by Parliament at first reading the Council forwarded the common position, albeit with some delay, which took up fully, substantially or partially a large number of the European Parliament's amendments included by the Commission in its modified proposal."
"There was acceptance of the introduction of a consideration on the application procedure for LIFE and on the general information procedure, to improve transparency and efficiency, and of a second consideration which defines the nature of the preparatory activities. The inclusion of air protection and the setting of a maximum intervention percentage for LIFE in the nature protection sector for measures affecting bird species threatened with extinction were also accepted."
"On the financial side, while not accepting the doubling of funds that Parliament voted for, the common position does provide for a review of the reference figure in 1997, recognizing that the interest shown in the LIFE programme is disproportionate to the available budget."
"So while appreciating the fact that Parliament's work was well received by the Commission and the Council, it is considered essential to table some amendments to reinstate the reference to rivers which flow into coastal areas and to the sustainable management of the wetlands created by such rivers; to reinstate the reference to the protection of water resources and water management to be provided for as part of the preparatory activities; to point out that the 3 % intended for assessment and support for activities must also be available for use with the remaining part of the first stage; to specify more clearly the assessment and selection procedure for innovative projects, whereas it is already clearly established that for LIFE-nature activities, reference must be made to the 'Habitats' directive. Lastly, we must insist again on the doubling of the budget."
"Finally, Mr President, may I thank the Members present, the officers of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and the Commissioner and her department for their assistance, and I hope the new regulation will be approved as soon as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of LIFE is to help develop and implement the environmental policy and environmental legislation of the European Union, especially in relation to the impact of industrial activity and the protection of nature, but also in the context of cooperation with third countries, particularly those of the Mediterranean Basin and of central and eastern Europe."
"In view of the broad spectrum of projects which it would be desirable to finance, the funding of the LIFE programme, though considerably increased by the European Parliament - for which I thank Mrs Marinucci - remains very meagre."
"That means that we must be very cautious in awarding these funds and ensure that the money is spent on useful projects."
"In the past there have been repeated complaints of a lack of transparency in the awarding of funds."
"The main root of the problem has been that no precise criteria for the selection of projects were laid down in the original LIFE programme."
"So the primary objective of the revised LIFE proposal under discussion today is to establish such criteria."
"Today's text considerably improves the catalogue of elimination and evaluation criteria for LIFE applications."
"On behalf of my group I very much welcome that."
"How the evaluation criteria work in practice remains to be seen and will have to be reviewed in due course."
"There is, however, one point with which I am not happy: LIFE can only make good its claim to be an instrument for the promotion of innovation in the industrial sector if the best available technology is taken as the starting point for innovative projects for the development of technological refinements, because otherwise we should find ourselves promoting a project in one Member State to develop technology that has already been in use for several years in another Member State."
"Given the shortage of funds, that is something we simply cannot afford to do."
"That is why I say that the best available technology must be used as the basis of evaluation when it comes to selecting projects for the further development of existing technology."
"The common position on the Directive defines the term 'best available technology' , which means that an agreed basis for the use of the term is already in place."
"For that reason I should like to ask Commissioner Bjerregaard again whether she does not agree with me on the need to include this in the LIFE programme, because that would be a consistent policy and position for the Commission and the European Union to adopt."
"If Mrs Bjerregaard could agree to that, perhaps Mrs Marinucci could also support my motion, for I consider it very important that we should not pursue a redundant policy but rather apply the rules that are needed."
"Some countries do need to catch up, and instead of being content to go on letting them lag behind we should ensure that their technology reflects the state of the art by providing them with the necessary funds."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is fair to point out that Community policy on the environment has been carried out ever more comprehensively and effectively."
"Even though it does not cover every aspect of the environment to the extent we should like, Community policy has encouraged in all Member States the development of programmes and projects aimed at environmental protection and consequently at improving the quality of life in the European Union."
"The proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of a financial instrument for the environment - the LIFE programme - which we support, forms part of this policy."
"But at the moment we should like to say how pleased we are with Mrs Marinucci's report, which considerably improves the proposal for a Council regulation, extending its field of application to rather sensitive areas such as the protection of wetlands of rivers flowing into coastal areas, the protection of water resources in general and the conservation or restoration of significant habitats of threatened species of flora and fauna and also because the report proposes a financial reference amount for the implementation of programmes, for the period 1996-1999, of ECU 600 million, 150 million more than provided for in that proposal."
"I should like to believe that the Member States will take proper advantage of all the aid this regulation offers them."
"And as regards particularly the ultraperipheral areas of Portugal - the Azores and Madeira - it is to be hoped that above all in the protection and rational management of coastal areas, in the protection and management of water resources (including waste or contaminated water treatment), in the reduction of toxic and dangerous residues and in all actions relating to the protection of nature, with special emphasis both on the preservation of the typical forest, exceptional and valuable - the laurisilva - or its restoration, and in other eco-systems, biotopes and species endemic to those islands, it will be possible to follow firmly and wisely the ways which are being opened up or enlarged as a result of the Community instruments fortunately being produced in the sphere of the environment."
"Mr President, many thanks to Mrs Marinucci for her very good report that we have been discussing here."
"'Environment' , it seems, is but a word, an empty shell."
"ECU 600 million had almost been voted by the Council."
"A majority of the ministers were on the point of agreeing, when things suddenly took a turn for the worse."
"Petty jealousies, concern that too much money might be poured into the South, finally won the day, and agreement was reached on ECU 450 million."
"Does this amount really reflect the wishes of the European people?"
"When I consider that in 1996 we are promoting tobacco production to the tune of ECU 1.1 billion and spending ECU 894 million on textile fibre plants and silkworms, I have to ask whether the European environment is not worth more than silkworms."
"What is more, this amount of ECU 450 million has been earmarked for a multiannual programme."
"This is downright scandalous, Mrs Bjerregaard!"
"There am I, on the one hand, protecting the livelihood of tobacco-growers, while on the other hand they probably have no clean water to drink and too little pure air to breathe."
"The one is really no substitute for the other."
"I should also like to mention the Commission's laxity with regard to the investigation of the misuse of LIFE funds in Italy."
"Why has it taken so long to institute proceedings?"
"This reticence on the part of the Commission is losing us a great deal of money every year!"
"Lastly, I wanted to mention that the inclusion of the countries of central and eastern Europe is very important to us, because environmental conditions in some parts of those countries are disastrous."
"But if that is mentioned as a priority, Commissioner, we must also be prepared to find the necessary resources."
"Where will you obtain the money for such priorities?"
"I am interested to hear that."
"Mr President, we shall support Mrs Marinucci's proposal for presenting these seven amendments again. We should like to draw attention to two of them."
"With regard to no 1, which relates to the conservation of rivers and wetlands, the Commissioner knows very well - in my country for example - the number and value of the wetlands and how they are deteriorating."
"I could mention many: Doñana, las Tablas de Daimiel, Santoña and so on."
"On the other hand Amendment No 5 proposes more funds."
"The problem always lies in the scant resources allocated for dealing with a programme like Nature 2000."
"DG XI itself has sent us today a very interesting bulletin, no 1, in which it is clearly shown how many countries there are which have still not started to designate their special areas for conservation."
"So it seems to us that this instrument in the first place needs to be effective and in the second place to prevent the disasters already occurring in fauna, flora and habitats which will wipe them out before the year 2000."
"This very week in my country, in the Island of Lanzarote, which is a biospheric reserve, military installations have led to the disappearance of a plant which is unique in the world. The only place in which it lived was the Risco de Zamara in the Island of Lanzarote."
"It seems to me that if the financial instrument is not equal to preventing that from happening and if we do not manage to set up this Nature 2000 network in the time envisaged we shall be losing a great opportunity."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner."
"LIFE has proved to be a successful environmental policy instrument, not least as far as Finland is concerned, judging by our experience of one year of membership."
"The proposed budget of ECU 450 million for the entire second stage of LIFE is, however, totally insufficient, especially if the intention is to broaden the scope of the instrument."
"As far as the share allocated to third world countries is concerned, where the problems are severe, the amount is really negligible, a mere five per cent."
"The effectiveness of LIFE should be safeguarded."
"In other words, efforts should be made to ensure that projects are implemented as planned, but monitoring problems should be solved other than by means of increased bureaucracy."
"Since the aim is to improve the procedure for project selection by laying down new criteria to govern eligibility for financial assistance, the entire application procedure should be made as clear and as open as possible."
"Projects should have genuine merit."
"With respect to industrial projects, particular attention should be given to whether the project really is innovative."
"They should promote the development and application of the most useful technology available."
"A clean, viable environment is fundamental to the future of mankind."
"We will not achieve real and lasting environmental improvements until such time as a sufficient number of people are aware of the real state of the environment and are willing to assume responsibility for it."
"This is why I consider it very important that the results of these projects are communicated efficiently, so that the information can be circulated as widely as possible."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to say that the Commission much appreciates Parliament's speedy second reading of the Council's common position."
"In addition I should like to take the opportunity to emphasize here this evening the reasonable and constructive spirit which has been typical of the work of the Committee on the Environment and I should like to give my special thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Marinucci."
"I am happy to note that we are approaching the target in the best possible conditions."
"It may be regarded as being the bright spot for the European environment and for the fruitful development which LIFE is trying to promote thanks to a creative strategy in which new methods and technologies are used."
"Personally I am quite pleased with the Commission's common position, which is the result of lengthy discussions and which represents a compromise which the Commission can use as a working basis in the period 1996-1999."
"Of course it is not a perfect compromise since the Council has not included some of the improvements which Parliament had proposed and which the Commission had accepted."
"But that is not so serious, since the most essential is included, and as the rapporteur, Mrs Marinucci rightly said, the text resulting from the common position has turned out clear and positive."
"The Commission thinks that the greater part of the amendments - and there are in fact only a few - put forward here in second reading, point in the right direction."
"The Commission actually accepted the first four in November last year and incorporated them in the modified proposal in January."
"Amendment No 6, tabled by Mrs Marinucci, is new and explains what is, in the Commission's opinion, a quite essential point."
"I share Mrs Marinucci's view that with no reference basis, the most suitable projects may be selected by a transparent application of the criteria in the regulation."
"The choice of the criteria to be taken as the basis, together with the procedure for selection of projects is the only way to avoid misunderstandings at the implementation stage."
"Although I can, therefore, concur with the procedure proposed, I must point out that it is impossible to incorporate Amendment No 6 in the regulation in view of the legal implications for the Commission's powers of initiative."
"I therefore undertake to draft a statement from the Commission to the Council on the basis of Amendment No 6 in order to call attention to Parliament's wishes."
"So I can say that the Commission accepts the principle of the amendment but will in due course give it a suitable form."
"Amendment No 7 can of course be accepted in the light of that statement replacing Amendment No 6."
"Mr President, I shall urge the Council to look again at the aspects raised by the amendments in the hope that it will accept this in principle, if necessary with certain adjustments in drafting."
"I must on the other hand admit that the Commission does not regard Amendment No 5 as being a step in the right direction."
"The amendment concerns an increase in the LIFE budget to ECU 600 million and in that connection I can only confirm that it was discussed at length in the Council and reiterate the Commission's usual view as regards form and content."
"With regard to form the Commission cannot agree with the idea of stating a specific amount in the document."
"With regard to content the Commission does not think that it will be possible with the present budgetary perspectives to go further than the Council's proposal to consider the situation afresh in 1997."
"At the present time therefore it is impossible to accept the idea of increasing the LIFE budget even though the ECU 600 million may be regarded as a compromise between the amount of ECU 800 million proposed in first reading and the ECU 450 million entered in the common position, which the Council decided to accept until the further assessment in 1997."
"In my opinion the essential factor is that the Council has recognized the disproportion between the interest in LIFE and the budget available."
"That shows in a way that the Council shares Parliament's view, as expressed here this evening, and that the Council is trying to improve the situation as far as possible."
"With regard to the amendment which has just now been put forward, namely Amendment No 8 introduced by Mrs Schleicher to Article 1(5) of the common position, which she was advocating a moment ago, I should like to say that the Commission prefers the more general text in the common position."
"According to the wording it is for the Commission and the Member States' experts to decide themselves whether the industrial technology which is to receive LIFE support is the best technology available, depending on whether an individual country or the Community is concerned."
"The Commission will therefore submit a remodelled proposal to the Council as soon as possible with a view to approval of the second stage of LIFE in June."
"If that comes about - and I think it is possible in view of the assurances I received from the Italian presidency - it will be due in my opinion particularly to the effective work Parliament and the rapporteur, Mrs Marinucci, have done, to Parliament's interest in the specific problems confronting us, which we must solve."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)"
"Extraordinary Council meeting of 3/4 June 1996"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has decided to deal in this session with the problems facing the European Union now that the spread of BSE has thrown the whole beef sector into crisis, with all the producers in the Member States suffering serious losses."
"The European Parliament also wishes to take a position on the attitude of one Member State which has been applying a selective policy of non-cooperation for several weeks, preventing the Council from adopting important decisions for the functioning of the European Union."
"As President of the Agriculture Council, which devoted its meeting of 3 and 4 June essentially to BSE problems, I am most grateful for the invitation to take part in this debate and report to Parliament on the outcome of the Council's last meeting."
"But I would first like to mention the approach taken by the Agriculture Council in its discussions since the British government laid the official information on BSE before it last March."
"The Council has expressed its determination to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of public health."
"As emphasized in the texts approved at the Council meetings of 1-3 April and 29-30 April, the priority has been to ensure a high level of health protection on the basis of the available scientific data."
"As you know, faced with the consequences suffered by the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union, on 27 March 1996 the Commission decided to introduce a temporary ban on the export of bovine animals, beef and beef products from the United Kingdom to other Member States and third countries, as a protective measure."
"Following this decision, the United Kingdom adopted a series of measures to eradicate and prevent the spread of BSE throughout its territory, and the Commission has been monitoring the implementation of these measures through repeated inspections."
"A report on the Commission's last inspection mission to the United Kingdom, conducted from 28 to 31 May, was presented to the Council on Monday 3 June."
"At the same time the British Minister for Agriculture presented a comprehensive plan for the eradication of the disease from the United Kingdom, and this plan should eventually produce a substantial reduction in the incidence of BSE in United Kingdom herds."
"The Council decided that all the new documents received should be thoroughly examined by the relevant Community departments."
"However, as you also know, the main item on the agenda at the last meeting of the Agriculture Council was the examination of the Commission proposal for a decision on partial lifting of the embargo covering the whole British beef sector."
"Essentially this involved permitting exports of three by-products: gelatine, tallow and bull semen."
"This proposal reached the Council after the Standing Veterinary Committee failed to provide an opinion on 20 May."
"On the basis of the current rules of procedure, the Council could then approve the proposal from the Commission by qualified majority, amend it unanimously or reject it by simple majority."
"After conducting a series of bilateral meetings with the various delegations to see if conditions for agreement existed, I had to acknowledge in the Council that there was no qualified majority in favour of the Commission's proposal despite certain changes which could have been made to the proposal to strengthen the criteria for opening up trade, in particular as regards bull semen."
"In fact it was on this last item, - semen exports - that there was strongest resistance from some delegations, and that meant there was no qualified majority."
"Immediately afterwards, however, I recognized that no majority of delegations existed in the Council to reject the Commission's proposal, so on the basis of the rules of procedure which apply in this case, the proposal will be adopted by the Commission under its own responsibility."
"Although some delegations could not associate themselves with this decision and thus prevented the Council from adopting it, the Commission has always maintained, naturally on secure scientific foundations, that the proposed measures will not prejudice public and animal health."
"In fact this is the criterion underlying the Commission's whole approach to lifting the ban progressively, only as and when the scientific evidence justifies it."
"You will be aware that the Commission adopted the proposed measures yesterday and they will come into force as from next Monday, 10 June."
"For my part I want Parliament to know that the Italian presidency, by agreement with the Commission and recognizing the delicacy of the matter and its human, social and economic repercussions, has left no stone unturned to gather all the detailed information needed to justify a decision to lift the ban, if only partially."
"I would also stress that even those Member States expressing reservations or opposing did so out of a sense of responsibility and without any punitive intent, but purely to guarantee the health of consumers through the strictest controls."
"There has already been major progress towards restoring consumer confidence with the United Kingdom's wellconstructed programme for eradication of the disease, as well as the confirmation of the commitment to make the exceptional effort equal to the gravity of the problem, obviously a priority for the United Kingdom which faces a worse situation than any other country."
"But the United Kingdom has repeatedly stated in the Council that it cannot settle for such piecemeal decisions and its aim is to obtain a Council commitment to a framework for step-by-step progress towards complete lifting of the ban."
"The United Kingdom is visiting the various capitals to this end."
"The British delegation was received yesterday evening by the Italian Foreign and Health Ministers and by myself."
"The United Kingdom has a very detailed framework programme for the eradication of the disease and is seeking a commitment from the European partners to examine and approve it quickly."
"The Italian presidency recommended thorough examination of the document by the European Commission and the appropriate Community scientific and technical bodies."
"This will take place over the next few days with a view to providing firmer scientific and inspection data on which to base a gradual and justified series of measures leading to a possible lifting of the ban."
"As regards the United Kingdom's aim - complete lifting of the ban - I want to stress that the Council clearly stated, in paragraph 6 of its conclusions of 29 and 30 April, that the group of measures introduced by the United Kingdom, their implementation, the appropriate controls established by the Commission, the programme for selective slaughter announced by the British authorities, the supplementary measures which have proved necessary and, finally, the equally necessary assurance that all future decisions will be based on solid scientific opinion, constitute reference points in a process leading to progressive lifting of the export ban, stage by stage."
"The Council is not hiding behind a safety measure taken against a sector of production in a Member State for economic and commercial reasons. Its every act is guided by the priority of protecting animal health and human health."
"The Council is already committed to taking the necessary decisions that will lead to the lifting of the ban once the United Kingdom has taken sufficiently credible action to permit a clear assessment of the eradication of the disease."
"The need now is to encourage the United Kingdom to pursue the eradication of BSE, and continue to show due solidarity towards this country which is so heavily committed to the reconstruction of the entire sector."
"In view of all this, the attitude the United Kingdom has adopted in the last few weeks, expressed in the policy of non-cooperation with certain decisions of the European Union, does not appear to be the best way of serving the common objective of preserving public health and progressively rebuilding the market through the positive effects of the health measures."
"It has been impossible to take important decisions for the operation of the single market in the areas of development policy, social affairs, the economy and finance because of the United Kingdom's non-cooperation policy."
"The President-in-Office of the Council and Commission President Santer have stressed in an official letter to Prime Minister Major that there is no justification for such behaviour. We also confirmed this yesterday evening to the British Foreign and Agriculture Ministers."
"We shall not fail to act in close solidarity with the United Kingdom to contribute to the eradication of a disease which has devastated that country's herds, but we expect the British government to restore the climate of reciprocal confidence vital to the proper functioning of our institutions by renewing respect for the common rules of conduct which make our Community a community of law."
"Encouraging signals are now being received from the British government and we look forward to definite confirmation."
"Finally, I want to remind the European Parliament that the last Agriculture Council meeting also dealt with the Commission proposal on emergency income support measures in the beef-producing countries of the European Union. These measures are proving increasingly vital as a result of the grave crisis sparked by BSE."
"The Council unanimously stressed the urgency and importance of these support measures, although many delegations made the point that the amount proposed by the Commission was quite inadequate compared to the loss of income suffered by European Union producers."
"Given the urgency the Council decided to ask the European Parliament for an opinion on this proposal in the next session of 17-21 June."
"Being familiar with parliamentary procedure, I recognize that the request for an urgent opinion from Parliament may create some difficulty, and obviously I must leave it to the European Parliament to take the decision."
"I am quite sure you all understand the spirit of this request and the need to respond rapidly to the expectations of Community beef producers who have seen their income seriously compromised and their costs of production significantly increased, while the prospects for market recovery and an upturn in consumption are extremely insecure."
"We must all work together to send a message of confidence to the world of the producers and to the consumers."
"So I feel sure the European Parliament, which is the most genuine expression of public opinion, will support us on the road we must travel together."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the House for the opportunity to provide an update today on the latest steps taken by the Commission to overcome the problem of BSE, which is wreaking havoc throughout the European Union."
"In particular, I should like to report on the events that have taken place in the last few days and over the past week."
"The Commission, as you know, took a decision yesterday about gelatine, tallow and bulls' semen."
"In taking that decision, the Commission was fulfilling its responsibility to take steps that will help to normalize the situation in the European Union."
"The Commission has enacted measures based on scientific knowledge, measures designed to protect public health, to help restore consumer confidence and to enable us in specific areas to take our first steps back towards the single market."
"The Commission decided on these measures long before the British announcement of a non-cooperation policy at European level and believes it is necessary to hold fast to this course despite any acts of political escalation."
"However, as the President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, explained to the House yesterday, the British policy of obstruction is making the work of the Commission increasingly difficult."
"Before dealing with the substance of yesterday's decision, I should like to report briefly on the other developments, one at a time."
"One thing that seems important to me is that last week from 28 to 31 May the second inspection took place in the United Kingdom."
"The main purpose of the inspection was to check on the implementation of the programme for cattle older than thirty months, cattle which must not enter into the human or animal food chain."
"In addition, observance of the ban on feeding animal and bone meal and progress in the introduction of a new system of animal identification were also checked."
"The programme for the slaughter and disposal of animals over the age of 30 months is now fully operative."
"By the end of May, around 80 000 animals had been slaughtered under that programme. The programme presents an enormous challenge to all concerned, and especially to the authorities."
"Some 200 auctioneers, 115 abattoirs, three cold stores, nine carcass disposal plants, various storage facilities serving as depositories for tallow and animal meal and twelve incineration plants have had to be involved in the implementation of the programme."
"The inspection team noted in its report that the British authorities were making great efforts to establish appropriate procedures for the proper implementation of the programme and to effect improvements which initial difficulties had shown to be necessary."
"There are still problems, however, with regard to individual aspects, such as coordination problems relating to certain bodies involved in the programme and problems with the settlement of compensation claims."
"What evidently makes the verification process particularly complex is that almost without exception the animals have been slaughtered in accordance with standard procedure and have been processed into products, such as animal meal, without adequate facilities being available for the destruction of such products."
"The products therefore have to be kept in storage until they are finally incinerated."
"I therefore believe that an organizational streamlining of the programme is desirable and would help the UK authorities to solve the present verification problems."
"The United Kingdom has also now been making great efforts to enforce the feed ban."
"I hope that the waste-return programme currently under examination, whereby feed residues from feed mixers and similar installations are taken back and disposed of, will provide additional safety."
"Two sets of talks were also held last week, one with representatives of the Portuguese authorities and the other with representatives of the British authorities about their respective slaughter programmes."
"With regard to the Portuguese slaughter programme, the various unresolved points were discussed here, and the Commission requested further information, such as epidemiological data, details of animal traceability and information on the feed ban in Portugal. As a result of this preparatory work, it should be possible at today's meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee to discuss the Portuguese slaughter programme in detail and, if circumstances permit, to adopt a decision."
"At the end of last week, the United Kingdom presented the Commission authorities with the draft of a very comprehensive slaughter programme comprising just over 120 pages as well as an extensive technical annex."
"This programme was also distributed to the Member States through the Council."
"The programme will now need to be discussed and examined in detail, and that will also be done by the Standing Veterinary Committee today."
"The opinions of the Member States on this programme are expected to be delivered at that meeting, and I hope that we shall be able to make appropriate progress today in this area too."
"The Commission and various Member States regard the realization and implementation of a selective slaughter programme as one of the key elements in the restoration of consumer confidence and in particular as a prerequisite of discussions on the framework programme requested by the British Prime Minister, Mr John Major."
"But let me now deal briefly with the three products to which I referred at the start, namely gelatine, tallow and bulls' semen."
"As you know, back in early April the Council adopted conclusions in which it asked the Commission to have its scientific committees examine the list of products covered by the export ban."
"This was done at various meetings held by a highly diverse group of committees in the course of April."
"The scientists there reached the conclusion that bulls' semen posed no danger and should therefore be removed from the list of banned products."
"Their conclusion on gelatine and tallow was that the establishment of safe production processes which guarantee deactivation of the BSE pathogen can eliminate any health risk connected with these products."
"In its conclusions at the end of April, the Council then asked the Commission to submit a proposal for a set of rules covering the aforementioned products in line with these scientific findings."
"The Commission responded to this request and on 15 May presented the Standing Veterinary Committee with a draft opinion."
"This was discussed in detail, but the Veterinary Committee has yet to deliver its opinion."
"In addition, at its meeting of 22 May the Commission, following the rules of the contrefilet procedure, decided to submit to the Council the draft opinion on which it had asked the committee to vote and asked the Council to adopt a decision on the draft."
"As you know, the Council discussed the draft in detail at its meeting of 3 and 4 June and put it to the vote, where it was backed by nine Member States, the other six Member States withholding their support."
"This meant that the procedure was to be continued, which was done yesterday."
"The Commission duly took the decision, empowering the President and myself to implement it on Monday, following the expiry of the statutory period during which the Council may take the decision."
"Let me explain briefly the ins and outs of this decision."
"It is not the case that the export ban on these products expires on Monday, so to speak. With regard to bulls' semen, we have no objections on the basis of the scientists' opinion."
"For that reason, bulls' semen can once more be sold within the European Union."
"As for gelatine and tallow, in our Regulation we have defined a safe process by which these products must be manufactured in future."
"It is also necessary, however, that companies which intend to produce gelatine or tallow obtain a licence."
"This licence will be issued by the British Government."
"The British Government is also required to notify the Commission of each licence issued; once this notification is received, a site inspection of the production facilities concerned will be conducted, to which the Member States will be invited."
"Only when the production process has passed this inspection will the Commission give the go-ahead for the marketing of the product in question."
"In this way, I believe, we have done everything that is humanly possible to fulfil the obligation to which I referred at the start, namely to give absolute priority to human health and safety."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the proof that Europe is gambling away not only the future of an economic sector but its own political survival on BSE was given by the strength of feeling in President Santer's voice when he spoke in this Chamber yesterday."
"Even here we feel rather powerless when faced with the distress of bewildered consumers who have lost faith in Europe's capacity to guarantee the absolute safety of their food, the procedural riddle preventing the Council, in such a delicate situation, from reaching a decision with a majority either for or against, the resurgence of nationalism and the deadly blows it deals our mythical single market, or the spectre of the policy of the empty seat, popular since time immemorial."
"What is to be done?"
"We might want to throw in the sponge and go home, saying the European project was a fine thing, but there were forces and beliefs too strong for it to overcome."
"But we cannot give in to that, we must make the right signals."
"Now, was yesterday's decision by the Commission on the partial lifting of the ban right?"
"It opens a window of opportunity, breaches the solid wall which would not serve the citizen well because it suggests ulterior motives."
"I know there is strong anti-British feeling in the countryside, but isolating the United Kingdom is no way to handle this crisis. The problem is a collective one."
"But we are also telling the British government and above all the British people that political opposition to Europe is no way to deal with their problem. Hindering Europol or the fight against racism is not going to gain them more attention for their legitimate national interests."
"Lifting the ban, by whatever means, will not restore consumer confidence."
"The more the table is thumped, the more obvious it is that there are no other arguments on the table. And it is the other arguments we have demanded: a plan for eradicating the disease which secures the assent of the European bodies and which attracts the European solidarity, including financial solidarity, we are all agreed on, plus support measures for the sector which not only add new money where plenty is already being pocketed, but also take account of the peculiarities and differences of the various European countries."
"All this can be done. It is reasonable, and shows political sense which is also common sense."
"But if political situations can be created for purposes of domestic political window-dressing, Europe will be in a permanent state of gelatine."
"Minister Pinto has brought us positive signals today and I do not think it is irresponsible optimism to say that more Europe is needed, not less Europe."
"Mr President, the Commission decision to lift the ban on the export of derivatives is very welcome news and it is, of course, consistent with the previous statements that Mr Fischler has made, on a number of occasions, on the basis of scientific evidence."
"I accept - Mr Santer pressed for this yesterday - that this is a decision of principle and I recognise that it depends upon British action in their programme of eradication of the disease, in an endeavour to restore confidence among beef-eating consumers."
"Many will say that the plan of action to exclude from the human food chain all parts of bovine carcasses which could convey infection, if it were transmissible to man, should have started five years ago."
"Well it did, because all ruminant material which could convey BSE to cattle was excluded six years ago."
"All cattle suffering from BSE have been slaughtered to date."
"That is 190, 000 of them since 1992, costing ECU 180m."
"A further ECU 63m has been spent on research and administrative controls have cost a further ECU 43m."
"The budget for research in the United Kingdom has been increased and the meat hygiene service budget also increased by £39m for additional control."
"These measures have had a clear impact; the number of confirmed cases has dropped since 1992 from 36, 000 to 8, 000 and it is still declining."
"I invite everyone to read and consider the further action programme, all 121 pages of it, and to consider what has happened."
"Since 29 March, 81, 648 cattle have been slaughtered under the Government's scheme of carcass disposal."
"Last week, the total slaughter exceeded 25, 000 and that includes the cold storage and 1, 500 further emergencies."
"In addition, 20, 000 calves have been slaughtered since 29 March, 4, 000 a week."
"We are very grateful to the Commission for the compensation and the added intervention and support measures which I hope have been agreed."
"With a framework plan of action for tightening measures for dealing with BSE, I hope we can now remove the crisis of confidence and restore normal trading as soon as possible."
"Confidence will only be restored by a rigorous and demonstrable enforcement of animal and public health control measures and I submit that it is time to get this issue back to science and away from political posturing."
"Mr President, we understand that Lord Plumb has to put a good face on a terrible story; we feel for him."
"Mr President, I presented the truth."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, these first speeches could actually make us feel moderately optimistic."
"But the fear is too great for us to surrender right away and lower our guard immediately."
"A great deal more needs to be done and even if we cannot remember as far back as the origins of this crisis in 1986, which indicate grave responsibilities on the part of those who failed to intervene immediately, we can at least get up to date on recent events. We do not forget that five people have just died and it seems that the causes can be reliably traced back to Creutzfeldt Jakob disease."
"This is no time to get carried away by optimism."
"True, there is no certainty that BSE can be transmitted to man but even after the thorough investigations of recent times, neither is there any certainty to the contrary."
"Well, between contamination and non-contamination lies an even more terrible evil and it strikes at the consumer. It is doubt, and while there is doubt they will not buy meat, and we all know what repercussions follow."
"Personally - but I think my group will feel the same as me - I am puzzled about the partial lifting of the ban on gelatine, tallow and bull semen."
"Lord Plumb will forgive me, but I am a little sceptical about the guarantees the British government is offering on the licences for these exports."
"If these licences are presented, I would ask the Commissioner to supervise the situation very carefully."
"The events of the last few days, the opposition and obstruction Minister Pinto has condemned, are a clear expression of the attitude the British intend to bring to this matter."
"The problem is very complex and involves scientific, agricultural, economic, psychological, political, institutional aspects."
"The way the situation has developed through the relationships between various institutions is not very clear, not very transparent, not very convincing."
"So how and what do we decide?"
"Solidarity with those affected, yes, but consumer protection and public health must come first."
"Commissioner Fischler has talked about this and given assurances."
"Now I want to ask him if there are sufficient resources to guarantee this action."
"We hope so!"
"Then there are the economic measures."
"ECU 650 million is not very much: a lot of people have said so and I agree."
"It would make matters worse if it were badly distributed."
"And there is some concern in countries like Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal which are net importers of calves."
"For instance, Italy produces 20 % of bullocks and according to early indications would only receive 6 % of this special intervention."
"Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, we shall be on the alert to make sure that insult is not added to injury!"
"Mr President, the embargo on British meat and derived products has achieved three things."
"It has protected the Union's reputation for the quality of its food."
"It has kept the internal market intact by preventing individual countries from erecting national barriers."
"And it has obliged the United Kingdom to adopt a number of measures at last."
"But it will still take some time before consumers' confidence is restored outside the United Kingdom."
"Even if the ban were completed lifted, most people would still not be ready to eat British meat."
"Now that the Commission has decided partially to lift the embargo I call upon the Commission to make sure that no Member State independently introduces new import barriers."
"Let the Commission also ensure that similar safety standards are applied in the whole European Union."
"But, Mr President, I want above all to speak of the political background to this crisis."
"The British ship of State is a rudderless vessel which has run aground on rocks of its own making."
"There is a bitter irony behind the many inconsistencies in the British position."
"By bringing an action before a Court of Justice whose powers it wishes to see curtailed, by resisting measures which it supports and by being politically rescued by the faceless Brussels bureaucrats, the British Government shows how very much British diplomacy has tied itself in a knot."
"After blocking 30 measures in less than three weeks perhaps we should even thank Britain because London has demonstrated how necessary it is to replace the unanimity rule by majority voting."
"But, Mr President, above all I should like to express today my deep concern at the emergence of a venomous nationalism in the United Kingdom."
"There is mention of a wave of insults against Germany and German citizens."
"That wave fills me as a citizen of the Netherlands and as a European with disappointment and shame."
"How easy it is, 50 years after the Second World War to summon up a xenophobic storm and to wallow in chauvinism."
"How easy it is to call up once more the demons of intolerance and prejudice which have so often disfigured European civilization."
"(Applause) How easy it is, ladies and gentlemen, for a government to encourage nationalism instead of resisting it."
"There is no honour in that strategy, ladies and gentlemen."
"Each of us, as politicians is faced with a choice."
"We can exploit prejudices or we can help to spread tolerance."
"We can excuse prejudices or we can oppose them."
"We can preach nationalism or we can strengthen the rule of law within the European Union."
"The conservative party has made its choice."
"That party has chosen nationalism as its electoral strategy."
"The conservative party is no longer the party of responsible government and of one nation."
"The conservative party has become the English national party."
"(Applause) Some courageous individuals such as Emma Nicholson, have made their choice."
"They have left the conservative party to join the only British party which consistently follows a pro-European line."
"It is time for those of her colleagues who share her concern to follow her example."
"By letting party interests prevail over the country's interests the conservative party has shown clearly where it stands."
"It is time for my conservative friends in the European Parliament to do the same."
"Let them put principle above party."
"Let them choose an England in the heart of Europe."
"Let them choose the only British party which is not ambivalent about Europe."
"Let them join the British and European liberals."
"It is time to make their choice."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, perhaps there is no need for me to mention the wrong approach taken by the British Government but you will perhaps allow me an observation on the functioning in this case of the Community institutions."
"The underlying problem with BSE is that political decisions have been subordinated to economic pressures in the United Kingdom."
"The disease originated with the introduction of meal of animal origin into animal feed and a change in the industrial processes to which it was subjected."
"Both of those factors yielded considerable profits and it is highly significant that when it was shown that meal of animal origin was responsible for BSE the multinationals pulled out of manufacturing animal feed so as to avoid responsibility."
"Yesterday Mr Santer told us that the Commission, faced with the blocking tactics in the Council, without any political pressure and on the basis of scientific evidence, decided on the partial lifting of the ban on gelatine, tallow and semen from the United Kingdom."
"But if blocking the Community institutions does not count as political pressure I cannot imagine what does."
"It is clear that the British Government has caused blockage in the institutions, forcing through the adoption of decisions which may adversely affect public health, because those products were originally included in the ban and the disease has not been eradicated so it must be feared that if at any time there was a danger, it has not disappeared."
"The Commission claims to have scientific evidence in this connection, but it is not publishing it or passing an appropriate opinion on to the relevant scientific bodies."
"Mr Fischler has just referred in his speech to the debate in the Veterinary Committee, which ended without any positive statement that the ban could be lifted."
"There are surprising arguments in the media."
"I cannot understand what the fact that the disease is not transmitted through the genes has to do with gelatine or tallow."
"We also hear about the report provided by an association of gelatine makers on the safety of those products."
"However, in the Commission's earlier decisions it was stated that in the present state of knowledge there were no known processes which could fully guarantee to render the infective agent inactive."
"It must be made clear that decisions are based on rigorously scientific grounds so that it may not be thought that economic interests and political pressures are taking precedence over protection of the public health."
"In this respect the Commission must produce any scientific proof it has for proposing a partial lifting of the ban, a description of the new experiments carried out, their results, the names of the people who have conducted them and the assessment of those experiments by the competent scientific bodies and in particular by the Scientific Veterinary Committee."
"Unless it does so, the impression will inevitably be given that the Commission has adopted decisions which may present risks for public health if there are no favourable reports from the competent scientific bodies."
"The line taken in the CAP has led to certain problems."
"The quest for competitiveness at any price encourages the introduction of methods and techniques whose long-term consequences are unknown."
"The CAP was set up at the beginning of the 60s to guarantee Europe's food supply."
"Now the situation has changed and we ought to be asking ourselves whether this is not the time for the common agricultural policy to cease to concentrate solely on quantitative aspects and begin to take action with regard to the quality of the food with which the European Union supplies itself."
"Mr President, there is no anti-British climate, either in the House or in our group."
"There is, however, a British Government which is irresponsibly banking on political and administrative pressure and creating an atmosphere in which nationalist chauvinism can rear its head again, which we should scarcely have thought possible."
"And there is a British Government which, by means of this political and administrative pressure, is preventing the necessary measures in the United Kingdom that could lead to effective suppression of this disease."
"Mr Fischler, this morning you have again been speaking of 'could' , ' should' and 'ought to' with reference to the measures that the British Government must introduce."
"You do not tell us what the British Government has done, because it has to be assumed that, apart from exerting political pressure, it has not done very much."
"It is true that the suppression of BSE cannot be restricted to the export ban alone."
"It is a European problem, as we have always said, not an English disease, so we all have responsibility to bear."
"But at a time when political pressure is being applied, a decision to relax restrictions sends the wrong signal and has nothing to do with scientific findings or responsible behaviour!"
"It is true, Commissioner, that the products to be derestricted - gelatine and tallow - do not belong to the most dangerous category and are ultraheat-treated, but, as you will also be aware, the latest findings show that this process does not kill the pathogens but only reduces their activity."
"And how you want to explain the lifting of the ban on bulls' sperm, when it is perfectly clear that the disease is transmissible from one generation to the next, is beyond me."
"I believe it is time to return to an objective discussion focused on BSE and to explore seriously every possible scientific avenue."
"The Commission should also present a plan at long last laying down the means by which, notwithstanding the present epidemic, proper beef production can be ensured, we shall no longer need to talk about BSE or to discuss any future antibiotics scandals, European agriculture can be set to rights and we can inspire confidence among consumers, sustained confidence that will endure beyond the present BSE scandal."
"Our group originally wanted to approve this joint resolution."
"We assumed that the Commission had not yet reached its final decision."
"We enquired about the scientific findings in order to substantiate our decision."
"But now you have crossed the Rubicon."
"The die is cast."
"That is why our group can no longer subscribe to this resolution."
"We retract our signature."
"We are opposed to a relaxation at this point in time and on the basis of the available findings."
"Mr President, I am glad this debate is taking place now."
"As you know, our group and the Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Group wished it to take place during the last part-session."
"It is certainly not before time."
"This is a crisis which affects the whole of Europe."
"I am a citizen of the United Kingdom but I think it is totally shameful and irresponsible of the UK Government to try to paralyse the entire decision-making mechanism of the European Union on this issue."
"Of that there should be no doubt whatsoever."
"It is even more galling when we think that this was supposed to be the great year of advance for Europe."
"With the intergovernmental conference we were going to try to bring Europe closer together."
"Instead, what we are getting is a series of petty veto measures - even measures which the UK itself argued for in the past are suddenly unacceptable and vetoed."
"So you find the hapless UK Minister for Overseas Development having to veto aid to Rwanda which she believes in."
"What a position for any government to put its own Ministers in!"
"I say to the UK Government that enough is enough is enough!"
"We have had the partial lifting of the ban which I welcome."
"I was glad to hear Commissioner Fischler's statement."
"It is time now for the UK to say this phase is over."
"They must re-think very seriously."
"What worries me - and I echo what Mr de Vries said - is that the irresponsibility of the UK action is leading step-by-step through a phoney war to a cold war to a tide of xenophobia which is sweeping through the tabloid press."
"Die Bild-Zeitung reproduced an article from The Sun which gave its readers twenty ways to annoy the Germans, would you believe!"
"One of them was to burn the German flag and to send the ashes to Chancellor Kohl."
"What sort of message is this to be sending across Europe, in particular when England is to host the EURO 96 football competition which will produce all kind of tensions?"
"I say to the House that the UK Government has unleashed a tiger."
"It will regret this and all of us in this House certainly deplore these activities."
"There is, however, some good news."
"An opinion poll published in Scotland this morning shows that the net result of the Conservative Government's campaign against Europe was that they have gone down in the opinion polls to 12 % in Scotland - half the percentage of the Scottish National Party which is on 24 %, though, I have to concede, well behind the Labour Party."
"That is the verdict of the Scottish voters on this anti-European hysteria which has been whipped up by the Conservative Government."
"The Scottish farmers are very worried."
"I spoke to one this morning who said they had given up hope."
"He said the crisis was supposed to be about helping the beef farmers - the Aberdeen Angus area which I represent - and they were getting absolutely nothing."
"Some farmers have benefited but some have lost business and received no compensation."
"The beef farmers are asking where the action is to follow the rhetoric."
"They are not at all impressed by what they have heard from Michael Forsyth, the Secretary of State for Scotland who controls the Scottish Agriculture Minister."
"I drew the House's attention to this man at the last part-session as the man who wanted to haul down the European flag in Scotland instead of flying the Scottish flag in Europe by saying let us have a special deal for Scotland, let us get things moving."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Santer, President of the Commission, told us yesterday of the decision on principle regarding a partial lifting of the ban, probably relying on the paralysis of the summer months to bury the matter permanently."
"I trust that he will be sufficiently touched by and sensitive to our legitimate questions not to confirm that decision on 10 June, whatever the political consequences may be."
"To err is human, but to persist in error is another matter."
"Mr Santer also told us that his only regret was that it had been necessary to wait six weeks in order to find a solution, alibi, compromise."
"Six weeks to make sure that the experts were infallible."
"Six weeks to make sure that the gates of paradise were open to all, to take an economic decision against the interests of nature."
"Commissioner, do you think that is reasonable?"
"If your heart fails to rule your head today, fear will soon do so."
"While we wait for that inevitable day, for which you will accept responsibility, let us stop expecting the worst and start hoping for the best."
"Morale will benefit, and so will our health."
"Commissioner, can you conscientiously take the consumer hostage now that he is refusing to consume high-risk products, having felt they represented a danger to his health?"
"Can you take hostage the tax-payer, who pays up with no guarantee of origin or quality and has other legitimate concerns than paying the bills of those who have made a lot of money out of him without committing themselves?"
"Can you condemn the farmers, including our British and Irish friends, their careers, their jobs, other than the job of burning carcasses, and at the same time the whole of European agriculture in every aspect of its production simply for having naively trusted a few unscrupulous multinational animal feed companies?"
"Can you, once again, leave it to European and national aid to make good lost revenue, soothe spirits and prevent liquidations and the resulting desertification of the rural environment?"
"You are well aware that this aid will be criticized by observers of the European Union's agricultural financing."
"We will not escape that criticism, and that goes for Parliament too."
"And, as always, the farmers will be in dock."
"All that remains will be to dream up a system of compensation between production operations to make quite sure that farmers are divided on the subject."
"Everyone will lose out: the tax-payer through the State, the farmers through their professional solidarity, and the administrative machinery as far as its operation is concerned."
"To conclude, Commissioner, given the present political complications of this matter, are we to allow political responsibility to assume, in the name of the Commission, something that is not a matter for your authority or jurisdiction?"
"That is why my group opposes the lifting of the embargo and, consequently, will vote in favour of the resolution, provided it is amended."
"Mr President, the lifting of the export ban on beef derivatives is a significant step forward."
"Equally, I am pleased that the British Government is at least showing some signs of constructive behaviour by apparently supporting the association agreement with Slovenia."
"That slightly modified stance needs to be taken much further."
"It is surely absurd that the British government is actually damaging everyone's interests by indiscriminately blocking measures which are in Britain's national interest and some of which were actually proposed by the United Kingdom."
"The saddest aspect of this whole business is the way the British Government has encouraged an unprecedented xenophobic, jingoistic rhetoric and practice."
"Surely such language has absolutely no place in the European Union or in any civilized society."
"The use of racist language and innuendo is a political tactic which will have a lasting and detrimental effect on both Britain and the European Union."
"It must be our task as democrats and as parliamentarians to do all we can to end this crisis. It must be our task to ensure that the ban is lifted."
"It must be our task to help ensure that consumer confidence is restored as quickly as possible and to ensure that, above all else, jingoism is never, ever, heard again in the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the cattle disease BSE has not only provoked a crisis within the European Union; above all, it has led to a significant loss of consumer confidence."
"Anxious consumers mean a reduction in sales, and that in turn means lower prices for beef producers."
"We are locked into a cycle here which has already produced unforeseeable effects and which we urgently need to bring under control."
"But the best way for us to do that would be to restore confidence in European meat production."
"We should therefore take a first step towards that goal by rigorously culling the BSE-infected herds."
"The introduction of a practicable system of identification marking for meat and meat products across the whole of Europe, animal protection standards that apply throughout Europe, intensified research efforts to discover ways in which BSE can be transmitted and a critical examination of yield enhancers, medicated feed additives and feed supplements, as well as their residues, are also necessary."
"Consumers must ultimately be able to find out where their meat comes from."
"The danger at the present time is that hasty measures will be taken through force of circumstances and will sap consumer confidence still further."
"This could be the case if the export ban were lifted without appropriate prior guarantees that the animalidentification system will work, for example, or that the ban on feeding with bone meal will not be contravened."
"In addition, continuous monitoring by the EU will be necessary in future."
"This is also the context in which the Austrian position in the Council should be seen, for at the present time we feel that the uncertainties are still too great."
"It is in the interests of no-one to maintain an indefinite export ban on British cattle, but it is surely in the interests of everyone that safety and quality of supply should be ensured."
"Let us not only regard the current problems as a disaster but let us also see them as an opportunity to take the proper steps in the right direction."
"Mr President, I wish to restate here this morning my confidence in Commissioner Fischler's handling of the BSE crisis."
"I welcome the partial lifting of the ban."
"The decision is based on scientific evidence and will bring some movement in the beef sector which is very welcome at this time."
"However, I urge the Commission to bring to fruition the compensation package promised to beef producers."
"At a time when the industry is on its knees with farmers facing bankruptcy and workers in the industry losing their jobs, it is disgraceful that the Council of Ministers is unable to reach an agreement on a compensation package."
"I also restate my view that the compensation proposed is totally inadequate and must be immediately increased."
"Beef producers were already facing heavy financial losses before the BSE crisis."
"I regret that the overall impact of the crisis on consumers and farmers is not improving."
"The latest statement, for example, by a British scientist that the disease is transmitted by cows to their unborn calves is creating further doubts in the minds of consumers."
"Where is it all going to end?"
"There are people out there with all kind of agendas and nobody knows exactly where the truth lies."
"We need urgently to concentrate on the public health considerations and what the position is there."
"My understanding is that there is no proven health risk and surely it must be possible to have a factual and credible statement with regard to this."
"In the meantime Britain continues to treat the Community with arrogance and contempt."
"It created this problem and Europe is now having to pay the price."
"If consumer confidence is to be restored, Britain must implement an eradication programme that will leave no doubts in the minds of consumers."
"That is what the European Community is committed to funding and it is not unreasonable to expect a satisfactory response."
"As I have stated here on previous occasions, this crisis is having a greater impact on Irish beef producers and on the Irish economy than any other Member State."
"I would like to hear Commissioner Fischler this morning confirm the effectiveness of Ireland's control programme which has been in operation since the first case was identified a few years ago."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I listened to the strong words spoken by Mr Santer yesterday and Mr Fischler today condemning the behaviour of the British Government, I could not help feeling that this tough talking is really only a facade behind which there lurks a strategy or tactics that will make it easier to give in to demands for an end to the embargo."
"Let me justify that assertion."
"If I say that it is too soon for the ban on these three products to be lifted, I am not denying that there may be conditions under which a very high level of safety can be guaranteed."
"But the fact remains that the conditions for lifting the ban at the present juncture have not yet been fulfilled."
"If we want to act fairly - and I am not one of those who seek to maintain the embargo in its entirety until the last vestige of uncertainty has been eradicated - we must assess, step by step, the success achieved in combating the disease and ease the ban in the same gradual manner."
"But the mechanism has been thrown out of balance."
"Success has not yet been achieved, nor can we be certain that the three products are absolutely safe."
"That is why the ban on these products has been lifted too soon!"
"The Commission should know that it has, to some extent, been left holding the baby."
"If the coming months are marked by dogged consumer resistance to many products containing gelatine and tallow, just as has happened with beef itself, this will have something to do with the premature lifting of the ban on these three products."
"I do not wish to be a Cassandra or to tempt Providence, but we know how volatile consumer markets are, and I fear that the same will happen with a wide, wide range of products as has been happening with beef."
"The Commission should know that."
"I believe we have really reached the point at which the BSE crisis may become a crisis in the European Union."
"The British Government has to take a considerable share of the blame - of that there is no doubt - but the actions of the Commission and of some Council members are fomenting this process."
"Where health is concerned there can be no half measures!"
"That is the foremost precept of the European Union and surely also of the British Government."
"Health is paramount."
"Nothing, but nothing, is anywhere near health in the list of priorities - just health, health and health again!"
"Only then, well down the list, come national sentiments and national sensitivities."
"That applies to the continent as well as to the British Isles!"
"My fear is that the Council and the Commission are frittering away the trust of European people in the European Union, and Parliament should have no part in this squalid process!"
"Mr President, Lord Plumb is an able advocate - nobody denies that."
"He told us movingly about the work going on in the UK to deal with BSE."
"Sadly he omitted to tell us how the mess was caused in the first place."
"He did not tell us who was responsible, who had been reckless with consumer interests and who had been reckless with the health interests of the population in the last fifteen years."
"However, not even Lord Plumb's advocacy - Mr de Vries will be very happy to hear this - can save the British Conservative Party from their own fate at the hands of the political equivalent of BSE."
"Only a programme of electoral culling can do that."
"It is more than two and a half months since the British Minister told the House of Commons of the possible link between BSE and CJD."
"Ten weeks later it is only this week that we have received a plan to deal with the problem."
"Incredibly, in spite of all the warnings, from here among other places, the Government had no contingency plan when the Minister made the statement in the House of Commons."
"Now we have two ministers touring the capitals on what they call a charm offensive."
"They do not include Lord Plumb because he is far too committed a European for that."
"But two ministers - I am not sure, incidentally, which one is charm and which one is offensive - are touring the European capitals."
"It is a bit like sending Saddam Hussein on a peace mission."
"For what they are not doing is concentrating on the eradication of the disease, concentrating on issues of consumer health and consumer confidence."
"In this Parliament we need to reorientate the debate to concentrate on public health, to recognize that there are still mysteries surrounding this disease."
"We do not know about transmissibility and we do not really know about its origins."
"We do not really know about the links with CJD and that is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are jointly running a hearing at the end of this month to investigate precisely these things, to throw some light in public on what is going on."
"Far too much of this debate and far too many of these concerns have been hidden behind a shroud of secrecy in the Council and elsewhere."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Working Group on Agriculture of the European People's Party held a hearing in February 1991 in the presence of Mr Meldrum from the Royal Veterinary Institute in London."
"As a consequence of that hearing, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on 12 March 1991 urging the British Government to ban human and animal consumption of beef from herds suspected of carrying BSE."
"At the same time the European Parliament called for the production of bone and animal meal as ruminant feed to be authorized only if it involved heating and sterilization at 134 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes at a steam pressure of bar 3."
"In the years that followed Parliament adopted further resolutions."
"There was virtually no response from the British Government."
"Mr Meldrum told us in 1991 that the feeding to ruminants of bone meal from infected carcasses had been prohibited in 1988 and that by 1993 - five years after the prohibition - the disease would be eradicated."
"Sadly, Commissioner, things worked out differently; the disease has survived, and farmers can only look on helplessly as the greatest of all food scares deters consumers from beef consumption."
"Carelessness and ignorance have prevented resolute and timely action to eliminate the disease."
"In this way the British Government has put its own farmers and its own consumers in a critical economic situation as well as endangering their health."
"This situation has now affected the whole of Europe."
"Farmers and consumers are deeply disappointed at the ineptitude of the British administration!"
"(Applause) The protection of health takes priority over the lifting of the export ban, as Mr Santer said yesterday."
"The decision to buy a product is taken by the consumer."
"The consumer wants to know where gelatine and tallow, as products or as ingredients in other products, come from and whether they are harmless."
"Commissioner, as a farmer I would never buy bulls' semen that has had to be sterilized beforehand, because you get no new life from sterilized semen, only empty cows, and I would not do that."
"I'm telling you that straight!"
"(Laughter, applause) To combat a swine-fever epidemic in Germany and in Belgium, hundreds of thousands of healthy pigs were put down."
"The farmers were up in arms, but they were not asked."
"Only when it was officially established that the disease had been eradicated was the export ban lifted in both countries."
"Only then could free trading be resumed."
"If we did not have the single market, the British Government would be left to carry the can for this whole debacle."
"Two hundred and fifty infected animals are still dying every week in Britain."
"That is too many for a relaxation of the export ban."
"There is still no sign of the epidemic ending in the immediate future."
"Let me say loud and clear to the British Government that only with BSE-free herds can consumer confidence return and these products become exportable once more to every part of the world."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, we have just heard the Commissioner who has just given us with a wealth of details the latest news about control of BSE with the basic criterion of safeguarding consumers' health - a criterion with which we agree -and has told us of the various plans for eradication of the disease, control of beef products and derivatives from cattle possibly infected with BSE, such as the destruction of the carcasses, sterilization of such products, monitoring at the stage of manufacture and inspection and a follow-up on the spot."
"That is all very well and we support these measures, although we might have wished they had been taken some years earlier so that the problem could have been stopped before reaching its present scale."
"In my country we say that if you do not stop a leak you have to repair the whole house and today the cost has been considerably greater since, Commissioner, the ECU 650 million which you have earmarked are the first, since you will have to keep on earmarking funds for that purpose."
"Here the Union's solidarity in the face of this serious crisis is demonstrated."
"One Member was saying that in a similar matter - African horse sickness - her country was left to cope alone, and that should not be the position either."
"The ban is to be lifted on trade in gelatine, tallow and semen."
"As regards the first two - gelatine and tallow - we are speaking of cosmetics, food, soft drinks, chocolates, sweets, sausages, doughnuts and so on. It seems, according to what the Commissioner has just said, that technically control by sterilization methods is guaranteed."
"But I have my doubts about semen since the measures we have heard about, such as sterilization, as the word indicates, would leave it useless."
"And I wonder how the ban can be lifted from the movement of semen when it is not only unproved that the disease is not transmitted through the genes but when there are fundamental aspects of these diseases which make it clear or suggest that there is genetic transmission, since they appear in given sectors of the population with similar characteristics and in totally closed environments."
"Commissioner, the health of consumers is the first consideration."
"We must not play with these things. We must control the problem we are speaking of and above all follow things up in the country of origin to prevent possible escalation of the problem at Union level."
"Mr President, in everyday life if not in European politics the penalty for blackmail is imprisonment."
"The British Government, which is blocking all European decisions in order to obtain the abolition of the ban on tallow, gelatine and bulls' semen, is rewarded by having its demands met."
"So no-one must be surprised if it acquires a taste for that and continues with its policy of blackmail."
"Now it has already announced that it will continue blocking all European decisions until there is also an agreement on total abolition of the export ban on British meat."
"I seriously wonder how the British Government thinks it will ever restore confidence in British meat if it goes on so clearly treating mad cow disease not as a health problem but as a political issue."
"The extent of the present crisis is clearly the product of thoughtless deregulation and maladministration on the part of the British Government."
"But the export ban has to be viewed in another light against the import ban on British meat and meat products which it now appears have been applied by countries such as the United States and Argentina since the late 1980s."
"Why has no publicity ever been given to that import ban, Commissioner Fischler?"
"Why has that never been contested as import bans are normally contested?"
"Perhaps because it was then thought that the Americans and Argentineans were perhaps right, in other words, and I should be glad to have an answer from the Commissioner, as to whether the EU has not been negligent in only now proclaiming the British export ban."
"Mr President, I would like colleagues to focus on what we do now and next week."
"This is an appalling problem, it can be solved and the resolution of it lies in our own hands."
"We now have an eradication plan on the table and the derivatives ban has been lifted, courtesy of the courage and persistence of Commissioner Fischler."
"Yesterday, President Santer asked for a de-escalation of the British policy of non-cooperation with Europe."
"Last night he got it from the British Foreign Secretary in Rome, announcing that we would not veto the association with Slovenia."
"What we need to do now is concentrate on establishing a framework for the progressive lifting of the main ban."
"The British Government is not asking for dates, it is not asking for anything to be taken on trust; it is asking merely for the establishment of a framework."
"That can and should be delivered."
"It would be easier for it to be delivered if people abandoned some of the rhetorical tricks they have been using this morning."
"I do not know quite whether I am more irritated by the recruiting campaigns of my Liberal Democrat and Scottish Nationalist colleagues, or by the Labour Party's habit of behaving like a nervous jackal, circling around this issue and frightened to bite in case they damage Tony Blair's frail reputation for patriotism."
"This is not clever, what we need is a resolution of this problem and that means an early negotiation of a framework."
"I would like to say to my friend Mr de Vries that you are right to raise the demon of nationalism, but this is 'pitch' and you must be careful how you throw it around."
"If colleagues in this House start quoting the poisonous drivel from The Sun and attributing it, however indirectly as Mr Macartney was doing, to the actions of a party they oppose, that is dangerous."
"It sticks and plays precisely to the nationalist demon that lurks in all countries and in all parties."
"I beg us all not to do that and concentrate on completing a perfectly simple negotiation on the framework for raising this ban over time when it becomes scientifically justified."
"Mr President, I am sure you will join me in thanking the Commission for their continued effort towards finding a solution to the on-going crisis in the beef industry."
"Only through dialogue will solutions be found which are satisfactory to all those who, through no fault of their own, have become involved."
"It is in the interest of all parties and Member States to ensure that consumer and animal health throughout the Community are safeguarded and we have a responsibility to do so."
"For that reason I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Collins who has pointed out that a number of questions remain unanswered."
"For example, questions about epidemiology and transmissibility."
"The urgent need for increased and coordinated research has so far been largely ignored as efforts have been concentrated on emergency solutions to a crisis situation which should have been avoided."
"Not only must we also establish an information programme for consumers but the means should be made available to answer the questions that need to be answered before consumer confidence is restored."
"The final point I would like to make is one which I have made before and will continue to make."
"Whilst I welcome the aid package which has been proposed by the Commission, assistance has only been extended to farmers and the slaughter industry."
"The plight of others is being ignored."
"To date, 36, 000 people in the United Kingdom, employed in the beef industry, have lost their jobs and many others are likely to do so."
"Some of those people are with us today in the visitors' gallery."
"The United Kingdom recently handed back ECU 200m, which was earmarked for the agricultural processing industry, to the Commission."
"I call upon the United Kingdom Government to spend that money for the purpose it was intended; to help those employed in rural industry."
"I urge the Commission and Parliament to ensure that they do so."
"Our task is to bring an end to the crisis for all those affected and not, as the British Government seem to be doing, continue down paths which deepen rather than solve problems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to deal very briefly with some of the interventions we have heard, because I think it is important to spell out the basis of the Commission's deliberations."
"Moreover, I believe the situation is serious enough without the addition of any distorted representations, which I should like to dispel."
"With regard to bulls' semen, I was asked where there had been a scientific decision or recommendation on this matter."
"Well, the Scientific Veterinary Committee adopted several conclusions at its meeting on 26 April. The first of these reads as follows: ' The committee concludes therefore that semen does not present a risk of transmission of BSE' ."
"I believe that this constitutes a clear recommendation, and we have acted upon it."
"And by the way, Mr Funk, we too are shrewd enough to work out that we cannot sterilize bulls' semen if it is to achieve its intended purpose!"
"(Laughter, applause) And so to gelatine and tallow. What we decided upon begins with the definition of a process, as I explained earlier, and goes on to define a procedure."
"Among other things, item 3 of Article 1c states that, after consulting the Member States in the framework of the Standing Veterinary Committee, the Commission will determine when dispatching can begin."
"In other words, the date from which tallow and gelatine may actually be exported again has not even been set."
"I therefore marvel at all those who already know that the ban is being lifted too soon."
"I believe we must remain consistent and logical here, otherwise we run the risk of not being taken seriously."
"I was also asked how further controls will be organized once the first checks have taken place."
"It is laid down in Article 1b that every consignment from the United Kingdom must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by a veterinary health officer, which must affirm that the product in question was produced in accordance with the requisite standards and must state the frequency with which official checks are conducted."
"One thing is already clear to all of us in the Commission: the health and safety of consumers must be the supreme imperative."
"On the question of assistance to the affected producers and what the Commission is doing in general to overcome the economic crisis, the 650 million under discussion must not be seen in isolation; the other expenditure must also be borne in mind, especially the cost of intervention."
"These intervention measures, of course, primarily help the processing industry; they also help the abattoirs and those who work there."
"Fifty thousand tonnes of intervention stocks cost ECU 120 million."
"In April and May alone we bought up 115 000 tonnes of intervention stocks and have just put a further intervention of 50 000 tonnes out to tender."
"These purchases alone amount to ECU 400 million, and it is a regrettable fact that we cannot foresee these measures bringing us out of the woods, so to speak, and that further interventions may well be necessary."
"And finally, you have to add on the expenditure for private storage aid for veal, for the slaughter programmes for calves and particularly for the programme being implemented in the United Kingdom for animals over 30 months old, as well as for the selective slaughter programme that has yet to be adopted."
"All of these measures added together naturally produce a considerably higher amount, more than double the 650 million debated here."
"I should also like to add that we have three more projects in the pipeline."
"The first stems from an initiative that won broad support in Parliament, namely the desire to create a multidisciplinary scientific body to discuss complex issues of this type, not only BSE but future issues in general."
"Secondly, we have received notice from the Weissmann group, as it is now being called, that it will draw up a scientific programme enabling us to commission research projects to examine questions such as transmissibility from one species to another or transmissibility from animals to humans or whether it is possible to test live animals for BSE."
"The third project that is under way concerns the question of labelling, and the Management Committee for Beef and Veal, serving here in an advisory capacity, has already met, so it will now be up to the Commission to formulate an appropriate proposal for future action."
"But one thing is clear."
"We must surmount these acute difficulties now."
"That does not mean, however, that we can then return to business as usual, but rather that we shall then have to sit down without delay to revise the existing rules for the sake of the future of cattle-farming in general."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Financial services and movement of natural persons"
"The next item is the report (A4-0171/96) by Mr Kittelmann, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, as regards matters within its competence, of the results of the WTO negotiations on financial services and movement of natural persons (COM(96)0154 - C4-0272/96-96/0105(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report outlines the results of the WTO negotiations on financial services and on movement of natural persons in the framework of the multilateral trading system."
"The GATT Agreement signed in 1994 by 76 contracting parties had hitherto applied only to trade in goods and has now been supplemented by a General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)."
"In December 1994 the European Parliament gave its assent to the results of the Uruguay Round."
"GATS is an integral part of the legal framework of the multilateral trading system."
"It covers the entire range of services, including financial services."
"Its first part sets out the general principles and rules, while the second part comprises lists of specific concessions on market access, which correspond to the tariff concessions made for trade in goods between WTO members and to trade in goods in general."
"As is the case with trade in goods, the basic principles are those of most-favoured-nation treatment and national treatment."
"It was clear from the very beginning that services markets could only be opened up in stages."
"The commitments arrived at in the Uruguay Round therefore represent an initial, in some cases cautious, step towards the liberalization of trade in services and need to be supplemented by further negotiating rounds."
"For this reason the negotiations were highly constructive but also very lengthy, and it is regrettable that the United States ultimately felt unable to sign the agreement, which confronts us with the problem that, despite the various extensions of the negotiating deadline, only 90 participants, though still an impressively large number, arrived at an agreement without the USA."
"With regard to the overall content, it may be said that in many participating countries the business prospects for foreign banks have been improved."
"Financial institutions and insurers can upgrade their operations, either through branches on the spot or through cross-border transactions."
"The attitude of the United States remains disappointing."
"Several U.S. withdrawals from various negotiations in recent times makes one wonder where U.S. trade policy is headed."
"Although not all the results of these negotiations have lived up to our expectations, we can still give our assent to the results as a whole."
"And I do mean 'assent' literally."
"The Commission had proposed that Parliament merely be consulted on the conclusion of the negotiations, a proposal based on the first subparagraph of Article 228(3) of the EC Treaty."
"This, however, is at variance with the second subparagraph of Article 228(3), which makes parliamentary assent to the conclusion of international agreements mandatory if they entail 'amendment of an act adopted under the procedure referred to in Article 189b' (codecision procedure)."
"It would be illogical if assent procedure were not applied in this case."
"Whoever gives assent to a procedure is also entitled to give assent to any subsequent changes in the procedure."
"I believe this represents an inadmissible attempt to curtail the rights of the European Parliament."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, which was consulted on this report and delivered its opinion, endorses our position and also pleads the case for assent procedure."
"We are grateful to the draftsman, Mrs Schaffner, for her report."
"I should like to conclude by making a few remarks on the timescale within which the European Parliament has had to deal with this matter."
"The negotiations were completed at the end of last July."
"The results are to enter into force no later than 30 July of this year."
"Following the end of negotiations it took nine months for the Commission proposal to be tabled and a total of ten months before it was referred to Parliament."
"It is neither comprehensible nor acceptable that it took so long to draw up a 16-page proposal, with the result that Parliament has had scarcely more than a month to discuss it."
"How can a proper balanced process of parliamentary deliberation be implemented under these circumstances?"
"The fact that we have managed to do this and to subject the proposal to serious examination is due to the speed at which the Committee on External Economic Relations has been working."
"I should like to thank all of my fellow Members for helping to put this through so quickly."
"Let me say to the Commission and the Council that this highly disrespectful treatment of Parliament cannot be tolerated or accepted much longer."
"I ask the House to approve this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, as so often these days, we have good news and bad news."
"The good news is that the proposal was referred to Parliament and the committee at all."
"Our thanks go to the Commission for that."
"The bad news, and I urge the Commission and the Council to take this properly on board, is that the rapporteur had good reason to point out that we do not intend to deliver an opinion but to give our assent; we believe this simply reflects valid Community law, for two quite straightforward reasons."
"The first reason is that it is the extension of a treaty - GATT - to which we had to give our assent."
"It is the logical sequel and the logical consequence of this that all further negotiations resulting from the treaty should be subject to parliamentary assent as a matter of course."
"It makes no sense to seek our assent on the original question but not to have us approve the results of the follow-up negotiations, which are just as important and relevant; furthermore, as we now know, our political responsibility has become even greater, because GATS is a very important element in the World Trade Organization."
"The second reason is that GATS is an international agreement, and international agreements are now referred to us."
"I simply ask the Commission and the Council to take note of that and to let Parliament perform the duty which is incumbent upon us and which we are prepared to discharge in a responsible manner."
"There is another piece of good news, thanks once again to the Commission."
"This is the second time I have thanked you today, because you have really done some excellent work."
"You undoubtedly prevented the collapse of the talks during the negotiating rounds."
"We know how difficult the Americans were as negotiating partners, in the talks on the telecommunications element of GATS as in other domains."
"Here too, you negotiated exceedingly well, for which I offer you our special thanks."
"This should send a signal to the United States, urging it simply to regard liberalization as a philosophy that should be followed throughout the world."
"The United States has almost always been the leading exponent of free trade, but now it is abandoning the principle wherever awkward situations arise, and that must not happen!"
"The Americans really must see the process through and stop merely pushing national and regional interests."
"That also applies, incidentally, to our debate on Helms-Burton."
"I ask the United States to take this message to heart."
"Mr President, I rise with mixed feelings to speak in this debate as regards both the procedure and the substance."
"We naturally welcome the fact that the Council has consulted Parliament on the agreement negotiated in the framework of the World Trade Organization."
"But we are disappointed that the Council has preferred the consultation procedure to the assent procedure."
"We are also disappointed that once again the Council is allowing Parliament such a short time for giving its views."
"That is becoming a habit."
"It has taken some ten months for the Council to consult Parliament."
"Now Parliament has very few weeks if the date on which the agreement takes effect is to be observed."
"As regards the substance I shall be very brief."
"I refer to our colleague Mr Kittelmann's excellent report."
"But I should like to express the hope that the concessions in opening up the markets will increase the commercial opportunities for banks, financial institutions and insurance companies."
"It is a pity that the United States has felt unable to take part in the agreement."
"That will not perhaps have any dramatic effects as regards our relations with the United States, but it undeniably reduces the credibility of the World Trade Organization."
"In conclusion I should like to say this: Parliament must be consulted according to the assent procedure whenever agreements concerning the World Trade Organization are involved."
"That is moreover the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs too."
"We may therefore hope that Parliament will accept Mr Kittelman's two amendments contained in his report."
"Finally one last observation."
"Parliament must protect its institutional position not only within the European Union but also within the World Trade Organization."
"I think Parliament must therefore do everything necessary in order to be represented by a delegation at the ministerial conference in Singapore in December next."
"It would be inconceivable if Parliament were unable to attend."
"Mr President, the agreement on financial services was adopted almost a year ago and has only now been referred to Parliament, shortly before the deadline."
"We know that it had been a bone of contention for years."
"We know that many developing countries had very serious objections to this agreement and to one-sided liberalization of trade in services in general."
"Among their objections was the fact that, although the agreement was intended to create freedom of movement for major banks and insurance companies, it contained no provisions on the free movement of persons."
"A concession has since been made to the developing countries, but this does not alter the fundamental issue."
"We also know that the United States has not acceded to this agreement, so a major international trading nation is missing."
"What we do not know, however, is how this agreement will affect employment in Europe and in the Third World."
"The WTO is conducting secret diplomacy, and the European Commission seems bent on outdoing it for secrecy."
"Not even the competent parliamentary committee was duly informed."
"Two years ago we were already sounding warnings to the effect that the WTO would mean less democratic control by parliaments and citizens."
"To rush through in this way, without time for careful scrutiny, an agreement with such far-reaching implications for people's lives cannot be justified to the voters who gave us our parliamentary mandates."
"That is why we shall not vote for this agreement."
"Nor can I share the euphoria about the liberalization of world trade that is prevalent in parts of this House."
"On the contrary, I fear that if we continue to pursue this ambition we shall liberalize ourselves to death."
"Mr President, the liberalization of services would be a significant step towards the worldwide liberalization of trade if the United States did not refuse to approve it."
"The agreement that was achieved certainly offers easier access to new markets for European businesses."
"That will have some beneficial effects, especially in the fast-growing markets of the developing and newly developed countries."
"However, without the approval of the United States, which leads the field in international competition, the liberalization of service markets has been severely disrupted, to put it mildly."
"When this decision is implemented, great care will also have to be taken to abide by the principles of mostfavoured nation treatment and national treatment."
"Otherwise the agreement could very quickly turn out to be an exercise in self-deception."
"Liberalization also presupposes scrupulous observance of the legal provisions governing the capital and liquid resources of financial service enterprises."
"The point that this Council proposal would have benefited from better cooperation and above all from parliamentary assent has already been adequately expounded."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to congratulate Mr Kittelmann on his report which gives a very accurate and clear description of the World Trade Organization negotiations on financial services and on movement of natural persons."
"As you all know, in July 1995, the European Community made a decisive contribution to the conclusion of these negotiations."
"The excellent results obtained under the Community's leadership have confirmed Europe's position in the World Trade Organization, which will need to be further consolidated in the future."
"The proposal for a Council decision, which confirms the commitments made by the Community, is the final step in these negotiations."
"The deadline for acceptance of the legal instruments implementing our commitments is fixed for the end of this month."
"Here I must sincerely apologize for the fact that the proposal for a Council decision has been presented to you at a relatively late stage. This was principally due to the various procedural stages, such as the legal verification of the timetable for the commitments which we had go through in Geneva."
"As I have already said, the Council decision, proposed by the Commission, will allow the Community to confirm the results of the Geneva negotiations."
"This is based on numerous articles of the Treaty on European Union which generally speaking reflect the sectors covered by our commitments in terms of access to the market and national treatment in relation to financial services and movement of persons."
"I wish to specify clearly that none of these commitments involves any amendment to the acts or legislation in force in the Community but simply reflect the current degree of liberalization on its territory, without going any further."
"The co-decision procedure under Article 189b, mentioned in the Kittelmann report, applies only when an international agreement gives rise to the amendment of an act adopted according to the procedures provided for in that article."
"This does not apply in the present case, so Article 189b cannot be invoked."
"I also want to clarify some points that were made on the connection between the conclusion of this negotiation and the results of the Uruguay Round."
"The Uruguay Round package presupposes the creation of a new institutional framework with binding legal rules and disciplines."
"The assent of the European Parliament was asked for on that basis."
"That is how the World Trade Organization was created and is now operating."
"But the position here is different: as the introduction of a new institutional framework or new rules and disciplines was not provided for, the criteria under Article 228(3)(1) do not apply."
"Finally I would like to emphasize, Mr President, that the Commission has thought long and hard about the type of opinion Parliament should be asked for."
"For the reasons I have just given we did not consider it appropriate to apply Article 228(3)(1) which provides specifically for assent."
"So Parliament is being asked to give its opinion on the basis of Article 228(3)(1)."
"I conclude by emphasizing the need to take a decision rapidly to confirm the Geneva results. We reiterate the importance of the role played by the European Community and the commitment undertaken in this multilateral process."
"Recent developments demonstrate that the leadership of the European Community is undeniably necessary."
"Here I would also like to express my thanks for the recognition accorded to the Commission's conduct of the negotiations."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Votes"
"Madam President, I would have liked to say a few brief words before voting began, because I have been somewhat surprised today by the turn that events have taken in this House."
"I would remind the House that I asked an oral question in March, together with other Members incidentally, regarding the problem of the so-called dangerous sects. Now I have learned from the press that a meeting was being held here, under normal conditions on 6 June, in the premises of the European Parliament, organized by the scientologists."
"I do not say that scientology is a dangerous sect."
"I have my own opinion on the matter. Even so, I do find it a bit much for Parliament to have authorized a meeting of this kind."
"Furthermore, I learned this morning that the meeting had been cancelled at the last moment."
"So, Madam President, I would like us to be a little more scrupulous when requests of this kind are received by Parliament, and I would prefer us not to appear ridiculous in the eyes of outsiders."
"I cannot tell you whether that meeting was really authorized or had simply been announced, but I am taking note of what you say."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Kingdom of Morocco is destined by its history, its splendid civilization and its geographical situation to be an essential partner for Europe, and especially for France, which is linked to it by long-standing ties of friendship."
"That is why bilateral agreements between Morocco and the European States concerned could usefully extend these relationships into the future."
"On the other hand, the multilateral agreement between the European Union and Morocco which is before us today smacks of a project to globalize the economy, generating imbalances and destroying the roots of nations."
"Not only that, but this agreement is incompatible with the principle of national preference, which seems to us more important than ever."
"I am thinking especially of national preference in employment, at a time when millions of men and women in France, as throughout Europe, are the victims of unemployment."
"That is why we voted against the von Habsburg report, which reflects a policy of which we disapprove."
"This general policy only serves, in the long run, the interests of a handful of multinationals and the globalist lobby."
"I did not vote for the von Habsburg report."
"It is a most inappropriate time to make this agreement with Morocco."
"We have sacrificed our principles of defence of human rights on the altar of trade."
"We have abandoned the people of the Western Sahara for this shoddy and shabby deal on trade."
"Therefore I cannot support this agreement."
"Madam President, I did not vote for this report either, along with numerous other Austrian Social Democrats, because it effectively forestalls something that the world and Europe have long awaited."
"It is not as if the inhumanity and the escalation of the conflict with Polisario had happened yesterday."
"Efforts to find a solution have been going on for years, and it is quite obviously the case that Morocco has no interest in an amicable settlement."
"Nor are the human-rights violations a new phenomenon."
"I am not prepared to pay the piper before he plays the tune."
"I should have considered it more appropriate to state clearly that there should and must be such an agreement but only if Morocco fulfils the clear conditions that this Parliament has stated in its resolution."
"Madam President, it is because we would not wish on Morocco something we reject for ourselves that we have not voted for the association agreement with that great country."
"Because, more and more, we are seeing the fateful effects for nations throughout the world of Treaties inspired by the single notion of free trade."
"Now, hardly has this agreement been approved than we find Parliament voting to make Morocco a ward of court, accused of failing to respect human rights - rights which, as we know, are very unstable here, in what might be called this multi-track Europe."
"Rights that have been violated in France where, to use the words of the famous journalist Annick Rigel, the Stalinist Rocard-Gayssot law has set up an intolerable thought police, whose origins she, for her part, was able to name without the danger of being accused of the crime of crimes."
"So let us first put our own house in order, by breaking with the single-track thinking and totalitarian methods worthy of the Brave New World, before we start giving lectures to the Kingdom of Morocco."
"Parliament earlier rejected ratification of the financial protocol between the EU and Morocco precisely because of the Moroccan government's infringements of international law."
"According to a report from Amnesty International (18 April 1996) the Moroccan security services are guilty of serious violations of human rights, in contravention of international human rights conventions which have been ratified by Morocco."
"Another major problem is Morocco's systematic boycott of the process to implement the UN Security Council's resolutions that a free referendum should be held concerning the independence of Western Sahara."
"The European Union has a responsibility to help ensure that Morocco develops into a stable and properly functioning parliamentary democracy which respects freedom of speech, freedom of organisation and the freedom of the press."
"To enter into an association with Morocco under present circumstances would mean going back on our demand that Morocco should introduce real democracy and respect human rights."
"For this reason we will vote against the report."
"The Portuguese Socialists are voting for this Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Morocco, conscious that the historic aim of the opening up and cooperation of the European Union with the countries to the south of the Mediterranean is the condition for political stability, economic development and peace in the region."
"Morocco is, moreover, one of the markets with the greatest potential for Portuguese exports, which have been gradually increasing and are on the whole favourable with a positive export cover rate of 160 (11 500 million escudos of exports in 1994)."
"This agreement, like the goodwill already shown by the Moroccan authorities and in particular by His Majesty the King, in favour of cordial and friendly relations between Morocco and Portugal, will now provide great opportunities for Portuguese firms."
"On the other hand this association agreement has also opened the way for a new fishing agreement between the European Union and Morocco, of fundamental importance for the economy and for employment in fishing areas such as Sesimbra/Setúbal and the Algarve."
"And without an association agreement there will be no fisheries agreement: we cannot have the sun shining on the threshing floor and rain on the turnips..."
"The agreement is naturally based on a compromise between the contracting parties, which in our case, as far as Portugal is concerned, brings constraints in the field of competition, particularly in the sardine processing sector."
"The Socialist Members are also in favour of a specific Commission support framework, apart from the structural funds already assigned in the TAC, which will make it possible to bring about a restructuring of the sector, the establishment of a compensatory indemnity, the preservation of storage aid and the launching of a campaign at Community level to encourage consumption of sardines, whether fresh or processed or in new products (for example sardine paste)."
"But the processing industry must also recognize that, within the world economy as a whole, competitiveness will be based on quality and commercial dynamism, not on protectionism, and that is also the best response to social and environmental dumping."
"This House has voted in favour of the association agreement between the European Union and Morocco, and I welcome that vote."
"By making this gesture we have accepted the conclusions arrived at by Mr von Habsburg, and I congratulate him on his excellent work."
"We all have at heart the process of renewal of the European Union's Mediterranean policy, established by the Barcelona Conference."
"In giving our assent, we are keeping faith with the desires we expressed."
"This agreement will stimulate Morocco to expedite the opening-up of its economy, with a view to a free trade area."
"In addition, economic cooperation will be strengthened, with the aim of supporting and developing sectors that create jobs."
"That leaves the matter of human rights, an argument of which much has been made by the supporters of a 'no' vote."
"It is my deep-seated conviction that this question should be integrated into the actual philosophy of the association agreement."
"We are giving a clear political signal to the Moroccan authorities to continue along the road towards liberalization, political as well as economic."
"Finally, let us also remember that the fisheries agreement has already received the assent of this House."
"Not to give our assent to the association agreement would have made no sense at all."
"Paradoxical as our vote may have seemed, it was more a vote against the way in which the European Union has behaved in the negotiations with the Kingdom of Morocco, particularly with regard to the consequences which this agreement will have for Portugal, than an actual vote against Morocco which, we are convinced, will sooner or later have to be our partner, even if as an associate country."
"The question for us is simple: those who negotiated and signed this agreement on the part of the European Union did so from a global viewpoint - which was inevitable - but, whilst safeguarding the interests of some, they forgot to safeguard the interests of all the Member States of the European Union to which we belong."
"Obviously we are speaking of essential questions, as essential as the productive sectors of a little economy such as ours and, let us be clear, assuming that the ever-growing problem of human rights would be solved."
"The agreement now approved has in itself some good aspects; it will bring the people of Morocco closer to Europe and will have the effect of bringing Europe closer to the people of Morocco."
"We have always been and shall always be in favour of an agreement with Morocco."
"But because it affects our agricultural sector (for example as regards fruit and horticultural products such as tomatoes and early potatoes as well as flowers (particularly from Madeira), because it affects our industrial sector (for example the processing sector) and because it affects our fishing sector - although that was the subject of a special agreement for which, moreover, we voted - we think this association agreement should be condemned."
"Above all, it is worth repeating, because of the way in which Europe protected (or rather did not protect) one of its Members."
"But we still hope that although the agreement is for an unlimited period the Kingdom of Morocco and Portugal will be able to cooperate and show, as regards the healthy relationship which must exist between these two countries in the sense that they draw closer together without provoking one another, that there was no need to harm essential sectors of the Portuguese economy so that an agreement, a good agreement between the European Union and Morocco could be signed, this time with our vote in favour."
"We are sure that the Kingdom of Morocco will see the importance of the way we have voted and that the European Union will understand it."
"Farassino report"
"We regard the design and issuing of driving licences as a matter for national governments, not only in the EU but throughout the world."
"There is no need for a special EU driving licence."
"The principle laid down in Article 1 of Directive 91/439/EEC concerning mutual recognition of national driving licences is entirely sufficient."
"In view of the above we are voting against the report."
"This directive has been improved considerably since the first reading."
"I am therefore voting for it."
"However, I regard the whole idea of an obligatory common driving licence for the different countries of the Union to be wrong."
"Each country should have the right to decide for itself on the design of driving licences."
"The directive will only give rise to unnecessary change-over costs in the Member States."
"Adoption of the common driving licence model should at least be voluntary."
"Marinucci recommendation"
"I want to express my support and that of the Green Group for the Marinucci report on the proposal to amend the regulation establishing LIFE."
"The fact that the common position took up a large number of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading is a positive sign."
"However certain amendments not included in the text of the common position are very important in our opinion, especially inclusion of the wetlands in the protection and rational management of the coastal area, protection of the habitats of threatened species and, above all, increasing the funding from ECU 450 to 600 million, as proposed by the Greens in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which roughly splits the difference between the initial request from the European Parliament (ECU 800 million) and the Council proposal."
"LIFE is the most important Community environmental programme, and amongst other things it should initiate the network of protected areas known as 'Natura 2000' . Carrying it out as planned with the allocation proposed by the Council is unthinkable."
"I hope the Commission will support the point of view of the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"I only wish to repeat what I said in my speech during first reading."
"LIFE is the financial instrument which has done most to help our environment and although the common position covers a considerable number of the amendments submitted by the Committee on the Environment, there is one submitted by me which is of special importance with regard to the protection and management of water resources."
"I have no doubt that the amendment will be accepted as the Commission told us in the previous debate. I shall therefore vote in favour."
"Parodi report"
"The Commission's communication on the common transport policy action programme 1995-2000 has many serious failings from the environmental point of view."
"The Commission wants to keep transport policy and environmental policy separate, which will result in unsustainable development, in view of the fact that the effect of road transport on the environment is one of the most serious threats facing the European Union today."
"The proposed green paper on the internalisation of external costs and citizens' networks is a positive element, however."
"In its report the Committee on Transport and Tourism has tabled a number of proposals to improve matters, but as a whole the proposed action programme nevertheless takes the enormous challenges facing transport policy with regard to environmental adjustment far too lightly."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism describes transport and the trans-European networks as 'the basis for social, economic and cultural development' ."
"We regard this description of Europe's cultural development as a somewhat gloomy and narrow conception, particularly in view of the fact that the trans-European networks will mean that the area taken up by motorways in Europe will increase by 32 %."
"It is against this background that we abstained in the final vote on the Parodi report."
"We have voted for the report and the amendments from the Greens, including paragraph 41, integrity, Amendment No 12 by the Green Group."
"We assume that the phrase 'harmonised at European level' means 'minimum rules' which permit Member States to retain or introduce more stringent environmental and safety standards, not least where permitted alcohol levels and speed limits are concerned."
"I believe that the time zones which countries belong to and the summertimes they adopt are national matters where the principle of subsidiarity should apply."
"I oppose the requirement that less state aid should be provided for rail transport while heavy goods vehicles do not have to pay their own environmental costs and state aid is provided for the construction of motorways."
"It should be possible for the requirement concerning emergency telephones along European motorways to be modified in accordance with the extremely low traffic density which exists in northern Scandinavia, in order to avoid unreasonable costs being incurred."
"A common rule on the maximum permitted blood alcohol level is desirable but I would like it to be possible for stricter national requirements to be applied, as well as a zero level for all drugs."
"I should also like to observe that support for airports in thinly populated areas, at the expense of big airports, following the Swedish model, should be allowed to continue."
"For the rest, I welcome the proposals concerning environmental adjustment put forward by the rapporteur."
"I would stress that changing over to a transport system more suited to the environment is of the utmost importance if European industry is not to fall behind."
"Having twice adopted a position on the White Paper on the future development of the common transport policy, the European Parliament now finds itself confronted with a legislative framework programme defining the Commission's priorities on measures to be adopted for the period from 1995 to the year 2000."
"Mr Parodi's report, following on from the Topmann and Visser reports, admittedly represents a valuable inventory of technical achievements and future objectives, but takes no account, or insufficient account, of the human and social aspects."
"My apprehension is confirmed by the fact that the Commission document contains the following passage: ' It must be emphasized that although, as is generally held, human error seems to be the essential factor in accidents, that error is always profoundly influenced by the technical features of the vehicle and the layout of the routes.'"
"Although it is true that the technical features of vehicles and the layout of the routes may have a direct influence on the causes of accidents, it is no less true that one of the main causes of serious road accidents is deeply and genuinely associated with the extreme tiredness of professional drivers, caused by excessive weekly working hours and rest periods that have been cut to the minimum (daily rest periods of 11 hours, which can even be cut back to 9 hours, three times a week - weekly rest periods of 45 hours - working hours fixed to a maximum of 78 hours per week, as laid down in Regulation 3820/85)."
"It is true that the European Parliament has on several occasions called, unsuccessfully, for genuine fiscal and social harmonization."
"It is no less true, however, that negotiations between the social partners have hitherto been fruitless and that a satisfactory solution to the problems of the working conditions of the professional drivers seems likely to be postponed indefinitely."
"So I would have preferred and hoped that Mr Parodi would comment in his report on questions like the working and driving hours of professional drivers, tougher checks, observance of working and driving conditions, the harmonization of penalties for breaches of rules relating to driving times and rest periods, and the prohibition of piecework."
"I believe the problems I have just mentioned are of quite crucial importance for safety, and indeed for the improvement of road safety."
"Since Mr Parodi's report virtually avoids this subject, I feel obliged to abstain in the vote, although certain other proposals made by Mr Parodi seem to me to be acceptable."
"Plooij-Van Gorsel report"
"As I did not have the opportunity to speak when the report was debated in plenary I would now like to give an explanation of vote on the subject."
"I believe greater emphasis should have been placed on the waste which partly accounts for the administrative costs of 13 %."
"Corresponding costs in normal research programmes are between 2 % and 3 %."
"Where future research programmes are concerned we must make sure that stringent measures are taken to keep down administrative costs."
"In the research world it is generally acknowledged that bureaucracy and high costs are typical of EU research programmes."
"This state of affairs should be properly reviewed and appropriate measures taken."
"Argyros report"
"This report from the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy constitutes an excellent analysis of the Commission's green paper on innovation."
"Three fundamental considerations in this report should be emphasized."
"The first is that you cannot directly equate the concept of innovation with research and technological development since innovation must be regarded first and foremost as a function of the interplay between the technological supply and demand."
"Innovation involves to a very high degree the application of technology in production and the life of the community."
"The other consideration is that to strengthen innovation as a means of improving the international competitiveness of European industry presupposes a more rapid availability and utilization of the results of research and technological development."
"The third consideration is that the attempt to put a centrally regulated industrial policy into effect at national or European level according to the 'pick the winner' principle has not, according to experience, had the effect of promoting innovation."
"In those circumstances I can entirely concur with the rapporteur's conclusions according to which the European Union's role as regards the elaboration of an effective innovation policy should be concentrated on ensuring on the supply side of research and technological development that the information produced is interdisciplinary and application-orientated and on promoting on the demand side of research and technological development the obtaining and application of research results through a consumer-orientated network."
"Pompidou report"
"As is stressed in this report from the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, this is the first time an attempt has been made at European level to lay down certain overriding rules for the Union's cooperation with third countries in the sphere of science and technology."
"For the same reason it is also the first time the question has been raised in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"Amongst the Union's partners for cooperation within Europe and outside the report makes a distinction between associated third countries in Europe, competitor industrial countries in North America and the Far East and a series of potential partners for cooperation in the third world."
"The committee's rapporteur, Mr Pompidou, rightly emphasized the importance of the stage of technological development of partners in cooperation, their geographical situation and the extent to which their interests in research and technological development coincide with those of the European Union for the sake both of the choice of projects for cooperation and of the form that cooperation is to take ."
"So far as choosing the form of cooperation is concerned the rapporteur discusses three possible models for cooperation, namely association, bilateral cooperation and cooperation with technological assistance."
"With regard to the choice of projects for cooperation the main thing appears to be to strengthen research and technological development cooperation on problem-solving within different infrastructure-related spheres (such as, for instance, transport, communications, exchange of information, provision of energy) together with protection of the environment within the framework of EU cooperation with associated third countries in Europe and the Mediterranean region."
"Research and technological development cooperation within spheres such as for example biotechnology, nuclear technology and space research, in addition to cooperation on research in and development of various high-technology products, can with advantage be strengthened within the framework of a partnership with non-European industrial countries."
"One decisive condition for stepping up cooperation with the last-mentioned group of countries is however that cooperation should take place on the basis of the principle of reciprocity and with due consideration for the need to protect partners' intellectual and industrial property rights."
"Non-admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe"
"Madam President, the fact that Croatia is not being admitted to the Council of Europe on the pretext of a supposed absence of press freedom really is a peak of Parliamentary hypocrisy."
"Because, after all, who would venture to claim that the press is freer in Russia - to name but one instance - than it is in Croatia?"
"Croatia had to conduct a heroic struggle for its independence before reestablishing its economy."
"And admittedly, we who maintain close links with the opposition know that Mr Tudjman's present government is persisting in practices that still reflect socialist customs, which are difficult to get rid of. But it really is a bit rich to complain of that here, in this House, when, this evening, every channel in France is going to be broadcasting a single programme."
"A single broadcast about Aids, which seems to be regarded as the only illness worthy of sympathy, a hundred times more so than cancer or muscular dystrophy or all the other illnesses put together."
"What strange exclusive criterion, what strange variety of racism treats such things as acceptable at home but criticizes them in Croatia?"
"Madam President, we in the Freedom Party also regret the actions of the Croatian Government in relation to the appointment of the Mayor of Zagreb and the restrictions on the opposition and on freedom of the press, and we call for a rapid improvement in the situation."
"However, in awareness of Croatia's difficult position after waging a long and brutal war to obtain its freedom, we believe that this brusque rejection of Croatia for the aforementioned reasons, especially when compared with the treatment accorded to Russia or, as was mentioned earlier, Romania, is heavy-handed and counterproductive."
"The votes of some Members may also reflect a delayed reaction to Croatian independence, which some groups accepted reluctantly."
"This, however, would be the wrong way to lead a country scarred by years of Communist dictatorship and by civil war towards the Western European fold."
"For that reason we reject this resolution."
"Extraordinary Council meeting"
"Madam President, my group believes that we have no alternative today, for the protection of human health, but to maintain a complete ban on British beef and veal and their derivatives even if it does mean finding the resources to pay appropriate compensation to the farmers concerned."
"At first sight this may seem a difficult line to follow, but if we fail to follow it for the sake of simplicity we risk regretting it bitterly in a few years' time."
"So let us act responsibly."
"And acting responsibly includes analysing the underlying causes of the crisis and implementing the essential remedies to ensure that it does not recur elsewhere."
"First, let us acknowledge that mad cow disease is the result of unnatural agricultural practices, embarked upon in a mad race for world market prices."
"This deplorable approach is now engraved on the heart of the new common agricultural policy."
"Unless we undertake a radical change in direction, we must be prepared for other mad cows, or worse, in future years."
"Secondly, we must also recognize that, in the name of abolition of frontiers, the Commission has been slow to react at every stage of the crisis, trying to prevent those states that wish to do so from adopting protective measures."
"After all, it is quite possible that the chaotic state of frontier controls has facilitated the fraudulent importing of contaminated meat or cattle feeds into mainland Europe."
"We must accept that States have the right to control their frontiers for the objectives stated in Article 36 of the Treaty, in particular the protection of human life and health."
"Finally, we cannot accept the procedure that has been followed, and a situation where, although the Council has not adopted the Commission's proposal by a qualified majority, the Commission nevertheless has the right to implement it of its own volition."
"That, they will tell us, is what the Treaties say."
"Well, our answer to that is that the Treaties are absurd."
"This abdication of responsibility by the politicians in favour of civil servants dishonours the Council and helps to explain much of what is wrong in Europe."
"Madam President, in my view the British Government is making itself look very silly in the present circumstances."
"However, I regret that today's resolution was a very substantial change from the resolution we passed on 28 March."
"Now we seem to be supporting the ban rather than being an interested, neutral observer."
"I would rather we have maintained the position whereby we were an observer of the ban rather than a supporter of the ban."
"A few nights ago I was in my hotel room watching German television. I watched a programme on ZDF and as a British citizen from a beef area I was appalled at the almost hysterical attack on the British beef industry in that programme."
"I found some of the scenes quite distressing and quite offensive."
"I have been very critical of the way the British press has been talking about our partners in Europe in recent weeks."
"I would ask that the continental media show some balance in the way in which they report the subject of BSE."
"Madam President, my answer to Mr Hallam, in particular, is that our British colleagues and the British government are scientifically right: there is no danger of horizontal transmission and the culling of cattle is scientific nonsense."
"But he is wrong legally, because what characterizes Europe is error, and the responsibility for error, or at best objective responsibility, the responsibility for risk."
"One British factory, the Dunkester factory in Yorkshire, by changing its manufacturing processes, has poisoned 156, 000 British cattle to date, and a few others elsewhere in the world."
"Well, that is a matter of responsibility."
"Every human act that causes damage to another person obliges the party responsible for the error to put things right."
"By rejecting Mr des Places' amendment, which was an attempt to fix responsibility on the polluter and the poisoner, we have gone against the flow of what is characteristic of Europe, the principle that each individual is responsible for his acts."
"What we rightly accepted in the case of the Amoco Cadiz disaster, the principle that the major oil companies were to be held responsible for the pollution, we have rejected in the case of the British factories responsible for spreading poison."
"Scientifically, Mr Hallam, you are right: the risk is exaggerated."
"Legally, you are wrong: the factories that caused the poisoning should have been held responsible for it."
"I abstained on account of Recital E, which recommends additional support for agriculture of several billion."
"I consider current agricultural support to be wasteful and do not wish to contribute to further subsidies for this sector."
"Madam President, I voted against the resolution."
"I should have expected the European Parliament to signal far more clearly that consumer protection and public health are not subordinated to economic interests in the European Union."
"The decision taken by the Commission makes a mockery of consumer protection and public health."
"The relaxation of the export ban at a time when more and more cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are coming to light can only lead one to conclude that such a decision is based on sheer cynicism."
"The Commission, the Council and even, to an increasing extent, the European Parliament are buckling under the blackmail tactics of the British Government."
"It is to be feared that the Commission's decision will pave the way for the complete lifting of the export ban."
"I believe it is a totally misguided decision, because consumer protection and public health must take priority."
"We must practise preventive health care."
"As long as scientists cannot rule out a health risk, we must try to have the export ban maintained."
"That should have been our aim."
"I believe that this decision taken by the Commission shows total disregard for consumer protection and public health in the European Union."
"That is why I regret that we did not adopt a more radical resolution."
"That concludes voting time."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 6 June 1996."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, in particular from the region concerned, have asked me to make a short statement on the bombing in Manchester last Saturday."
"The IRA bomb injured over two hundred people, many of them seriously; it caused vast material damage to the centre of Manchester."
"It is almost a miracle that hundreds of people were not killed."
"There is no possible or conceivable justification for the IRA bomb."
"The targets were ordinary men, women and children shopping, on Saturday morning, in a busy city."
"What possible cause could justify such barbarism?"
"The aim of the bombers is clear: to destroy peace; to shatter peace talks, which have just begun in Belfast, following the courageous efforts of the two governments, the democratic political parties and the community of Northern Ireland."
"The European Parliament expresses its sympathy for those injured by the bomb in Manchester last Saturday, and our hopes for their speedy and full recovery."
"I am writing to the Lord Mayor of Manchester to pass on this message to the injured and to their families."
"I am sure that I speak for the whole House when I say that the cause of peace must not be abandoned because of intimidation by terrorists."
"(Applause) Terrorism can be defeated by the courage and steadfastness of communities and their leaders, to keep the peace process moving forward."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, as the Member who represents the constituency where this terrible atrocity took place, I want to thank you for the comments you have made on behalf of all the House."
"I know that my constituents, as all the colleagues here, share those views."
"I simply wish to add a tribute to the members of the emergency services whose prompt and professional actions saved many lives."
"Without those actions there would indeed have been a terrible mass murder."
"This was the largest explosion of its kind on mainland Britain since the Second World War."
"We should be very thankful that, despite the efforts of the bombers, at least no-one died."
"But terrible damage has been caused and we all share your condemnation of this atrocious act."
"Mr President, I should like to speak on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Members of the European Parliament, all our constituents and indeed the 99.9 % of the Irish people who would like to be associated with your remarks on the atrocity committed by the Irish Republican Army in Manchester."
"In the circumstances of the peace process there is no justification for this, or in any other circumstances for that matter."
"I endorse your view that this House must support in every possible way the peace process."
"I want to thank you for your statement and I want to extend sympathy on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Irish Members to all those injured and to the people of Manchester and to wish them well in the future."
"I appeal to the men of violence to lay down their arms, to stop their murderous acts of violence in Ireland and elsewhere."
"Again, Mr President, thank you for your statement."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Parliament, I wish to welcome 40 honorary consuls who have taken their seats in the official gallery."
"They are members of the Federation of Consuls in Europe, which is holding its annual meeting here at the European Parliament."
"You are very welcome!"
"Order of business"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 June 1996 pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Mr President, I should like to give an account of something that happened recently and ask the presidency about it."
"Last Friday a demonstration was held in Brussels by a trade union representing metal workers and its route passed close to the European Parliament buildings in rue Belliard."
"When the demonstrators marched below the pedestrian walkways joining the Belliard building to Van Maerlant (at about 1 p.m. on 14 June 1996), various European Parliament staff members and/or members of different political groups noticed that certain individuals dressed in civilian clothing and armed with walkie-talkies were filming demonstrators from these walkways."
"According to the huissiers they were not members of the European Parliament's internal security forces nor could they have been, given what they were doing."
"Nor were they visitors."
"Who were these people filming the demonstrators?"
"Were they police officers?"
"If so, who authorised their activity?"
"Can you give me any information on this matter, Mr President?"
"Could you please just put your headphones on, Mr Novo."
"Firstly, you may have heard me announce that the next item was the order of business."
"I could not see that what you were saying had anything to do with the order of business."
"Secondly, you can send your comments to me in writing, and I shall look into the matter."
"You will also then receive a reply."
"For this week, there are no amendments."
"On the July part-session in Brussels:"
"For Wednesday, 3 July 1996, I have a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists for the report by Mr Pelttari on the bioethics convention to be postponed."
"The PSE Group is asking for this report to be postponed to the second part-session in July."
"The exact date will have to be fixed by the group chairmen, since we cannot decide that here, but we can of course decide on the postponement."
"Since no one wishes to speak in favour of or against the request, I put it to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request) The order of business is thus established."
"Deadline for tabling amendments and motions for resolutions"
"Mr President, as you know, we have a discussion and a resolution on the summit meeting on Florence."
"Part of that, according to most groups I imagine, will be to make some sort of statement from this House on the British Government's policy of non-cooperation in Europe."
"As you know, the Foreign Affairs Ministers are meeting today to discuss that issue and I wonder, therefore, whether on just that single issue we could shift the deadline so that we can take into account in our resolution what is decided or not decided tonight by the Foreign Affairs Ministers."
"Perhaps we could hold the deadline on just that single issue until 11 a.m. or noon tomorrow to enable our resolution to be up-to-date and to make sense."
"I assume it is the general view of the House that we should have the opportunity of tabling such a resolution, which means having to set a deadline of 12 noon for this item."
"The services responsible are signalling to me that this is technically feasible."
"If the House has no objections, we shall proceed accordingly."
"Thank you, Mr McMahon."
"We too are glad to hear good news."
"Framework programmes for R & D"
"The next item is the report (A4-0183/96) by Mr Linkohr, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on:"
"I. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision (COM(96)0012 - C4-0092/96-96/0034(COD)) adapting for the second time Decision No 1110/94/EC concerning the fourth framework programme of activities in the field of research, technological development and demonstration (19941998);"
"II.the proposal for a Council Decision (COM(96)0012 - C4-0157/96-96/0035(CNS)) adapting for the second time Decision 94/268/Euratom concerning the framework programme of activities in the field of research and training for the European Atomic Energy Community (1994-1998)."
"Mr President, I am presenting this opinion on behalf of my colleague, Mr van Velzen."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy can agree with the setting-up of task forces as a mechanism that might bring research closer to the market, if it is on an experimental basis that will inform the methodology for the fifth framework programme without prejudgement."
"The committee is calling on the Commission to set up intersectoral and interdisciplinary task forces, and to involve European industry as closely as possible in drawing up research topics, so as to avoid a top-down approach."
"The criteria and data for selecting task forces must be made transparent; in particular, a comparative assessment of the benefits of the task forces should be presented after a certain period of experience."
"The committee is asking that, when preparing the fifth framework programme, the Commission should draw not only on existing experience with the task forces, but also on the 'best practice' criteria contained in the Green Paper on innovation."
"Further, the committee calls on the Commission to consider cooperating with other European partners and with small and medium-sized firms, as desired by the business world, as a means of increasing the task forces' prospects of success."
"In short, we regard the task forces as a positive initiative, but above all as an experiment which will only succeed if, at the same time, the lead time for application assessment is shortened, small and medium-sized firms are more closely involved, and the selection of topics is made more transparent."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposals regarding the establishment of these task forces were originally of great appeal to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, not least because the transport sector was given considerable prominence: task forces on aeronautics, automobile RTD-activities, transport intermodality and interoperability, maritime systems, and the train of the future."
"According to the Commission's proposals, as much as 55 % of the ECU 700 million - in other words, ECU 385 million - was to be assigned to transport issues."
"We in the Committee on Transport and Tourism were therefore all the more taken aback by the outcome of the voting in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, because all that remains of these various transport projects is aeronautics."
"The Committee on Transport has consequently tabled an amendment of its own, Amendment No 60, which reinstates at least the intermodality task force, and with a suitable appropriation."
"We must in fact recognize that interoperability is an inherently European topic."
"For example, we have five different railway gauges in Europe, and we wonder why many hours are wasted changing engines."
"Time is not wasted in this way with lorries."
"It is also a matter here of increasing competitiveness in the European Union, whereas the car sector, for example, can readily be tackled at national level."
"To my mind, interoperability is the European topic par excellence ."
"The two largest political groups have tabled a compromise proposal with a somewhat reduced appropriation; the Committee on Transport and Tourism hopes that this compromise will meet with the approval of the House."
"I know that we are to discuss the funding separately, but our inclusion of this title shows clearly the direction in which European transport policy needs to move."
"Mr President, it is a great pity that Rolf Linkohr is not with us this evening for the presentation of this report."
"I would like to congratulate him on the quality of the work he has done."
"The explanatory statement is a very valuable document and I hope colleagues will take the trouble to study it."
"We have had a lot of difficulties with this report, on the whole question of how much money we should go for and over what period of time, and what the role of the taskforces should be."
"Although when we agreed the original fourth framework programme it was not our idea that it would serve as a forerunner for the fifth framework programme, this has, in a sense, been one of the strands that has been emerging in our discussions."
"We have to learn some lessons in Parliament with regard to the Commission: when trying to decide how much money should go into research and how we should spend it and the role of taskforces, there is a great deal more work that has to be done amongst ourselves."
"I should like to say on behalf of the Socialist Group that this is the path that we wish to follow."
"The report is subject to the co-decision procedure and we must have a majority in Parliament."
"I hope that, although most of us have reservations about the report as it emerged from committee, we will support it."
"We have the task ahead of making sure that we can put a convincing case to the Council for increased research activity at European level."
"Perhaps the most telling phrase in the whole of Mr Linkohr's report is that, even if we approve the ECU 700m, it will not be sufficient to catch up with the work that is going ahead in the United States and in Japan."
"We are still falling behind and I hope we will take this lesson, if no other, to heart this evening and make sure we argue this case very strongly with the Council of Ministers."
"I just want to mention a couple of items."
"One, the increased funding for BSE research."
"This is very topical and, if nothing else, it shows the importance of having a bit more flexibility in our programmes."
"It would be a real tragedy if we had to wait three, four or five years before we can change the direction of some of our research, simply because we are locked into a rigid five-year programme."
"That lesson is one we need to learn."
"We need to look also at the question of the safety of nuclear reactors."
"We are all agreed that we need to do more work in these areas: the decontamination of affected areas and the radiation protection programme."
"I hope these matters will have strong support in the House tomorrow."
"Mr President, I wish to add my voice to that of Mr Adam in thanking Mr Linkohr for his very good work and all honourable Members who have worked to find a point of basic agreement on this issue which is extraordinarily important not only as regards, clearly, the refinancing of the Fourth Framework Programme but also future lines of action. We are dealing, as Mrs Quisthoudt has said, with the issue - which might be described as being experimental in nature - fundamental to the development of the Fifth Framework Programme that will soon be with us."
"I have to say that my group is in agreement and will therefore be supporting the compromise that has been reached on this, but I want personally to stress two aspects: the issues on which we have focused, selecting them from among the Commission proposals, are definitely of interest, but the special point that has been raised by Mr Linkohr is certainly an important one - not only in humanitarian terms but also in terms of our responsibility vis-à-vis the scientific guidelines that cannot be separated out from the more immediate issues that currently concern us."
"In that context specifically, we should devote a word or two to another important issue on which Mr Adam touched, that is to say the possibility of increasing, albeit partially, to a limited extent, the resources of Biomed and Biotec to develop research into what will surely be the next century's ill: the new viral diseases and above all bionic diseases."
"In conclusion, I believe that by approving the Linkohr report tomorrow, we shall be giving the Council a strong signal that the House wants to move in that direction Europe's research strategy for the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have already said on a number of occasions that the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party is by no means in favour of the task force model developed by the Commission."
"Although it may be useful for identifying technical priorities in some industrial sectors, the task force model appears to add yet another management and coordination level to a structure which actually needs to be made simpler and more transparent."
"It also interferes with the current programme structure."
"There are a number of subjects which my group recognizes as extremely important for Europe and its citizens."
"Information and communications technologies are vital for the future of Europe, and are areas where rapid changes are taking place."
"Future workers are going to have to learn about telematics, and this is why the task force on educational multimedia is such a good idea."
"Multimedia products need to be developed for and used in schools."
"A good example here is the UK, whose schools have made much more progress in using information technologies than those in other EU countries."
"Secondly, small and medium-sized firms must be able to participate fully in the fourth programme."
"This is a point I have made repeatedly, but the Commission remains very ambiguous on the subject."
"On the one hand, it is setting up task forces specifically targeting major industries, but it also states in every programme that there is plenty of scope for small and medium-sized firms."
"The framework programme has taught industrial firms in Europe how to work together, and this is something we must not jeopardize."
"Cooperation is the best way to disseminate new knowledge in Europe, and this is why it would be better to separate the two groups completely, so that firms both large and small can benefit from the framework programme."
"Mr President, in the process of reorienting Europe's productive activity to meet the demands of the globalization of the world economy, research and technological development play a crucial role."
"In his report, Mr Linkohr responds to the Commission proposal for additional funding of ECU 700 million for the fourth framework research programme and the setting-up of task forces with a counter-proposal which is far more positive and significant."
"The Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left disagrees with the Commission proposal and agrees with Mr Linkohr's report, whilst recognizing that it does have some shortcomings."
"Firstly, we disagree with the Commission proposal because it seeks to amend the fourth framework programme without a prior evaluation of the horizontal criteria on which the programme has been based, introducing vertical proposals which concentrate activities on a small number of countries and undertakings."
"Secondly, we disagree with it because these proposals focus on the interests of the big multinationals and the nuclear, automobile and aerospace sectors, and so on - pressure groups, in other words - without taking into account the social interests of the citizens of Europe."
"We therefore welcome the fact that Mr Linkohr has incorporated into his report our amendments concerning the elderly and health care - areas which will present the most urgent problems in the coming years."
"There should also be a concern to promote a model of sustainable development."
"And, thirdly, we disagree with it because the Commission proposal advocates, looking forward to the fifth framework programme, a vertical philosophy that will increase the research disparities which exist in Europe, given that some countries devote 0.5 % of GDP to research, whilst others dedicate 2.7 %."
"For these reasons, we reject the Commission proposal and support Mr Linkohr's report, acknowledging the efforts made by the rapporteur."
"Mr President, in times of recession, one should actually be welcoming an increase of ECU 700 million for the fourth framework programme of activities in the field of research."
"Research and development must receive financial backing, but the focus has to be right."
"And, in our opinion, the focus no longer is right."
"I should like to explain this by taking some examples."
"First of all, another ECU 105 m - and we have in fact tabled an amendment here, but I fear it will not be adopted - is to go to Euratom, where it will be used for fusion, a form of energy which has already received ECU 895 m under the fourth framework programme, and which might perhaps solve our problems in the year 2030 or 2050, but certainly not here and now."
"Secondly, the money is to be spent on the so-called inherently safe reactor, something which does not and cannot exist, and for which there is no acceptance among the general public."
"Moreover, as Mr Scapagnini has quite rightly said, research funds always go to major industry and not to SMEs, which could really do with them."
"Another case in point is that, according to the proposal from the Commission, ECU 150 m was to be made available for the SAVE II programme."
"The Council then had the impudence to reduce this funding to ECU 45 m: in other words, it has slashed a five-year programme, the only programme we still have which could go some way to meeting the commitments we made in Rio and Berlin."
"But huge sums of money are to be spent on aeronautics and fusion and other such gimmicks."
"My second example concerns THERMIE."
"No one mentions THERMIE II any more, another programme which has become absolutely vital."
"We hear every day that CO2 levels are rising."
"And now some clever people are saying that the cause is our opposition to nuclear power plants."
"What nonsense!"
"Having looked at the OECD statistics, I note that countries with a particularly large number of nuclear power stations do not have lower CO2 emissions."
"In fact, this phenomenon is caused primarily by traffic, which is not being taken into account at all."
"In conclusion, we cannot approve this increase, because we believe that the focus is wrong and it will not solve our immediate, pressing problems, even though many of the minor points contained in the proposal are - admittedly - worthy of support."
"Mr President, thank you for allowing this exception."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to highlight three important points, and firstly the amount of the increase: ECU 700 million."
"Even though savings are now the order of the day in all the Member States and at EU level, we believe that there is an urgent need to invest in the future."
"And this can only be done through innovation, the basis for which is research and development."
"That is why we have endorsed this overall sum."
"Secondly, we agree with the Green Paper on innovation that the dissemination and exploitation of results must be improved."
"We have taken this into account in our amendment on the allocation of resources."
"Even though money is not all that is needed here, it certainly does help!"
"Thirdly, we are in fact in a transitional phase, in the middle of the fourth framework programme."
"The discussion has in some cases been unusually heated, however, due to the fact that the thrust of the research topics was altered in an over-hasty way."
"We hope that the consultation process in preparation for the fifth framework programme will be smoother and more relaxed."
"Finally, I am grateful to the rapporteur for having worked with us in such an open and fair manner, and I would thank the Commissioner for having sought and conducted a dialogue with Parliament, after certain initial difficulties."
"As Gordon Adam has already said, we do need an absolute majority in Parliament."
"For that reason, there has been a strong desire in the House to reach an agreement, and this is reflected in our compromise proposals."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both the Commission's proposals and Mr Linkohr's report on the adaptation of the European Community's fourth framework programme of activities in the field of research - in Annex I, footnote 5, of that report, and Annex II, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the report on the adaptation of Euratom research - rightly refer to research into increased safety in the peaceful use of nuclear energy."
"It is most important to increase the safety of the nuclear power stations located, in particular, in the countries of the former Eastern bloc and in China."
"But another Chernobyl-type accident would be extremely dangerous for us too."
"That is why, for reasons of solidarity as well as our own safety, it is imperative for us to contribute and expand our practical help and know-how regarding accident prevention."
"However, it is not acceptable that a covert or overt extension of the use of nuclear energy should be pushed through by these means."
"Many people are in fact in favour of abandoning this fundamentally uncontrollable technology, and we should like to see a move into the age of solar power."
"So it needs to be made clear that European research funding should not be used to develop new types of reactor, but only to enhance the safety of existing nuclear plants, including that of the disposal of radioactive waste."
"That is the most we can possibly accept, and even that demands something of an effort from us, because in structural terms, even safety upgrades are an incentive to keep dangerous nuclear plants in service."
"In principle, this means that the life-span of the plant and technology of a conventional nuclear power station is likely to be extended by a further 40 years."
"With regard to Central and Eastern Europe, the following ping-pong effect, which might not be immediately apparent, will play a major role: because of the chronic lack of foreign currency in these countries, the upgrading work is to be funded by so-called payment in kind."
"In this way, for example, not only is the latest nuclear technology to be introduced at Sosnovy Bor, but the decommissioning of the Grafenrheinfeld nuclear power station in Germany is to be avoided."
"Therefore, because this legally questionable option of continued operation must be averted, I would urge the House to support Amendments Nos 53, 54 and 62, as does a large majority of my group."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, before anything else may I express my thanks to Mr Linkohr, whose enforced absence prevented him from presenting his report personally and to whom I wish a speedy recovery, and to the members of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, to Mr Desama, Mr van Velzen, Mr Ferber, Mr Collins and Mrs Ahlqvist, as well as to the members of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media."
"Numerous Members of Parliament were involved in discussing the Commission proposal on supplementary financing of the fourth framework programme for research and development (1994-1998)."
"The result is a balanced and constructive motion for a resolution, which should enhance the quality of the debate between the institutions and make this decision easier to take."
"I shall not presume on your attention for any longer than is necessary."
"In view of the importance of the subject, however, I should like to make a few remarks on a number of points."
"I shall therefore begin by reminding you of the background to the Commission's proposal on supplementary financing and then comment on some points in the report drawn up by Mr Linkohr on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, before finally informing you of the position adopted by the Commission on the various proposed amendments, specifying our reasons for accepting or rejecting them."
"So let us begin with the background. You may recall that the principle of supplementary financing of the fourth framework programme was enshrined in the decision adopting the programme;"
"Mr Desama, indeed, put it perfectly earlier this evening. This supplement is different in nature to the technical adjustment made last year after three new states had acceded to the Union."
"It represents a political commitment by the Council and Parliament to adapt the fourth framework programme as necessary to developments that have intervened since its inception."
"It was a wise decision."
"Given the fact that it was launched over two years ago, the fourth programme does not satisfy all the needs that arise today."
"As we await the fifth framework programme, which will not come on stream before 1999, the option of this supplementary financing gives us a unique opportunity to improve the ways in which Community research responds to the needs of society."
"These needs are more clearly apparent in certain domains. The Commission therefore decided to focus this effort on a few priority themes."
"The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, along with the other committees consulted, have indicated their acceptance in principle of such selectivity, which takes account of society's foremost expectations and of the prospects of creating jobs, and certainly of preserving them."
"Priorities evolve."
"Mr Adam referred to research into BSE."
"Let me point out in passing that it was a Community research programme which enabled a team in Edinburgh to identify a probable link between the CreutzfeldtJakob syndrome and mad cow disease."
"Mr Linkohr's excellent report highlights two points to which I should like to return."
"The first is the recommendation that these programmes should be managed more efficiently."
"I know that this is a matter of concern to a great many of you. It is also a concern that I share."
"It has been referred to in this debate, notably by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl."
"Despite the progress achieved in the course of the last few years, further improvements in this area can and must be made."
"As a step in that direction, a seminar involving senior Commission officials and representatives of the scientific community and of industry is to be held shortly."
"Allow me to reassure those of you who feel that small and medium-sized enterprises are not well enough represented in these programmes; another aim of the seminar is to provide SMEs with easier access to research programmes, as several of you have requested, in particular Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel."
"The second point relates to the evaluation of the way in which the fourth framework programme is being implemented."
"This matter, which was addressed in one of the amendments, is also referred to extensively in Mr Lange's report on the Annual Report of the Framework Programme Monitoring Panel for 1995, which you will be discussing next month."
"As I had the opportunity to inform the members of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, the Commission services are currently preparing a comprehensive document assessing the progress made in implementing the fourth framework programme, and this document will shortly be made available to Parliament."
"All in all, I am keenly aware of Parliament's wish to be closely associated with the preparation and implementation of research initiatives within the Union."
"I can inform you that by the end of July the Commission will present an initial political document on the fifth framework programme, indicating the guidelines on which it intends to base its formal proposal at the start of 1997."
"The publication of the document at that stage will give Parliament the opportunity to express its views soon enough to be able to enhance or alter the proposed guidelines."
"As promised, I shall now communicate to you the position adopted by the Commission on the various amendments to its proposal."
"As a general rule, the Commission accepts all those amendments which introduce useful clarifications or which help to reinforce its proposal."
"The amendments to which this applies are Amendment No 9 (last part) on the need for an indicative breakdown of the ECU 700 million, Amendments Nos 15, 16 and 39 on various aspects of multimedia activities, as well as Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 6, 11 and 12, subject to some rewording, on the ways in which the task forces are to operate and the manner in which the supplementary financing is presented."
"With regard to Amendment No 2 in particular, the Commission is prepared to refer to its proposed revision of the financial perspective but without establishing a link between the decision on supplementary financing and the final adoption of the revised financial perspective."
"By the same token, the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 5 to the Euratom proposal, which add useful details to the text as it now stands, as well as the third part of Amendment No 6, on condition that the concept of radiation protection is introduced into the second specific programme on international cooperation under the fourth framework programme."
"Amendment No 9 proposes the creation of a René Descartes Prize to be awarded each year to reward and honour outstanding European research work."
"I had occasion to mention to the members of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy just how excellent I find this idea. The Commission, incidentally, is already looking at ways of putting this proposal into effect."
"There is no need, however, to add a new article, because Annex III of the Decision adopting the fourth framework programme already envisages the possibility of scientific awards; the relevant passage there need only be amended accordingly."
"On the other hand, the Commission would prefer not to accept at this stage the amendments that affect the substance of its proposal, in other words those which propose changes to the maximum overall amount, such as the first part of Amendment No 9, those which adjust the balance between priorities, such as Amendments Nos 4 and 7 and Amendments Nos 17 to 21, 23, 24, 29 and 36, those which propose new themes alongside those already adopted, such as Amendments Nos 8, 10, 40 and 41, 22, 25 to 28 and 31 to 38, or which suggest new research subjects within adopted priority areas, such as Amendments Nos 13 and 14."
"Amendment No 5 and the part of Amendment No 9 in which the integration of ECSC research into the framework programme is proposed cannot be accepted either, since the activities carried out in the realm of the ECSC have in fact been absorbed into the programme."
"The same also applies, for similar reasons, to Amendments Nos 3, 4, 6 and 7 to the Euratom proposal."
"I should like to reply at this point to Mr Tannert, who spoke on the subject of nuclear energy. When all is said and done, while noting the call for prudence in nuclear matters expressed in these amendments, the Commission wishes to emphasize that the wording of the technical annex accords perfectly with the text of the technical annexes to the proposal on the framework programme for Euratom and to the specific programme on nuclear fission safety."
"The framework programme for Euratom clearly mentions the work on new safety specifications for the new generation of reactors."
"The specific programme on nuclear fission safety refers to the need to improve safety in the operation of existing installations while advancing knowledge applicable to the reactors of the future."
"The underlying idea is that the Member States work actively to develop better-designed reactors, while the task of the Union is to support the research required to guarantee their safety."
"The Commission also deems it preferable not to make any pronouncements on amendments proposed in plenary which seek to alter its proposals beyond the bounds of mere clarifications and on which CERT has not had the opportunity to comment."
"It does, however, note with interest the priority attached to intermodality by a number of speakers, especially Mr Ferber, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and Mr Desama in their compromise amendments."
"I should also like to stress an important point in this context."
"While standing very firm on the principle of 700 million in supplementary financing, the Commission basically has an open ear for the ideas underlying several of the proposed amendments."
"The Commission would not be averse, for example, to a balanced distribution of funds among the proposed priority themes that are linked to the activities of the task forces and some other more generic areas which are the subject of specific programmes."
"It is likewise open to politically important themes, such as the detection of land mines, and to the idea of spreading the supplementary financing over three years."
"At this stage in the proceedings, however, the Commission prefers not to incorporate the amendments in question."
"It must be remembered that the supplementary financing has to be adopted by codecision, which means that the unanimous approval of the Council is required."
"Any formal modification of key points in the Commission proposal would be liable to make the achievement of an overall compromise between the institutions even more difficult."
"Such a compromise must be our objective."
"In general terms and on numerous specific points, the positions of Parliament and the Commission are very close, as indeed is often the case."
"We now have to take the Council with us."
"An informal trialogue is due to take place on 25 June, the day before the meeting of the Council of Research Ministers."
"We must be at pains to ensure that these talks proceed in a way that will enable the Council to reach an early political agreement on supplementary financing."
"In their joint decision to adopt the fourth framework programme, Parliament and the Council undertook to formulate their positions on supplementary financing by the end of June 1996."
"It would be a pity if this undertaking were not honoured."
"The people of Europe expect the Union to implement specific programmes in those areas in which research can help to improve the quality of life, to invigorate the economy and to promote the creation of jobs."
"We cannot disappoint them."
"I shall finish on that note, and I thank all of you who have contributed to the high quality of this debate on the supplementary financing of the fourth framework programme."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Energy efficiency of domestic electrical appliances"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0194/96) on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the common position adopted by the Council (C40203/96-94/0272(COD)) with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on energy efficiency requirements for household electrical refrigerators, freezers and their combinations (Rapporteur: Mr Macartney)."
"Mr President, Members will be aware that we have already been through the general aspects of this report in the first reading."
"Just to remind Members, however, the whole objective was to make a contribution towards the problem of global warming, to try to take some steps towards fulfilling the commitments which the European States made at the Rio Summit and, at the same time, to make some contribution towards the question of saving the consumer bills on electricity."
"The Commission proposals did this by looking at the question of improving the efficiency of refrigerators."
"Both the Commission and the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy relied heavily on the background study which indicated that it was perfectly feasible to achieve substantial improvements in efficiency in the European Union, parallel to those which have already been achieved in the United States and Japan."
"So when we went through the first reading we made some substantial statements and some substantial progress."
"We come to the second reading now, having had our common position outlined by the Council."
"Just to remind Members, the first set of norms proposed by the Commission was for a 10 % improvement in energy efficiency, whereas we are convinced that a 20 % target is required."
"The committee also believed that a stricter timetable for implementation was appropriate two years after adoption of the directive, and that a second set of norms going beyond the first set should be implemented five years after the adoption of the directive."
"It was proposed in the first reading that there should be a flexible implementation system which was based on information given to consumers, which was an innovative approach."
"Some of these proposals met with the approval of the Council and some did not."
"The first point is that the Council agreed on a 15 % energy efficiency target, which was similar to the Commission's revised proposal."
"It decided that the implementation time for the first norms would be three years after adoption, whereas the Commission and Parliament had proposed two years."
"The Council text refers to a possible second set of norms but, frankly, it is so vague as to be almost evasive."
"Unless there is a specific figure mentioned, then there is no point in talking about improvements or, for that matter, like one of the amendments which I do not support, ' substantial improvements' ."
"That is not worth the paper on which it is written."
"So we have a crunch here about setting firm targets."
"At the same time, the committee has wisely compromised on two issues."
"One is to say to the industry which is asking for a voluntary agreement or the possibility of a voluntary agreement: Okay."
"You have got some time after the introduction of the first set of norms to come up with a voluntary agreement."
"We will wipe the slate clean and forget about the fact that nothing happened for four or five years when you wanted one before and we will take you at your word now."
"But, if this agreement is not achieved, the Commission has to propose a firm piece of legislation, and we would support this."
"The other compromise we have made is on this rather controversial and, some would say, bizarre category of subtropical and tropical appliances."
"The expert advice was that really the whole category did not make a lot of sense."
"Nevertheless, the expert who was consulted by the Commission and by Parliament's committee concluded that there was a case for making one small exception in this category and that is for the four-star fridges - if you want the full details - with a single compressor and two compartments."
"So there is a small exception, which allows us to meet the Council half way."
"What I am putting to Parliament is a plea that we go forward with a firm resolve to have a clear set of norms for the second phase, although we are prepared to go along with a couple of concessions in order to meet the Council half way."
"I plead with Parliament to get the amendments proposed by the committee through in toto , otherwise we will have been wasting our time."
"However, I am very confident in the wisdom of this House and the assiduity of the Members and I am very confident that when they vote tomorrow we will have an overall majority and Parliament will have achieved something for energy efficiency which will benefit both the planet and the consumers."
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleague Mrs Jensen, who unfortunately cannot be here today, I should like to make the following comments. In this proposal, the point is made that the EU has committed itself to reducing CO2 emissions."
"It is also stated that refrigeration appliances consume a great deal of electricity, and that this is an area in which the EU can do something."
"The proposal seeks to remove the heaviest energy users from the market, but unfortunately the effect will be no more than that of natural innovation in the sector."
"The technology is available, and the sector should make use of it."
"The most important thing in the proposal is that the Commission commits itself to bringing forward a proposal for a second set of norms to match what modern technology can do."
"With the first set of norms, we are merely getting rid of the heaviest energy users."
"The Commission says that it will be of benefit for consumers, society and the environment to have refrigeration appliances which are more energy-efficient, and that this is technically feasible."
"While we are waiting for the CO2 tax, we can make appropriate use of the mechanisms of the internal market."
"This week, we have put the Union's future climate strategy on the agenda."
"In this context, it will be remarkable if we cannot agree on this proposal, which in spite of everything is a step along the road."
"There is not very much good news regarding CO2 , since it now appears that the EU will be unable to achieve its aim of stabilizing CO2 emissions at the 1990 levels in the year 2000."
"As Commissioner Papoutsis rightly pointed out, the end is one thing and the means another."
"For example, the Council recently cut back the SAVE programme from ECU 150 million to ECU 45 m."
"This raises serious doubts as to whether there is any political will at all in the Council to tackle the CO2 problem."
"The IEA has produced comparative studies of worldwide refrigerator norms."
"In the USA, for instance, a third set of norms is being introduced in 1998 which is much more ambitious than the Council's proposals, and that is in the free and liberal United States."
"Europe is far behind."
"We are all concerned about the effects on the climate when a billion Chinese and millions of Indians increase their energy consumption, but can we in the West ask so much of them if we are unable to meet limits to which we have committed ourselves internationally?"
"Mr President, I should like, very briefly, to indicate the position the Socialist Group will take on Mr Macartney's amendments."
"In general terms, the Socialist Group intends to support Mr Macartney's five amendments."
"The last two of these are relatively formal amendments. The first three, however, are important amendments, because in Amendment No 1 in particular the energy efficiency improvement is set at 20 %, not only in the first phase but in the second phase too, while Amendments Nos 2 and 3 provide respectively for a reduction of the period allowed for local industry to adapt to the new norms and for various specifications relating to tropical and subtropical refrigerators."
"I could leave it at that, but honesty compels me to admit to Mr Macartney that the recommendation will not be supported by the entire Socialist Group."
"In fact, a substantial minority of the Socialist Group intends to oppose the first three amendments for the following reason: in general terms, we feel that since the Commission - and very probably the Council too - will be unable to back these amendments, we are likely to become involved in conciliation procedure, which seems to be a luxury we can ill afford in the present circumstances."
"We should have welcomed a greater degree of willingness to achieve some sort of rapprochement between the positions of the various institutions."
"Be that as it may, notwithstanding this reservation - which does not concern the substance of Mr Macartney's proposals - the recommendation will have the support of the Socialist Group, but not its unanimous support."
"Mr President, the objective of reducing the greenhouse effect is absolutely praiseworthy given that there is a great deal of macroscopic evidence that the planet is heating up. In point of fact it would be useful to be able to undertake further research in situ to enable us better to understand the processes whereby infrared light is trapped, if I may be allowed a very brief digression, using satellites attached to long lines - like the one we had occasion to experiment with in a space mission in 1992 - which will make it possible to explore those high strata in the atmosphere which balloons cannot reach and in which satellites cannot remain."
"That could perhaps be an ideal subject for the Fifth Framework Programme; turning to the directive at issue, however, that document identifies energy-saving with energy-efficiency and applies the sole criterion of energy efficiency to a great variety of European refrigerators."
"Different habits, in the European Union, that vary from region to region as a result of climate, eating habits and also the purchasing power of European citizens, trigger different market requirements, and the predictable result of this directive will therefore be to reduce the number of refrigerators on the market and direct the market itself towards products that are more efficient certainly but higher range and more expensive, particularly in the countries of the south."
"This is not a question of respecting the concept of energy-saving, which is we accept, or taking a view on the fate of future generations, it is a matter of establishing whether this measure is fair and balanced or whether it benefits one industrial sector as compared with another, resorting to the expedient - if I may put it thus - of confusing energy-saving, which is our objective - not producing carbon dioxide then- and energy efficiency."
"To demonstrate that energy-saving and energy efficiency are not the same thing, suffice it to say that a Mercedes may be more efficient in terms of energy than a scooter but a scooter clearly uses less energy than a Mercedes."
"A person travelling by scooter saves energy as compared with someone using a Mercedes but has a less efficient vehicle."
"When considered in detail, the directive at issue does not appear to constitute a balanced measure, given that there has been no socio-economic study on the costs for consumers in the north and in the south."
"As regards the second step towards efficiency - following on from the first, on which we at any rate agree - I propose that the House support an amendment which leaves this vague, although incorporating the element of reinforcement contained in Amendment No 5."
"The intention is not so much to make it difficult to take that step as to allow the Commission to structure it better and resume the study."
"That has in fact been the Commission position in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, and the Council position similarly."
"I therefore commend to the House Amendment No 5."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, domestic fridges and freezers account for 7 % of the total electricity consumption in the European Union."
"A 15 % reduction in energy consumption could mean as much as a 1 % drop in electricity consumption and lower CO2 emissions throughout the Union."
"The Council has proposed a transitional period of three years for the directive instead of the two proposed by Parliament, which allows ample scope, especially when you consider that fridges can easily last 20 to 25 years."
"There is also no evidence that energy efficiency will drive the price of fridges up."
"On the contrary, there are already more energy-saving coolers which are no more expensive to buy than the average fridge."
"So the cost will not be higher for the consumer or, in all likelihood, the producer."
"The Liberal Group supports the rapporteur's proposal to introduce a second series of measures once the first phase has been evaluated."
"At the suggestion of the Netherlands, the Commission has been trying for the last five years to reach voluntary agreements with the industry, but this appears to be impossible, hence this proposal for a European directive and the amendments by Mr Macartney which my group wholeheartedly supports."
"Mr President, the purpose of my remarks is to summarize in two phrases the position of a large section of the Socialist Group: total support for the Council's common position, since it addresses the major objectives which will make energy savings possible; and total rejection of the amendments proposed by Mr Macartney, who has ignored the views of many Members of the House and a large number of countries which have declared their opposition to these amendments."
"These amendments are not about energy savings or environmental protection."
"They are about something else: a disguised and covert trade war."
"One cannot fail to take account of the different conditions prevailing in the various Member States."
"One cannot say that there is a single study on this subject, when in fact there are several which justify the need to distinguish between different refrigerators."
"More specifically, in the view of a large section of the House, allowing the industry time to adapt and accepting the category of tropical and subtropical appliances are essential not only for achieving energy savings, but also for ensuring that concern for the environment is not used as a covert means of supporting certain commercial interests."
"In fact, Mr Macartney's Amendment No 3, concerning four-star refrigerators, is technically quite incorrect."
"Today, refrigerators do not a have a single compartment."
"The four-star compartment is a freezer, but refrigerators have other compartments which require fewer stars. And these compartments are not given co-efficients, although they would meet the directive's requirements if they were."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Macartney for his report and for his work during Parliament's second reading of the proposal."
"As he has pointed out very clearly, the great importance of this proposal lies in the fact that it forms part of the European Union's strategy for the stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions."
"It will not, in absolute terms, make the biggest contribution to the reduction of those emissions, but it is a necessary element in the pursuit of the objective."
"If we are really serious about that objective, we must do everything that is economically feasible to achieve it."
"And this measure offers a favourable cost-benefit for society as a whole."
"The proposal will also produce substantial savings for our peoples."
"I feel obliged to say that Parliament, through the Committee on Energy, has done much to improve the text and to give the directive a good balance over the course of the second reading."
"However, we should remember that time itself is a pressing factor in the struggle to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and that achievement of a reasonable result by the year 2000 depends on getting this proposal adopted as quickly as possible."
"The European Union enters into a great many policy commitments; however, as we had occasion to point out to the Committee on Energy recently, the final stage of decision-making for directives and specific proposals is often plagued by delays."
"I think that you would be wise to bear that in mind now as you deliberate on this directive and tomorrow when you vote on it, because having a directive which can be implemented to produce real results by the year 2000 will boost the credibility of Parliament and the credibility of the three legislative institutions as a whole."
"You will have noted that the Commission, with this modified proposal, has heeded Parliament's call at the first reading for a strengthening of the original proposal."
"The common position is now very much stronger than it was in the first proposal."
"We believe that the common position now strikes the right balance between protection of the environment and the protection of consumers and the interests of the manufacturers, and we can therefore support it."
"As regards the amendments, Amendment No 1 is very important because it has to do with the adoption of the second phase."
"The Commission has always supported the need for a dynamic approach and for the implementation of a second phase of measures five years after the adoption of the directive."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament has taken a positive stance on the question of the voluntary agreements to be implemented in the second phase."
"That, too, conforms with the common position."
"However, according to the recommendation of our experts in their extensive study, a precise determination of the technical and economic improvement in the level of efficiency is not possible at this present time."
"The Commission thinks it important that the economic and technical factors should be evaluated when the first level enters into force and that determination of the second level of efficiency improvements should be embarked on afterwards."
"In view of that, the Commission, while accepting the principle expressed in Amendment No 1, cannot accept the proposed text where the improvement of efficiency is given a quantification."
"We do not have the necessary figures, and it is far too early to contemplate such an amendment."
"Rather than a specifically quantified improvement in efficiency, the Commission could accept the expression 'substantial improvement' , and the Council also could accept that, which would make it possible for all of us to give the proposal final approval."
"I believe that what we all want, in the policy sense, is to see the adoption procedure for this proposal brought to a satisfactory conclusion."
"Amendment No 2, concerning the period of adjustment for the first phase, is acceptable to the Commission."
"And we are glad that the three legislative institutions agree on the 15 % figure for efficiency improvement in the first phase, because it obviously strengthens the original proposal."
"Amendment No 3 deals with an exceedingly technical aspect which has already been discussed in detail in the Committee on Energy, and I would not wish to go into all the details of it today during this debate."
"However, as the experts have said, at least for four-star refrigerator-freezers, these coefficients are technically justified."
"I therefore welcome Parliament's acceptance of them, and I can say that the Commission can accept this amendment."
"Amendment No 4, on the new version of the EN 153 standard of July 1995 can also be accepted by the Commission."
"Amendment No 5, tabled by Mr Malerba to Amendment No 8 concerning the adoption of the second phase, approximates very closely to the common position."
"The only difference is that 'improving' is changed to 'significantly improving' ."
"This change would be acceptable to the Council and would obviate the need for the conciliation procedure."
"For that reason the Commission supports the amendment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in concluding I would like to request Parliament to support amendments which will permit swift adoption of this proposal."
"If we truly wish to contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000, it is the most significant thing that we can do."
"We need to move rapidly."
"I wish to thank all of you, and the rapporteur, Mr Macartney, in particular, for your substantial contribution to the improvement of this proposal and for giving it your support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Short sea shipping"
"The next item is the report (A4-0167/96) by Mr Sindal, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission (COM(95)0317 - C4-0297/95) on the development of short sea shipping in Europe - prospects and challenges."
"Mr President, together with my colleagues, I very much welcome the initiative taken by the Commission in this area."
"The Committee on Transport has worked on a good many maritime questions in recent years, particularly involving safety."
"Now we have come to the development of shipping in the future."
"This report may only deal with a communication, but it is a pleasure to be able to present an end result which supplements this initiative."
"We have also noted in the committee that the Council has a positive attitude towards the maritime sector."
"Unfortunately, this is not always borne out in practice."
"As Pushkin put it, words are one thing, actions quite another."
"We are therefore some way from the goal we write and speak about so much: short sea shipping as part of the European transport network."
"And we all know how things are going with the conciliation procedure."
"At this very moment, they will be sitting down and arguing in Luxembourg."
"Unfortunately, that is why the Chamber is half empty, because those of my colleagues who are waging the campaign for the Maastricht Treaty to be applied in this area as well are not present."
"But the wish to create a coherent transport system in Europe may be harder to put into effect than a common European security and defence policy."
"Enough of that, however; let us now turn to the report."
"There are two points in particular which are important - two things which are important if we wish to promote shipping in European waters, in other words what we commonly refer to as short sea shipping, or coastal traffic."
"The first is the ports structure and related matters."
"The second is competition between the different modes of transport."
"These two areas are mentioned in all the statements and all the answers from hearings in this context, and in connection with the production of this report."
"It is very important for the Commission and the Council to be aware of this."
"On the first point, when will a common position be established as regards the ports sector which all the Member States will apply?"
"And on the second, will we succeed in making the initiative on fair pricing and so on something which the Council of Ministers takes seriously?"
"Will any more concrete initiatives and decisions be forthcoming?"
"Turning to the amendments, I am grateful for the contributions from the Committee on Regional Policy, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"It has been a positive experience to work with both internal and external committees, and it also means that there are not so many amendments to the report, a sign that the process we have been through has been effective."
"We have reached out to each and every part of Europe, to every port and every ship, in order to discuss this subject."
"There are two specific amendments to be dealt with, the first by Mrs Myller and others."
"On a previous occasion, I found it helpful to ask the Commission to assess the growing volume of low-standard river-going ships operating in Europe which come from the former East European countries."
"The amendment by Mrs Myller and others can therefore be accepted."
"I have discussed the other amendment, by Mr Wijsenbeek, with the author and I am bound to say that it belongs in a different area of the debate."
"I should therefore like to thank the secretariat and the Commission, and I hope that the Council of Ministers, which will be planning the development of European transport, will be able to achieve a good result."
"Let me emphasize from a personal point of view, partly with my own father and grandfather in mind, that shipping was once the future."
"For many years now, it has been underrated."
"I believe that if we adopt a sensible approach, it will be the role of Parliament, the Commission and the Council to bring shipping to the forefront once again."
"If we are serious about this, then decisions are the order of the day."
"Politics is all about will, about having the will to do things."
"It is not about waiting to see how the market develops."
"We should not think that there will be any changes in European transport policy if we fail to decide anything at European level."
"Mr President, on behalf of the PSE group I would like to join the rapporteur in thanking the Commission for this important contribution to the debate on the maritime sector and its future and in particular, the role of short sea shipping."
"I would also like to underline the point made by the rapporteur that what we need here is political will and in the process thank the rapporteur, Mr Sindal, for the political will he has demonstrated throughout Parliament's consideration of this communication."
"I thank him for the effort that he has put into this report which has ensured that all parties concerned with the future of the maritime sector have fully participated in the development of our response."
"The role of short sea shipping clearly needs to be developed."
"As many of us are already aware, it already plays a key role in the transportation of goods throughout the European Union; indeed 30 % or 40 % of our trade is already by short sea shipping."
"Clearly that role needs to be developed, not just for historical or sentimental reasons."
"I, although I represent the historic port-town of Dover and am very aware of the need to remember our history, recognise that the maritime sector and in particular, short sea shipping could play a key role in the development of transport policies in the future to fulfil both our economic and our environmental objectives."
"I should like to deal briefly with both of those issues in turn."
"Firstly the economic objectives: the development of ports and port infrastructure and short sea shipping would actually work well towards fulfilling our objective of assisting Ireland and the peripheral areas."
"Many of the run-down areas in the European Union with high levels of unemployment are often associated with these ports and coastal areas."
"We would therefore be facilitating the regeneration of declining peripheral areas if we supported the measures outlined by the rapporteur."
"Secondly, overall within the European Union we will enhance industrial competitiveness if we make short sea shipping in Europe more competitive."
"My second area of interest is the environment."
"We must not overlook the fact that the short sea shipping sector could play a key role in fulfilling our environmental objectives."
"Probably like many Members in the UK, Mr President, you were shocked to find that the EU's commitments made at the Rio Earth Summit to stabilize CO2 emissions at the 1990 levels by the year 2000 not only are not being fulfilled but are well on course to exceed those particular commitments by a substantial margin."
"We therefore desperately need to ensure that short sea shipping is promoted to enable the EU to fulfil its international obligations."
"I should like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur for his efforts but I plead with the Commission to state this evening what actions they will now be promoting both within the Commission and the Council to put these fine words into action."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, I wish to congratulate Mr Sindal on his excellent report on the Commission's communication on the development of short sea shipping in Europe."
"With just a few amendments, the Commission's guidelines and action programme will be extremely effective."
"But as my colleague Mr Jarzembowski never tires of pointing out, the general policy on seaports, formulated almost in passing and in an annex, is unacceptable in its present form, since it goes far beyond the promotion of short sea shipping."
"A reasonable level of mobility in the long term depends on more flexible and efficient transport infrastructures and rational connections between them."
"From this point of view above all, but also for environmental and regional policy reasons, I warmly welcome all those aspects which help to shift goods traffic from the roads to coastal waters."
"This can only be done if, firstly, the fleet, port structures and links with the port hinterlands are modernized; secondly, if there is greater transparency of the services on offer, port taxes and port administration structures; thirdly, if there is coordination between the funding of public and private infrastructure; and, fourthly, if administrative procedures are simplified."
"It is interesting that short sea shipping is finally being regarded as a complex form of service transport: in transport terms, it is thus part of the door-to-door transport chain, and so in direct competition with road haulage."
"Short sea shipping must therefore become simpler, cheaper and more efficient in terms of transport times."
"The Committee on Regional Policy tabled some amendments at a very early stage. The thrust of these is contained in the Commission's original text, or the rapporteur has picked up on the linguistic nuances and incorporated them into his report."
"For these reasons alone, and not on grounds of content, our group is proposing to reject the majority of these amendments."
"A new element raised in Amendment No 3 is the effect of the development of short sea shipping on the creation and preservation of jobs in EU shipyards."
"We should therefore support this amendment."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Sindal for his work in highlighting this neglected sector."
"We are always worried about job creation and here is an area where we could really stimulate enormous job potential."
"At present there are 600 ports near industrial centres."
"There are hundreds more that could potentially be developed for this purpose."
"Previous speakers have mentioned the aid to stop congestion on the roads which is horrendous and costly in every way, and also that this is an environmentally friendly kind of procedure."
"European funds would be well spent if we could encourage further action of this kind and it has to be encouraged because the political will seems to be lacking on the part of our governments."
"There are 90 islands in my constituency and many have ferry connections."
"But we no longer have direct links, as we used to have in Scotland, with the Low Countries, Scandinavia and the Hanseatic ports."
"We could so easily have those links and it would help everybody."
"If ever we were looking for ways to assist job creation, this would be an area that we should be considering."
"Mr President, given the expected growth in freight transport and the problems we are already facing, short sea shipping is going to have to assume a more prominent role in relieving the burden on land transport."
"In order to do so, it will have to be integrated into the trans-European networks, since it is only if it becomes part of the overall door-to-door transport chain that it will be able to compete strongly against other forms of transport."
"Firms must make best use of the rapid developments in data processing to ensure smooth links with the other forms of transport used in each case."
"Secondly, the time spent by vessels in port must be reduced."
"A good deal of progress has already been made here through the use of modern loading and unloading techniques, but it would still be useful to investigate ways of reducing the time still further."
"Short sea shipping is also very much held back by cumbersome customs procedures, particularly veterinary checks, and by the monopolies enjoyed by the providers of services in some ports."
"This problem receives little attention in the Commission document, despite the fact that it is one of the Commission's responsibilities to promote the smooth operation of the internal market."
"Finally, we must not forget that the promotion of short sea shipping must be seen as part of our overall transport policy."
"There is competition not just between the various shipping operators, but also between shipping and other modes of transport, particularly rail."
"We endorse the Sindal report and feel that, taken together with the Commission document, it constitutes a valuable and helpful addition to the work of the Maritime Industries Forum."
"The Commission must now ensure that all these good intentions are actually put into practice."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the rapid increase in the volume of traffic that we are seeing as trade expands within the single market means that we have to find new methods of looking at transport."
"The recommendation drawn up by the Commission in its White Paper on Transport Policy is therefore an obvious and natural consequence of developments in the sector."
"It is vital for that purpose that we move from land transport to other forms of transport, such as short sea shipping and river transport."
"We have to bear in mind the cost/benefit ratio, the number of kilometres - 35, 000 - of European coastline and the more than 600 ports from which goods can be distributed, the majority of them close to industrial centres."
"That is why those working in this area should pay greater attention to sea transport, and specific infrastructures need therefore to be created to reduce costs and remove obstacles."
"The ports should, in particular, make an essential contribution with customs checks, on persons and goods, and also animal health checks."
"Moreover, relaunching short-haul sea transport could provide a fresh incentive for economic activity in certain regions, creating new jobs."
"Mr Sindal's report, which follows on from and expands upon the Commission and Council directives, gives us an opportunity to reflect and shows us that we can take the maritime route and that it for all of us to determine the future."
"Mr President, sea shipping relieves and lightens overland traffic in many ways."
"This is also the case in the area around the Baltic Sea, as Mr Sindal points out in his excellent report."
"Despite a long tradition of co-operation in shipping in the Baltic area, going back as far as the Hanseatic League, and despite the fact that sea shippings on the Baltic Sea generally are known to be ecologically beneficial and efficient forms of transport, transport in this area is slower and more difficult than transport across the continent."
"Transportation across the Baltic Sea involve the use of several different transport vehicles; the cargo has to be unloaded and reloaded due to the water levels and the archipelago."
"It should be possible to link cargos more smoothly to other parts of the transport chain."
"A good example of this is the rail-ship combination, which is expected to increase strongly due to demand."
"In the Baltic countries, any future Member States of the European Union, the legislation, the development of ports and of traffic structure require a good deal of work."
"It would also be sensible for the European Union to invest in the development of port infrastructure in this area."
"Transport connections to northern Europe which work well are obviously beneficial to trade in the entire EU."
"The Baltic area should consequently be given similar status in EU traffic policy as has already occurred in the Mediterranean area."
"Finally I would like to stress an environmental issue about which I feel that the European Union should make an initiative and start preparatory actions."
"I am referring to the transport of oil in European waters - oil transportation, both in small and large vessels, should be prohibited unless the vessels are equipped with a double hull."
"The catastrophe in Wales showed that double hulls are an absolute necessity in both small and large oil-transporting vessels, and consequently all vessels in question should be equipped in this way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the report before us is to promote the transport of goods by sea and to correct the imbalance that exists between maritime and overland transport - an excellent aim, but one which raises various problems regarding the environment, social issues and safety standards."
"Minimum safety levels really must be imposed in order to protect human life and to ensure respect for the environment."
"A list of essential conditions could be drawn up, and special attention must be given to the need for a minimum training standard for crews."
"In this respect, minimum nationality quotas might be a means of raising overall levels of aptitude in view of the lack of professional skills among certain crews whose members are recruited at low cost from countries outside the European Union."
"Moreover, standards governing the construction and refurbishment of ships ought to be adopted, since the short sea shipping fleet comprises many small and dilapidated craft."
"That could serve as an opportunity to promote European dockyards, thereby establishing a European preference in the domain of ship repairs."
"Lastly, it is absolutely essential that there should be standards governing the conditions under which dangerous goods are transported and rules for the prevention of marine pollution, as well as regulated procedures for rapid assistance to ships in distress."
"In conclusion, we note that there is convergence between these needs and the activities of the dockyards which exist in the countries of Europe, and we believe that the best possible use should be made of this convergence."
"Mr President, it is vitally important, not least for environmental reasons, to do everything we can to move goods and passenger traffic off the roads and onto the railways and the various waterways."
"From the perspective of a landlocked European country, inland waterways should be given rather more prominence in this overall context."
"Given the likelihood that east-west transit traffic on Austrian roads will increase sharply as a consequence of enlargement to the East, shipping on the River Danube will represent an important alternative."
"The efficient management of passenger and goods transport on the Danube is bound to take on a regional dimension in the context of the accession negotiations with the eastern countries bordering on the Danube, and this alternative transport corridor must be used to relieve the already unbearable pressure on the roads."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kinnock has asked me to apologize to you for not being able to be here today."
"He is attending a meeting of the Transport Council in Luxembourg."
"First of all I would like to thank Mr Sindal and the Committee on Transport for this very positive and constructive opinion."
"I note as well that the opinion gives support to the policy of the Commission regarding the measures proposed in the communication on the development of short sea shipping."
"I understand the anxiety about the need for more emphasis to be given to the social dimension of maritime transport."
"This dimension, which preserves, in particular, the know-how of European seafarers through education and vocational training and the availability of qualified personnel in the countries of the European Union, is covered in more detail in the Commission's communication on the new strategy for shipping which was published last March."
"The communication proposes joint action by the European Union and the Member States to promote seafaring vocational training programmes and to attract young people to the shipping professions with a view to preserving the seafaring specializations in the European Union and to meeting present and future demand for well-trained seafarers with high levels of skill."
"In due course you, as the Parliament, will undoubtedly turn your attention to the specific measures proposed in the communication, and I feel sure that you will view them as positive."
"In the framework of that communication, the Commission has embarked on a study of the vocational training and employment of seafarers in the Member States."
"The study will cover the following areas:"
"first, world trends in employment in the marine professions; -second, the measures taken by the Member States to promote shipping vocational training and career development programmes for seafarers; -third, other measures which may be necessary for the purpose of attracting young people to the professions."
"Obviously, we will make the recommendations of the study known to Parliament and the other institutions."
"The study will be discussed with shipowners and the unions in the framework of the Joint Maritime Transport Committee.In response to the question by Mr Watts concerning the direct action that we intend to take, I can inform the House that the Commission is currently drawing up a draft Council regulation on the extension of the combined transport pilot actions."
"The five-year experimental programme will be completed in December of this year."
"The Commission intends to use the new PACT programme to make the combined transport pilot projects concerned with short sea shipping eligible for financial support on an equal basis with those relating to other forms of transport."
"Short sea shipping continues to occupy an important position in on-going activities of the Commission such as the fourth framework programme on research and development, the integration of ports into the trans-European transport network and the support for pilot actions."
"With reference to Mr Van der Waal's concern about the cumbersome administrative burden of veterinary checks, and the question of the legislation itself, the Commission is working closely with the Member States, and I believe that we are already making some progress."
"In the future development of policy in the short sea shipping sector the Commission will take account of Parliament's recommendations and will keep it informed about progress that is made."
"In addition, as recommended in Parliament's report, the Commission will liaise with the Short Sea Panel of the Maritime Industries Forum on the implementation of the action programme envisaged in the communication."
"This process has already begun, and the seventh plenary of the forum in Marseilles on 4 and 5 July will make a first formal assessment of the progress that has been made so far."
"To conclude, I would like to thank Mr Sindal again for his splendid report and the European Parliament for its painstaking perusal of the communication."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Climate change"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the current and future strategy on climate change."
"Mr President, I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss the preparations for the second conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change, and especially the role which the European Union intends to play at this conference."
"I shall not repeat here this evening what I said at the excellent hearing in February, and nor will I repeat what we all know, namely that we have sufficient scientific evidence of climate change and that what we need is political action."
"So I shall concentrate on what is taking place now."
"The second conference will be held in Geneva from 8 to 18 July."
"It is part of the process of leading the parties to the convention to enter into further commitments."
"The key issues as regards this mandate are as follows: firstly, to bring about agreement among the industrialized countries on setting targets for a reduction in greenhouse gases for the years 2005, 2010 and, if possible, 2020; and, secondly, to secure their agreement on common measures which will enable them to achieve these targets."
"For the industrialized countries, this mandate therefore goes much further than the commitment under the convention itself, which principally sets the target of stabilizing the emissions of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels in the year 2000."
"It is anticipated that these agreements will take the form of a protocol to the framework convention."
"For the first time in the international negotiations on climate change, the industrialized countries will be focusing their efforts on specific targets for reductions in the coming decades, and on specific political measures to achieve them."
"And the negotiations will of course therefore be difficult."
"Under the timetable laid down in the Berlin mandate, agreement is to be reached on these issues at the second and third conferences of the parties, the latter to take place at the end of 1997."
"The negotiations on the Berlin mandate have scarcely begun, however."
"The process is a complex and difficult one, not only because there are so many different matters to discuss, but also because the industrialized countries - both inside and outside the Union - have a variety of points of departure."
"All the parties are now in the process of establishing what commitments they think they can enter into."
"The second conference of the parties should thus be regarded as an intermediate step with the aim of giving further political direction to this process."
"The view taken by the European Union is that we should continue to base ourselves on the principle of precaution, and that the second conference should therefore fully endorse the evaluation report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which was also discussed by us in some detail in February."
"It is extremely important that the European Union should maintain its leading role in these negotiations."
"The targets that we set, the political strategies for achieving them and the measures to reduce emissions must be both ambitious and credible."
"As regards the strategies and measures to be laid down in the future protocol to the convention, the Union has already put forward proposals covering a wide range of fields, such as economic instruments, standards for the energy efficiency of products, transport and renewable sources of energy."
"At the second conference, this EU initiative will be pursued in other sectors, and here I would mention forestry, agriculture and industry."
"Against this background, the Commission will continue to be a driving force in the process."
"I have therefore decided to seek a mandate from the Council, following the second conference of the parties, to negotiate on the basis of Article 228 of the Treaty."
"The proposal for this mandate, preparations for which are well under way, will concentrate firstly on securing ambitious and credible targets for reductions for the group of Annex 1 parties, i.e. for the most part the industrialized countries as a whole, in accordance with the timetable laid down in the Berlin mandate, and secondly on the content of the protocol on political strategies and the measures to be taken at a number of levels."
"An ambitious and consistent policy on climate change has a very high priority in the European Union."
"To implement such a policy, we need to be active and credible both domestically and internationally."
"The measures we take must be framed in such a way that they show our wish to achieve results and increase our credibility."
"The Commission fully recognizes this, and therefore regrets the recent development in the ECOFIN Council regarding the proposed CO2 energy tax, just as we regret the reduction in the Commission's proposed budget for SAVE II by the Energy Council."
"We in the Commission are firmly convinced of the need for an EU-wide tax instrument to support the efforts to reduce CO2 emissions."
"The Commission therefore does not intend to withdraw the current proposal."
"Mr President, it is now four years since the Commission published its original proposal for the introduction of a Community-wide CO2 energy tax."
"At the time it was seen as an essential part of the Community's efforts to meet international targets which, after all, they had agreed at Rio."
"In spite of that agreement, four years on the proposal still stands blocked by the very Council whose members agreed these original targets."
"As the Commissioner has said, earlier this year in February the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection had a public hearing during which a series of distinguished speakers told us of the dramatic effect climate change might have."
"Drought, storm damage, floods would become more likely and medium and long-term insurance costs are therefore likely to become considerable burdens on industry and consequently on job creation."
"The Council seems to have forgotten that sustainable jobs depend on a sustainable environment."
"Short-term thinking in both industry and governments has meant that Council is still unwilling to take any action."
"The latest ridiculous example of this was the slashing of the SAVE II programme."
"Have these people never heard of the precautionary principle?"
"Do they not take advice from their own scientists?"
"Do they not realise that they are prejudicing the well-being and even the livelihood of European citizens?"
"The lessons from last week's Rome Conference in which the Commissioner, the Italian President-in-Office and myself took part are there to be learned."
"In spite of increased unemployment, the fact is that taxation on labour has more than doubled in the last thirty years but taxation on resource-use has remained steady at only 10 %."
"It is time we embraced the economic model advanced in Chapter 10 of the Delors White Paper and altered that balance."
"As far as we are concerned, the Commission must redouble its efforts to persuade Member States that the creation of employment and the protection of the environment go hand in hand."
"Both demand a credible and active policy to reduce CO2 emissions through a combination of incentive, regulation and progressive taxation."
"That policy is needed sooner rather than later."
"I hope, therefore, that when the conference of parties to the Convention on Climate Change meets in July, they will not simply add to the greenhouse effect by generating even more hot air."
"We have had quite enough of that."
"It is the role of the Community to persuade its Member States to take action and I hope the Commission will take that job seriously and persuade all Member States to cooperate fully in producing that action."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner's statement and, in particular, that she speaks on behalf of the Commission in deploring the latest developments in the Council over the CO2 energy tax."
"I agree with her emphasis on the political nature of this problem and welcome her call for us to take a leading role."
"But if we are to take a leading role we have to be politically credible; and if we are going to be credible we have to learn the lessons of the past, which is that very little has actually been achieved."
"Very little has been achieved in recent years because of the determined blocking of the political process by particular lobbies that threw dirt in the potential way forward of solving the administrative problems and indeed denied the whole scientific basis."
"I share with her the belief that the relevant timescale is from now until the Kyoto Conference."
"The mandate is important: it is important that the Council gives the Commission a mandate for widespread negotiations, and these are not just negotiations with the Americans, they have to be negotiations with the Chinese and the Indians as well."
"This is a global problem and it needs a global solution."
"There is a need to refresh the debate and to talk about not global warming but climate protection, to recognize that the ground of the debate has shifted, that there are people in the insurance industry and the agriculture industry who are already feeling the advanced impact of climate change."
"So I have brought her this evening a modest proposal which I invite her to support."
"It would dramatise political attention if we were to indicate exactly why this is so politically difficult."
"It is so politically difficult because of the fossil fuel industries' determination to jam up the legislative process both here and in America."
"So I invite her to support an idea of mine, which is that we should take to naming hurricanes after oil companies."
"When hurricane Exxon hits the Florida coast this might well focus attention quite eloquently."
"I should like to endorse what the last two speakers have said and also thank the Commissioner for the commitment she has shown on this issue; the matter is best summed up by saying that we have the knowledge, but need political action, and this is not in fact a situation where there are grounds for criticizing the Commission."
"I therefore join in the regret at the lack of a decision by the ECOFIN Council on the CO2 tax and the decision taken by the Energy Council on SAVE II, which show that when it comes to realities, the Council wants neither taxes nor research, in other words it wants nothing at all when it comes down to it."
"The Commissioner said that the Union should take the lead in this field, and here one has to say that the Commission has taken the lead, but the Union certainly has not, and the risk we are running at the moment is that the climate issue will be one of the really sorry, not to say frosty chapters in the long history of the Union, while reality shows that what is in fact involved is global warming."
"Mr President, I wish I could take pleasure in hearing the Commissioner say that the Commission wanted to be ambitious and realistic."
"The realism, unfortunately, consists today in recognizing that we are in something of a blind alley, especially as far as energy taxation is concerned."
"But since we are talking of ambition, I believe we must ask some questions about the types of initiative that the Commission and the European Union might take in the coming weeks in connection with the Geneva conference."
"I should like to know what the Commissioner thinks of the German proposal that has been tabled, namely that we should set ourselves a new target of a 10 % reduction in greenhouse-gas concentrations by 2005 and a 15 % reduction by 2010."
"It is a proposal that my political friends and I find too weak, but it points in the right direction."
"We believe it is totally realistic to set a 20 % reduction in the 1990 figure as a target for 2005, a 30 % reduction for 2010 and 50 % for 2030."
"It is perfectly realistic from a technical point of view as well as being economically advantageous."
"All the arguments prove that, which is why I think we ought to move in this direction."
"My second question is this: it would seem that a discussion paper has been circulating in the Commission in which it is proposed that a maximum permissible concentration of greenhouse gases, or rather of CO2 , be introduced and that this ceiling be set at 550 parts per million."
"May I point out that before the industrial age there were 280 ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and that an increase to 550 ppm, which is virtually double the concentration, would entail a temperature increase of two degrees."
"Is the Commissioner able to confirm or deny the existence of this paper, and what does she think of its alleged content?"
"I believe that is quite crucial to the future course of our debate."
"Commissioner, I should like to associate myself with the congratulations that have been expressed to you on the objectives and ambitions you have established for the Commission, but if I may strike a whimsical note - with all due respect to yourself - I feel that it is not the Commission we should be listening to here but the Council of Ministers, since all guidelines established by the Commission are systematically destroyed by the Council."
"I am thinking especially of Jacques Delors' Directive on CO2 -based energy, which was buried with great haste by the Council in Essen in 1994."
"I am also thinking of a number of other proposals made by the Commission which were never put into effect."
"We have to tell the Commission that its ambitions are noble but that it ought to go further, especially with regard to the fifth action programme, in which it set itself the aim of incorporating an environmental aspect into all its policies."
"But whenever we discuss transport in particular, we notice that the environmental aspect is excluded."
"The Maastricht Treaty may well be criticized, but to its credit it does lay down convergence criteria and quantifies them."
"We have no such criteria for the environment or for combating the greenhouse effect."
"Why, Commissioner, should we not establish environmental convergence criteria which the Member States and the Commission and governments would be bound to follow and which would be quantified in accordance with environmental needs?"
"I have the feeling that, with the environment and the greenhouse effect, we shall have to go careering into a brick wall - as is happening with the BSE crisis - before we realize that a radical change of direction is needed."
"Once again, the vacuum left by the lack of political will has been filled, as Mr Spencer rightly said, by business, liberalism and the quest for profit."
"Shall we have to leave the government of Europe to the tender mercies of those multinationals which, at the moment, are doing their business at the expense of consumers?"
"I think not."
"Finally, the latest UN conference, Habitat II on cities, illustrates to us how urgently the Commission needs to let its voice be heard by the Council of Ministers and, ultimately, to reassert its authority."
"Mr President, I sometimes have the impression that disasters are already happening, but we refuse to admit that they are the result of climate change."
"It is becoming increasingly clear from research that human intervention in the form of emissions of greenhouse gases is causing climate change, so that even those who most stubbornly refuse to accept that there is a link are beginning to have their doubts."
"We do not appear to know yet what the precise link is, and I would therefore ask the Commission to intensify its research programme in this field."
"It seems to me that we need more information on this link in order to be able to develop an appropriate reduction strategy."
"What does the Commission think about this?"
"What approach does it intend to adopt at the forthcoming conference on climate change and the developing countries?"
"What efforts are we making in Europe, and which projects by the developing countries are we prepared to support financially?"
"Does the Commissioner agree that if the Union is to maintain its credibility, we must ensure that the support we provide is balanced between Europe and the developing world?"
"Mr President, as the greenhouse gases build up, there is a growing likelihood that our climate will be adversely affected, and we must always bear in mind that the climate is not a linear system, in that very sudden, unexpected changes can occur, causing whole eco-systems to disappear at a stroke."
"We now know from many scientific reports what kind of counter-measures are required, and where and by whom they should be taken, but the introduction of such measures is being delayed, because unfortunately the many fine words are not being followed by the necessary deeds."
"I would have particularly liked to see the introduction of what are described as 'no regrets' measures - measures which, whatever the circumstances, bring immediate and substantial benefits to the environment by reducing pollutants, and which undoubtedly improve energy efficiency as well as creating jobs, as previous speakers have pointed out."
"When one thinks that a third of all the CO2 emissions in the world are caused by energy generation and distribution, we have surely not yet fully exhausted the potential savings, which should at long last be introduced, because of course lower energy consumption not only does less damage to the environment and reduces emissions into the atmosphere, but can also have a major impact on the competitiveness of our countries."
"I hope, Commissioner, that in the discussions on the mandate which you are to be given, you will draw the attention of the Council members in particular to the fact that decisions like the slashing of the SAVE II programme are totally at odds with the declarations which they make."
"Mr President, the Commissioner tells us that we have done everything we can to reduce CO2 emissions, but we have failed in our aim and now, four years on, we are once again going to a conference where we will be trying our best to come to some sort of new agreement."
"And what was the reason for our failure? According to the Commissioner, it was because the ECOFIN Council will not accept our CO2 tax."
"But we have known for two years now that ECOFIN will not accept the CO2 tax, so why does the European Union not try to develop a number of alternatives instead?"
"The next question is: what exactly should it do?"
"Will we have to change from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, and reduce energy consumption?"
"What has the Commission agreed to do about this, or is the CO2 tax still the only thing anyone talks about?"
"What precise agreements have been reached?"
"The best idea, it seems to me, would be to see what we can arrange on a voluntary basis with our industries, in the form of self-regulation."
"Why can we not do this, instead of simply waiting to see what a CO2 tax will achieve, when we know that there is no chance of it going through at the moment?"
"I would therefore urge the Commissioner to come up with a plan that we can consider in parallel with the CO2 tax, so that we can go along to the international conference with some honest proposals."
"Mr Blokland is quite right when he says that if we, the industrialized countries of the European Union, cannot get anything done, then we really cannot expect the developing countries to do anything either."
"Mr President, my question relates to what the previous speaker and the other Dutch Members have said."
"What we are talking about this evening obviously concerns the developing countries, and the Netherlands has already felt the effects, as it were, of climate changes in the Antilles."
"I have a very specific question which relates to those raised by my colleagues."
"There is an organization called AOSIS, the Alliance of Small Island States, and if there is one subject close to its heart it is climate change."
"The islands of the Pacific and the Caribbean will be in the front line if the situation deteriorates."
"An ambassador in the Pacific once said 'we are the canaries of the mines' ."
"If the canary drops dead, you know you have to get out of the mine, and that is what these small island states are."
"My question to the Commission is this: these islands are very well aware that they are in the front line."
"There are atolls in the Pacific which are being evacuated at this very moment, but this is not even mentioned in the European press."
"There are 200 or 300 people who are being moved from the atolls where they have lived for generations."
"Many of the AOSIS states are ACP countries - in fact, one third of the ACP countries with which Europe has development agreements are small island states."
"Is the Commissioner prepared to develop a plan with Mr Pinheiro, who is responsible for the ACP countries, to try to work with them to provide help for the AOSIS states, and is she also prepared to attend the hearing on climate change which the ACP Assembly is organizing in Brussels in September?"
"Mr President, the reports we have debated here this evening have had a great deal to say about climate change."
"They dealt with precisely the problem taken up by Commissioner Bjerregaard."
"I believe that the debate has demonstrated Parliament's concern for this issue extremely well; there was not a single speaker who did not stress the importance of taking measures in this field."
"I believe it is interesting to return to the report of the Brundtland Commission, where climate changes - the climate issue - is cited as being the environmental issue of greatest priority in the report 'Environment and Development' ."
"With regard to the intensive debate we have had on nuclear energy, it is also interesting that this report takes roughly the same line as Commissioner Cresson did very recently, namely that safety measures must be increased in this field so that nuclear energy can be used in the positive battle to achieve lower carbon dioxide emissions."
"I should then like to ask the Commissioner if it would still not be possible, despite previous failures, to continue with carbon taxes and attempt to convince the Member States of the wisdom of carrying out these measures."
"I might perhaps be able to advise them to study carefully the carbon taxes which have been introduced in Sweden."
"I willingly admit that we have had failures in some areas but in others these taxes have been very successful."
"There is every reason to promote this in other countries in the Union."
"Mr President, I am grateful for the many helpful comments on a problem which I recognize is one that we agree should be taken seriously."
"There are a few points which I should like to make about some of what has been said."
"I very much agree with Mr Collins that when you run into difficulties, there is little else to do but try to redouble your efforts, and I think we are in fact trying to do so."
"That is why we are now seeking to obtain a mandate in connection with the negotiations at the end of 1997, as both I and Mr Collins mentioned, and to make progress with the use of economic means in general."
"I also share Mr Spencer's view from the other side of the House that we must naturally concern ourselves with what we are able to do here in the Union, but that it is important for us to bring about the dialogue which is so urgently needed with China and India, for example, if these problems are actually to be resolved."
"Several Members referred to the SAVE II programme."
"Mrs Dybkjær did so, and Mr Blokland called for more resources to be provided for targeted research programmes."
"It may well be said that what took place in the Energy Council, where my colleague Mr Papoutsis argued very strongly against the cutback which was decided, seems most unreasonable and also casts some doubt on what we can actually achieve in the area of research, but it will not prevent us from trying again to see how far it is possible for us to go."
"Mr Lannoye referred specifically to the German proposal and the objective which it contained."
"We are currently working on several different objectives put forward by countries in the Union, and we are glad to support many of the proposals which have been made, because we need ambitious targets in order to make any progress at all, and we do wish to make progress in the negotiations."
"This is a general objective on which we have an opportunity of moving forward."
"The only contribution here this evening which I did not actually understand was the one by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, because it appeared from her speech that we in the Commission are supposed to have sat back and waited and not really done anything, because we cannot get our CO2 tax through at the moment."
"I am sure Mrs Oomen-Ruijten will remember that the Commission, when it emerged that we would be unable to get the tax through, brought forward guidelines which gave the Member States some scope for making progress, because we did not just want to resign ourselves to waiting when we made no progress on this in the ECOFIN Council, and so we have been continuing our work."
"There is a new mandate, on the basis of which Commissioner Monti is currently working, and as regards the international conferences we have been talking about here this evening, they have nothing to do with the tax, they are about the targets, and then we have to choose the means we are going to use in this area."
"I can tell Mrs van Putten that measures are well under way to help the smaller islands, and to help with the problems to which she referred."
"I will gladly look at the scope for doing more, together with Commissioner Pinheiro."
"We are very conscious of the matter, and there is excellent cooperation in this area."
"I would say to Mr Virgin that one of the purposes of the conference in Rome on economic means was precisely to look at what the Member States have done - including Sweden, but other Member States as well - when they have tried to use economic means; how these have worked, what weaknesses there have been, and how we can possibly make further progress with this approach."
"The real breakthrough in this area lies in the negotiations at the intergovernmental conference and involves extending majority decision-making to other sectors, but that is - and I think Parliament would agree - a different debate which we must have on another occasion."
"Mr President, I gather that the Commissioner says she did not understand my question."
"Let me explain."
"First of all, because of climate change we reached a number of agreements on reducing CO2 which we have been discussing for the last four years. In the meantime, the Commission has come up with the idea of a CO2 tax, but this has not gone through."
"My question is: what progress has Europe really made in reducing CO2 ?"
"And the answer is none at all."
"So I wonder why, in addition to this tax idea, we should not also try to bring about voluntary reductions by encouraging a voluntary shift from fossil fuels to other renewable energy sources, as has already been done very successfully in the Netherlands?"
"Why can you not try something like this?"
"Why not try and move forward with new projects instead of just sitting back and waiting?"
"Mr President, the Commissioner answered one of my two questions but not the other."
"The second question referred to whether or not a proposal was about to be put forward by the Commission limiting the acceptable future concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to a ceiling of 550 parts per million."
"That would lead, it must be said, to an average temperature increase of two degrees."
"Does this proposal exist, or does it not?"
"Is it a basis for discussion?"
"I would say to Mr Lannoye that as far as I am aware, this is not our proposal, although it has entered into some of the negotiations; however, it would not be particularly wise of me to say more without studying this in further detail, so as to be sure of giving you a correct and more complete answer."
"I should then like to say again to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten that I understood her first speech very well, which differed from all the other speeches here this evening by taking the view that the Commission had done nothing at all since we were unable to secure the introduction of the CO2 tax."
"That is not true."
"As I pointed out, we went on to bring forward a number of guidelines designed to improve the situation."
"In addition, we have been calling very strongly for targets to be established, and we have been active in this respect following the Berlin conference."
"This has been achieved for some countries in various ways, and we have explained some of the ways in which it has been done."
"We are continuing with our task, and it is clear from our programme of work that there will be a communication on voluntary agreements aimed at considering how these can play a part not only in terms of climate change, but in other areas too, and I very much hope that the programme concerning motor oils, which is closely linked to emissions and the scope for reducing them, will go through at the Commission meeting tomorrow."
"So while we maintain that a CO2 tax would be sensible and appropriate, we have worked on guidelines, we are naturally working on many other proposals, and as regards the international conferences, we are not abandoning our aim of establishing reasonable standards in the negotiations that will take place with other countries."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, concerning item No 10 on page 16 of the Minutes, Mr Novo raised the matter of the use of the bridge over rue Belliard to film a demonstration."
"The President said that he would reply in writing."
"It was a legitimate question and we are all entitled to hear the answer."
"If Parliament's premises are to be used by the goons and the ginks and the finks we are all entitled to know."
"Perhaps the Minutes do not record the President's words accurately, Mr Smith."
"He asked Mr Novo to submit his observations to him in writing."
"Clearly, he could not give an immediate reply, and since he did not have direct knowledge of the events in question, he asked Mr Novo to make his point in writing, so that he could make the necessary inquiries and provide an answer as soon as possible."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Calendar of part-sessions"
"At its meeting of 13 June, the Conference of Presidents decided to propose the following calendar of part-sessions for 1997:"
"13 to 17 January; - 29 to 30 January; - 17 to 21 February; - 10 to 14 March; - 7 to 11 April; - 23 to 24 April; - 12 to 16 May; - 28 to 29 May; - 9 to 13 June; - 25 to 26 June; - 14 to 18 July; - 8 to 12 September; - 24 to 25 September; - 6 to 10 October; - 20 to 24 October; - 5 to 6 November; - 17 to 21 November; - 3 to 4 December; - 15 to 19 December.The deadline for tabling amendments to these dates is 5 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 July."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday, 17 July."
"Mr President, am I correct in thinking you said that the deadline for tabling amendments would be Wednesday 3 July?"
"That would be preposterous."
"It would be before we have a proper discussion in the main group meetings."
"You have to allow the full group meeting in the week before the plenary session so that groups can make decisions as to how they will vote."
"This is not the prerogative of four or five people sitting in a smoke-filled, or any other, room."
"The groups have to meet."
"I urge you to look at the deadline for amendments so that the proper full group meeting that is normally only held on a Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning can take place and so that the Members of this House have some say in how and where they meet."
"Thank you, Mr Tomlinson. The President set this deadline precisely so that the political groups would be able to discuss the calendar beforehand."
"In any event, I shall pass on your comments to the President."
"There is another meeting of the Conference of Presidents this Thursday, and the group chairmen will thus have an opportunity to discuss the deadline and change it if necessary."
"Decision on urgency"
"Mr Santini has the floor to give the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture as the committee responsible."
"Mr President, since Mr Jacob, the chairman of the committee is not here, I wish to express in his place the view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that is to say the decision we have taken not to agree to urgency on this matter."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"Mr President, I would formally request the House to agree to urgent procedure."
"We have fallen badly behind with our emergency aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"I was there with other Members a fortnight ago, and we were able to see that the emergency aid of ECU 92 million cannot be put into effect because of the lack of a legal basis."
"Please do not make the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who desperately need this money, pay the price of the disagreement over the legal basis."
"If we do not agree to urgent procedure, it will take longer still for this money even to reach the start of the administrative process."
"I would implore you to vote in favour of urgent procedure in this case."
"Mr President, we shall be looking at the question of finance tomorrow afternoon, and I hope that we can take the vote on Thursday, because the Committee on Budgets adopted that report unanimously yesterday evening."
"So I do not see how urgency will make any difference as far as the report on the regulation is concerned."
"We would prefer to keep to the planned timetable, in other words to have the vote on the Committee on Budgets' report on Thursday and the debate on the report on the regulation in due course."
"Mr President, with reference to the alarming situation in Bosnia, agreement was reached in January of this year at a tripartite meeting of Parliament, the Council and the Commission on guidelines for the budget concerned."
"Most of the appropriations are to be used for the procurement of goods for the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"In other words, thanks to Parliament's decision in January to approve disbursement, EU aid is already a reality in the region and continues to flow in."
"The legal formalities surrounding this aid do not therefore need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency."
"Secondly, Mr President, the Commission and the Council have taken six months before deciding they wanted to seek Parliament's views on these legal issues."
"If Parliament now takes one month it can hardly be regarded as unreasonably dilatory."
"Thirdly, however, Mr President, we in the European Parliament have objections to the procedure proposed by the Council."
"The Council decided on the regulation at its meeting of 10 June 1996 in Luxembourg, when it also amended the Commission's proposal."
"Now Parliament is being consulted on an issue on which the Council has already adopted a standpoint."
"I do not wish to rule out the possibility that Parliament will request negotiations with the Council once it has given its opinion in July."
"In any event, Mr President, we should today reject the proposal from the Council for a special urgent debate on this subject."
"Thank you, Mr Cars."
"We have heard one speaker in favour and one against, and Mr Cars has spoken on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I now put the request for urgency to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"EMI annual report - Currency fluctuations and the internal market - Exchange rate relations- Broad guidelines of economic policies"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0180/96) by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the second annual report of the European Monetary Institute (C4-0228/96); -the report (A4-0181/96) by Mr Pérez Royo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission (COM(95)0503 - C4-0011/96) on the impact of currency fluctuations on the internal market; -the report (A4-0186/96) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the interim report by the Commission to the European Council (CSE(95)2108 - C4-0308/96) on the exchange rate relations between the Member States taking part in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union and the remaining Member States; -the oral question (B4-0561/96-0-0126/96) by Mr Cassidy, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, to the Council, on the recommendation on the broad guidelines of the economic policies; -the oral question (B4-0567/96-0-0130/96) by Mr Hughes, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, to the Commission, on broad guidelines of the economic policies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief."
"I do not intend to outline the report by the European Monetary Institute, but simply to comment on three rather important points which it raises."
"First of all, there is the work done by the Institute since the end of last year, which I am pleased to be able to tell you has gone according to schedule."
"In other words, we are still on course to complete the structure for the future European Central Bank, and we have not encountered any serious delays."
"There is therefore every reason to believe that the Bank will indeed be able to get the single currency up and running in 1999."
"This was the first point I wished to make."
"Secondly, there is the analysis of the economic situation which we give in the report."
"There have been no significant changes since the report was drawn up."
"Of course, we are all concerned about current economic developments, and we are all wondering, individually and collectively, how likely it is that we shall see signs of a recovery in the course of this year."
"In my personal opinion it is extremely likely, and I expect to see a recovery in the second half of the year, though I cannot predict how strong it will be."
"But whatever doubts there may be at the moment about its scale and strength, it is growing increasingly likely that it will happen."
"Thirdly, there is the process of convergence, which the report covers in some detail."
"I am pleased to say that further progress has been made on convergence on inflation, interest rates and the stabilization of exchange rates, and we are certainly heading in the right direction."
"Our budgetary concerns are, of course, the same as they were when the report was drawn up, but it is encouraging to see that the analyses carried out in the various countries and the budget plans announced by the governments are converging too."
"I think that each and every country is fully aware of the scale of the problems confronting us, with or without Maastricht."
"So the fact that our thinking, analyses and determination to find a solution to these problems are all converging is of crucial importance, and is essential if the government policies which are currently being put in place are to succeed."
"We will have a clearer picture towards the end of the year, once we have seen the budget forecasts for next year."
"These were the comments I wished to make to accompany our annual report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the second Annual Report of the European Monetary Institute contains an adequate analysis of the progress made by the Union's economies in the process of economic and monetary convergence, as well as a detailed description of the preparatory work for the third stage of economic and monetary union, with particular emphasis being placed on the report on the changeover to the single currency which formed the basis of the European Council's decision of December 1995, the agreement on the interconnection in real time of gross settlement systems - the 'Target' system - and the coordination of the instruments of monetary policy."
"There are still far too many question marks over the final outcome of this process, in which the European Monetary Institute plays a fundamental role."
"Despite the fact that six months ago, at the Madrid summit, the Heads of State or Government of the Member States firmly reiterated their commitment to achieving economic and monetary union and introducing the single currency, certain statements made in political, economic and financial circles have been casting doubts on whether these objectives are entirely viable."
"As Mr Lamfalussy said, the process of economic convergence is meeting with success in three respects: inflation, interest rates and exchange-rate stability."
"Nevertheless, the hoped-for economic recovery - which six months ago, the European Commission was calling robust - has failed to materialize."
"We are in a period of uncertainty, of economic sluggishness - there was even a slight recession in the first quarter of the year - which can only be explained by the lack of consumer and investor confidence brought about respectively by the high level of unemployment and the necessary budgetary cutbacks, all of which is preventing the economic upturn from occurring."
"In my view, therefore, the only course is for the Community institutions - and especially the Council - to give a clear and resolute signal that the process of economic and monetary union, as set out in the Maastricht Treaty, is irreversible. Consequently, it is essential for economic operators to be provided with adequate guarantees that enable them to give a boost to the kind of economic activity in which investment plays a key role in both promoting the recovery and ensuring that the European economy is sufficiently competitive in the medium term."
"In this context, the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy stresses the need to enhance the role and the capacities of the EMI, especially in view of the fact that 1996 is a decisive year for economic and monetary union, since according to Article 109f of the Maastricht Treaty, the EMI must specify by 31 December the regulatory, organizational and logistical framework necessary for the European System of Central Banks to perform its tasks in the final stage of EMU."
"We believe that in its activities hitherto, the EMI has been excessively reserved and restrained."
"Our committee takes the view that the EMI should adopt a firmer and more resolute approach, enabling it to play a more active role in the coordination of the Member States' monetary policies and to establish flexible working relationships with the international financial institutions, in particular the International Monetary Fund. Also, the committee gives its backing to the proposal that the EMI should be rigorous in the application of Articles 104 and 104a of the Maastricht Treaty, which prohibit monetary financing and privileged access - cases of which have occurred, albeit on a small scale, and which must be eliminated completely."
"Our committee also stresses the need for the adjustment of internal control mechanisms, with the introduction of new and effective procedures aimed at preventing the kind of distortions which occurred in connection with financial derivatives."
"Finally, it is calling for the European Monetary Institute's activities to be extended to more operational fields, in view of the timetable and objectives entrusted to the EMI, which is a key player - and, we would wish, a more active one - in the process of preparing for economic and monetary union and the single currency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the honour of presenting to the House today concerns the monetary fluctuations which occurred during 1992 and 1993 - and indeed 1995 - and which, as we know, had a significant impact on the functioning of the European exchange-rate mechanism and the internal market itself, leading first and foremost to changes in competitiveness in favour of those currencies which suffered depreciations."
"Secondly, it should be remembered that as a result of these monetary fluctuations or upheavals, two currencies left the European Monetary System in 1992."
"The EMS was itself modified in 1993, with the broadening of the fluctuation bands."
"Above all, however, the distorting effects on the internal market caused by the uncertainty and insecurity in the markets resulting from these fluctuations should be underlined."
"The main concern of our report is not so much to produce a balance sheet of winners and losers as a result of these fluctuations, but to draw the lessons from the past which must be taken into account in the future, especially when it comes to defining the relationship between the euro and the currencies which temporarily remain outside EMU."
"As far as the causes of the fluctuations are concerned, we must focus principally on the inadequate coordination of the economic policies of the Member States, whose economies, prior to 1992, displayed very different patterns of behaviour as regards inflation, budget deficits and interest rates."
"This situation contrasted with the stability of nominal exchange rates, which progressively diverged from real exchange rates, giving rise to the corrective action of the markets, which was also encouraged by the lack of flexibility of the EMS which existed at the time."
"With regard to the effects of the fluctuations, we agree with the Commission communication that they were not particularly noticeable at macro-economic level, neither in terms of the volume of external trade of the countries affected, nor the increase in market share."
"On the whole, the effects were mainly felt at sectoral level, with a reduction in the profit margins of undertakings in countries whose currencies appreciated."
"In any event, we would stress that the principal damaging effects were those caused to the smooth and effective functioning of the internal market. This was especially due to the fact that the fluctuations of European currencies were accompanied by fluctuations of the dollar and yen, underlining Europe's need for a single currency - the euro - capable of functioning autonomously as a reserve currency at international level and offsetting the fluctuations of these and other currencies."
"I should also like to draw attention to the fact that in recent years - those of the second stage of EMU, the current stage in the process - there has been an improvement in the coordination of the economies of the Fifteen, which have made progress towards convergence. This progress has been underpinned by the behaviour of the markets, which appear to be demonstrating their confidence that the timetable for economic and monetary union will be met."
"Since 1993, the European Monetary System has functioned satisfactorily."
"Despite the broadening of the fluctuation bands, the currencies which form part of the EMS have been moving within reduced margins which correspond to the narrow bands in force before the summer of 1993."
"This very week, if we examine the EMS grid, we can see that the difference in parities between the strongest and weakest currencies is less than 2 %. And this has been the case continuously now for several months."
"In this context, the report recommends that an explicit call should be made for those currencies at present outside the European Monetary System, both those which left it in 1993 and those of the new Member States - which, with the exception of Austria, have not yet joined the EMS, to be integrated into it as soon as possible."
"And, in this respect, we must welcome the rumours - because at present they are no more than rumours - of the imminent return of the lira to the EMS, as well as the entry of the Finnish mark."
"Looking towards the future, it is important to stress the need to strengthen the mechanisms for coordinating economic policies at European level; and it could even be argued that the ECOFIN Council should progressively become a kind of economic government of the Union."
"Finally, I should like to make a few brief comments concerning the relationship between the 'ins' and the 'outs' - between the euro and the currencies which remain outside EMU."
"This issue is the subject of the report which will be introduced next, so I shall deal with it very quickly."
"There is a broad consensus on the need for a system which has the euro as a pivot, in relation to which the currencies which remain temporarily outside EMU would float within bands of an agreed width. This system would be complemented by a practice of inflation targeting approved jointly by the European Central Bank and the central banks of the countries outside EMU."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the third stage of economic and monetary union will begin with the establishment of the European Central Bank on 1 January 1999."
"However, it is probable that not all the Member States will participate, because they are either unwilling or unable to do so."
"This means in effect that monetary union will be achieved at various speeds, and we must ask ourselves the question: is this in fact compatible with the Treaty of Rome?"
"For Denmark and the United Kingdom, the relevant protocols to the Treaty make explicit reference to the socalled 'opting in' and 'opting out' ."
"It is fairly certain that one of these countries, and possibly both, will make use of this opportunity."
"Thus the Treaty itself makes provision for a two-speed Europe."
"Other countries will initially remain outside because they cannot yet meet the stability criteria."
"I would remind the House on this point that the criteria were decided jointly by all the Member States, and then ratified by all the national parliaments without exception."
"We must abide by these criteria as stipulated in the Treaty; they must not be relaxed."
"But nor should any further conditions be laid down before the entry into force of monetary union."
"It would of course be preferable for all the Member States of the European Union to accede to the monetary union simultaneously, but that could only happen at the expense of stability."
"The Maastricht Treaty sets out the priorities unequivocally: the stability of the common European currency is more important than its simultaneous introduction in all the Member States."
"But will not a variable-speed monetary union jeopardize the smooth functioning of the European single market, one of our major achievements?"
"I would refer here to the exchange-rate turbulence experienced in recent years."
"Since 1993, competitive devaluations have caused numerous jobs in the European Union to be put at risk, and even lost."
"Unless stability in the exchange rate between the euro and the other currencies of the Union can be maintained, there will be a danger that the European single market could break up, even after the transition to monetary union, in other words even after 1 January 1999."
"What instruments do we have to prevent this?"
"The prerequisite for exchange-rate stability is that all the EU Member States should operate credible and sound financial, economic and monetary policies."
"In addition, the existing exchange-rate system should be retained in a modified form."
"However, when the new exchange-rate system comes to be designed, with the euro as its anchor currency, account must be taken of the experience gained with the EMS."
"The new system must demonstrate greater simplicity, transparency and flexibility than its predecessor."
"Flexibility is the key: the new exchange-rate system must be more flexible than the previous one."
"Any necessary exchange-rate adjustments between the euro and the other currencies must be geared to the realities of exchange relations, and they must be made in good time."
"A major weakness of the 'old' EMS was that it was up to the Member States involved to initiate the process for adjusting exchange rates."
"Time after time, this resulted in delays for political reasons, leading to adjustments being made under chaotic conditions; such difficulties must be avoided with the new system."
"We therefore support the proposal that the right of setting the adjustment mechanism in motion should be granted to the President of the European Central Bank."
"What is more, the system must have fairly broad margins of fluctuation, to be set by mutual agreement."
"Member States wishing to do so could choose to have closer links with the euro, as they make progress towards meeting the stability criteria."
"Intervention measures in support of currencies experiencing difficulties should be automatic when a currency reaches its fluctuation margin and possible before it does so, provided that such measures are justified by fundamental economic factors, and that their volume does not run counter to the objective of achieving price stability."
"In my personal view, this new exchange-rate system will still function even if the United Kingdom declines to participate."
"The UK only participated for a short while in the present exchange-rate system: its lengthy absence brought no significant disadvantages, and nor did its brief participation lead to significant gains in efficiency for the system."
"It should be borne in mind, however, that under the Treaty, exchange-rate policy is a matter of common interest."
"The UK is therefore obliged to keep the rate of the pound stable against the euro; whether that happens within or outside the exchange-rate system is a secondary issue."
"However, if the UK were to join the system, the exchange rate on entry would this time - unlike last time - have to be set by agreement with the other EU Member States."
"Finally, I would just comment briefly on stability policy after the transition to monetary union."
"Global public sector debt in Europe remains too high, and this works to the detriment of competitiveness and of the younger generation."
"We are therefore awaiting clear proposals from the Commission on how budgetary discipline can be maintained after the entry into force of monetary union."
"Clearly, however, the objective must be that ultimately all the Member States of the European Union will also be members of the monetary union."
"1999 will be the decisive date for the central banks."
"The decisive date for the citizens of Europe will not come until the year 2002, when banknotes and coins in the new currency are to be introduced."
"If all the EU Member States pursue their convergence policies with determination, I am confident that by the second date, which is more relevant to the citizens themselves, a large majority of the Member States will be on board."
"Mr President, it is not in any sense part of my job this morning to answer comments made by previous speakers."
"However, just in parenthesis, I will make the point, following on what my colleague, Karl von Wogau, has just said, that the question of the United Kingdom's relationships with the European Monetary System and exchange rates is, of course, one for markets and not for governments."
"But that is a matter which I am sure we will discuss endlessly in the coming months."
"I speak this morning as the rapporteur on the annual economic report and part of the responsibilities that go with that rapporteurship is producing a report on the broad economic guidelines."
"My first suggestion, addressed to the Commission - and I promise the Commission that this will be my last criticism of it - is that it would be most helpful in future if the Commission could contrive to produce its annual economic report and its broad economic guidelines in sufficient time for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment because these two projects are the joint responsibility of those two committees."
"It would be helpful in future years if we could have the broad economic guidelines a bit earlier, because the trouble this time is that we have had to rush to conclusions because of the deadline at the end of this week of the 21 and 22 June meeting in Florence."
"This has meant that we have not really had time in the Economic Committee to produce a report debated in committee, adopt amendments in committee and then present to this House a report that is properly balanced in the way in which the three previous reports are balanced and reflect consensus in the committee."
"The compromise resolution, which we shall be voting on later today, is therefore unsatisfactory in some respects, but that is an inevitable part of having a compromise."
"Compromises, by definition, do not satisfy everyone and we would say that the joint resolution is all right up to a point but we shall be tabling a number of amendments to it."
"One is to remove the Commission from the line of fire of criticism, because you will have noticed that our resolution is somewhat critical of both the Commission and the Council."
"But we believe that at this stage it is too late to criticize the Commission."
"We shall also be tabling amendments on matters which we feel very strongly about and which, indeed, are in our question to the Council, because at the moment there is no reference in the final resolution to the need for the Member States to analyse the best practice in Member States and, in parenthesis, the United States, in order to identify the policies which can achieve results in bringing down unemployment rapidly."
"This is something which the committee as a whole felt strongly about in the resolution on the annual economic report and it is a significant omission that it is not in the resolution to wind up this debate."
"I hope that the House will agree to incorporate this point and that the House will also agree to the addition that the Member States should create an environment where employers are encouraged to take on workers."
"It is not part of my job to anticipate what the speakers on behalf of the Social Affairs Committee may say on that matter, but it is very clear, with the high level of unemployment in the European Union, that it is unacceptable that there should be something like 18 million unemployed in our society, with 50 million living in poverty or in near poverty."
"Coming to the substance of what the debate this morning is all about, this is actually the European Parliament's opportunity to put forward its views to the European Council which meets in Florence at the end of this week."
"You will find in our resolution something to the effect that our President should take this resolution to Florence."
"The other important point is paragraph 11 of our resolution which calls upon the Irish presidency to report very quickly back to this House on what action is going to be taken by the Member States on the broad economic guidelines."
"I do not know whether there is a representative of the Irish presidency here but, if not, perhaps the representative of the Italian presidency would be kind enough to pass on that message and a copy of our resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are moving towards an important decision."
"The House is likely, by a large majority, to reject as unrealistic and inadequate the broad economic guidelines presented by the Council."
"That is very important, and it is also very important that we should do so by a large majority."
"I agree with Mr Cassidy that we can no longer accept economic growth which is such that employment levels continue to decline."
"I would, however, like to discuss with him in more detail what he means by encouraging employers to take on workers."
"I believe that a very specific form of encouragement is required in the case of companies which are now able to earn far more from currency speculation than they can through genuine economic activity."
"We need a change of direction here."
"As a Parliament - and here too I turn to Mr Cassidy - we have taken a joint decision in many areas that it is high time to put an end to the superficial strategy of pretending that all is well and there are no structural problems; these problems need to be resolved as a matter of urgency."
"Parliament has asked a number of questions which the Commission has taken up in part, very tentatively, and which the Council has not even acknowledged."
"It is therefore the duty of the House to reject these guidelines, not merely for reasons of parliamentary etiquette, but because it is central to our task as a Parliament to tackle the mass unemployment and mass poverty which have become the real scandal of the European Community."
"I would assume that a large majority of us will address ourselves to this task."
"Because of the speed of the procedure, and not any fundamental disagreement with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has asked the Commission a number of supplementary questions."
"This is not because we think that the Commission is the main culprit in this situation, so to speak - rather, the guilt lies chiefly with the Council and the Member States."
"However, the Commission too could do more, and we are therefore asking what initiatives it plans to take to bring about the necessary change in economic policy."
"We are asking about the implementation of our priority of combating mass unemployment effectively, because we cannot expect the citizens of Europe to tolerate another outpouring of meaningless fine words."
"We are also asking in particular about additional Commission measures to send a strong signal to the markets and help revive the economy."
"We are asking for the much-trumpeted initiative of a European pact on employment to be presented at long last."
"We are asking what efforts the Commission plans to make to redress the balance between fiscal and employment policies in the multiannual programmes submitted by the Member States."
"We are asking how the Commission is going to devise and apply common socio-economic indicators which make it possible for a binding debate to take place on the coordination of economic policy, no longer geared solely towards a monetarist approach to national debt. And we are asking for greater coordination between economic and employment policies."
"The decision which we have to take today is not a trivial one."
"The real issue is the point in time when the European Community becomes relevant to every individual in this Community."
"It is a matter of making it clear at last that our Community is one which has set its sights on genuine improvements in the welfare of its citizens, and which is not solely determined to push through a narrow monetarist view of stability policy and a technocratically agreed timeframe and strategy for the introduction of monetary union, at the expense of millions of impoverished and unemployed people."
"I hope we shall decide by a large majority that this cannot go on."
"I also hope that this will be the first impulse for real change."
"Unfortunately, the House does not yet have the power to force a change, but the governments would be well advised to react now, because otherwise the problems will seek out new governments."
"Mr President, you said, when you spoke at the meeting held in Luxembourg on the Council's current economic policy strategy, that although the economic fundamentals were favourable, the Community's overall results were not yet satisfactory."
"That does not, however, mean that the strategy itself is called into question: progress has been made more difficult as a result of the slow-down in activity over the past twelve months but the current strategy needs to be continued and reinforced."
"The Council expects the positive impact of the action taken by the Member States in response to the maximum guidelines to become more perceptible as time goes on, with an improvement in economic conditions."
"The Council therefore confirms the need to continue with the balance-of-payments adjustment and control of inflation, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, and stresses the importance of achieving a stable and appropriate macro-economic policy framework as the pre-condition for increasing growth and reducing the level of unemployment."
"The Council unanimously confirms the need to implement this policy combination, as these are policies which have the backing of the other Community Institutions, the Commission and the European Monetary Institute."
"Consolidation of the process of adjustment, in its current form, is the way to create a macro-economic framework which increases growth and creates jobs."
"That, naturally, presupposes in particular that further progress will be made in reducing government deficits and implementing stability-oriented monetary policies and trends in salaries and wages that are consistent with the objective of price stability and increased productivity."
"If that very ambitious objective is achieved, we shall be able, in the medium if not in the short term, to create the macro-economic circumstances needed to improve the Community's negative record on unemployment, by cutting interest rates."
"As far as structural measures are concerned, the maximum guidelines provide us with a useful set of policy recommendations that have to be implemented under the responsibility of each Member State, enabling us to banish the rigidity that currently affects the labour market by, for example, reforming the social welfare system to guarantee efficiency and fairness between the generations in the current systems; introducing improvements into the education and vocational training system so that priority is given to employment for the less qualified, young people and women; reducing indirect wage costs; encouraging, where appropriate, regional and intersectoral mobility; and reviewing working hours and the organization of work."
"Increasing employment is the main priority, and the Council is trying to identify those experiments which have been successful in the different Member States in improving the employment strategies of those same States."
"That will be one of the focal points of the annual report on employment at the Dublin European Council, and, naturally, as Mr Cassidy has requested, the Italian presidency will pass on your requests to the Irish presidency."
"I can assure you that the convergence programmes are the focal point of the Council's multilateral monitoring procedure."
"The aim of those programmes is to secure the convergence required for participation in the single currency area and they are important in themselves because they are designed to bring about sustainable and non-inflationary growth."
"The Treaty itself establishes a useful range of procedures - maximum economic guidelines, convergence programmes and procedures covering excessive deficits - in order to secure effective coordination."
"This will be further improved as a result of the process which will bring into effect the third phase of European Monetary Union."
"The maximum guidelines for economic policy, as well as the procedures relating to excessive deficits will, of course, become more rigorous in the context of Monetary Union."
"As far as the objective of sound public finances is concerned, some limited progress has already been achieved in the last year."
"The excessive deficit procedure is an effective means of encouraging the efforts of Member States towards consolidation; the concept of countercyclical policy, taken up by Mr Cassidy, is difficult to apply in the context of an open economy, but it is certain that achievement of the fundamental objectives of economic policy, as set out in Article 2 of the Treaty, in particular non-inflationary, stable growth which respects the environment and secures a high level of employment, depends on effective and close coordination between the Member States."
"If we are to increase growth and, therefore, levels of employment, there have to be measures designed to improve the operation of the markets, services and products."
"In its plan for the maximum economic policy guidelines of the Community and the Member States, the Council points out that, as far as the improved operation of the markets is concerned, the individual Member States very largely possess the key to this."
"The Council, however, appreciates that national measures can be reinforced via the guidelines at Community level."
"The problem of increasing levels of unemployment is the main crisis area in a Europe caught between two requirements: the need to reposition its own economic and productive structures generally and the need to safeguard those fundamental social achievements that constitute the distinctive feature of Europe's cultural tradition built up over the passage of time."
"If we are to do that, we need to attach less importance to the role of financial returns and concentrate resources on productive uses."
"Since our approach cannot be to restrict the social rights of workers in an effort to increase Community competitiveness, we shall have rapidly to adopt measures designed to encourage innovation."
"The Commission's Green Paper on innovation makes a very useful contribution to the debate on competitiveness and deserves to be looked at closely in terms of how it can be applied at both national and Community level."
"The Council will be very interested to take part in and contribute to the forthcoming discussions designed to devise specific measures."
"At its meeting of 3 June, the ECOFIN Council achieved some important progress in the field of economic and monetary policy that we are discussing here today."
"Let me just summarize the main issues: as regards preparation for the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union, the Florence European Council will reaffirm that it intends to conclude by the end of the year the technical preparatory work on the legal framework to be used for the euro; the Council has concluded that it would be helpful to consider in parallel the problems of exchange rate parities and budgetary discipline; it has also stressed that, regardless of whether or not they adopt the euro, it is of great concern to all the Member States that Economic and Monetary Union should function properly and that there should be an exchange rate parity mechanism which provides a point of reference for the application of sound economic policies."
"Membership of the new system of exchange rate parities would continue, in the Council's view, to be optional; however, provision can be made for those Member States given an exemption to join the mechanism."
"The Council has suggested that, like the earlier systems, the new system will be set up on the basis of a European Council resolution and become operational following an agreement between the European Central Bank and the central banks of those Member States that have not joined the euro area."
"The Council stated that it favoured an asymmetric system in which the euro acts as an anchor."
"The new system would be designed in such a way as to permit various levels of convergence of the Member States."
"Turning, finally, to budgetary discipline in the third phase, the Council has asked all of the Member States to aim in the medium term for a budgetary position that is close to equilibrium or in credit."
"That should allow the automatic stabilizers to operate throughout the whole of the economic cycle."
"The Council, finally, has proposed strengthening the procedure concerning excessive government deficits under Article 104c. It takes the view that it will be necessary to set rigid time-limits, based on the assumption that the Council will impose pre-set and proportionate penalties in cases where excessive deficit persist."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is delighted that the House has decided to focus on economic and monetary union this week."
"At this time, in the run-up to the Florence European Council, the Commission feels it is important to restate our clear commitment to the approach we have adopted up to now in pursuing a stable and healthy macroeconomic policy which enables us to take determined and coordinated measures to combat unemployment, while at the same time keeping the preparations for the third phase of EMU on schedule."
"First of all, improvements to the macro-economic situation."
"There is no alternative to the Commission's recommended policy of reducing public deficits in order to create jobs."
"This year, the Commission has two new recommendations: first, that the policy mix should be made more flexible over the long term."
"The Commission has established the broad economic policy guidelines on the basis of Article 105(1) of the Treaty, and the macro-economic policy it recommends should help towards achieving the objectives of the European Union as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty, namely growth, employment and stability."
"We cannot hope for a substantial reduction in unemployment without strong, sustained medium-term growth supported by growth in investment."
"So as far as the Commission is concerned, we must make credible budgetary improvements, but as well as the quantitative reductions in public deficits, we also need to redirect public spending towards productive areas such as investment in infrastructure, human resources and an active employment policy."
"The social effects of budgetary consolidation also need to be carefully balanced, and wage increases should be kept at suitable levels."
"Instead of increasing overall fiscal pressure, the Commission recommends that increases in spending should be curbed and tax structures modified to reduce the tax burden on labour."
"This will enable the policy mix to be relaxed still further, making it possible to create monetary conditions that are likely to keep interest rates down."
"Secondly, the structural measures taken to promote employment should be better coordinated."
"The pact on employment gives the Commission the tools it needs to implement the 1993 White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment and the conclusions of the Essen European Council in this field."
"The pact is a collective initiative which spells out the various commitments undertaken by the public authorities and the social partners as part of an overall coordinated strategy."
"As you can see, the Commission is following its own recommendations in trying to make unemployment a matter of common interest."
"But the broad economic policy guidelines are also a vital instrument in our progress towards economic and monetary union, and must be applied to the letter."
"Article 103 of the Treaty states that Member States must coordinate their economic policies as a matter of common concern, and this is why the Commission recommends that updated national convergence programmes should be developed this year."
"The programmes must make it clear how the convergence measures adopted pursue the general aim of strengthening growth and improving employment."
"If economic policy is to be better coordinated at Community level, the national programmes must represent a much firmer statement of political commitment, and the Commission asks that they should be approved as such by the Council."
"The broad economic policy guidelines may be an effective and coherent method of achieving economic and monetary union, but transition to the third phase also depends on the achievement of monetary stability throughout the Union."
"The reports by Mr Pérez Royo and Mr von Wogau are an important contribution to the work the Commission is doing on monetary stability and the need to avoid splitting Europe in two when the euro is adopted."
"The Commission notes with satisfaction that your rapporteur confirms the analysis of the impact of currency fluctuations which it presented to the European Council in Madrid."
"Currency fluctuations are damaging to the single market, but at the same time we must not allow the market to be jeopardized by the introduction of protectionist measures."
"The Commission is determined to remain vigilant, and as you have requested, we will keep a close eye on the impact of currency fluctuations by regularly monitoring the economic indicators."
"As your rapporteur himself recommends, the solution is to be found in closer convergence, particularly in the area of public deficits, and the introduction of the euro."
"On the subject of relations between the 'ins' and the 'pre-ins' , in accordance with the instructions of the Madrid European Council, the Commission and the European Monetary Institute are working hard to set up a new monetary system between the countries participating in the euro and those not participating at the outset."
"The report by Mr von Wogau will make a useful contribution to the work which the ECOFIN Council has been doing on this subject since Verona, work which I would point out has involved a broad degree of consensus."
"The Commission feels that this new system should both guarantee monetary stability in the Union in the transitional phase, while at the same time keeping the door to the euro open for those countries which are 'preins' ."
"But we cannot have lasting monetary stability without convergence, and this is why there will be stronger convergence procedures running alongside the exchange-rate mechanism."
"However, if it is to be entirely credible, the new system must also be flexible enough to accommodate the various levels of convergence between the different countries."
"Although anchored to the euro, it will still have to have fairly broad fluctuation margins, with compulsory intervention within these margins, as well as credit facilities."
"As many Member States as possible will need to participate if the new system is to operate smoothly, and it will be in their interests to do so, since it will be to the advantage of all the Member States to join the economic and monetary union as soon as possible."
"The new system will also open the door to the euro, and the conditions of entry will be the same for the countries which are 'pre-ins' as they are now for the countries which are 'ins' ."
"The 'pre-ins' should join as quickly as possible, an idea which your rapporteur obviously supports when he asks the Commission to design new instruments to strengthen convergence and accelerate the process of integration."
"It is for this purpose that the Commission is currently examining ways of improving the present convergence programmes, which have proved that they are effective and will remain at the hub of the system."
"In conclusion, I should like once again to underline the Commission's commitment to a coherent approach."
"Only by pursuing a healthy and stable macro-economic policy can we restore confidence and stimulate growth."
"The broad guidelines were adopted unanimously by all the Member States at the last ECOFIN Council."
"It is vital to maintain the overall dynamics of this policy by developing the necessary structural policies for promoting employment in Europe."
"All the preparatory work must be completed at least one year before the decision is taken to enter the third phase, so the European Council needs to decide how the new monetary system and the stability pact are to work and what legal status the euro is to have."
"Economic and monetary union is a comprehensive project which will be concluded under the conditions and timetable set out in the Treaty."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their presentations this morning."
"I shall concentrate on the broad economic guidelines."
"The Socialist Group firmly rejects the guidelines adopted by the ECOFIN Council recently and we are deeply unhappy with the approach taken by the Commission regarding the economic prospects for the European Union."
"The first point is to look at the economic fundamentals which the Commission claims are favourable."
"We have historically high levels of unemployment."
"Some 50 million people in the European Union are suffering social exclusion and poverty."
"Internal demand in the EU is depressed because of the attack on social protection and jobs."
"Real wages are stagnant."
"Business confidence fell again last month for the seventeenth month in a row and there is a collapse of consumer confidence."
"Public investment has fallen over the last ten years from 3.5 % of GDP to 2.5 %."
"If the Commission and the Council claim these are favourable economic fundamentals I would like to see the statistics they are basing this on."
"Clearly Europe is in crisis and we need coordinated measures by the Commission and ECOFIN to try to bring Europe out of that crisis."
"The growth rate this year is 1.5 %, which I imagine will be estimated as even lower by the end of the year."
"There may be a growth rate of 2 or 2.5 % next year."
"It is completely insufficient."
"That is why we have produced a very critical report on these guidelines."
"In particular, I want to refer to the guidelines as approved by the Council."
"Mr De Silguy did not refer to the way in which the guidelines were changed by the Council and I should like the Council and Mr De Silguy to deal specifically with the changes that have been made to those guidelines by the ECOFIN Council."
"I hope the Council is listening carefully to this."
"There are ten cases where the Council has deleted points from the Commission's guidelines, which Parliament was already unhappy with."
"Why did the Council delete the reference to a better economic policy mix more favourable to growth?"
"The ECOFIN Council deleted this."
"I want to know why."
"The reference to the European Parliament's opinion on the economic annual report was deleted by ECOFIN."
"Why did it delete that?"
"A durable detente in macro-economic policy is essential to relaunch activity and strengthen growth in job creation in the medium term."
"Again, in the Commission text, the Council deleted that reference."
"Why did it do that?"
"Monetary policy can, within the spirit of Article 105 of the Treaty, contribute in a substantial manner to the achievement of Community objectives as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty."
"That reference was deleted."
"Why?"
"The Council has to explain to the House why it made these changes."
"The Commission text referred to the social partners and to the dialogue that exists."
"The Council deleted the reference to an efficient coordination between the different actors concerned and between countries as essential to ensure the coherence of these policies."
"That reference was deleted and we want to know why."
"It deleted the reference to the fact that measures aimed at improving convergence go hand in hand with the promotion of growth and employment in the medium term."
"Why did the Council delete that from the broad economic guidelines?"
"In relation to TENs - the trans-European networks - the statement proposed in the Commission text, that action has to be taken to remove the last obstacles to the achievements of the TENs projects is deleted in the Council text."
"The ECOFIN Council is acting with extreme arrogance if it believes it can simply disregard growth and employment in the European Union."
"We were deeply unhappy in this House with the Commission text but at least it made some effort to refer to the need to bring unemployment down and to deal with the appalling levels of growth."
"The Council text is completely unacceptable to this House."
"If the Council would look at paragraph 10 of the resolution that we will vote at lunchtime today it will see that we insist that in Florence these deletions from the Commission text be reinserted, and that is the text which should then be endorsed by the Council."
"Unless that happens I warn the Council that whether it be the Italian presidency winding up to their presidency in July or Mr Spring or Mr Bruton presenting the programme of the Irish presidency, this Parliament will roundly reject the conclusions of Florence, unless the Council gives a real commitment to bringing unemployment down, getting growth back to Europe and ensuring that the EMU project can continue on a path that will mean something to the citizens rather than simply being something which is pursued by central bankers."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, allow me first of all to thank Mr Lamfalussy and Mr de Silguy for their reports."
"As far as the report of the European Monetary Institute is concerned, I must say that, as with the previous one, a very good and serious attempt has been made to cover the issues of preparation for the third stage, and we are pleased to see that substantial progress is recorded."
"In connection with Chapter 1, however, on the growth of the economy, I have a number of observations that I think deserve discussion at greater length at some juncture."
"For instance, the report does not stick as firmly as I think it should to the duration of financial performances, and the importance of that is something that I think needs to be stressed all the time."
"The cause of smooth transition to economic and monetary union is certainly not helped if a country, after achieving satisfactory convergence figures, suddenly goes off the rails."
"The Institute's report is, of course, pervaded by a certain optimism."
"Thinking back to my previous remarks, I have to say that it is logical for there to be some element of optimism in these analyses."
"Statements given out by the institutions of the European Union cannot be pessimistic in tone or doom-ridden in their assessments."
"Naturally, there is a very big difference between that and projecting baseless assessments and analyses."
"However, one can see that the financial prospects, as analyzed, are not far short of reality."
"Despite the element of optimism the substance is pretty accurate."
"That applies for both the European Monetary Institute and the Commission."
"As regards the Commission's analysis and the changes in the financial prospects, I, too, have to say that I find them totally incomprehensible. Unless, that is, ECOFIN decided to adopt a purely technical approach and to refrain from policy projections and appraisals."
"If that was the case - and if it was I would regard it as mistaken - the deletions can be justified, but it means that ECOFIN is now functioning as a technical body rather than the policy institution which it should be."
"The EMI report refers to the internal market as the instrument for growth, by contrast with 1994 when the talk was of export-led growth."
"Of course, the internal market is supposed to promote competitiveness, but the big difficulty with regard to competitiveness in the European Union is that we have developed a quality of life and forms of social conduct that give us problems vis-à-vis those of our competitors who are not bound by the same criteria."
"This difficulty, however, must be tackled in a logical and constructive manner and not by opting for things such as a slackening of monetary policy, which is the sort of thing that we often hear advocated."
"At this present time there is no alternative to the strict monetary policy."
"There is no other policy available to us, and to tackle phenomena of a structural nature with measures that are appropriate for cyclical adjustment is mistaken because it would be damaging rather than beneficial."
"On the matter of unemployment, to attribute it to something entirely independent, to something which is not the consequence of other phenomena, is a massive error."
"Unemployment did not appear from nowhere."
"It is the consequence of other phenomena, of structural phenomena to be precise."
"We have to try to rectify these structural weaknesses, but it cannot be done via the countercyclical measures that are always being recommended here."
"I say again: in these circumstances, countercyclical measures would in the long term bring a result exactly the opposite of that which is desired."
"On the question of convergence and relations between the Member States taking part in the third stage and the remaining countries, I must say that here, happily, the Treaty is beginning to be implemented correctly and that the analysis of the parameters is beginning to show an element of flexibility."
"And why is this so?"
"The reason is that is very important that we keep to the 1999 starting date and that progress is not impeded by certain very small percentages."
"In this regard, Mr President, it is important that the analyses should take account of the criteria of those countries which wish to join the EMU but will not be in the first group and that notice is taken also of factors stemming from occurrences of an urgent nature."
"I am thinking of my own country which, precisely because the European Union would not give political support if it were to be faced with a threat of war, is now having to embark on an armaments programme to the tune of ECU 10 billion, which will totally negate all of the efforts of recent years to achieve convergence with a view to joining the EMS and the EMU."
"At some juncture more attention will have to be paid to this matter than at present."
"Mr President, let me begin by congratulating the three rapporteurs, in particular Mr Gasòliba, on the drafting of the reports we have been listening to."
"As did the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, my group is examining closely the EMI annual report for 1995, as this is a major document that deals comprehensively with the state of preparations for Economic and Monetary Union."
"During the coming six months, however, it will be necessary to define the parameters of the framework as a whole, as we look to the third phase and the responsibilities attaching to the European system of central banks."
"As Mr Lamfalussy has already said, the process of economic integration is on the right path, but the recovery we had all hoped for has not got off the ground and unemployment remains Europe's number one problem."
"The EMI report clearly indicates that the solution necessitates, among other things, consistent reduction in government deficits; in that connection, the Institute should take action particularly in regard to those Member States in which those problems are all too marked and have so far prevented them becoming full members of the European Monetary System."
"We need therefore to look more closely and more receptively at those Member States which, although not at the moment fully complying with the Maastricht parameters, are, nonetheless, showing signs of a change in trend, indicating that their - currently negative - parameters could, in just a little while longer, meet the conditions for the single currency system."
"As Commissioner de Silguy has pointed out, the EMI framework defined in Maastricht should be directed towards a more active role in coordinating the Member States' monetary policies."
"There has also to be preventive assessment of what might happen as a result of the coexistence of those States that belong to the single currency and those that do not, with the distortion of competition and fluctuation in exchange rates that would ensue."
"There is finally a practical aspect on which we are focusing particular attention: this concerns the introduction on to the market of the new currency, the euro, and its distribution in the Member States."
"Explaining to the citizens of Europe how the single currency operates will certainly not be an easy process: there will have to be the maximum of cooperation on the part of those market structures in which citizens actually come face to face with the euro."
"I have in mind here the retail industry, in all its guises, in which there will have to be a campaign of information directed towards businessmen, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, and towards those working at the point of sale."
"That will in fact be the point at which consumers discover the euro and with it perhaps a greater understanding of the Community's economic system."
"Public acceptance and understanding of the single currency will also imply acceptance and understanding of a united Europe."
"Mr President, I am speaking on the broad economic guidelines."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party believes that there is a credibility gap at the heart of Union economic policy, which is undermining public confidence in the entire enterprise."
"There is a gap between aspirations and their realization, rhetoric and substance, and economic guidelines and their implementation."
"The gap is measured most starkly by the 18 million people out of work and up to 50 million suffering from social exclusion and poverty."
"It is a dismal record."
"Ecofin's report to Florence on what I would characterize as the non-implementation of the 1995 guidelines, following hard on the heels of the non-implementation of the 1994 guidelines, is a ritualistic, bland and passive document in the face of this pathetic factual record."
"Little wonder that in their day-to-day lives so many citizens are questioning Europe's ability to deliver the goods, because they know that action speaks louder than words."
"The ELDR Group is strongly committed to achieving EMU in line with the Treaty criteria and timetable, but there remains space for real policy debate."
"I have several questions to the Council in the time permitted to me."
"From the institutional point of view, I repeat the question: why has the Council, even in the preamble to its recommendations, made no reference to Parliament's opinions?"
"Policy-wise, I wish to ask the Council to respond today on the question of inflation policy, where we know that inflation is historically low and contained, according to our own analyses."
"Why is it that it recommends these results should be improved on?"
"Does the Council not share the fear expressed recently by the Bank for International Settlements that there is a risk of deflation if we push the price stability objective beyond what is appropriate?"
"What is the Council's view?"
"Finally, on the macro policy mix conducive to growth, employment and convergence, the Commission correctly referred to Article 105(1) and let me quote it briefly: ' Monetary policy shall support the general economic policies of the European Union, including those concerning a high level of employment' ."
"The Council today needs to explain why politically it has scandalously disregarded this capacity for an appropriate flanking measure, because symbolically it is saying to the 18 million unemployed: we frankly do not care about the appropriate mix, we are monetarists and we will do it our way."
"If that is your way, it is a political mistake for the Council and for Europe."
"(Applause from the centre and the left)"
"Mr President, the single currency scenario is paving the way for a multi-speed Europe."
"Our group is extremely worried about the repercussions for the weakest countries, most of all, and for the millions of workers and unemployed people in the European Union."
"The whittling away of the whole concept of national sovereignty, with the management of monetary and exchange rate policy being handed over to bodies such as the European System of Central Banks, which have no political and democratic legitimacy, is a particular cause for concern."
"The countries which do not join the EMU will fall even further behind those which do; divergence, in real as well as nominal terms, will increase."
"That will be followed by an even harsher anti-popular policy for the purpose of trying to meet the Maastricht criteria, which will remain an unattainable dream."
"The countries which remain outside will face serious problems over resources as capital, albeit for speculation at first, moves to the euro core, and this will have a domino effect on currency reserves, on growth rates and on the living standards of workers in those countries."
"The abolition of the ECU will generate new problems in connection with the Community budget and fiscal relations between the European Union and the countries which do not join the single currency."
"Risk premiums and the obligatory circulation during the transitional period of the new currency in parallel with the national currencies will create additional difficulties for those countries, difficulties which they will have to tackle in various ways to the detriment of their economies."
"The decision to pursue further enlargement of the European Union adds another complication to the single currency process, and the costs of enlargement will be transferred down to the countries which remain outside the system."
"Mr President, we hope that the peoples of the European Union will fight against these options, that they will rise up and demand referenda in the Member States when the new treaties come up for approval and that they will refuse to go quietly down the one-way path of bankers' democracy."
"Mr President, the common denominator in this morning's reports is that they all want to keep strictly to the schedule and criteria set for EMU, regardless of the consequences."
"It is clear however that by the end of the millennium we will not have a situation where all EU countries will be participating in a common currency."
"In addition to this it is of course questionable whether EMU will be implemented in the first place."
"In any case EMU will cause divisions in the Union, and taking into consideration an expansion from the Eastern bloc there will be at least a 'three-speed' union."
"As we know EMU is a continuation of the internal market."
"It is interesting and indicative that even Mr Mario Monti, member of the Commission, has now tabled a question concerning the fact that the internal market has not fulfilled the expectations on a macroeconomic level."
"As far as employment especially is concerned the internal market has hardly had any positive effect."
"The Commissioner has also chosen to present this report during the summit in Florence."
"There has to be big question mark as to whether we are in for a similar disappointment as far as EMU is concerned, since the internal market and EMU are products of the same mind set."
"The Green Group unanimously supports a healthy economic policy, where there is an equilibrium in the public sector and where budget resources do not have to be largely spent on interest payments on public loans."
"At the moment however the European or Nordic society is threatened, because we are aiming to implement these EMU criteria far too quickly, perhaps even arrogantly."
"For this reason the schedule simply has to be postponed."
"Another reason for a postponement of the EMU schedule is that it makes a genuine rapprochement between the economies in the EU countries possible."
"The economies of the European Union Member States have, according to some research, recently moved even further apart from each other."
"Perhaps we should agree on a factual precondition for EMU, that employment really should be halved before EMU is implemented."
"This objective has been voiced by many Member States with high unemployment and also by the European Union."
"A somewhat more flexible economic and monetary policy would have to be considered."
"According to some estimates a one percent increase in inflation could help to create two million jobs."
"Above all the Green Group proposes a thorough reform of taxation."
"The Commission has recently published an interesting document on taxation within the European Union."
"The document expresses the view that, essentially, taxation at the EU level should be considered as a complete entity, rather than on a tax by tax basis, since the Member States have already lost a major proportion of their taxation sovereignty to the markets, much to the politicians' discredit."
"No solutions regarding taxation have been achieved at the EU level, and I would like to ask the Council whether it is aware of the enormous contradiction that is involved in aiming for a rapid implementation of the EMU and the complete inability to deal with taxation, a matter with far-reaching effects on the economy and on employment."
"Mr President, I rise on behalf of my group to support the compromise resolution and to say I would like to identify my group with the questions that were asked by Mr Cox and the criticisms that were expressed by Mr Donnelly on the question of the broad economic guidelines."
"The compromise resolution speaks out against this terrible gloom and doom of the 18 million unemployed and the 50 million on the bread-line."
"There is such a colossal loss of dignity involved here that it is surely not to be tolerated."
"Nor should we tolerate the many fears of our citizens: fear of those in jobs - whether they will still have a job; the fear of the lack of social protection - we have seen that in the unrest in Germany and France; the lack of consumer confidence; our growth is low and getting lower and public investment is dropping."
"All this demands action and yet the Council and the Commission do not seem to be listening to the European Parliament which is the democratic base of all the institutions."
"They must listen to us and we must see investment boosted, consumption boosted, lower interest rates, a rise in labour-intensive growth and an increase in consumer confidence."
"Today, when we see greater profitability, we do not necessarily see a reduction in unemployment or an increase in wages."
"I have just read in The Guardian today that British Steel made £1 billion profit."
"We have seen incredible profits made by British Telecom recently."
"This has not led to higher wages or a significant increase in employment."
"We also all have to guard against the wishful thinking of some of the economic forecasting we have seen from the other bodies of the Community."
"Economic forecasting has so often had to be revised downwards."
"This creates yet more mistrust out there in the minds of our citizens; it worsens confidence and has negative effects on consumers."
"Turning to EMU, few Member States seem to be able at this moment of forecasting to meet the criteria."
"I have noted them: Luxembourg, Ireland, Denmark and the UK."
"Denmark and the UK have an opt-out, so in effect that is two."
"I was privileged to be in the EMAC delegation to Dublin recently where we had an excellent address from the Irish Finance Minister."
"He was pointing out that despite Ireland's strong growth they have not reduced unemployment."
"So, you can meet the convergence criteria and still have the basic problem of unemployment."
"Ireland has that in a very serious way."
"It must be looked at as an entity, almost separately from all these other matters."
"It is quite clear that France and Germany will have difficulties in meeting the criteria, Italy more so but making confident noises and Belgium has problems with one particular aspect but surely the Benelux countries will not go in and leave Belgium out."
"The date is being constantly reiterated as if it is all going to happen and yet there is an air of sleepwalking, it seems to me, and of wishful thinking."
"Because, when you examine the criteria, very few countries seem to be likely to meet them and the flexibility which does exist does not seem big enough - to me anyway - for 1 January 1999 to be the date."
"I would like to support the compromise paragraph 6 and the emphasis on life-long learning, education, and the creation of new jobs in new sectors."
"I am at the end of my speaking time but this recent debate in the UK about being able to leave the EU is so disgraceful and so detrimental to consumer confidence that I feel I have to mention that as well."
"Mr President, the report by Mr von Wogau is extremely useful."
"The European Union's internal market benefits from having a monetary system which is designed to prevent fluctuations in the exchange rates between European currencies, and we agree with the rapporteur that a 'new style' of European Monetary System will be of great assistance here."
"The motion for a resolution rightly states, however, that monetary stability cannot be created by EMU or an exchange-rate mechanism, but depends on the Member States pursuing a credible economic and budgetary policy."
"Like the rapporteur, I too expect relatively few of the Member States to take part in the third phase of EMU in 1999."
"Many Member States, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, do not currently meet the entrance criteria, and there seems little likelihood that the position will change in the short term."
"Some politicians have panicked and called for the criteria to be relaxed, but all this does is to undermine the credibility of the euro and place a time-bomb under any new exchange-rate mechanism."
"I really do wonder whether there is any point in forming a monetary union with only three or at most four Member States, since the advantages would scarcely outweigh the costs of setting up EMU."
"An important practical reason why we should not establish a monetary union prematurely is that it would create a barrier to the early accession of countries from Central and Eastern Europe."
"It would be much better to align the economic and monetary policies of the present and future Member States in a totally unforced way, with the Member States themselves working to achieve monetary and exchange-rate stability."
"This would improve the operation of the single market and avoid creating any unnecessary obstacles to the accession of Central and Eastern European countries."
"Mr President, the Commission's report confirms the view of those who believe that both the Union as a whole and individual Member States will be adversely affected if the monetary union enters into force step by step on the scheduled dates."
"Degeneration into a two-speed Europe is inevitable, and even if this state of affairs were to be only temporary, it is at odds with the goal of economic and social cohesion."
"The prerequisite for unrestricted participation by all Member States in the euro will be that the budgets of those countries already meeting the criteria, weakened as they will be by savings measures, will have to provide substantial support for the 'outsiders' ."
"The distortions of competition, caused by unilateral devaluations, which are at present a burden on the external trade balances of certain Member States, cannot be overcome by the countries with soft currencies remaining outside."
"It is therefore particularly important to devise as soon as possible intervention mechanisms to neutralize speculative pressure."
"This report, at any rate, contains only vague and general indications, and does not state when the general guidelines for the future exchange relations between participating countries and those not yet participating will be drawn up."
"Yet again, the fears of citizens in many Member States are being borne out: that in view of the poor economic situation, only a few countries will be able to meet the stability criteria; and, at the same time, that the vital question of the stabilization of exchange rates between the 'ins' and the 'outs' is unfortunately only now beginning to be addressed."
"Furthermore, in this divided Europe, some parts of the export and tourism sectors in countries with hard currencies will continue to suffer significantly from the adverse effects of savings measures introduced in order to achieve convergence."
"Mr President, the reality that our economic guidelines have to deal with is that there are at least 18 million people officially out of work, with another nine million not covered by statistics."
"They should be getting to grips with this problem, but they are patently failing to do so."
"Once again, we are faced with one-sided monetarist recommendations offering absolutely no support for the active structural employment policy for which the Delors White Paper and the Essen summit laid the foundations."
"Monetary stability creates confidence, but monetary stability cannot be achieved by creating social unrest."
"This is a crucial time at which to be holding this debate, and it calls for more balanced guidelines than those before us at the moment."
"First of all, instruments and indicators are going have to be adopted at the end of the year in Dublin to give the Essen agreements a more practical form and make them more binding."
"Second, the Heads of Government will shortly be meeting in Florence to plot a course for a common, active European employment policy."
"EMU has already shown that coordination at European level which is binding on the Member States can prove beneficial, and in Florence this must be shown to be equally true for employment."
"Third, the European Commission is currently making a desperate attempt to persuade the social partners to conclude agreements on a European employment policy in the form of a pact on employment."
"But this will only work if we abandon our unilateral faith in EMU in the broad economic guidelines and establish a basis for agreement with the social partners, such as on creating apprenticeships for the millions of unemployed people under the age of 25."
"Finally, the negotiations at the IGC are currently considering how to establish a balance in the Treaty between monetary and structural employment policy."
"A move from taxes on labour to energy and environment taxes can only be made at European level, and competition between the Member States means that a common policy is needed for which the broad economic guidelines should establish a basis."
"But there is no sign of this happening."
"The balanced economic policy which Parliament has called for on so many occasions involves recognizing the economic importance of the European social model."
"The model is not just about expenditure: it is, first and foremost, a powerful means of promoting employment by maintaining purchasing power and demand, and thus creating stability."
"The same applies to decent wages, which can also in turn encourage continuing training and education."
"In short, restricting economic policy to a single market and a single currency is simply asking for the European Union to remain economically weak and to continue to suffer mass unemployment."
"For this reason, these economic guidelines should be at the very least amended or better still, in my opinion, rejected by the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following what Mr Donnelly said, there is one point I should like to make first of all about the broad economic guidelines, which is that we firmly support the line the Commission has adopted, especially as it is largely based on the consensus positions reached by Parliament itself."
"Although we are aware of the financial constraints which restrict what the governments can do, our group nevertheless regrets the changes which the Council has made to the Commission's proposals."
"That is why, unlike the Socialist Group, we do not want to tar the Commission and the Council with the same brush."
"Moving on to the von Wogau report, I would point out that changes to exchange rates between the currencies of countries belonging to the same common market have always been a matter of common interest."
"What this means is that the Member States can no longer do as they please."
"It is something which applies today and will continue to apply tomorrow, something which was spelt out in the Treaty of Rome and was not amended in the Maastricht Treaty, nor is it likely to be at the IGC."
"This makes sense, because changes to the exchange rates which are not simply designed to redress imbalances in purchasing power would distort competition and seriously damage the operation of the single market."
"That is why, despite the fact that after difficult negotiations and completely contrary to the spirit of the Treaties, two Member States have finally been allowed to opt out of monetary union, this does not mean that they no longer have to act in tandem with all the others when it comes to realigning exchange rates."
"It is also totally unacceptable for some people to say that they will refuse to be bound by any future discipline adopted jointly, by democratic methods and in accordance with the Treaties, in relation to exchange policy with the euro."
"If the new European monetary system is sufficiently flexible, as the rapporteur has claimed, then the United Kingdom should not have any serious objections to taking part."
"It is therefore a mistake to give it the option, even now, of going its own way, which it tends to do all too often these days."
"That is why, on this particular point, we do not agree with some of our colleagues and have tabled an amendment reaffirming the basic principles on which Europe was founded."
"One final comment on the 'ins' and the 'outs' , or the 'pre-ins' and the 'ins' , to use the current jargon."
"There is clearly a degree of solidarity involved here, as we have said on many occasions, but it should not, as certain amendments seem to imply, go so far as to restrict the independence of the Central Bank and impose in advance certain constraints or requirements regarding its interest-rate policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports before us cover three areas of major importance: economic and monetary union, the impact of currency fluctuations on the internal market, and the annual report of the European Monetary Institute."
"The motion for a resolution is an important contribution to the construction of Europe's monetary system, and the mechanism proposed by Parliament is very similar to the outcome of the discussions in the Council itself, which was presented at the informal ECOFIN Council in Verona and is shortly to be presented at the European Council in Florence."
"The exchange-rate mechanism is essential if we are to prevent currency fluctuations in non-participating countries and to protect the single market."
"The resolution rightly points out that while it relies mainly on the Member States achieving convergence and sound financial management, it also needs to include ways of supporting any currencies under attack."
"Our group has some reservations, however, concerning paragraph 4."
"We feel that while stable real exchange rates are certainly necessary to prevent unfair competitive advantage, stable nominal rates are also a powerful deflationary force, help towards convergence and underlie the very principle behind the European Monetary System."
"In order to prevent exchange-rate fluctuations in future, we agree with the resolution that we need greater convergence and closer monitoring of the macro-economic situation within the Union."
"The report also opposes any corrective measures which run counter to the rules of the single market, and it proposes specific measures to help small and medium-sized firms."
"On the subject of combating currency fluctuations, I would point out that the French Finance Minister recently put forward three proposals to his Union counterparts designed to prevent exchange-rate turbulence."
"The measures involve keeping payments made under the Structural Funds in line with changes in the real exchange rates, introducing macro-economic conditionality for Structural Fund payments similar to that which applies for the Cohesion Funds, and making procedures stiffer under the broad economic policy guidelines."
"The resolution proposes the right way to prevent currency fluctuations: stronger macro-economic and budgetary discipline in the Member States, which will boost economic convergence and prevent the imbalances which are the source of financial instability."
"Once we have entered the third phase of EMU, the same question will arise in relation to the currencies of those countries which are still outside the system."
"The Council has already made progress in this direction by adopting, with the exception of the United Kingdom and Sweden, a proposed exchange-rate mechanism based on the EMS."
"The technical details are to be finalized at the Dublin Council, which is a concern raised in the motion for a resolution."
"Our group has serious doubts, however, as regards the proposal to introduce a tax on currency speculation."
"How can you tell the difference between a speculative transaction and a cover operation?"
"How effective would it be in a world where capital moves around freely and European currencies can be traded in financial centres in America, Asia and elsewhere?"
"In other words, why should we give the rest of the world an advantage over Europe at a time when unemployment is still our biggest problem?"
"It is subject to these reservations that our group supports all three of these reports."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are enormous challenges involved in introducing a single currency, and our experience up to now has taught us a number of important lessons about the exchange-rate arrangements between the countries at the centre of EMU."
"I would emphasize once again, perhaps unnecessarily, that any arrangement that limits reciprocal exchange rates is always better than no arrangement at all, and we should therefore follow the recommendations put forward by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr von Wogau."
"However, leaving aside the tremendous importance of EMU, which my group hopes will create jobs, we must not forget the terrible problem of unemployment."
"As many speakers have already mentioned, we have 18 million people out of work and many different forms of hidden unemployment."
"It is a subject we have been talking about ever since I have been in the House."
"An excellent report was produced on employment, growth and competitiveness which we have been discussing for two years now, but it has not yet been implemented."
"The Council is mainly to blame for failing to make adequate progress on its recommendations concerning education and training, greater flexibility on the labour market, new working hours, shorter working hours and above all shifting taxes on labour onto other targets."
"I also gather that in the pact on employment which President Santer is taking to the Florence summit, the 17 areas where employment could have been created, mainly in the regions and the cities, have been dropped. I should like to know why the Council has decided against implementing all these specific examples on which Parliament and the Commission have worked so hard."
"Mr President, despite all the considerable doubts and criticism the leaders of the Union continue obstinately to insist on a dogmatic theory and its implementation - a theory which has no basis in reality."
"What are the consequences which we can all see? They include the inability to pursue a constructive economic policy, the destruction of important social infrastructure, powerlessness and cynicism in the face of mass unemployment and social crisis, total capitulation to the destabilising effects of speculative finance capital and now finally also the risk of splitting the Union."
"What conclusion should be drawn?"
"The conclusion is that it is time to give up an obsolete, dogmatic idea and choose a modern, flexible form of monetary cooperation and economic policy which is grounded in reality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how we have seen our language and ideas change since the Maastricht Treaty!"
"In 1992, we were promised that all the Member States of the Union would adopt the single currency by 1 January 1999 at the latest, apart from a few minor derogations."
"We maintained at the time that this was completely unrealistic, and we asked instead that the European Monetary System should be reformed so that it would work properly."
"Today, those responsible for the single currency project have been forced to invent a new monetary system, more or less at the last minute, in order to prevent the Union from being split into two or more groups."
"Even worse, having proclaimed that the EMS was dead and buried, they are now having to resurrect it, and having said that the single market could not function without the single currency, they are now having to admit the opposite."
"However, while the current developments are certainly heading in the right direction, we are still not entirely happy with them, for two reasons."
"First, the new EMS cannot be more than a temporary arrangement, since the official objective, in theory at least, is still a single currency for everyone and convergence in the foreseeable future."
"This policy seems as unreasonable as expecting all the Member States to go for the single currency at the same time."
"It suggests that it will be possible to apply a single economic policy across the board in the near future, which presupposes that our problems and therefore our societies will be as one."
"In our view, this is ridiculous!"
"If disparate societies have this bureaucratic convergence forced upon them, it could have a very negative or even destabilizing effect on the system."
"Another reason why we have our doubts is that the new system they are trying to invent has never been thought through and has never been democratically approved by the national parliaments, despite the occasional indications that you find here and there in the Treaty."
"It is difficult to impose discipline where it has not been accepted, and we cannot take a major step of this kind in the dark, so we shall sooner or later have to reopen formal discussions on the subject."
"Mr President, Mr Lamfalussy, Commissioner, the reports by Professor Pérez Royo - who totally disagrees, incidentally, with Milton Friedman, the monetarist, who thinks the single currency is suicide - Mr Gasòliba and Mr von Wogau bring us back to the 'theological' and 'teleological' problem of the single currency."
"Let us consider the theological problem first of all."
"Is the Lord good?"
"Is the single currency good?"
"France's strawberry producers tend to think the single currency is good because of the devaluation of the Spanish peseta."
"But as it happens the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira, which are of interest to France's cattle breeders, will probably not even join the single currency, so the apparent advantages are somewhat deceptive."
"And even if the Fifteen all join, the dollar will not, nor will the undervalued currencies of South-East Asia, Morocco and so on. The single currency might suit the European single market, but the single market is becoming less and less European and more and more global, mainly because of the European Commission's free trade policies."
"Another much more serious problem is that a currency is nothing more than a vehicle for information on the economy."
"It is the reflection or shadow of the economy, not the economy itself."
"It is like the story of Plato and the cave; it is the signifier, not the signified."
"But trying to force 15 different economies to have the same official monetary shadow is really just forcing them to chase their own shadows."
"Experience shows that if you chase your own shadow, you will eventually fall down exhausted and die."
"And that equates, in economic terms, with unemployment, austerity, recession and protests, even in Germany."
"This brings us on to the teleological problem, or what it is all for."
"The single currency may be fine, but what is it for, what purpose does it serve?"
"Is it Europe's objective to have a single currency, a single central bank and a single market, or is it prosperity, democracy and development?"
"Forgive me for saying so, Mr Lamfalussy, but when Articles 107-109 say that the president of the European Central Bank shall not take instructions from anyone, it smacks more of oligarchy than democracy."
"So even if there are some kind of parliamentary controls, they will not go very far."
"And if the aim is prosperity, Mr Pérez Royo, the situation of farmers in Andalusia, Finland and France reflects what Jaurès said about money being the blood of the poor."
"Just look how we have forgotten what history has taught us!"
"We have already had a single currency in Europe and throughout the world: the gold standard."
"But it did not stop deflation."
"The great depression in America happened at a time when it had a fixed exchange rate with the gold standard."
"I know that I will not convince you, Mr de Silguy, since this is a religious question."
"At least we shall know what to think about the disasters it will bring in its wake."
"Market forces produce contaminated meal."
"Mr President, if we wish to have monetary union, we must combat unemployment in the European Union, as is repeatedly stressed by both the European Monetary Institute and the Commission in its annual economic report."
"To my mind, however, it is not enough to carry on as before."
"We need to provide greater impetus on the structural policy side, and that is why the economic policy guidelines must indeed be reoriented, as Parliament is calling for today."
"This is now more important than ever, because we need a more optimistic and confident approach in order to complete the project of monetary union. If, happily - as is also noted by the EMI - the work is on schedule, this project must not be jeopardized by a lack of credibility as regards the other policy elements."
"I do hope that the European Monetary Institute will continue to adhere to the timetable, and that Mr Lamfalussy can give us a guarantee that the EMI will carry out its evaluation of convergence this autumn in such a way as to establish whether or not a majority of the Member States meet the convergence criteria, so that there is clarity about the appraisal and the scope for interpretation, and also about the need for participation in a European exchange-rate mechanism."
"The House stated very early on that currencies not participating in European monetary union should be linked to it by means of an exchange-rate mechanism with the euro as its anchor-point."
"Fortunately the monetary institutions, as well as the Commission and the Council, have since come round to Parliament's position."
"What kind of mechanism should this be?"
"In my opinion, we need a European system of solidarity and stability, because on the one hand the currencies not belonging to the monetary union must be protected from speculative attacks, and on the other a split in the internal market must be prevented."
"Above all, we should assure the other currencies of our support and solidarity, so that they can join the monetary union as soon as possible."
"In fact, as the past few years have shown, exchange-rate turbulence has a detrimental effect not only on economic growth, but also on employment."
"It is therefore important to introduce an exchange-rate mechanism on these lines, in order to maintain the credibility of the initiative."
"In my view, it is very important that the European Monetary Institute should conduct further studies of these exchange-rate fluctuations, in particular to examine their micro-economic effects, since these can give us a much clearer picture of individual sectors and branches of industry, especially in 1995, and show how these elements have contributed to the lack of confidence in business circles."
"Ultimately, what is crucial today is not wage costs, but the factor which distorts competition within the internal market by pushing up unit labour costs in countries with hard currencies, namely exchange-rate variations and fluctuations, as well as exchange-rate protection operations."
"So it is high time for us to invent a mechanism which makes one thing clear: that those currencies which do not participate in monetary union immediately will be able to join in later, and that the internal market as such will not be fragmented; rather, European monetary union is a further step towards its consolidation, and another contribution to the multinational dimension of the market."
"Mr President, unemployment is at the moment a Europe-wide problem, to which a solution is sought in all Member States of the European Union."
"Unemployment does however not a constitute a barrier to joining the EMU, since EMU not only improves competition but also increases demand, which helps maintain employment."
"EMU reduces sharp economic fluctuations, lowers the interest rate particularly in smaller European countries and increases trade within the internal market."
"There is no short-cut to employment and it is not improved by short-term measures."
"Economic and monetary union is a natural extension to the internal market, since full benefit from the internal market can only be achieved through co-operation and convergence within economic and monetary union."
"It is true that the implementation of the third stage of monetary union within the schedule set in the Maastricht Treaty is uncertain, due to economic problems."
"However, a postponement of the third stage and the postponement decision in itself will slow down the recovery of the European economy, keep interest rates high and cause great economic uncertainty."
"By fulfilling the EMU criteria stability can be achieved."
"The political decision-making within the economy, regarding both exchange rates and interest rates, will decrease, and this reduces the benefits of not joining the third stage."
"After EMU's third stage, currency policy will be of general concern to Member States."
"Price stability has to be regarded as an essential objective both within and outside monetary union."
"Countries outside the EMU should receive help from the system to join at a later date, and the system should not complicate activities in the internal market or the European Central Bank's monetary activities."
"From the point of view of EMU support, it is important for the Commission to define the currency rules for the countries staying outside the EMU during the course of the current year."
"I hope that the Commissioner will see that this is implemented and aim at finding a solution to the situation as soon as possible."
"The rapporteurs' views on the current situation of the EMU and on the preparatory stage prior to progressing towards a common currency are realistic."
"I find however that fulfilling the convergence criteria is more important than linking floating currencies to the European monetary system, since it enhances political credibility regarding economic issues and provides greater opportunities for achieving both monetary stability and national economic stability."
"Mr President, in April 1996 the European Monetary Institute published its annual report for 1995."
"This excellent document contains a section detailing the economic and financial conditions in the European Union including the existing situation in the different Member States with regard to the Maastricht criteria of convergence necessary for the successful implementation of economic and monetary union."
"Our group, for its part, recalls the necessity, eventually, for the participation of all currencies of the European Union in the exchange mechanism if we wish to guarantee the correct working of the single market and ensure the transition towards EMU."
"Mr Böhm's report, which we generally support, welcomes the EMI report and draws on its main principles, which are the need to follow the Treaty at all institutional stages towards the transition to the third stage of EMU; to continue the reflection on exchange relations between the future Euro-zones and other parts of the Union; and continued pursuit of the adjustment of public debt."
"The Institute's report, like the rapporteur's resolution, goes in the right direction from the point of view of our group, with one slight exception."
"In fact in one of the recitals the motion for a resolution notes a contradiction between the EMI and the European Commission with regard to their explanations of the economic fluctuations which were so evident in 1995."
"The term is a bit strong and for our part we think there is consensus and that the prognoses of the two differ only in the respective importance given to the level of the rate of interest in 1994 and to the monetary fluctuations during the first quarter of 1995 as well as their impact on the confidence of economic agents."
"In this general outline our group welcomes the report by Mr Pérez Royo, which puts the emphasis on the efforts in terms of convergence and budgetary discipline, which alone are able to prevent monetary fluctuations."
"In conclusion, we believe that the system of monetary cooperation is not the competence of the Commission and the EMI alone, but also the competence of the Council, the EMI and the Commission respectively."
"At the same time one should bear in mind that the possibility of narrower bands of fluctuations should not be the only resort of Member States concerned and that there should also be a multilateral framework at the disposal of the Ministers of Finance, of the European central banks and of the central banks of countries which are not yet in the system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a specific comment on behalf of my group on the Pérez Royo report."
"The Liberal Group agrees with the main thrust of the report, but we have two fundamental objections to paragraph 4, which states that a tax on currency speculation can help to keep the exchange rates calculable."
"First of all we doubt just how effective such a tax would really be, and it is not even a good idea in the first place."
"Why can we not introduce this tax?"
"Because we could not limit it to currency market transactions, otherwise the speculators would simply turn to other financial transactions such as derivatives."
"Furthermore, the introduction of such a tax in Europe would simply mean that capital movements would shift to other countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong."
"In other words, if the tax is to be introduced, it must be extended to all financial transactions and to every country in the world."
"But even if we succeeded in introducing the tax, it would still not be a good idea."
"First, it would lead to less liquidity on the financial markets, which can in itself trigger greater currency fluctuations."
"Second, it would also make capital more expensive."
"It makes no distinction between genuine speculation and investment."
"Both business credit and cover transactions for direct investments would be affected, and curbing investment is surely the last thing we want."
"I find it extremely regrettable that the idea of taxing currency market operations is brought up time and time again without ever being properly thought through, and that is why I and my Liberal colleagues will be voting against the paragraph in question."
"Mr President, one more voice, one more minute."
"So that once more it can be made clear that the so-called path of consensus is not actually a path of consensus at all."
"What was decided about EMU and a single currency at Maastricht was not set in concrete."
"Reality has shown that the planned path cannot be achieved."
"One voice and one minute to remind everyone of unemployment and social decline and the share of responsibility borne by the nominative criteria which served to impose a policy even though they were proved to be unattainable."
"But after the total inflexibility shown towards arbitrary goals and deadlines we might now have a more easygoing and arbitrary flexibility in the interpretation of the Treaty articles once it has been realised that applying previously set and inflexibly applied conditions was out of the question."
"Above all, one voice and one minute to assert that the problem is the fall in demand, the orientation of investment, the need to tax speculation and stimulate production and job creation."
"To change our economic policy to one where the single currency has its rightful place of monetary instrument and the objective is improving social conditions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Commission and the Council, since September 1992, there have been a number of devaluations of national currencies: one of the most significant, in terms of loss of value, was that of the Lira, which lost as much as a third of its value against the Deutschmark, causing the Lira to depart the EMS."
"And now, in Italy, all we hear about is the re-entry of the Lira into the European Monetary System as soon as possible."
"This seems to be a priority which, in my view, is likely to cause us to lose sight of the fact that the prime objective that the Italian Government has to achieve is to reduce the government deficit and, therefore, apply a sensible and stable fiscal policy which may help ease the rate of inflation which, in Italy, continues to be one of the highest."
"It is precisely because I agree with the spirit of the report by Mr Fernando Pérez Royo that I am worried therefore: the devaluation of the Lira has been the consequence of speculation and short-term economic policy but, at the same time, we have seen it recover very rapidly against the Deutschmark - something which I personally find it hard to come to terms with, precisely because of the rapidity of this development which leaves me confused."
"We need to have transparency: a policy of transparency is a good thing, and nor do I believe that this sudden revaluation of the Lira is the result of the so-called confidence of the markets in the stability of a government which has been barely two months in existence."
"I therefore ask that we delve deeper into the causes of financial fluctuations which occur too regularly not to be suspect, bearing in mind that there was a time in Italy when all it took was a 'leak' of information on guarantee notes to send the Lira tumbling, with the cost then being borne by Italian workers in terms of their purchasing power."
"To conclude, Mr President: we need common aims and a common macro-economic policy designed to resolve those economic and monetary problems currently besetting certain Member States which could, however, affect others in the future."
"Mr President, in welcoming the 1995 EMI annual report, I wish to congratulate not only Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, but also EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy, who has recently announced his retirement in 1997."
"That does not, however, mean that the Socialist Group agrees with all that is set down in the 1995 report or, indeed, the rapporteur's gloss on it."
"In many areas the report adumbrates ideas given wide currency in the Commission's annual economic report, on which Parliament has already pronounced."
"Some differences between these two snapshots emerge however."
"The EMU idiosyncratically scarcely mentions the shaky state of consumer and business confidence as a significant contributing factor in the current and recent economic slowdown."
"As a consequence, it omits to highlight the need for active measures, including the judicious use of monetary policy to prompt recovery of business and consumer confidence."
"On the other hand, the EMI report talks glibly about the rigidities of the labour market and seems to follow the simplistic approach that labour-market flexibility means poorer wages and conditions for workers rather than improving their mobility through education, training and investment."
"Similarly, the doubtful observation that percentage rates of public expenditure were unacceptably too high, was only half-heartedly qualified by Mr Lamfalussy when he came under fire in Parliament's Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs recently."
"Finally, the EMI report failed to point a finger of blame at the rigid monetary policies pursued by some national monetary authorities whose effect in the real economy has been so deleterious."
"Socialist amendments underscoring some of these sins of omission and commission have been incorporated in Parliament's report."
"I am also pleased that future EMI reports will contain more detailed analyses and evaluations of the effect of the exchange-rate fluctuations on the economy."
"Secondly, Mr Lamfalussy has promised that he and his successor are prepared to issue half-yearly reports on the EMI's preparatory work for EMU."
"This will give greater transparency to the EMI's work and that, in turn, will benefit us all."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Every speech that I have sat through this morning has been extended one way or another through your incompetence in the chair."
"It is no good exhorting people to shorten their speeches."
"You are in the chair on behalf of Parliament to shut people up when they go over time, because they transgress on other people's democratic rights to speak in this Parliament."
"Could you wake up and do something about it?"
"Mr President, if everyone keeps to what has been agreed, not just here in Parliament but everywhere else, then economic and monetary union will be in place by 1999."
"It is not just the politicians already in favour who believe it will happen, the financial markets also already seem to be counting on it, as we can see from the convergence of long-term interest rates in France and Germany."
"Next comes the man in the street."
"We are going to have to earn his trust in practical ways, by meeting the criteria and by providing proper information from now to 2002."
"My group believes in the single currency, let there be no mistake about it."
"But we do still have a number of questions which I should like to put to the Chairman of the European Monetary Institute, Mr Lamfalussy."
"The Treaty states that the central banks must make themselves independent of the decision-making powers of their governments and parliaments by 1 January 1999 at the latest."
"At the same time, the institutions of the ESCB, the European Central Bank and the central banks, are not to take any further instructions."
"This is often referred to in the press as the sixth convergence criterion."
"The majority of the national central banks do not yet meet the independence requirements, and far too little progress is being made here."
"Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Sweden have done particularly badly."
"And even once a bank is formally declared independent, it may take a considerable time before it develops its own tradition of independent decision-making."
"The independence of the future European Central Bank would provide a sound basis on which its president could build a reputation for reliability."
"France yesterday came up with a proposal that could become the political equivalent of the Central Bank, or something resembling an economic government, as Mr Pérez Royo described it this morning."
"I should therefore like to ask Mr Lamfalussy two questions."
"What does he think in general terms of the progress made by the central banks towards independence?"
"And does he see the French proposal as a restriction on the independence of the Central Bank in particular?"
"Do Mr Waigel's 'stability pact' and other similar proposals also imply restrictions on the independence of the Central Bank?"
"I should also like to ask about the blueprint which the EMI is to produce for the future operation of the European Central Bank."
"According to the Treaty, this blueprint is supposed to be ready by the end of this year, and it is being increasingly widely reported that the Central Bank is probably going to pursue a policy of controlling the money supply."
"This was the system used by the German central bank, the Bundesbank , and according to reports it worked successfully in only ten years out of twenty."
"What is the argument in favour of using this system?"
"My third and final question is this: what does Mr Lamfalussy estimate the value of the euro will be against the Asian currencies?"
"I ask this because I am convinced that in some sections of the market, the European currencies are overvalued against the Asian currencies and vice versa, and that this may lie at the root of some of our unemployment."
"Mr President, thankfully we live in a Community where the weapons of war these days are economic rather than military."
"It is important that we seize the opportunity to get our economies together to prevent future conflict."
"It is a bit like the difference between nuclear fusion and nuclear fission."
"We all know that nuclear fission is an inherently dangerous process, as indeed is a fission in our economies."
"But if we were able to achieve the economic equivalent of nuclear fusion and fuse our economies together, we all know that the benefits would be great and that we would produce a lot of economic energy through a growth in trade on our continent and a lot more jobs, which is so important."
"I belong to a tradition of a party in Great Britain which has always believed in the United Kingdom's full participation in economic and monetary union."
"Indeed, one of the more eminent members of my party, Mr Roy Jenkins, in his time as President of the Commission, was one of the main proponents of currencies coming together."
"I am proud to be in that tradition, to stand against the prevailing government policy and sentiment in my country."
"Mr von Wogau said that perhaps it would be better if the UK did not join a single currency."
"I beg to disagree with him."
"I am arguing very strongly in my country that we should join a single currency."
"It is important for us irrespective of its importance to the European Union as a whole."
"On Black Wednesday in September 1992 we saw the immense damage that can be done by great devaluations of currency."
"In his report, Mr Pérez Royo talks about the growth in Italian competitiveness through the short-term devaluation."
"One can also look at the growth in UK competitiveness and the damage it did to the French and Belgian economies."
"I do not agree with him that we need a tax on currency speculation but certainly we need to avoid this kind of movement."
"Finally, I am arguing in my country that the logical consequence of an opt-out from the single currency is a lockout from the single market."
"Countries cannot co-exist in a single market with partners who reserve the right to indulge in competitive devaluations to gain short-term advantage over their neighbours."
"If we live in a union it is a union where solidarity in these matters must prevail."
"In our view, the point of this debate we are holding is that the economic guidelines and, above all, the political measures taken so far are insufficient given the real state of affairs; the truth is that we are in a stage of economic slow-down with an unacceptable level of unemployment."
"And so, if in those circumstances the internal market is not strengthened, if there is no fresh investment, if we do not have an effective employment policy, that slow-down could turn into a new period of recession and, if that situation persists, then the time-scales ahead of us cease to be credible."
"This is a political and not a technical problem."
"The closer we come to the third phase, to the single currency - which is essential and has to be maintained - the clearer it becomes that Economic and Monetary Union has not been brought into effect as a whole and, more particularly, that Economic Union has not moved forward."
"There is at present not even a trace of government of the economy; there is no coordination, save in theory, between the Member States; and the main guidelines are not being put into practice - despite the fact that those are the very elements that need to be given a boost, not forgetting the priority to be accorded to employment, as happened at the tripartite conference recently held in Italy."
"That is the point!"
"Finally, we must be clear that the policy of austerity, albeit vital, cannot be allowed to destroy development; that is fundamental point but does not seem to me to be taken fully into account in either the discussion or the documents of the Community Institutions."
"That is why I think it would be a mistake to make the Maastricht criteria stricter, as some would wish."
"What we actually need is to revert to an intelligent reading of Article 104c which says, among other things, that public investment needs to be rid of deficit - and that is a basic factor."
"I know that it is difficult to balance out deficits with a high level of public investment; difficult to reduce the fiscal pressure on employment, as Commissioner de Silguy said, but that is what needs to be done, and coordination between the Member States is needed for this."
"I wish also to point out that, as President Santer rightly said in a recent statement: we need to make full and good use of the Structural Funds - ECU 170 bn - to aid investment and employment."
"The Commission and Council must do more here."
"Mr President, honourable colleagues."
"The economic guidelines now before us are marked by the preparations for EMU and the tragic fact that the European model has created a situation involving 18 million unemployed and 50 million people suffering social exclusion."
"It is obvious that the new jobs and sectors of the future are not thriving in today's EU."
"I am convinced that cooperation on economic stability and a common currency is the most important contribution that the EU can make towards the creation of better conditions under which we can all be more competitive, achieve greater growth and thus create new jobs."
"Even for those countries which will not qualify for the first round of EMU the process has resulted in a thorough and in many cases necessary revision of the economy."
"For it is to be hoped that we have come to the end of the era in which budgets could be expanded and politicians could buy popularity by shifting the burden of debt irresponsibly onto future generations."
"Much remains to be done, however, as part of a structural revision, responsibility for almost all of which lies with the individual countries."
"It is the responsibility of the members of ECOFIN and of the Ministers meeting in Florence to effect changes in the various countries' national tax, social security, labour market and education systems rather than just talking about them."
"As regards the Union, and not least us here in Parliament, it is a question of gearing our work to deregulation and not to new expensive regulations which hinder development."
"I would stress what is said in the guidelines, namely the need to reduce expenditure and the fact that increased taxation is not an alternative, particularly with a view to our competitiveness."
"We must thus forcefully reject increased taxes, European taxes and in particular the proposed Tobin taxes."
"There are no quick and easy solutions to the problem of unemployment."
"We could learn something from other countries' experiences, however, more quickly than getting bogged down in meaningless political formulations about vague ideas of an employment union which has shown itself to have no effect whatsoever, at least not in the way it has been put into practice in my country."
"The old structural problems in Europe cannot be ignored."
"The omissions of many years must be dealt with in the short term if we wish to retain our prosperity."
"And we have white papers, Essen conclusions, these guidelines - which is to say that the conclusions and the direction to take are clear."
"I should now like to hear fewer fine words and see more concrete evidence that the leaders of the EU are really serious about their goal of halving unemployment."
"The Commission's recommendations to the Council on the broad guidelines of economic policy are a source of some concern to us, since they appear to be determined by a strictly monetarist approach in which employment and growth are incidental considerations."
"This approach could take us straight to the wall."
"Look at what is happening in Germany, Belgium and France."
"We cannot have a single currency if we do not have the support of public opinion. The currency has no virtue in itself, but it has a vital political dimension and represents part of what it is to be European."
"What is more, experience has shown us that in industry for example, excessive belt-tightening can be counterproductive in that it destroys the social cohesion which everyone agrees is a vital element in being competitive."
"This is also true of the macro-economy, but its importance is underestimated, and I therefore wonder what Mr de Silguy means when he recommends 'suitable' wage increases."
"In his preliminary remarks, Mr Lamfalussy told us that we should seek to get to grips with the serious problems facing us."
"But if we are to do so, we cannot accept the economic guidelines being proposed by the Council and the Commission."
"In particular, the Council must agree to adopt and finance the 14 major infrastructure projects proposed by Jacques Delors, which Parliament has called for time and time again."
"On the jobs front, our structural policy must be to reduce working hours."
"Looking beyond the accepted monetarist approach, simply saying that we intend to invest in infrastructure and human resources is not enough, we must also say how we intend to do this and how much we intend to invest."
"I have one comment on the report by Mr Pérez Royo."
"His proposal for a tax on currency speculation is absolutely vital for the system we wish to introduce, and Europe should take the initiative on this subject at the next G7 meeting."
"Finally, while we are in favour of monetary stability, it is our political responsibility to condemn the conditions under which the Council and the Commission expect us to pursue this objective."
"The Commission's economic guidelines are unacceptable, and have been made even more so by the ECOFIN Council."
"They merely demonstrate that our executive bodies have caved in to monetarist pressure, and they play into the hands of those who oppose the single currency."
"Mr President, what message do Europeans have for our almost 18 million unemployed people?"
"Are we able to solve real problems, instead of simply making solemn declarations?"
"New jobs in the environmental sector, social services and information and communications technology are not enough in themselves."
"Disputes over competence will not take us any further forward."
"Only when measures at European level are coordinated with those of the Member States will effective results be achieved."
"Jacques Santer's confidence pact on employment in no way impinges on the legitimate aim of subsidiarity."
"A chapter on employment in the new EU Treaty will not in fact create a single extra job, but the foundations are being laid for an active policy on employment."
"After all, the Commission is supposed to complement, not replace, measures taken by the Member States."
"It is therefore not a question of new programmes costing millions, but rather of jointly agreed resources, such as the Structural Funds, being coordinated so as to enhance their effectiveness."
"The European Council in Essen took the first real steps by establishing five areas for action."
"The Madrid Council then decided to reduce regional imbalances, not least as a means of combating long-term unemployment."
"Research and development must be strongly promoted, alongside small and medium-sized enterprises, which provide the bulk of the jobs and traineeships in Europe."
"We need more flexible working hours, greater investment in training and further training, the introduction of lifelong learning and more generally a policy of stability."
"The convergence criteria and the third stage of economic and monetary union must be adhered to."
"As a hard currency, the euro will help to boost investment and to create new jobs in Europe."
"The social market economy is and will remain Europe's number one export in intellectual terms."
"But both parts must be in harmony: the economic part, with an increase in competitiveness, and the social part, which must never be allowed to fall by the wayside."
"Our model is based on consensus, not on confrontation."
"The alliances on employment which should be pursued and respect for the interests of the social partners belong in this context."
"Mr President, I will start by bringing the House's attention to the Delors White Paper which was charged with the task of providing a blueprint to get 15 million of Europe's citizens back to work by the year 2000, an ambitious task but one which I believe we should still pursue."
"At the same time we have within the Maastricht Treaty a timetable laid down for monetary union which we need to stick to."
"Indeed until recently the growth projections of both the Commission and the OECD suggested we could still possibly complete that task of getting millions of people back to work by the year 2000."
"What concerns me is the revision that has taken place on those growth figures and the likely impact on jobs."
"The jobs, I believe, will not come with such low revised figures and what we really need is the measures outlined in the resolution that will go before Parliament shortly so that those jobs are created."
"Modest growth in itself will not bring those jobs."
"What is clear is that the reductions in the number of people paying income tax because of the increased unemployment and the increased number of people dependent on social security payments will seriously affect the achievement of the debt and deficit targets of Member States in the European Union, and I draw Members' attention particularly to the situation in Germany."
"Only by getting people back to work, getting people to pay taxes, reducing social security spending as a whole, will we actually get to meet those debt and deficit criteria and see jobs and the single currency at the same time."
"We know that growth does not guarantee jobs but without growth jobs will not be created at all."
"Mr Santer came to us with a package of confidence-creating measures which at the moment seems to many like a confidence trick."
"What we need are the measures outlined in our resolution in order to see the real growth and the real jobs that we need in Europe so desperately."
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to the speeches of all those have taken part in this debate, and I was particularly struck by Mr de Silguy's comments."
"I would agree with the Commissioner that the introduction of the single currency must not give rise to a split between the rich and poor countries of the European Union, but I note with regret that this statement is far from consistent with the intention expressed by the French Government - and partly taken up by the Commissioner - of at least studying the possibility of paying Community grants in depreciated currency and - what is worse - of making Structural Fund support conditional on the improvement of public finances."
"Besides having no legal basis in the Treaty, these two measures - and especially the second - would be in clear conflict with the Commissioner's statement, since they would mean adding new penalties to the existing penalty of exclusion from the hard core, increasing the 'pre-in' countries' difficulty in joining the common currency, and ultimately widening the disparities and causing the split which the Commissioner does not wish to be created."
"The Spanish delegation supports the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism which encourages the convergence of those countries which do not participate in the third stage of EMU from the outset and protects their currencies from external pressures."
"However, it does not - and will never - support the introduction of penalties which make convergence more difficult and impede the entry of those countries which initially remain outside the hard core."
"Mr President, economic growth will not be a magic cure for all the European Union's problems, but adequate growth is absolutely essential if we are to achieve both our current main aims of higher employment and economic and monetary union."
"The first thing we might expect the broad economic guidelines to do is to set a course for achieving adequate growth in the short term."
"It is therefore quite astonishing to realize that neither the version put forward by the Commission nor the ECOFIN version actually does this."
"What is worse, if we followed today's recommendations to the letter, our already stagnating growth would be slowed still further."
"The main problem seems to be that the Commission and the Council live in a one-dimensional world of supply economics where the concept of demand is completely taboo, so no account is taken of the impact which the recommendations given in the broad guidelines might have on actual demand."
"The Member States' convergence programmes are still under review, with adjustments being made to accommodate declining economic performance, and we shall not see the cumulative effect of all these until the end of the year at the earliest."
"Clearly, the idea that 90 % of the Union's gross national product is earned within the Union itself and only 10 % through external trade has not yet got through to everyone."
"If the Commission and the Council are recommending a number of measures designed to curb demand to all the Member States, where are we going to find the impetus for growth to help us increase employment and achieve EMU?"
"From the 10 % of GNP which we earn from exports outside the Union, against a background of strict monetary policy geared towards lower inflation, when the BIS is already warning against deflation?"
"By refusing to take advantage of the flexibility built into the EMU criteria and imposing an unnecessarily severe programme of belt-tightening on all the Member States, which would run counter to present economic trends?"
"And by curbing wages in all the Member States, so that there is little growth in internal purchasing power and therefore in intra-European exports?"
"When our joint resolution says that the approach adopted by the Commission and the Council is unrealistic and inadequate, we are really understating the case."
"It is actually a danger to the Union, and must therefore be rejected."
"Mr President, we are here to discuss a common project, the single European currency, and its next stage."
"A precondition for the progress of EMU is that European citizens have confidence that it is justifiable."
"Large Member States play a significant role in this."
"The interest rate is a good example of the above."
"The interest rate of the anchor currency will have to be lowered before interest rates in my own country, Finland for example, can decrease, even though Finland has the lowest inflation rate in Europe."
"Finland has discussed joining the European exchange rate mechanism."
"Before joining, however Finland wants to be certain that the anchor currency, the German mark, is not used to protect Germany's national interests, as was the case in the early 1990's, when Germany was forced to sustain an unrealistically high interest rate in order to prevent an inflationary election campaign of a politician which would affect the value of the German mark."
"This lead to a collapse of the entire ERM, and the weak ones are still struggling with high unemployment as a consequence."
"In EMU discussions we are talking about necessary savings within the public sector."
"With regard to EMU's progress it is important that this concept is not misunderstood."
"Public savings should not mean that everybody is saving - on the contrary."
"The private sector in particular, where there is money, should invest and also spend."
"This serves to bring about an equilibrium in the public sector, more jobs are created, more tax revenue is collected and there are fewer costs related to unemployment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lamfalussy, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to concentrate on just one aspect of the subject that we are debating; on a very important aspect on which the success of the whole single currency venture may hinge."
"Namely, the relations between the Member States in the first group and those which remain outside."
"We have before us a first class report, and I would like to congratulate Mr von Wogau on the intellectual range that he has displayed in producing it."
"However, various points have remained unclarified in this debate and I will recall them for you now."
"First, the likelihood that the countries which are not in the first group will face a worsening of the terms of the Treaty because of the stability pact, otherwise known as the Waigel pact, about which there is intense discussion."
"The Waigel pact makes things worse, and it matters not whether those in the first group agree on it."
"What matters is that it will worsen the situation and make things much more difficult for the countries in the following group."
"To put it in a nutshell, I think that the main issue that should be concerning us in the whole affair is the position of the European Central Bank which will support the currencies of the countries which are outside when they are threatened, but only sufficiently, so it tells us, to prevent a threat to the stability of the euro."
"And, of course, that is just as it should be."
"No one would wish to see the stability of the euro threatened in the very early days or to see it sacrificed on the altar of stability for the currencies which are temporarily outside."
"However, there is no reason why it should ever come to that, because each intervention by the Central Bank in support of a currency can be sterilized."
"The essential element is equitable apportionment of the interest cost, of the cost of interest rate changes, so that the economies of the countries which have remained outside are not excessively burdened."
"I would like the Commission and the European Monetary Institute to take note of this point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with three days to go to the Florence summit, it was important for Parliament to say what it thinks about the economic situation in the Union and its economic and social prospects."
"The only option open to us was an oral question, and so I now have only two short minutes in which to restate my dissatisfaction at the far too liberal approach adopted by the Commission and the Council."
"Budgetary discipline, combating inflation, flexible working conditions and increasing competition have proved to be anything but the right way to get Europe out of its present severe crisis, with 18 million unemployed, 50 million people living in poverty, inadequate demand, a lack of confidence, falling investment and excessively high interest rates."
"None of these remedies has worked."
"As the French socialists see it, we should instead promote economic growth by bringing interest rates down, abandoning the fight against inflation, which is now in any event practically non-existent, channelling profits towards investment in order to create jobs, implementing a regeneration programme based on the Delors White Paper, and reducing working hours so that people can share them more fairly."
"And, lastly, the Intergovernmental Conference must give Europe a social and, above all, a political dimension."
"An economic Europe which is soon to have its own single currency will really need political government by a governing body."
"This may be a different issue, but the fact that Europe does not have a political dimension certainly partly explains the Union's poor economic and social performance at the moment, which has brought such condemnation from the public."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to what you have said, and I have learned a great deal."
"Although I obviously cannot reply to all the questions you raised, I should nevertheless like to say something about EMS II and unemployment, two subjects which were mentioned in almost every question."
"On the subject of EMS II, I would confirm what Mr de Silguy said: that there are not one, but two objectives."
"One is to ensure that the single market is able to function properly."
"The other is to prepare the way for those who are provisionally outside the system to join the first team."
"What we are all wondering is whether there is really any hope that EMS II will achieve these two objectives after the serious crisis that the first EMS went through in 1992 and 1993?"
"My reply to this is simply that there is hope, for a number of reasons."
"First, do not think that the 1992-1993 crises marked the collapse of the EMS."
"The EMS did not collapse, though it was certainly badly shaken."
"But the countries which remained in the EMS experienced far less turbulence in their exchange rates than those outside the system."
"Second, we can learn lessons from past experience, and the proposal which is currently being discussed and which is to be completed by the end of the year rectifies every single one of the deficiencies which the EMS showed in 1992-1993."
"Third, the convergence process is considerably further advanced than it was at the time of the crises in 1992-1993."
"Fourth, there is still talk of the danger of 'asymmetric' crises."
"We have already had one, in the shape of German unification, but it is not something which is likely to be repeated, or at least I hope not."
"Furthermore, I would point out that the danger in the past has not come from 'asymmetric' crises, but from the asymmetric nature of the reactions to them, particularly the political repercussions."
"Think of how chaotic the reactions were to the oil crises in the 1970s."
"For all these reasons, I am confident that EMS II will work, but I would stress one vital point, which is that EMS II cannot be more than a transitional or provisional arrangement, and that the final solution to exchangerate instability is monetary union."
"Finally, a few words about unemployment."
"In every speech I have made, I have always recognized the fundamental importance of tackling the unemployment problem."
"I have never concealed my concern about this, nor do I intend to do so."
"But I would advise you to resist the temptation to draw parallels, as some people have occasionally done, between the preparations for monetary union, or even monetary union itself, and the increase in unemployment."
"If there is such a temptation, it is misleading in that it does not correspond to what actually happened."
"The strong upward trend in unemployment began in Europe in the 1970s and gained momentum at the beginning of the 1980s, in other words at a time when monetary union was not even on the agenda and we were a long way even from the Maastricht negotiations."
"I therefore feel we should analyse the seriousness of the problem as it is now, instead of drawing over-simplified parallels which are easily exploited."
"Mr Cox has asked for the floor; since we are about to start the vote, I would ask you to very brief and take the floor only to make points of order, given that I have still to give the floor to Mr Macciotta, on behalf of the Council, and Mr de Silguy, on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, you have anticipated the point of order I wished to make."
"I welcome the fact that Mr Lamfalussy has made his closing comments but I must insist that the House also hear the other institutions."
"We have asked direct questions and we should have direct answers before we go to vote."
"It is rather difficult for me to answer all the individual points; I shall therefore focus on a number of general considerations."
"To begin with, considerations of an institutional nature: there is no question that, objectively speaking, difficulties exist in relations between the Institutions, these provoke tensions and, looking ahead, represent an obstacle to further integration: we have a communications' deficit which is resulting in a shortfall in participation and democracy."
"We shall have therefore to find a way of involving the European Parliament, but also the national parliaments, in the decision-taking processes of the European Community."
"This is not an artificial concession but a real need to which it is in all our interest to respond through the appropriate institutional changes, which are, in any case, being considered by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"A few points now on the substance: the achievement of Economic and Monetary Union will help reinforce the conditions needed to give a fresh boost to economic and social development in Europe, making it more competitive in relation to the three other major economic areas in the world, and will therefore make it possible to speed up the process of creating new jobs."
"If that process is to be pursued in a resolute and credible manner, the priority objective of reducing levels of unemployment is both a necessary and a consistent one."
"I should like to say to Mr Martinez at this point that not taking part in the stable system of exchange rates is not helpful, as is clear from experience in Italy which did not devalue in order to be more competitive but experienced, in 1992 and between 1994 and 1995, sudden instability from which it is only now emerging with difficulty and determination."
"A stable macro-economic framework is not then of itself enough to guarantee the creation of new jobs."
"If we are bring down unemployment to a reasonable level, we need to take more wideranging measures, of a structural nature, designed to improve the operation of the markets, in particular the labour market."
"There are indispensable constraints and objectives: first and foremost the social welfare model - which, as I have already said, is an essential feature of Europe - needs to be defended and preserved but, given the changes in the age pyramid and the professional qualifications of Europe's population, if we are to do that we have to review it to make it more effective and alter the balance."
"Secondly, we need to increase investment in human capital which is the most important source of wealth for our continent, by strengthening and improving education systems and vocational training."
"Thirdly, we need specific measures to help the less-favoured groups in society: young people, women and the long-term unemployed, to make it easier for them to join or rejoin the labour market."
"The issue of employment is a priority for the European Union."
"The Florence European Council, to take place at the end of the week, will focus essentially on that issue, with the objective of making still more targeted and effective the strategy for combating unemployment, the broad lines of which have already been identified in earlier European Councils, beginning with the Essen European Council."
"The tripartite conference, convened last week in Rome by the Italian Government, showed that the broad lines of that strategy enjoy a large degree of support from the social forces."
"We need to increase that support because it is vital if we are to make this strategy more effective and more vigorous."
"Strengthening consensus, through dialogue and consultation, underpins the confidence pact for employment launched by President Santer."
"We are certain that the Florence European Council will be able to give fresh impetus to the strategy of combating unemployment and that resolute implementation of that strategy will soon produce real results."
"Noninflationary macro-economic policies geared to stable growth are not incompatible with the aim of increasing employment: they are in fact the vital prerequisite for achieving that objective."
"In that context, we need also to find and apply in all of the Member States fiscal policies able to reduce pressure on earned income - a hope that has been expressed in the course of this debate."
"That aim is not inconsistent with the need stated in the Council resolution not to reduce, for the time being, overall fiscal pressure: we are talking about a targeted redistribution of the tax burden."
"The objective we have set ourselves is difficult and requires a collective effort at all levels, but it is essential, and the future of the European Union depends on its achievement."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office."
"Commissioner de Silguy will now take the floor on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, I cannot hope to reply in just a few minutes to all the questions put to me, but I should like to make two points, one about the single currency and the other about unemployment."
"On the single currency, I feel we should put an end to all the doubts and misunderstandings."
"There is no doubt that the euro will enter circulation on 1 January 1999."
"Public debate on this subject has been changing over the last few weeks and months, and the question now is not whether the euro is a good idea and whether it is really going to happen, but what preparations we should make in order to obtain the maximum possible benefit from it."
"To prepare for the euro, we must of course carry on with the work on convergence, as we discussed at length this morning."
"We also need to set up a second European Monetary System."
"I would refer here to what we have just heard from the Chairman of the EMI on the subject, and I would point out to Mr García that the Commission has never said that it would make payments from the Structural Funds conditional on meeting certain macroeconomic criteria."
"It simply said that it would agree to a request from a number of Member States to carry out a study on the subject, which is not the same thing at all."
"What we must also do to prepare for the euro, and I feel this is absolutely vital, is to introduce a stability pact, because there is no point in being ready on the day if we are subsequently unable to adhere to rules of good conduct and sound management for the duration of the monetary union."
"I would add that the policies we pursue here must be both credible and socially acceptable."
"These are two very important points."
"We also need to introduce statutory regulations for the euro; you should receive the Commission's proposal shortly."
"Such regulations are essential if we are to provide the legal security which operators, firms and the markets in general demand of us."
"Finally - and this is in response to many of the questions raised this morning - we must organize an information campaign in close cooperation with Parliament to convince public opinion that the euro is necessary, and to prepare people psychologically for the changeover and reassure them about what will happen."
"As you can see, we have an enormous task ahead of us, but it is also a very exciting one, in that we shall now be making real preparations instead of simply asking questions."
"Moving on now to employment, this is a subject to which we should devote all our energies."
"It is a political priority, and as such should be the focus of our concern."
"When the Commission presented its broad economic guidelines, I told you that they were based on three vital elements: growth, stability and employment."
"So I was astonished to hear the criticisms made of these guidelines, criticisms which would seem to suggest that people would prefer to have inflation and deficits, neither of which has ever created jobs, as far as I am aware."
"If deficits created jobs, then Europe would probably be suffering from over-employment at the moment."
"The euro is another subject on which we need to eliminate misunderstandings."
"The euro will mean less unemployment, simply because it will mean healthier public finances."
"I would point out here that 40 to 50 % of budget savings go to finance public deficits, whereas the money would be much better used to promote investment and consumption, and thus to create jobs."
"The euro will also put an end to currency fluctuations, and on this point I share many of the concerns expressed this morning."
"I would point out that in 1995, currency fluctuations cost Europe half a percentage point of growth and one and a half million jobs."
"So here too, the euro should make a big difference to our unemployment problem."
"I am quite aware that although the euro itself may be a vital element, it is still not enough on its own and further measures are needed."
"This is where the structural policies come in, but these are primarily the responsibility of the Member States, with Europe merely providing the leverage."
"President Santer's proposals to be discussed at Florence adopt this same line."
"Let me just mention three other points which I feel are important, and which reply to some of the questions raised this morning."
"One of Mr Santer's proposals is to exploit the potential of the single market by making small and medium-sized firms more competitive."
"He is also proposing that the major infrastructure projects should be stepped up, and the Commission intends to stress the urgent need for the trans-European networks, because it is totally unacceptable that, four years on from the Essen summit, the funding for these is available but has still not been released."
"There are also proposals for reforming the employment systems, and although the main burden here again rests with the Member States, the Union can still act as a very useful lever."
"The measures we are taking are thus coherent, comprehensive and carefully thought out, and they need firm support if we are to restore confidence and return to growth."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Votes"
"Madam President, since Parliament has, as was to be expected, rejected Amendment No 1, I should like to call on all my colleagues in the House to support Amendment No 5, tabled by the Union for Europe Group, since we shall then at least signal a certain amount of willingness on the part of Parliament to move in the direction wished by Mr Macartney."
"Madam President, as rapporteur I wish to say how disappointed I am at the vote on Amendment No 1 and I think this House will have cause to feel ashamed about that."
"As a fall back, at least we can adopt Amendment No 5, which puts in the word 'substantial' which has no legal force."
"But at least let us put it in."
"So I support Amendment No 5, although it is very much weaker and this House has just made a fool of itself."
"(The President declared the common position adopted as amended)"
"Madam President, I have a comment to make about the voting order."
"It seems logical to me to have the vote on the two amendments tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Nos 59 and 60, before Nos 64 and 65, in view of the substance of the amendments and the fact that the Committee on Transport and Tourism feels that they go further."
"I would ask all Members who think we need to find a solution to the backlog to take another close look at Amendments Nos 59 and 60."
"Madam President, the amendments by the Committee on Transport and Tourism certainly do not depart further from the text than the others, since they do no more than restore the Commission's original wording."
"(In successive votes, Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions)"
"Madam President, I should just like to thank the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy for their support in drawing up this report, and especially for their valuable contributions in the discussions in committee."
"I think we can vote on the report and the amendment together - given that there are no other amendments - but I should like to clarify the following technical point."
"We accepted Mrs Randzio-Plath's amendment to paragraph 10 in committee, but the second part of that paragraph - referring to the role of the EMI - has been left in by mistake."
"Consequently, we should vote on the report and amendment together, but we should not vote on the second part of the paragraph in question."
"That will leave us with the following:"
"'Stresses the need for a balanced policy mix' ."
"(FR) We therefore do not need to vote on the second part of this paragraph."
"Madam President, I think our translators do an excellent job, but on this occasion I would like to ask for the Dutch version of the report by Mr Gasòliba to be revised again. There are four translation errors, all stemming from the same problem."
"'Fiscal policy' is translated as 'fiscaal beleid ' instead of 'begrotingsbeleid ' . And 'fiscal consolidation' is wrongly translated in three places as 'fiscale consolidatie ' ."
"This is not the first time this mistake has occurred, so I suggest that not only should this report be checked again, but that the problem should also be brought to the attention of the translation service, so that they know that 'fiscal' in English can be translated in two different ways in Dutch."
"Thank you, Mrs Thyssen."
"We shall not only make the corrections, but ensure that these mistakes do not occur again in future."
"(Since no Members opposed the tabling of the oral amendment, the President put it to the vote)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"This is an excellent report which proposed to make a concrete difference by its proposal for energy efficiency which in helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions also addresses climate change."
"The Green Group supports all the amendments by the rapporteur and I agree with Mr Macartney that it is a shameful day when this Parliament cannot take direct concrete action on a simple, straightforward issue like energy saving."
"Linkohr report"
"I cannot support the EU investing a great deal of money in research which is not in line with the Greens' proposals."
"The research includes aerospace research, as the text states that air traffic will double within the next 15 years."
"Flying is not an environmentally friendly form of transport."
"More resources should rather be made available for research in the fast train industry."
"It is true that this is also included in the proposal but I would like to increase its share considerably."
"There are many areas and objectives that I approve of, however, and I support the amendments, for example the reduction of the appropriation for nuclear safety by ECU 10 million."
"Unfortunately, experience shows that this money contributes to the continued use of nuclear energy and gives the impression, in the Eastern European countries as well as elsewhere, that nuclear power is safe."
"Nuclear power is not safe and we should instead invest money in renewable sources of energy in order to get away from nuclear power."
"I am voting against Amendments Nos 50 and 51 because they do not take money away from Euratom."
"I support Amendments Nos 55-57 because they ensure that Euratom money goes into support for renewable sources of energy."
"On the occasion of the refinancing of the Fourth Framework Programme, Commissioner Cresson has altered the political objective of European research for integration and cohesion and geared it to new purposes:"
"support for the international competitiveness of European industry; - making the subject-matter of research comprehensible to Europe's citizens; and - bringing together national and Community endeavours.The rapporteur, Mr Linkohr, was quite right to take up the three issues he considered, but looking beyond those particular issues and the priorities relevant to each, it seems to me that, on the occasion of this all too short debate, Parliament should give an early signal to the Commission concerning the approach to be taken in the Fifth Framework Programme."
"I would like to suggest that we use this opportunity to take a further step forward by earmarking a percentage of the total budget for projects involving a technological challenge, the so-called 'challenge-led' projects."
"A 'challenge-led' project is characterized by:"
"a high risk, such that it cannot be carried out at national level; - the possibility of triggering a multi-disciplinary approach and international cooperation (in the context of which it is Europe's interest to speak with one voice); - a real technological challenge - the breakthrough, when it comes, bringing with it substantial economic or social benefit.A 'challenge-led' project does not integrate existing technologies."
"the magnetic-levitation train or superconductor electric cable; - the super-efficient battery (all renewable energy technologies are limited by the problem of batteries); - vaccines which prevent illness: they are ruining the pharmaceutical companies but require major investment.Parliament and the Commission should start thinking now about the most important technological challenges - selecting one or more topics - and, in the context of the Fifth Framework Programme, adequate European resources should be earmarked for them, to ensure that specific programmes are viable and have a clear European profile."
"The Commission should not drag its feet, content to do only what it is well-equipped and knows how to do."
"If we want to keep pace with innovation, we must be prepared continually to re-invent ourselves."
"It is good to have the task forces for the time being!"
"Strengthening the funding of the 4th Framework Programme for technological research and development, in effect since 1994, together with as assessment of its activities, is of capital importance for guaranteeing Europe's competitiveness."
"But I must point out that the area of technological R&D is particularly important for countries like Portugal."
"By introducing the notion of task forces, interesting in fact in terms of principles, the Commission has somehow undermined the balance struck when defining the 4th FP."
"By banking on major applied research projects it runs the risk of harming cohesion, preventing the less developed countries from taking part actively, even though they want and need to take part for the whole Union's good."
"All Member States must have a voice in defining the future task forces but it is also important that the priorities already defined in the 4th Programme should continue to be taken into account."
"I agree with the rapporteur's proposal to concentrate priorities or focus on such basic areas as educational multimedia and hydraulic resources."
"Educational multimedia is the perfect Trojan horse for stating European identity and the European Union must accept this and draw the necessary consequences."
"The introduction of the new area of research on landmines deserves my full support."
"I am well versed in this problem since in Portugal's brother states, Angola and Mozambique landmines are still a scourge claiming countless lives among the younger generations in those Portuguese-speaking countries with so much to offer the future of our society."
"I back the amendments referring to the multimedia priority but must stress that only the budgetary increase proposed by the Committee on Culture will make them operational."
"I back all the amendments referring to concentrating priorities, the amendment on mines and the amendment calling for better and more permanent interdepartmental interaction."
"We Greens believe that a key element of any sound economic policy in the future is effective support for research which is not thrown off course by cyclical pressure for cuts, but in fact lays the foundations for future progress in an anti-cyclical way, at the very time when the economic cycle indicates that the innovations made have been exhausted."
"We therefore particularly regret that the proposed increase in resources for the fourth framework programme, which we shall support whenever we have the opportunity, has once again been inextricably linked to unacceptable changes in direction which will hamper and obstruct future developments, rather than facilitating them."
"These decisions include the funding for Euratom, for research into fusion and aeronautics - which might be of use 50 years from now, if ever - as well as the one-sided concentration on research carried out by large industry and the reckless determination to pursue biotechnological research without adequate risk surveillance."
"We regret this, and call on Parliament to devise a procedure for similar decisions in the future which enables us and others to make our criticisms of substance in an appropriate way, without at the same time having to reject the EU's whole research policy."
"Sindal report"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the main concern of this report is to make sea transport more flexible and attractive."
"There is a need to give a greater role to this mode of transport, so as to relieve pressure on the others."
"However, various problems and shortcomings have come to light in the course of examining of this report, especially as regards environmental protection and safety standards."
"Indeed, the vessels employed in short sea shipping are particularly small and dilapidated."
"The risks of an accident are therefore greater."
"We must now take all these factors into account, with a view to making short sea shipping a mode of transport which is environmentally friendly and safe."
"Madam President, in commenting on the Sindal report, I very much welcome the plans contained for a switch of 30 to 40 % of trade between Spain and Britain from the roads to short-sea maritime transport."
"It will be good for the environment, take 0.6 million tonnes of trade off our roads and it will be six times more efficient in terms of energy usage and reducing carbon dioxide emissions."
"I rise in support particularly to plead to the Commission that it ensures that the port of Tilbury in my constituency is at the heart of this new increased trade."
"It is a port which is close to London and the major transport networks from the south-east of England to the whole of the United Kingdom."
"It has an unmatched range of flexible facilities."
"Recently it has announced a fast, daily container service to Rotterdam."
"It has the potential to benefit from this increased trade and I ask the Commission to ensure that it does so."
"After months of intensive work, Mr Sindal's report is now ready for adoption by the House and, despite some criticisms, I should like to congratulate him on behalf of my group."
"An intensification of coastal shipping should have positive economic effects and a dynamic impact on employment in the coastal regions of the European Union, and above all in the least developed of them:"
"the necessary modernization of the fleet will revive the European shipbuilding industry, thereby preserving or even creating jobs in coastal regions; -moreover, an increase in the volume of turnover should result, and this will be of benefit to small and mediumsized ports as well as large seaports; -finally, an intensification of short sea shipping will above all benefit small and medium-sized firms in the maritime transport sector: it is mainly small shipping companies which are involved in the cargo sector, and a large percentage of the jobs on board vessels flying EU flags are concentrated in the short sea shipping sector.The Sindal report acknowledges that an intensification of coastal shipping must go hand in hand with a good deal of modernization, both of the fleet itself and of ports and their connections with the hinterland."
"At the same time, the text comes out in favour of free competition, which is generally to be welcomed, but against any aid measures, whether direct or indirect."
"This appears, at least to those of my colleagues who were actively involved in drafting the opinion on the Sindal report in the Committee on Regional Policy, to be somewhat at odds with the reality in many coastal regions."
"The Committee on Transport would therefore have been well advised to devote rather more attention to that committee's proposals, which were adopted with the strong backing of the PPE Group and the support of the socialist Members."
"Because - and here I have three questions to those present - is there any such thing as 'fair' competition between prosperous and less-developed coastal regions, or between large and small ports?"
"Can it really be said that some individual Member States or regional and local authorities, for example in Objective 1 regions, have as much budgetary scope for the necessary modernization work as their more prosperous counterparts?"
"Was it taken into account that coastal shipping offers major development prospects in regional and planning terms, particularly in the Atlantic and Mediterranean areas, as demonstrated by the case studies for the planning document 'Europe 2000+' ?"
"More account should be taken in future of such imbalances and different geographical circumstances, especially in the context of transport policy."
"After all, economic and social cohesion is one of the fundamental objectives of the European Union: the individual Community policies are committed to supporting this goal, and there is a broad consensus in the groups as to its importance."
"Finally, I have two further comments in support of a coherent European transport policy, as called for by most of the political groups:"
"it would have promoted safety on the high seas and the protection of coastal regions, which are of ecological importance as both residential and economic areas, if specific research or training measures had been called for in this sector: new, safe types of vessels and their handling, as well as portside logistical support for navigation, create a need here for accompanying measures; -lastly, it is strange, in view of the conciliation procedure currently under way concerning the trans-European transport networks, that the motion for a resolution fails to reiterate Parliament's appeal for short sea shipping to be included in the TEN guidelines."
"The Greens have voted in favour of the Sindal report."
"In comparison with rail and air transport, short sea shipping uses very little energy and is therefore less damaging to the environment."
"The geography of Europe being as it is, with its many coastlines, short sea shipping could and should be much more widely used, which makes it even more incomprehensible that it does not form part of the TENs, a situation which should be remedied immediately."
"My group has drawn attention to the rather surprising comparison made between road and rail transport in recital A and paragraph 6."
"These two are by no means developed and subsidized to the same extent."
"There is a risk that the poor working conditions in short sea shipping will be used as an excuse to bring further pressure to bear on working conditions in land transport, and for this reason I would again stress the importance of paragraph 19."
"Finally, my group was unable to support Mr Wijsenbeek's amendment, which would have reopened the debate on weights and dimensions."
"We were delighted to give our support to Amendment No 2, which is an excellent example of how short sea shipping and inland navigation can be combined."
"Gasòliba i Böhm report"
"I agree with the criticism in the report concerning the late arrival of the annual report and believe, like Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, that the Monetary Institute should submit regular interim reports to the EU Parliament and others."
"This is because the issue is one of the most important in the EU and one which affects all citizens of the Union."
"What I miss in the annual report is a proper analysis of how the policy being pursued affects ordinary people, as regards such things as the coordination of Member States' monetary policy, budget consolidation and the transition to EMU as a whole."
"The annual report should also get away from the usual economic terminology and be easier for ordinary people to read, explaining simply what the Institute is doing and how it affects the man or woman in the street."
"I oppose the introduction of a common currency in view of all the negative effects it will have."
"My goal of an ecologically sustainable society is not compatible with EMU."
"In view of the above I am voting against the report in the final vote."
"Referring to the national compromise and the Edinburgh agreement, the Danish social democrats naturally cannot support those elements of this report which run counter to Denmark's four reservations."
"Pérez Royo report"
"I am voting against all of this report by Mr Pérez Royo because it includes so much that I cannot support."
"It is primarily a question of the views expressed which pay homage to a common currency and the need for progress in the convergence process."
"On the other hand, I support the idea of a tax on currency transactions because it would reduce speculation considerably."
"Such a tax should be introduced by countries outside the EU as well as the EU Member States."
"The tax should, however, not be seen as a stage in the process leading to the introduction of the common currency; rather it should be introduced simply in order to reduce speculation."
"I find the totally uncritical praise of EMU, the convergence criteria and the schedule for those criteria totally incomprehensible."
"I am not against the national economies of the Member States being put in order but the cuts which are now resulting from the convergence policy should give cause for reconsideration."
"Rather than simply thinking in terms of the traditional economic objectives it is necessary to consider the new economic policy, the aim of which is an ecologically sustainable society."
"This objective is not compatible with the EMU project which must therefore be stopped."
"Referring to the national compromise and the Edinburgh agreement, the Danish social democrats naturally cannot support those elements of this report which run counter to Denmark's four reservations."
"Although it contains a number of good proposals, such as the tax on currency transactions, we are voting against the report because we are against the entire EMU project."
"The report contains many good proposals, for example in paragraph 4, which states that a tax on currency speculation would be an effective way of stabilising exchange rates."
"I am nevertheless abstaining because so many paragraphs of the report recommend completion of monetary union and the establishment of a new ERM."
"I believe that a new exchange rate mechanism will encourage speculation and could result in the same kind of economic disaster we experienced in 1992."
"I also believe that completion of monetary union at a time when the Union has almost 20 million unemployed is an economic gamble which could seriously backfire both socially and economically."
"This is why I have chosen to abstain."
"von Wogau report"
"Madam President, it is remarkable that in different contexts - including the reports which have already been debated today and the Von Wogau report - it is stated that there is a broad consensus in favour of EMU and the main principles involved in the introduction of the common currency, including an exchange rate mechanism."
"However, there can be no-one who does not know that outside the EU institutions there is considerable doubt about the splendid qualities of EMU, the schedule for EMU and the convergence criteria."
"This criticism comes from politicians, economists, bankers and trades unionists."
"Demonstrations in Belgium, France and Germany bear indisputable witness to the social unrest which the convergence criteria are causing among ordinary people."
"Naturally all countries must make every effort to pursue sound economic policies."
"However, this requires healthy development, not constant growth which adds to the growing environmental deficit."
"It also requires fair distribution of common resources and policies which prevent social exclusion and unemployment."
"With EMU, however, the EU has established an economic policy which puts price stability and balanced budgets above all else, which may entail cuts in public services and cause many more jobs to disappear."
"From a democratic point of view the European Central Bank is unacceptable."
"The Von Wogau report speaks of accountability but the truth is that it is impossible to impose accountability on the decision-makers."
"The six members of the European Central Bank's board cannot be removed in the course of the eight years for which they have been appointed."
"EMU is to be administered by experts over whom no political control will be possible."
"Economic and monetary union thus faces far too many unsolved problems and risks becoming a political owngoal, far removed from the real world and economic realities."
"As the idea of an economic and monetary union is basically a federal one and conflicts with our belief in the creation of a Europe of democracies, we will abstain from voting on this report."
"Allowing monetary policy to be determined by officials at the European Central Bank is not in accordance with our view that economic policy should be governed by the people through their elected representatives."
"On a separate point, it may be noted that during the membership negotiations Sweden made a unilateral declaration that we would decide for ourselves whether we would participate in EMU or not."
"The legal validity of this declaration is doubtful but the political view is that it is the Swedish people who will decide on EMU membership."
"As far as Sweden is concerned the matter has by no means been decided."
"As an opponent of the entire EMU project I am voting against this report by Mr Von Wogau."
"There are some good amendments, which I support, but they do not outweigh all the less satisfactory parts of the report which remain."
"I do not support the establishment of an exchange rate mechanism for the common currency in the present situation."
"Each country must bear responsibility for and be able to pursue its own economic policy, which takes into account the conditions in that particular country and the country's industrial structure."
"This will be made impossible by participation in EMU."
"It is naturally desirable that exchange rates fluctuate as little as possible."
"This is not only true with regard to the EU's Member States, however, but also with regard to those countries outside the Union, of which there are far more."
"The report is permeated by the demand that the convergence criteria should be implemented."
"In view of the massive cuts which many of the EU Member States are now being forced to make or will make, there should be some pause for thought."
"Rather than fostering the expansion of social welfare EMU policy is now resulting in the dismantling of the welfare system in country after country."
"This is not a policy I can support."
"As I oppose the entire EMU project I am voting against the Von Wogau report."
"I followed the debates this morning carefully."
"At no point was there any mention of the fears of the citizens of the Member States with regard to the single currency."
"Our political leaders, the Commission in Brussels, deliberately encourage confusion between a single currency and a common currency."
"Clearly, the people of Europe find it hard to tell the difference."
"For example, if you talk to French people about a European currency, or indeed a single currency, they think you mean a common currency, and seem to be in favour of it."
"But if you clearly explain to them what is at stake, they are against it."
"When they realize that the introduction of the euro will mean the disappearance of their national currency, they oppose it - and they are right."
"Why?"
"The people of Europe have a deep emotional, psychological and practical attachment to their national currencies."
"Depriving them of a reference point as essential as their national currency would undermine them psychologically."
"In the words of General de Gaulle, the currency links the citizen to the nation."
"I voted against the von Wogau report because, as a convinced European, I believe that Europe must not be built on a massive lie."
"Since Maastricht, there has been a growing suspicion on the part of people in Europe that partisan economic interests are increasingly taking hold of the process of building Europe."
"In this crisis of credibility in the EU, those who had been relying on the monitoring and corrective powers of the European Parliament have been deeply disappointed for months now."
"It is becoming increasingly apparent that the convergence criteria for monetary union are a vehicle for the destruction of welfare standards in the Member States."
"The pressure to achieve the criteria simultaneously and as soon as possible has begun to have a recessionary effect and is leading to a sharp increase in unemployment."
"Yet people in the European Union are waiting in vain for the EU institutions to reform these criteria, which have long since become socially irresponsible."
"A few days ago the President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, drew attention once again to the Member States' responsibility for pursuing an active policy on employment, but he cynically failed to mention that these EMU convergence criteria are precisely what has eliminated the necessary political room for manoeuvre."
"This inconsistency is heightened by the lack of any social initiatives at European level."
"In view of this policy, which is severely disrupting the social peace in Europe, it is the duty of the European Parliament to speak out strongly in favour of the development of a social and ecological Union, and against a policy of stultifying economic liberalism."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Fisheries"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0189/96 by Mrs Péry, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament (COM(94)0335 - C4-0086/94) on the crisis in the Community's fishing industry; -A4-0133/96 by Mr Arias Cañete, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the problems of the fisheries sector in the NAFO zone; -A4-0172/96 by Mr Arias Cañete, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the amended proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(96)0117 - C4-0299/96-95/0252(CNS)) laying down certain conservation and control measures in the Antarctic; -A4-0169/96 by Mr Kofoed, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(95)0670 - C4-0033/96-95/0338(CNS)) amending for the sixth time Regulation (EEC) No 1866/86 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating the crisis in the Community's fishing industry."
"This economic, social and ecological crisis is affecting the entire sector."
"For a number of years now, we have been obliged to cut back on catch authorizations, apply more effective controls, reduce fleet sizes and step up structural and social accompanying measures."
"At the same time, although the amounts of fish caught have decreased - in my own country, for example - many species have suffered the effects of international market forces."
"In certain regions of Europe, fresh fish prices have fallen by an average of 25 %."
"' Blue Europe' is a fragile common policy because it is incomplete."
"All Europe's coastal regions are looking to the future with concern."
"That is why I felt it essential to begin this report by calling on the Commission and the Council to map out some clear prospects and to show a willingness to ensure a maritime future for the countries of the Union."
"By chance, Commissioner, our respective timetables meant that we learnt your response a few days after this report went to print and after our seminar in Quimper."
"Consequently, our committee has not yet been able to debate the fourth multiannual guidance plan which you are submitting."
"Certainly, we were expecting a message of vision, but we were also expecting one of confidence."
"However, seeking to reduce fishing opportunities by an average of 40 % in five years will, as you well know, not only mean the scrapping of large numbers of vessels, but also lead to the certain death of several ports which are already heavily in debt as a result of their efforts to modernize."
"This is a very hard blow to the economic and social activity of the whole sector."
"I am convinced that we must now display not only vigilance and firmness, but also imagination and political will as regards a number of new proposals which are capable of restoring confidence to the sector."
"I shall restrict myself to dealing with three key points, concerning resources, the markets and structural policies."
"As far as resources are concerned, we are aware that sacrifices will still have to be made."
"So let us adopt stricter technical measures which genuinely make it possible for resources to be renewed."
"We refer in the report to the use of square meshes and more selective fishing gear, and to the protection of zones in which juveniles are concentrated."
"We propose the introduction of biological rest periods when species are particularly under threat."
"However, Commissioner, the Fisheries Committee also refers to the need for financial compensation."
"The Commission's reply will be that the common fisheries policy does not provide for this type of funding, save in very exceptional cases. 'No support for incomes' , you will say."
"I do not believe that I make populist speeches very often: I will not conceal the difficulties, but I cannot accept that the sacrifices should be one-sided."
"If we have the money to compensate for the destruction of a vessel, then we should also be able to find the money to conserve resources."
"In order to produce maximum effect, all these technical measures must be underpinned by constant and increasingly in-depth scientific research and far more rigorous controls."
"Hence it is essential not only to encourage those directly involved in the sector to assume their responsibilities, but also to equip ourselves with new means of surveillance."
"I know that I am wrong to put forward ideas which are not financially neutral, Commissioner, but this will allow us to gauge if there is a genuine political will in the European Union and its Member States to maintain a competitive European fisheries sector."
"With regard to the markets, I should like to point out firstly that the internal European fisheries market is heavily dependent on imports, both for consumption and supply to the processing industry."
"When the common fisheries policy was launched, the creation of a free market, a market which is open to international competition, was the choice that was made; and the crisis has affected the markets, the auctions and the distribution sectors."
"The industry as a whole must improve its systems of information and communication."
"The modernizing of the industry is vital in today's world."
"We also believe that it is important to involve producers more closely in the distribution sector, as well as to exploit the quality and the origin of fisheries products."
"However, Commissioner, I do not believe that the 'blue Europe' of 2002 will be able to make do with such a weak 'market' aspect."
"I am firmly convinced that it will be necessary to establish a more binding Community framework - compulsory withdrawal prices, preference prices which are better respected - and to put in place a financial instrument to help fresh fish producers' organizations in times of serious crisis and when there is a collapse in market prices."
"Here too, I know that you will say: ' But that is a form of income support!'"
"Time will not allow me to elaborate on my third key point, which relates to structural policies."
"This is undoubtedly the aspect of the common fisheries policy for which the Member States and the Union have provided themselves with the most extensive resources - and so much the better - through the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance and the PESCA programme, which we wish to see implemented as a genuine 'SEA LEADER' ."
"We also give our backing to your achievements in respect of early retirement measures - although we wish that the Member States would play the game too, when they know that the Union is already co-financing these measures by up to 50 %."
"This social dimension cannot be passed over in silence: it exists and must be adequately supported."
"I have already overrun my speaking time, Commissioner."
"I would simply say, in conclusion, that we shall be equal to the task in terms of vigilance and firmness."
"We shall need courage too, but we shall discuss this guidance plan again."
"To my mind, it is unacceptable, both with regard to production and the sector as a whole; we must take more imaginative measures, and certainly give more financial support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to present the European Parliament's own-initiative report on the situation of the Community fleet in the NAFO zone and, within this context, fisheries relations between the European Union and Canada."
"It is well known that since the creation of NAFO in 1978, the European Union's fisheries relations with Canada have passed through times of extreme tension."
"These relations, especially since 1984, have been characterized by regular clashes over fishing rights in the waters of the North Atlantic. One of the clearest examples of this - as pointed out by Professor Mallou - is Canada's achievement in fixing the cod TAC in division 3NO at zero for the years 1995 and 1996, without any sound scientific data."
"The most recent fisheries conflict between the European Union and Canada - and unfortunately the one which perhaps gained the most international attention - was that popularly known as the 'Halibut War' ."
"The facts are well known to everyone, but perhaps now is the time - with the benefit of distance - to examine in depth the reasons which led to this conflict."
"Firstly, we must look back to the meeting of the NAFO Fisheries Commission of February 1995, when a TAC of 27 000 tonnes of Greenland halibut was distributed, only 3400 tonnes of which was allocated to the Community fleet, whilst 16 300 tonnes was reserved for Canada."
"Parliament expressed its regret in a resolution at the action of the Community delegation, since for the first time a TAC had been established at a level lower than that recommended by the NAFO Scientific Committee, which had proposed an indicative limit of 40 000 tonnes."
"Furthermore, it should be remembered that in 1994, the Canadian Parliament unilaterally adopted a law on the protection of coastal fishing waters, granting powers of control beyond the 200-mile limit. This law was subsequently invoked as the legal basis for making unjustified seizures."
"A number of conclusions can be drawn from what I have described."
"The first, and Parliament has already criticized this fact, is that the European Union is inadequately represented in NAFO, both in the Scientific Committee - whose composition is extremely unbalanced, since Canada has far more representatives than any other country - and in the Fisheries Commission. In NAFO, as in other international fisheries organizations, there is the problem of the weakness of the European Union, which despite the fact that it represents many states, has only one vote."
"This is an objective problem to which attention must be drawn: the stronger the European Union becomes, as new members join, the weaker it becomes in certain international organizations, because it only has one vote."
"Secondly, Parliament believes that there is a lack of a genuine Community policy of scientific research within NAFO, and there have been cases in which zero TACs have been adopted without adequate scientific data being provided and without the European Union being able to respond."
"Thirdly, the Canadian legislation which allows the authorities to carry out controls and seizures outside the country's territorial waters continues to remain in force, despite the fact that, following the events which unfolded after the seizure of the 'Estai' , the NAFO mutual inspection programme, which sets out the obligations of the contracting parties as regards inspection and surveillance, was modified substantially and at great budgetary cost."
"Notwithstanding these controversial issues, Parliament takes the view that the prime objective, both for the European Union and for Canada, must be to avoid future clashes and take advantage of the welcome conclusion of the bilateral agreement of April 1995 in order to launch a new phase of understanding and cooperation."
"However, there are difficulties which it will not be easy to overcome: firstly, Canada's retention of its unilateral legislation; and, secondly, the fact that the bilateral agreement which was negotiated with great difficulty in 1992 - and which Parliament supported, with considerable reservations, because it realized that there was a need for an effort of rapprochement - has still not been ratified by Canada."
"Consequently, the fact that Canada has softened its hostile attitude with a measure limited to opening up its ports is not, in our view, enough to allow a comprehensive framework of normal relations to be established."
"We believe that the Community must endeavour to improve these relations, while always remembering that the defence of the Community's fishing opportunities must be a cornerstone of Community action, and that international relations need to be based on the principles of equality, cooperation and solidarity."
"We feel that the agreement on the conservation and management of transzonal fish populations which was adopted on 4 August 1995 in New York will provide a useful framework for improving the situation, as long as it is implemented in an intelligent and balanced way."
"We trust in the Commissioner's ability to ensure that this is so, and that the agreement is ratified in circumstances which make it possible to achieve stability in the Union's fisheries relations with Canada, so that the incidents of the past are forgotten once and for all, and we can cooperate as the friends we are in a rational and normal commercial environment."
"I now have the honour of presenting, on behalf of the Fisheries Committee, the report on conservation measures in the Antarctic."
"This report was adopted unanimously by our committee, since the aim of the Commission proposal is to amend the legal provisions in force, clarifying the existing regulation, the clarity of which has undoubtedly been diminished by repeated modifications."
"Similarly, the proposal seeks to incorporate into Community legislation the provisions adopted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources at its meetings in Hobart of 8 November 1994 and 3 November 1995."
"Finally, it sets out, in a Community act, the commitments entered into by the Community as a result of its accession to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources by virtue of the Council decision of 1981."
"Our committee approves the Commission proposal unanimously, but wishes to make a number of observations in this context."
"Firstly, once again, it is to be regretted that Parliament was consulted by the Council by means of the letter of 4 December 1995 - seven months, that is, after a number of the proposal's provisions were due to enter in force for all the contracting parties. In these circumstances, the consultation of Parliament was clearly an absolutely pointless and symbolic exercise, highlighting the need to continue working together to improve the existing procedures, so that Parliament can deliver its opinion in good time and before provisions enter into legal force."
"With a view to the future, therefore, the Committee on Fisheries has drawn up an amendment whereby the Commission will be required to inform the European Parliament in advance of the changes it intends to make to the regulation and of the measures taken in order to implement the recommendations adopted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources."
"Secondly, the Committee on Fisheries believes that the ecological balance of the Antarctic - a wilderness which remains virtually unexploited - must be preserved as far as possible."
"To this end, we are calling for a report to be drawn up - if budgetary resources allow - on the impact of catches on marine and bird species in the area, as well as requesting the submission of an annual report on the assessment of fishing activities in the Antarctic and the strengthening of surveillance measures."
"With these comments, the Committee on Fisheries, as I said before, approves the Commission proposal unanimously."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of establishing the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission in 1974 was to create an institution in which the countries bordering the Baltic Sea could jointly take responsibility for the management of fishery resources in those waters."
"Its decisions were to be based on advice from biologists, with the countries' own biologists also taking part in the IBSFC."
"This form of cooperation has worked extremely well, though there were some difficulties during the communist regimes in the Baltic States and Poland."
"Conservation policy has been based on the usual principles: an assessment of catches and the state of juvenile stocks, with quotas being allocated accordingly to the various countries."
"In addition, of course, there are the other technical measures such as mesh size and so on."
"The report which is before the House today concerns the approval or rejection of a decision which was taken last year and applies to 1996."
"In its report, the Committee on Fisheries criticizes the fact that we are being consulted so late in the day."
"I hope that the Commissioner will try to ensure in future that these decisions are forwarded to us somewhat earlier."
"It would also be a good idea if the Commission were to invite some members of the Committee on Fisheries as observers to the preliminary negotiations which begin in Warsaw in September."
"It is naturally not the task of the European Parliament to act as an administrator, but in our consultative role this would surely be a good idea, because Parliament could then have a better basis on which to take the proper legislative decision in due course."
"In my report, there are one or two proposals for the forthcoming negotiations in the IBSFC."
"What I have tabled in the report are amendments for the future."
"Amongst other things, they seek to introduce conservation measures which are different from those used in the past."
"Thus I am proposing the introduction of a limit on the engine power of vessels, such as 400 horsepower for vessels fishing cod and salmon."
"The reason why I am making the proposal now is that the Commission should be aware that Poland, the Baltic States and Russia are in the process of modernizing their fleets."
"If these fleets are modernized to include large vessels which are too effective, it will not be possible for fish stocks in the Baltic to be maintained."
"I am also proposing this because the fisheries policy which has been pursued in the Baltic Sea has not produced an increase in fishery resources."
"The stocks of cod, for example, are even lower than they were in 1984."
"I also have something to say as regards the quota policy."
"This involves a mass of control measures, imposes constraints on fishermen and criminalizes fisheries to some extent."
"It is also impossible to produce correct figures on what is not being fished, on what is not being reported under the quotas, so we have no idea how much we are talking about, and the biologists' models for what quotas should be adopted in the future will not be correct either."
"I am therefore proposing that a limit on engine power should be introduced, and if people want to have quotas, then give the large vessels quotas for a certain period and a certain quantity, and let all the other boats under 400 horsepower fish without quotas."
"I think I can promise the Commissioner that fish stocks would not fall, but on the contrary would increase."
"In this way, the wind and the weather would have an effect on when fishing took place, as opposed to now, when the big vessels fish in all weathers."
"So the fish are never left in peace in these areas."
"Furthermore, as a suggestion to the Commission, some of the areas should perhaps be protected during the spawning period, so that there is no fishing at that time."
"If you are a hunter, you do not hunt game during the breeding season, and the same principle should in fact be introduced in fisheries."
"Finally, I should like to say that I hope we can have a debate on how this instrument can be applied."
"I am not a supporter of quotas, because they criminalize fishermen, even if the aim of conserving fishery resources is a very good one."
"So I do not think that our fisheries policy should be based on the Machiavellian idea that the end justifies the means."
"The means cannot be to turn people into criminals."
"I should like to thank the Commission and the members of the Committee on Fisheries for their cooperation."
"Mr President, today's debate is an important one and one reason for this is that, on three different issues, we have had the impression - and, I believe, concrete proof - that our own Committee on Fisheries has proposals of its own, having drawn up specific documents and had, for some time now, the real technical capacity to tackle proposals relating to reform of the common fisheries policy."
"Well then, Mr President, we need reform of the common fisheries policy, and are very much persuaded that the texts that have been submitted represent a step in that direction."
"We are hoping for a reform that takes account of new environmental balances, that seeks to retain employment in the sector and also takes account of the capacity needed to meet consumer requirements."
"The Socialist Group will be tabling its own text officially, on Thursday, in this Chamber."
"We would take this opportunity to invite the representatives of the Commission to take part in our initiative here, in Strasbourg, on Thursday."
"The document put forward by Mrs Péry is a very important one, the product of the substantial experience she has gained in this sector."
"It in fact contains a number of very important and innovative elements: firstly, as I said a few moments ago, the fisheries sector must take account of environmental balances but it must also be able to retain an adequate market position."
"Production and market have therefore to be substantially integrated, and that can be achieved through technological innovation and the capacity to be able to handle increasingly large transactions which are both of Community origin and guarantee fishermen an adequate price, as a result of the role that the fishermen's organizations can play to an increasingly greater extent as an important point of reference."
"We shall also have to discuss again the consolidated arrangements, so to speak, for fisheries ownership."
"We favour an approach here whereby fishermen participate in ownership; we are therefore also in favour of local multi-ownership experiments which are becoming a point of reference and, in that sense, we are in favour of a form of integrated management between multi-ownership and the local institutions."
"We are also very much in favour of involving the local institutions and are also, naturally, persuaded that the fisheries policy should be a common policy but that the regional and local authorities should be associated with it because of the fundamental role they can play, including in relation to the integrated management of coastal fishing."
"This also offers a way of eliminating the over-fishing that has occurred in recent years."
"From that point of view, we consider that the programming document is important and when we have an opportunity of discussing it in official fora, we shall look at the substance in greater detail."
"For the moment, we regret the fact that we have yet to be involved as Members of Parliament."
"Mr President, I regard the fact that a substantial debate is taking place this afternoon on the subject of fisheries as a sign of the importance of Europe's future fisheries policy."
"Today's reports relate to waters from the Baltic Sea through the Atlantic to the Antarctic, showing that the fisheries crisis is a worldwide problem."
"It is therefore right that we should take a global approach to the problems and how to solve them."
"The way in which we manage our fish stocks will show whether or not we are capable of exploiting worldwide food resources on a sustainable basis."
"That is the message which we are receiving from institutions such as the FAO; it is the unequivocal message coming now from environmental organizations such as the Worldwide Fund for Nature, organizations which have begun to join forces with some of the world's largest multinational food-producing companies."
"The Member States and the fishing industry must heed these authoritative voices."
"The seas are being overfished: none of our waters will survive if they continue to be fished so intensively."
"There is only one answer - fewer fishing vessels and less fishing effort, and Mrs Péry clearly endorses this approach."
"The fishing sector will not emerge from its current crisis unless, on the basis of realistic calculations, the European Union fleets are finally adjusted to match the food resources available in EU waters and beyond."
"Restructuring must be accompanied by socio-economic measures."
"Even if we cannot offer all fishermen jobs at sea, we should not abandon them."
"We must find them alternatives, either in the fishing industry or in another sector."
"A team of Community experts, led by the Danish scientist Hans Larsen, has recently made an assessment of fish stocks, and they too have drawn attention to the critical state of affairs."
"Mrs Bonino, you have had the courage to present a proposal which is based on a scientific recommendation that the fishing effort should be reduced by 40 %, as Parliament called for back in 1990."
"Since 1990, the Fisheries Ministers have approved reductions of 20 %, 25 % and even 0 % - depending on the type of fishery, and a further reduction in tonnage is being made between 1992 and 1996 - but not as much as 40 %."
"We are calling on the ministers to hold a credible, down-to-earth discussion on the basis of the scientific report and Mrs Bonino's proposals."
"The House has taken the initiative of concentrating on fisheries today, and we have used this opportunity to bring forward some ideas on how to consolidate the common fisheries policy."
"Now it is up to the Member States to initiate the action which is required to save the fishing industry in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, it is timely for the European Parliament to be dealing at the same time with the general fishery crisis and the NAFO zone crisis, which epitomizes the former."
"These are issues that must be tackled by implicating the European Union's political will and clear cooperation by the Member States."
"Some European Union countries tend to ignore the real significance of the fishery sector for the whole European economy."
"Yet it should be pointed out that in peripheral maritime countries fishery accounts for much economic activity and many jobs."
"Take the example of NAFO."
"My country has been fishing in that zone since the 15th century, cod in particular, the historic reason for which Portugal is now the world's biggest market for that fish. Portugal's accession to the CFP and the NAFO crisis have lead, in four years, to a 70 % reduction in the fishing fleet and the direct or indirect loss of some 12000 jobs."
"I can state here that Portuguese shipowners intend to continue fishing responsibly in order to conserve stocks."
"They therefore agree with moves to strengthen taxation and controls carried out by the European Union."
"But it is difficult to understand why these controls are not carried out so intensely on ships belonging to nonCommunity countries which have signed the Convention."
"Another aspect which we should pay special attention to is that of scientific research which carries out on-going analyses of stocks and changes in their patterns."
"It is difficult to see why the European Union should have delegated to Canada scientific research in areas as important as 2J, 3K, 3L and 3NO, knowing full well that the interests of both parties clash over this."
"This research should also be extended to Community waters, taking into account information supplied by fishermen and producers."
"Take the case of sardines."
"When the Commissioner tells us that we must cut catches by 40 %, apparently on the basis of data she was supplied with - possibly by my country - the fishermen say that this decision is unfounded given that the stocks are still healthy and have just moved to other areas."
"This can lead to conflicts that affect the credibility of our institutions and the Union itself."
"As is stated explicitly in the documents we are discussing, agreements with third countries should continue to deserve the support and full weight of the European Union given their importance for supplies and safeguarding production."
"We think, however, that every time that association agreements are concluded with third countries - in which, apart from Community funding fishery products are exempted from customs duties - we should negotiate fishery quotas for Community producers that correspond to the amount of non-received customs duties."
"I commend the value of these texts and think that they are a good starting-point for dealing with the whole problem of fishery."
"Mr President, when the Commission report on the crisis in the fishing industry came out in 1994, as Mrs Pery has reminded us so well in her report, it was primarily about prices."
"Since then the fishing industry has been far more in crisis because of the biological aspect of depletion of stocks and the failure of the management system of the common fisheries policy to address any of the problems and to work effectively within the industry."
"What do we have in terms of a solution?"
"First, we have to scrap the common fisheries policy as it stands at the moment."
"I am not in favour of renationalizing it."
"That would be an extremely bad idea but we need to scrap it as it exists."
"We need to make sure that we reduce this constant friction between scientific evidence, the fishing industry, Member States and the Commission."
"The only way to do that is to push power downwards, to manage fish stocks around the areas of the fisheries rather than around the states which surround these areas and rather than from an inland city of Belgium centrally managing the whole system."
"That will not work."
"In the meantime we have to address the matter of quota hopping and, although we have had many discussions with the Commissioner and I welcome her constructive comments, we have to move this matter on."
"We cannot get a sensible solution within the current legislative framework."
"We have to look to derogations from the Treaty to solve the problem."
"In terms of the 40 % cuts we are discussing at the moment, there is no chance of getting this through sensibly and I condemn the Council of Ministers for the way it is treating the matter, without at the same time offering positive alternatives to the industry as part of the solution."
"With regard to Canada, I am delighted that in the Committee on Fisheries we made this report less antiCanadian than it had been."
"We now have access to ports in Canada."
"We need to sign the EU-Canada action plan and we need to make the objection procedure much better."
"I welcome Mr Kindermann's amendments on that as well."
"Mr President, with regard to the report on the crisis in the fishing industry, I should like to make a number of comments."
"While we were working on this report - and here I would congratulate Mrs Péry on her efforts - the Commission drew up its proposal on the restructuring of the fleet during the period 1997-2002."
"It is true that the fisheries sector is suffering a crisis caused by the scarcity of resources, to which the liberalization of trade, the reduction of tariff protection and the growing difficulty of access to other fishing grounds are not unconnected."
"However, we believe that the Commission has drawn up proposals which it is difficult to accept."
"The problems affecting the fishing industry cannot be resolved solely by dismantling the Community fleet."
"There is a whole series of problems which cannot be ignored, and which in my view are explained quite well in Mrs Péry's report."
"For example, the social dimension of the common fisheries policy has developed favourably in recent times, but is not commensurate with the large-scale adjustments proposed by the Commission under MGP IV."
"Also on Mrs Péry's report, and with many doubts in my mind, I should like to express the following reservations. The report advocates the establishment of 'prices and markets' instruments and mechanisms similar to those of the common agricultural policy, but I do not feel that these are problems which can be addressed in a mechanical way."
"Given the Community's capacity for self-supply and the present level of tariff protection, application of a prices and markets policy raises difficulties, and could perhaps lead to undesirable effects in terms of the conservation of resources."
"As for PESCA, it is an initiative which has produced few results. The problem is that if we wish to apply the LEADER model, access to the alternatives envisaged under that model will perhaps be far more limited."
"I say this too with serious doubts in my mind."
"I should just like to underline the weakness of the European Union, which is sometimes the fault of the Union itself, and sometimes the fault of the positions adopted by the different Member States. And I would say to Mr Kofoed that we understand and agree with his comments concerning quotas."
"Mr President, the four reports being discussed today concern fisheries in widely different areas of the globe: the Antarctic, the Baltic Sea, eastern Canada and here in Europe."
"This demonstrates the wide extent and influence of EU fleets."
"The common theme running through them all is the effect that the excessive amount of fishing capacity has on European fisheries."
"The Péry report on the crisis in the fisheries sector quite correctly points out that there are several problems that affect the industry, but surely the most important is the fact that there are too many boats chasing too few fish."
"This is probably the most important issue that faces the EU this year as it prepares the multi-annual guidance programme - the fourth one - to reduce the size of the fleets."
"It is certainly the most contentious political issue."
"Everyone accepts that many of the EU stocks have been over-exploited."
"The most effective single action that the European Union can take to resolve this problem is to decrease the size of its fleet."
"If this is not done, and done very soon, then the crisis in the sector can only escalate."
"The ones who would suffer most would be the small boat owners, those with a small economic base and very little political clout but who, in fact, actually provide the most employment."
"The decisions on how to reduce the fleet should consider not just the status of the stocks the fleet fishes but also other impacts of the fleet."
"For example, some gears have a higher by-catch than others or inflict more severe damage on the sea bottom."
"Environmental impacts of gear are a very important factor."
"Similarly, in terms of the employment generated, preference should be given to vessels which provide most jobs relative to the amount of fish they catch."
"In summary, the fleet reduction is urgently needed and it must be vigorously implemented."
"The Green Group submitted amendments on this issue in committee but they were not accepted so we have re-submitted them to plenary."
"I hope that they pass this time."
"For unless there is a rigorous programme implemented right away then the next report on the sector may well be its obituary."
"I was glad to hear Mrs Péry say that she will vigorously support efforts by the Commission."
"So I hope that she will support our amendment now."
"The issue regarding the Baltic concerns the adoption of a closed season for salmon."
"Whilst stocks of salmon in the Baltic have been decimated by habitat destruction and over-fishing - including the use of long drift nets - the recent Lassen report on fishing capacity in the EU actually recommends the complete closure of the fishery, so a simple seasonal closure is totally insufficient."
"The waters east of Canada have seen fishing vessels from Spain, France and England for hundreds of years."
"They used to be one of the world's greatest fishing grounds, which is probably why fishermen went so far under difficult conditions to fish there."
"But in the 1980s the bloated size of the European fleets forced the EU to claim unilateral quotas on several stocks there."
"It is unacceptable behaviour in a multilateral convention to regulate fishing."
"These unilateral quotas contributed to the obliteration of some of the stocks in eastern Canada; I say 'contributed to' for the responsibility does not actually lie with the EU alone."
"Canada has shown that it can actually wipe out its stocks without any help from anyone else."
"But here the European fleets did help."
"As regards the Antarctic, the European Union has no real fishing interests, at least on paper."
"However, some vessels fishing down there are European vessels flying other flags and established under joint ventures."
"So the long arm of the European Union's excess capacity reaches out even as far as there."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Péry on covering a large amount of ground and putting things very tactfully, but nothing that she says in her tactful way can disguise the scope of the crisis - not just the crisis in stocks and management but also the crisis of confidence of our fishermen right across Europe."
"This presents a very real challenge and difficulty for the Commissioner."
"I think we should look at ways in which we can bridge the gap."
"I congratulate Mrs Péry."
"I should also like to associate myself with the points made by Mr Baldarelli, Mrs Langenhagen, Mr Girão Pereira and Mr Teverson."
"We are all facing a common problem together."
"But we have to find a solution so that we can say to our fishermen: this is a solution; it is not being imposed on you by Brussels, but it is in your interests."
"The key thing is not to talk about imposing 40 % cuts - which everybody can then blame Brussels for - but to say: how would you tackle the problem yourselves?"
"That is where the decentralized management which has been proposed by several speakers is absolutely fundamental."
"At the moment the fishermen, certainly in Scotland, are terrified that somehow the foreigners will come and take all their fish and then go away again and they will be left with nothing."
"Whatever you say, they are apprehensive that they do not really own the fisheries resources off their coast."
"Therefore, the way forward - I am quite convinced as are many colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries - is to have a decentralized management system so that the fishermen in the particular sea, whether it is the Baltic, the North Sea, the Adriatic or whatever, whose livelihoods are at stake and whose descendants will benefit if they conserve things, will take responsibility."
"At the same time there are things that have to be done right across Europe on an equal basis."
"One of the gripes is that inspectors, for example, do not apply the rules universally across Europe."
"We have to address that to make sure that the same standard, the same misery, where misery has to be applied, is applied to everybody."
"Then people would begin to see some justice in the system and we could address all the other burning questions - such as quota-hopping and so on, which I do not have time to go into - to make sure that we have a common fisheries policy which is sustainable and which will be supported."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Péry on her thorough and discerning analysis of the causes of the serious crisis currently affecting the Community's fishing industry."
"Unfortunately, the Commission communication on which this report is based fails to put forward any proposals commensurate with the scale of the crisis."
"It recommends a policy which is more stopgap than imaginative, more resigned than determined."
"This policy seems to be based on a fatalistic premise: that the disappearance of the Community fishing fleet, overseen by the CFP, is inevitable."
"However, Europe's fishermen are expecting a different message."
"As the elected representative of a maritime region in the west of France, I can assure the House that they are expecting us to send them a message of hope, telling them that the profession they have chosen is not doomed, that it may be suffering a crisis, but that they can trust in its future and that their children will be able to practise it."
"That is the message which I propose we send to all the communities throughout Europe which depend on fishing, by adopting the amendments that I have tabled on behalf of my group."
"Firstly, all the measures aimed at reducing the size of our fleets are the consequence of the almost total opening-up of the Community market to imports from third countries, whose methods, as the House well knows, are frequently at odds with our legitimate concern to conserve fishery resources."
"This issue is not addressed in the Commission communication, although it is a matter of urgency to restore the confidence of our fishermen in the conservation efforts that are required of them, above all by establishing a protective European framework in the face of imports from third countries."
"Also, surely the mechanisms of market support should be replaced by a more pro-active policy, for example one which establishes the compulsory levying of a countervailing charge on the import of species found in the Community, amounting to the difference between the import price and the current guide price, which could be used to promote the fishing industry in the developing countries?"
"Finally, it also seems essential to me to involve the sector more closely in the management of resources, in particular by giving it responsibility for managing the resources of specific fisheries, on the basis of historical rights, within the framework of decentralized regional conferences."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in her report, Mrs Péry analyses in detail the causes of the crisis in the fishing sector and attempts to provide some solutions. Unfortunately, those solutions are not enough to halt the decline in the French and Community fishing industries."
"The diagnosis is correct, but the proposed remedies are quite inadequate to cure such a serious illness."
"And the findings are correct, particularly when it comes to condemning the deregulation of the world market without an ounce of security, the serious disturbances resulting from unfair competition, and the global downward pressure on prices."
"On the other hand, the solutions proposed are not equal to the challenges to be faced."
"Mrs Bonino, as the Commissioner for fisheries, wishes to cut the Community fishing fleet by 40 %, to scrap hundreds of vessels and force thousands of fishermen into retirement."
"In a word, she wishes to decommission our fishing fleet in order to leave the field open for predators who use the GATT agreements for their benefit alone."
"We are told, rightly or wrongly, that there is overcapacity in the fishing industry, that fish stocks are becoming dramatically scarce, that juveniles are inadequately protected, that the level of marine pollution is alarming, and that the use of certain fishing devices and practices is wrong."
"At the same time, however, Mrs Péry considers it essential to modernize the fleet with vessels using more selective fishing gear, and also wishes to dismantle tariff and customs protection."
"There is a blatant contradiction here."
"As with the CAP, as with the disaster-stricken industries, there is no wish to see the real causes of the crisis or to tackle them."
"Who but us will have the courage to say that destructive free-market policies and the globalization of trade desired by GATT and the Europe of Maastricht are placing our fishing fleet at the mercy of third countries which respect no rules and sell their fish at dumping prices, thereby jeopardizing our producers' organizations?"
"In ten years, our dependence on fish imports has increased by 30 %; and the processing industry depends almost entirely on imported fish."
"I wish to stress - because, I too, like my colleague Mr Souchet, am the elected representative of a maritime region in the west of France - that there is now a need to set clear priorities for the entire sector."
"What are these priorities?"
"The promotion of non-industrial coastal fishing; the application of minimum import prices; compensation for fishermen for loss of income in the event of a fall in prices; and the strengthening of controls, especially on third-country vessels fishing in Community waters."
"We should also like to see more low-interest loans and debt-relief for fishermen; the reduction of port charges; the amendment of the common customs tariff, which does not allow the principle of Community preference to be guaranteed; the restoration of quality by means of a labelling policy and better exploitation of fresh fish; and the improvement of the links between research, training and the profession."
"Yes, France's fishing industry still has a future, but it is not the fourth multiannual guidance programme which will restore confidence to 16 500 French fishermen."
"They need to be listened to, supported and defended."
"This is the decision that has been taken by our group, whose chairman, it should be remembered, is the son of a fisherman who was killed at sea."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am only speaking about Mr Arias Cañete's report on the problems of the fisheries sector in the NAFO regulatory zone."
"Although this is a very thorough and open-minded report, my group has some difficulties with it, and that is not because it is so openly critical of the Canadians at various points."
"In our view, this criticism is mostly justified."
"However, the report focuses too narrowly on the maximizing of fishing opportunities and fails to take account of some important aspects which should certainly have been addressed in an own-initiative report of this kind."
"I would firstly mention the monitoring arrangements: instead of dismissing the monitoring arrangements contained in the bilateral fisheries agreement of 17 April 1995 between the European Union and Canada as discriminatory and too costly, its innovative aspects should have been given greater prominence."
"It is true that the new inspection arrangements are costly, but they are obviously working and have, above all, helped to defuse the situation."
"Far fewer infringements have been detected than before, and so the potential for conflict between the parties to the agreement has been much diminished."
"It is also questionable whether different arrangements - as called for in the report - really would be more effective, or whether they might ultimately dilute monitoring practice."
"To my mind, on-the-spot inspections still remain the most effective way of monitoring catches and the type of gear being used."
"Satellite surveillance cannot replace these inspections, but only complement them in order to determine the location of vessels, as is in fact stipulated in the NAFO monitoring arrangements."
"The relatively high cost of carrying out such measures should be regarded as the price to be paid for dwindling fish stocks and for past neglect."
"In any event, we should like the existing NAFO monitoring arrangements to be recognized as an improvement in terms of the conservation of stocks, thereby helping to safeguard fishing effort in the future."
"Another very important aspect which is also omitted from the report concerns the decision-making procedure in the NAFO Fisheries Commission."
"Those in the know agree that the main reason for the appalling state of fish stocks in the NAFO zone is the fact that the NAFO decisions on management and conservation measures are not binding."
"The scope for raising objections has undermined all the measures, and any party dissatisfied with the catch quota allotted to it has routinely been able to award itself higher catch quotas."
"For my group, therefore, the abandonment of this objection procedure is the key to further progress in fisheries management in the NAFO zone."
"Unless this happens, in our opinion, there would in fact be little point in putting any of the other demands into effect."
"What, for instance, would be the use of the rapporteur's call for a more balanced composition of the NAFO Scientific Committee, or for a voting system in NAFO which is more satisfactory to the Union, when in a borderline case another party which is outvoted can raise an objection to certain management measures, thereby triggering the next conflict?"
"While it is true that my group's request does not correspond to the currently accepted international principles, it would nevertheless be very appropriate in a report which in several respects takes issue with those principles."
"One need only look at the proposals concerning the voting system in international organizations."
"Also, our request is by no means out of place, since the UN agreement on the conservation and management of straddling stocks and discrete stocks explicitly obliges coastal states and countries engaged in deep-sea fishing to cooperate in laying down conservation and management measures."
"My group has tabled a number of amendments reflecting our concerns, and it is vital for them to be adopted if we are to support the report."
"I therefore ask Mr Arias Cañete too to look favourably on these amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, although some Members may think that Mr Arias Cañete's report is excessively critical of Canada, I personally - having closely followed the European Union's fisheries relations with that country - wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the even-handedness of his report, which avoids dwelling on the periods of tension which Canada's stance has forced the Community to endure."
"Now it is a question of looking to the future."
"In my view, this is another indication of the European Union's goodwill and readiness for dialogue. However, I am bound to condemn the fact once again that - judging by the latest news - this is not an attitude which is shared by Canada."
"It is true that the Canadians have expressed their willingness to open up their ports to the Community fleet - although only in certain cases - and are giving to understand that this is a generous concession on their part. The fact that this is a unilateral decision, however, leads us to fear that it can be revoked at any time."
"If Canada really wished to permit access to its ports, it would have signed the bilateral agreement, one of the key points of which concerns precisely the normalized access of the Community fleet to Canadian ports."
"However, Canada continues to show great reluctance to ratify the agreement in question."
"It is my understanding, moreover, that in the latest round of negotiations between Canada and the European Union, Canada continued to insist that it had a complete right to manage certain stocks exclusively and absolutely - cod, for example - in international waters. This is a fresh sign of its intention to take action outside the 200-mile limit, in violation of the International Law of the Sea."
"Consequently, I would call on the Commission once again to defend our fishing rights, since the European Union is just as sovereign as Canada, and to defend Community interests in accordance with the Union's international weight, which is far greater than the results achieved recently would suggest."
"With regard to Mrs Péry's report on the crisis in the fishing industry, the rapporteur deserves to be congratulated on her efforts to unite positions. On the specific question of markets, however, I should like to call on the Commission to present, in its new draft regulation, a genuine reform which is geared to the challenges of the common fisheries policy."
"This time, it must be an in-depth reform, based on non-discriminatory criteria and free of the excessive red tape which is a burden on a sector that needs mechanisms to allow it to respond rapidly, ensuring it a permanent position on the fishery products market."
"And with reference to Mrs Péry's comments concerning the social measures for which there is such a need in the fishing industry, I believe that a good indication that something is amiss is the fact that in the next budget, only ECU 50 000 is earmarked for such social measures, whereas ECU 3 000 000 is set aside for observers in the NAFO zone, for example."
"In my opinion, something is not right in this sector."
"Mr President, at the outset I want to congratulate all of those who have presented reports here today."
"Due to time restrictions I shall concentrate on the Péry report."
"The current crisis assailing the Community's fishing industry is sapping morale from the most important employment sector in peripheral coastal regions in this Community, including my own country of Ireland."
"It would surely be considered a great scandal for the Community if, after obtaining control over significant areas of the most productive fishing zones in the world, we were proved incapable of managing fisheries in a coherent and, more important, a practical fashion for the benefit of the Union's consumers and producers."
"There are matters affecting us where short-term decisions could be taken."
"What have we done about imports of salmon from Norway."
"We have introduced minimum import prices."
"They have not worked."
"What about quantity restrictions?"
"What about the low cost of cod imports?"
"Nothing has been done there by the Commission."
"I believe Parliament can play an important role in assisting in the restoration of confidence to an industry where morale is at its lowest."
"We must point to a more positive future."
"Tax and quotas and not GRT or carrying capacity have regulated the landings of various species over the years."
"Of course we are looking at technical conservation measures."
"We have not been presented with specific measures as yet."
"At the same time the Lassen Report is indirectly being presented to us and suggests we should slash the fleet by 40 %."
"I would suggest to the Commissioner that is not the answer."
"Tax and quotas are the answer."
"We are unable to make our boats safer."
"It is an indictment of the Member States and the Commission that we were unable to make our boats safer."
"If we add to the GRT, we cannot receive permission although we are not adding to the carrying capacity or to the landings of fish."
"It makes little sense to me."
"There is a crisis and the Commission is adding to the crisis because of the veterinary charges to be introduced later after a short derogation period."
"What is Commissioner Bonino doing about that?"
"And what are we doing about early retirement?"
"It is too horrendous to contemplate what will happen with a drastic reduction."
"Finally, I and many of my colleagues speak on behalf of the industry in Ireland, but Ms McKenna does not."
"We are not prepared to share the pain."
"We have shared too much pain over the years."
"We have paid too great a price in Ireland."
"We want to ensure that Irish fishermen are fairly treated in the years to come."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with growing demand it is no surprise that the management of fishery stocks should once again be a priority in the common fisheries policy."
"But we need to be aware that the problem of balanced stock management should not be the sole responsibility of the European Union but should be done worldwide."
"It is also important to point out, in this regard, that some of our current problems are due to the ingenuity of the Commission in its negotiations with third countries."
"In fact, only a few years ago we were accepting reductions in our fish quotas but these countries were increasing theirs."
"That is unacceptable, because the rules must be the same for everyone."
"Having given in in international negotiations, the Commission has now resorted to the draconian management of our waters, proposing reductions in the fishing fleet by up to 40 %, such as for sardine fishing off the Portuguese coasts."
"Has the Commission, Madam Commissioner, actually assessed the economic and social effects of an almost 50 % cut in the fishery sector which represents more than 15000 jobs in Portugal?"
"If the issue of stocks was so serious, why is it only now that the Commission is acting?"
"Who supplied the Commission with these figures?"
"What alternatives does the Commission propose to fishermen, industrialists and workers and their families whose livelihood depends on Portuguese fisheries?"
"The Péry report - and I congratulate Mrs Péry on its quality - seems to take a balanced look at the main issues of the common fishery policy."
"It will therefore win my backing especially since it takes on board some of the amendments tabled by me and approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, such as those on international negotiations, the reaching of interprofessional agreements and the possibility of introducing a storage premium to be paid to the industry under certain conditions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner."
"For a long time we have been campaigning for conservation of fishery resources, taking all the technological, social, monitoring and taxation measures needed to bolster the industry properly."
"However this strategy, albeit vital, has not been very transparent nor has it been applied by everyone, indeed by very many."
"First of all because the decisions are very often taken on the basis of at times inadequate or distorted scientific studies which fail to take into account local reality."
"Also because these decisions overlook the appropriate and vital intervention of fishermen's organisations and fail to take account of any preference trade policy for the Community fisheries sector."
"All of these and other facts justify and generalise climates of mistrust and conflict among fishermen and ship-owners in the Member States."
"On the other hand - as shown by the figures and recent declarations by the Commissioner herself - there are few countries (like Portugal) that in recent years have observed (excessively sometimes) obediently and scrupulously the decommissioning plans while other countries, unfortunately the majority, have not done so."
"Against the background of a crisis in the fisheries sector, non e of this should be forgotten."
"Neither the Commission, nor the Member States, nor the government of my country."
"As well as conserving stocks, we need more transparency and equal participation in the decision-making processes - e.g. in NAFO, where I must repeat my utter failure to understand the proposals to reduce the TACs without proper scientific grounds - or the case of cod, also in NAFO waters."
"We must express our opposition to any reduction proposals which are not the same for all countries and species (e.g; sardines) without taking into account the reduction efforts already made by various countries and not taking into account recent facts which have been to the detriment of Portuguese fisheries, such as the agreement with Morocco and its effects on fish preserves and fisheries in general."
"Mr President, our desire to have a modern, large-capacity fleet can easily come into conflict with the need to maintain fish stocks at steady levels, so the Péry report is right to call for stricter controls on the observance of quotas, for the spawning grounds to be protected and for trust to be restored between marine biologists and fishermen."
"On this last point, there is the problem that less and less money is being made available for research into fish stocks, which undermines the quality of the data and the fishermen's confidence in them."
"It is therefore essential that adequate funding should be provided for detailed research."
"The huge fluctuations in the annual TACs are also very damaging."
"The flexibility now brought to the quota regulations through the introduction of a current account system is a step in the right direction, and the Commission should actively pursue the idea of multiannual planning."
"I am less enthusiastic about the calls to increase Community price support."
"This may limit loss of income in the short term, but in the long run the sector will be better served if the producers' organisations themselves take measures to regulate the market."
"Finally, on the subject of imports from non-Community countries, these are extremely important for the fish processing industry."
"Because of the reduced quotas, the European fleet is no longer able to meet demand from the industry, but in order to prevent unfair competition with the European fishermen there should be stricter controls to ensure that products from outside the Union meet the Community's quality and hygiene requirements."
"This is an area in which the Union's fisheries sector has invested heavily."
"Mr President, I want to talk mainly about Mrs Péry's report, for which congratulations and support."
"I fear I shall say some of the things that have already been said."
"We have here the views of the Committee on Fisheries on the continuing crisis in the fishing industry."
"The basic crisis has been with us for many years and it will be with us for many years more unless we do something radical about it."
"In fact, it will probably become hardly worth fishermen putting to sea in many parts of the European Union's waters."
"That has immense consequences, of course, not only for the fishermen but for all those involved on shore and for the consumer."
"We have to pay serious attention to this problem, which is a problem accentuated by a lack of political will, by far too much nationalism, and dare I suggest that we should look at the policies of the Norwegians and Icelanders and how they tackle their problems."
"The basic reason is, of course, simple: too many boats chasing too few fish."
"You can tackle this in two ways, and both need to be tackled."
"The first one - too many boats - obviously needs a serious decommissioning scheme."
"Now some countries have put decommissioning schemes into practice; my own country has not been serious about this and therefore is marked down for a 40 % cut."
"That is not an acceptable solution for fishermen and for the people who are dependent upon them."
"The other side of the problem is too few fish."
"Now there is much that we can do here and much that the Commission and the various Member States' governments could do."
"In many cases the research is already there."
"Mrs Péry mentions many of the things that could be done: improvements in the gear that is used, to allow many smaller fish to escape; improvements such as inserting square-mesh panels in nets."
"There is a whole range of technical improvements that have been tried and that work."
"We obviously need large areas to be closed off for fishing part of the year or, in some cases, permanently or near enough permanently, to allow the stocks to recover and to allow the juvenile stocks to grow."
"So we need conservation areas, if you like."
"We need to somehow get into being a policy which ends the practice of discards."
"I do not know about other areas, but in the North Sea sometimes 50 % and more of the catch of a fishing boat is discarded because it is too small, unmarketable, or whatever. So we have a whole range of measures on both sides of the equation."
"Finally, I must stress that we need a very rigorous evaluation and inspection system and I and many of the fishermen I talk to would prefer it if that was operated by the European Union."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Péry for her report and to say that I agree with her when she implies that the common fisheries policy is just a half-baked policy."
"Unlike the common agricultural policy it does not have the confidence or respect either of the producers or the consumers."
"In fisheries, the policy always seems to be about reducing the catch."
"The European Union is only 50 % selfsufficient and stocks are falling, yet prices continue to go down."
"We feel more concern about cheap supplies to processors than about the income of the fishermen whose interests we are supposed to support."
"This policy is doing the image of the Union no good either with its own producers or abroad."
"The common fisheries policy seems always to be about control but the benefits never seem to come."
"The Member States are unwilling to concede to the European Union the full responsibility for a comprehensive policy but are always willing to blame the European Union for the negative factors."
"There is one thing about the Commission's proposals which I would question: why all the emphasis on tonnage if we have a quota policy which is working?"
"Why, if quotas are being observed, do we need such emphasis on tonnage?"
"Quotas could be policed: with a proper computer system, a proper satellite system and proper import controls we could regulate the amount of fish taken out of the seas and marketed, if we really set ourselves to do so."
"If we are serious about supervising landing and if Member States cooperate, then tonnage reduction could actually be on a voluntary basis with compensation."
"If we had a policy of maintaining proper prices, then lower quotas would be much more acceptable in the fishing regions."
"Some trade restrictions are acceptable in view of the social environmental problems that are so obvious."
"If there is a precious and scarce resource, why do we exploit it and give it away at prices that are far below its real value?"
"I agree with Allan Macartney when he suggests that the policy needs a fundamental reappraisal and that the disadvantaged areas should be given more control over both the exploitation and the marketing of the resource that is adjacent to them."
"Mr President, I should like to say a few words about the Kofoed report on fisheries in the Baltic Sea."
"The report has been drafted in response to a Council regulation on salmon fishing entailing the further extension of the closed season in order to protect, above all, wild salmon."
"They are good measures even if they do not go far enough in view of the crisis conditions which exist as far as wild salmon in the Baltic is concerned."
"In connection with this report the rapporteur has, however, tabled two amendments on cod fishing in the Baltic."
"These amendments propose replacing the existing quota system with rules on fishing boat engine power."
"I do not think this is an especially good or well-thought-out idea."
"The problem with the current system is that certain countries stick to their quotas while others do not do so in the same way; what is needed therefore is better monitoring."
"Another problem is the level of prices for cod caught in the Baltic."
"I believe that a change to engine power would instead make it still more difficult to check how much fish is actually caught in the Baltic."
"It would also be more difficult to adjust fishing to actual stocks."
"I will not vote for the proposals on engine power."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner."
"It is going to be a pleasant change to hear her views rather than read about them in the Financial Times and the other press."
"Fishing in the Communities is a very volatile, very political matter at the moment."
"We have too many fishermen chasing too few fish."
"Everyone accepts that."
"I think it is symptomatic of open competition, which is compounded by the increasing efficiency of our fishing vessels and particularly the gear."
"Indeed when I was at school we were told that the United Kingdom was a lump of coal surrounded by a teeming sea of fish."
"There is very little coal left in the United Kingdom and if we go on using the gear we are using now then there will be very little fish either."
"The Union has got to call a halt to this."
"We are, at the moment, in a crisis in the fishing industry in Europe and particularly in the UK where the fishing fleet is the third largest within the European Union."
"The government is again preaching the virtues of deregulation."
"We have seen in the last few weeks the effects of deregulation on the agriculture industry."
"We do not want to transfer the bad practices of BSE into the fishing industry by deregulating everything and believing it is the way ahead."
"In an attempt to reduce the number of vessels by the doctrine of laisser faire economics the United Kingdom Government has left the fishing industry in Britain suffering at the hands of market forces."
"This is not conducive to promotion of conservation of fish stocks or to security of jobs of local fishermen, or to the livelihood and the thriving of local communities."
"It is no wonder, therefore, that local communities which are totally dependent on fishing for their livelihood view the United Kingdom Government and others with suspicion."
"The same government began decommissioning vessels as late as 1984 and offered grants in return for surrendering licence."
"It is now crying out in outrage about quota-hopping."
"Indeed the same government which is crying out about quota-hopping is the government which, at the moment, to popularize its own party is parading its xenophobia and has started blocking European institutions."
"We need action on quota-hopping but we must disassociate ourselves from the nationalistic sentiments surrounding it."
"There is a solution to the problem of quota hopping: there should be some recognition and licensing done by the Member States, to ensure some control of the quota-hoppers."
"The fundamental problem remains that fishing stocks are becoming dangerously scarce; Europe's fishermen are going out of business every day; sustainable conservation needs to be promoted and enforced."
"This can be helped by a reduction in the entire fleet capacity of the EU."
"The three multi-annual guidance programmes have all failed to allow Member States to reduce their fishing fleets."
"In the UK alone it will not be possible to meet the 1996 fleet reduction requirements."
"We have to deal with this problem."
"We have to come forward with proper methods of conservation and proper methods of supervision."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to welcome the fact that this important joint debate on four reports by the Committee on Fisheries is taking place."
"Of these four reports, two relate to the conservation of fishery resources - an issue of concern to the European Union - in two areas: the Baltic and the Antarctic."
"With regard to Mrs Péry's report, it sets out the diverse and complex set of problems currently affecting the fishing industry, where I would stress the need for socio-economic and structural flanking measures, given that, as we know, the fishing industry is based in areas which are heavily dependent on this sector."
"I also welcome the notable inclusion in the report of a call for the strengthening of fisheries agreements with third countries, both old and new."
"Lastly, Mr Arias Cañete's timely and important report on the problems of the fisheries sector in the NAFO zone makes it clear that major steps still need to be taken in order to balance the fishing effort in this area and ensure that the European Union participates in that effort on an equal footing."
"We wish to underline the urgent need to establish a voting system which is in keeping with the European Union's actual weight; to modify the composition of the NAFO Scientific Committee; to increase Community investment in research in this zone; to improve protection of the Community's fishing opportunities in this fishing ground; to reduce the cost of monitoring systems; and to call on the Canadian authorities to make practical gestures - such as withdrawing the legislation which discriminates against the European Union and ratifying the 1992 bilateral agreement - and to insist that they lift their ban on access to Canadian ports by Community vessels totally and for good."
"These measures are vital, Commissioner, for the improvement of the European Union's relations with Canada in general, and its fisheries relations in particular."
"Mr President, there is no doubt in my mind, nor I am sure in colleagues' or the Commissioner's minds, that there is a crisis of confidence in the fishing industry at the present time."
"In my own country some in the fishing industry are calling for the scrapping of the common fisheries policy."
"They conveniently forget what it was like before the common fisheries policy was introduced in 1983 and that at that time there were many international agreements."
"Fortunately we now have a policy but we all recognize that it needs to be adapted because it is not working properly."
"The 40 % reduction which is being proposed at the present time may be a suggestion which is not properly understood."
"People do not understand either that there are fewer and fewer fish in the sea."
"But I would suggest that we must work with the fishing industry and make sure that it fully understands the problems."
"I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has gone round many of the ports in the Community discussing the issues with the fishermen."
"She has raised her own profile and that of the Commission regarding fisheries and that is to be welcomed."
"I hope we can look at and address properly the issue of quota hoppers."
"I do not believe that quotas and the single market are compatible with each other."
"That is something we must look at."
"If we are going to have confidence in the industry we cannot allow quota that is allocated to one country to be fished by another country."
"That is the major issue we must face."
"There are many problems we must solve and I hope we can work with the Commissioner to get the right messages across."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner."
"In his report Mr Kofoed deals with the situation of the Baltic salmon in a most creditable way."
"With regard to the population of wild salmon the situation is already alarming."
"There is a danger that entire salmon stocks will become extinct."
"Wild salmon forms only 5-10 % of all the salmon in the Baltic Sea."
"By definition wild salmon is a salmon stock from a particular river which goes back to spawn in the same river in order to reproduce."
"Finland, for example, now has such salmon stocks in just two rivers, Tornionjoki and Simojoki."
"Special action is required to save the wild salmon population."
"The most important measures are fishing restrictions both at sea and in the spawning grounds, and the regeneration of fish stocks in order to preserve the genic genotype of wild salmon."
"It is very positive that the necessity to regenerate fish stocks, an issue which is not very well known within the European Union, is included in Mr Kofoed's report."
"Another thing worth mentioning is that it is a great waste to catch wild salmon in the sea where it is half-grown, often weighing only a few kilograms."
"The price of salmon consequently remains very low compared to the price a fisherman would pay the local authorities for fishing salmon in a river as a sport."
"Well looked-after fish stocks are of great importance to tourism in Finnish Lapland."
"The strengthening of Tornionjoki's position as a salmon river is to be regarded as good from the point of view of both regional and environmental policy."
"That is why fishing restrictions to protect wild salmon and fish stocks to secure the salmon population are required."
"I feel that we are here today on the right track on this issue."
"Mr President, I shall concentrate my remarks on the question of fishing in the NAFO zone, and especially on the problems of a fleet which has undergone one of the toughest decommissioning programmes in the European Union over the last few years."
"I refer to the Community cod fleet."
"I should like to thank the Committee on Fisheries - and in particular Mr Arias Cañete - for adopting my amendments to this report concerning the cod fleet."
"Because the fact is that the Community fleet's fishing opportunities in division 3NO - the 'nose' of the Terranova Great Bank, which is in international waters - are currently nil, since a zero TAC has been set."
"Let us remember that the NAFO Fisheries Commission fixed a TAC of 6000 tonnes for cod in division 3NO for 1994, 2213 tonnes of which were allocated to the European Union."
"But at the beginning of 1994, Canada called for a meeting to be held in Brussels."
"At that meeting, which took place in February, without any new scientific data being put forward to justify the amendment of the TAC for this division, a zero TAC was set which has also been applied in 1995 and 1996."
"Commissioner, you are well acquainted with the crisis afflicting this sector, whose fleet is in some cases confined to port for up to ten months a year."
"I would urge you - with your customary firmness, which has brought such good results for the Community fishing industry and other sectors - and the rest of the Commission to play a leading role in securing the amendment of this TAC, the application of which is not based on sound scientific data."
"93 % of the Terranova Great Bank lies in Canada's exclusive economic zone, and the Community fleet, operating in international waters, must not be made to pay for Canada's mismanagement in this area."
"Above all, Commissioner, we cannot continue to let Canada pursue its eternal fisheries strategy: concealing the promotion of economic and commercial interests behind environmental arguments, whilst it destroys and exhausts its own fishery resources."
"Mr President, time has proved us right - and not only time, but also the speeches that we have heard in this debate today, in comparison to those that were made in the past."
"Furthermore, the scientific and legal analyses have also made it crystal clear that in the 'Halibut War' , the European Union and Spain were entirely in the right."
"As the Commissioner rightly said at the time, the seizure of the 'Estai' was a case of hijacking, and Canada was violating international law."
"Today, the claims to be protecting the environment made by the mercenary Canadian Fisheries Minister at the time are clearly laughable."
"However, let us examine the facts - because the facts which gave rise to that conflict still remain: Canada wishes to drive the Community fleet out of international fishing grounds which are not its own; it has not ratified the bilateral fisheries agreement; it retains laws which are unacceptable to the European Union; and it is calling into question access to Canadian ports by Community vessels."
"These facts are keeping the tension alive."
"Canada is not acting in good faith - far from it - but is maintaining its hostile attitude."
"There is a need to demonstrate, even if only once, that the European Union is acting in a coordinated way in the Commission."
"It needs to be made clear that there is institutional unity and coherence."
"Consequently, if the Commission, as a collegiate body, refers in its programme of work to relations with Canada as an industrialized country, and if it intends to conclude agreements with Canada in the fields of competition and research and development which are in Canada's interests, then what we must do, logically, is refuse to decouple those agreements from the fisheries dispute."
"Commissioner, I would urge you to speak to your colleagues with responsibility for research and development, competition policy and relations with the industrialized countries, and ensure that the conclusion of any agreement with Canada is made conditional on that country genuinely pursuing a policy of good fisheries relations."
"We must not isolate the fisheries question."
"There must be unity and coherence in this respect."
"We are discussing the halibut dispute, which was caused by a bad decision in the allocation of the corresponding TAC quotas."
"And the fact that the Spanish fleet had been operating in those fishing grounds since the sixteenth century counted for nothing."
"Similarly, I have to say that the Spanish Agriculture and Fisheries Minister was unduly hasty in accepting a quota for scorpion fish which is so small that it reduces the authorized Spanish catch by up to 20 % in comparison with last year."
"This readiness to accept intolerable decisions is astonishing."
"I shall end by saying, Mr President, that the other occasion on which the Spanish minister in question turned the other cheek concerned the decisions taken on mad cows by mad British ministers."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Pery on her report."
"She is right."
"There is a crisis in the fishing industry of Europe."
"The fishermen I represent in Devon are very unhappy about it."
"They are not happy about quota hopping by re-flagging devices."
"I welcome the Commissioner's initiatives in bringing forward ideas to try to solve that problem."
"Many are aware of the failure of the quota system to conserve, manage and regenerate our fish stocks, not least because of the high proportion of discards which must be thrown back and are no use for conservation, no use for fishermen's income and no use for the consumer at home."
"The response should be to come forward with better conservation measures, perhaps a 'days-at-sea' policy which could be honoured by all fishermen throughout the Community, and not more proposals for decommissioning, particularly when our fishermen do not believe there is fair play in the implementation of the decommissioning schemes."
"Because of the volume of discards our fishermen believe there are more fish in the sea than the scientists say there are."
"There is distrust of scientific advisers in this area."
"There is widespread concern about industrial fishing for fishmeal, scooping out immature fish from the sea and damaging the possibilities for regeneration of the stock."
"I wonder what the Commissioner has to say about that particular aspect of the industry."
"As for the 40 % reduction in fleet capacity, I trust this is an opening bid for debate to catch our attention."
"Above all we want to see fair and even-handed implementation of any measures that are agreed upon."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I must first of all congratulate Mrs Pery on her report. I should then like to develop two or three ideas in respect of the Arias Cañete report."
"First of all, I think that this report will be a reference text marking - I am quite certain - the line to be taken by the Union in respect of NAFO."
"We want a relationship of mutual respect and cordiality with Canada within the standards of international law but we were right to condemn the conduct of the Canadian authorities motivated by the interest of domestic politics and not backed up scientifically."
"Like the rapporteur we agree that the number of votes in NAFO should take into account the number of countries represented by the Union, that the opinion of the Scientific Committee should take prevalence when defining admissible catches, that the Canadian authorities should ratify the bilateral agreement and allow access to Canadian ports by Community ships."
"But in this debate and in respect of a discussion which also took place here on the POP IV programme and the debate taking place in my country, I should like to deal with a couple of questions."
"First, industrial and deepsea fishing is now at loggerheads with a heightened awareness of ecology, environmental preservation and responsible fish stock management, all of which came about when Portugal and Spain joined the EEC - something that should not be overlooked when fisheries are being discussed, in terms of boats and catches and which does not justify an anti-European or anti-construction discourse."
"Secondly, in the European Union and Portugal in particular, the social and political weight of fisheries is far greater than its economic weight, by tradition, history and culture."
"Nobody can forget, especially when we are discussing the Multiannual Guidance Programmes 1997-2002, when we debate the crisis in the sector or thinking beyond the year 2002."
"The Commission must now carry out its duties, dispel mistrust and win over the people."
"There can be no fisheries without fish, it is true - but there can be no fisheries without boats and fishermen either."
"Mr President, as a representative from Ireland, I wish to express my deep opposition to the Commission's proposals which we know are aimed at reducing the size of the European fishing fleet by 40 % over the next six years."
"Fishing communities by their very nature are located in the most peripheral parts of Europe."
"In these areas the only indigenous resources that can be fully utilized are the fish in our waters."
"Current policy, however, places limits on the degree to which this resource can be exploited."
"Now we all accept that fishing activity must be limited in line with declining resources, but the Commission's proposals are unfair and contradictory."
"They take no account of the size or the age of the boats that ply the European Union waters and it is simply ludicrous to suggest that identical restrictions should apply to a ten-metre boat and to a seventy-metre boat."
"Here I call on the Commissioner to target fleets which impose unsustainable pressure on key stocks."
"Particular attention must be given to the needs of small, isolated coastal communities that rely exclusively on fish."
"I agree with Mrs Pery when she says fishing communities throughout Europe have little confidence in present policy."
"In order to rebuild this trust, there has to be a complete crackdown on illegal fishing."
"I am glad to say that the Irish presidency intends to make this a priority in its forthcoming term."
"Simply setting minimum prices for imports or financial compensation schemes are not sufficient: further action is required."
"I therefore welcome the rapporteur's calls for the improved management of resources, stabilization of incomes, measures to compensate for income losses and the creation of 'SEA LEADER' programmes."
"Mr President, Mrs Péry's report analyses the different factors in the long-term crisis afflicting the Community fishing industry."
"The rapporteur underlines the need for a political priority to be established, that of restoring confidence to the sector, since we must accept the fact that Europe's fishermen have lost all confidence."
"What message is the Commission sending them?"
"It is always the same: there is overfishing, and boats must be scrapped."
"Certainly, there is overfishing of some species."
"Certainly, there are catches of some fish which are too young."
"Certainly, it is the Commission's duty to sound the alarm."
"But fishermen are not fools, Commissioner."
"They know very well that the survival of their profession depends on managing the resources responsibly."
"It is simply that they are obliged to work more, to produce more, because the collapse of fish prices leaves them no alternative, if they wish to survive."
"And we are talking about tremendous rates of work, crews who go out to sea for 320 or 340 days a year, ageing vessels which fishermen have neither the time nor the money to maintain, and a single obsession: to fish more in order to avoid bankruptcy."
"Contrary to some simplistic ideas, the more the price of fish falls, the more our fishermen increase their catch tonnage in order to balance their books."
"It is not just a question of scrapping vessels, but above all of breaking this vicious circle."
"The crisis affecting the fishing industry is clearly a market crisis."
"The role of the common organization of the market is, in particular, to regulate the conditions of competition between Community producers and to prevent unfair competition from third countries."
"However, prices are being undermined from outside as well as inside the Community."
"From the outside, they are being undermined in general terms by what are token health controls; from the inside, they are undermined by unfair competition, caused by monetary and social disparities and encouraged by the Commission, which refuses to take the necessary market organization measures."
"When will it be understood that the resources currently available are enough for the existing equipment to be profitable, provided measures are taken to make price stabilization mechanisms compulsory, so as not to encourage overfishing?"
"When will it be decided to impose the application of minimum prices - which only make sense if everyone plays by the same rules - on the producers' organizations?"
"I know that this seems to run counter to the sacred dogmas of economic liberalism."
"However, Commissioner, this is the reality which must be faced: the reality which means that whilst over the last four years, producer prices have fallen by 25 %, they have done nothing but increase for the consumer!"
"The consumer is not being made king, but once again taken for a fool."
"Today, the Commission is presenting its fourth fisheries guidance plan."
"With the commendable aim of conserving resources, this plan provides for further drastic fleet reductions."
"If a price regulation mechanism is not implemented at the same time, as Mrs Péry proposes with regard to the role of producers' organizations, then this plan will not restore the confidence of fishermen, but ensure their lack of support and anger."
"The industry will go from crisis to crisis until - and I wonder if this is the Commission's aim - the total disappearance of the patients will allow the doctor to announce triumphantly that he has eradicated the disease."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for taking part in this debate and, above all, thanks to the rapporteurs for the four reports we are discussing, although, naturally enough, the debate has expanded to cover many others aspects of the common fisheries policy, as was bound to happen."
"I should like, if I may, to divide what I have to say into two parts: the first providing a specific Commission response to the four reports on the agenda, that is the Péry report, the two Arias Cañete reports and the Kofoed report; and a second in which I shall attempt to reply to more general issues raised here by many colleagues and many honourable Members."
"I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Péry for her report on the crisis in the fisheries sector, particularly because it is always helpful to listen to other ideas, other possible solutions regarding a sector in which no-one - or at least so I hope - can claim to have the complete answer, always at the ready and for all purposes."
"At any rate, I believe that the contribution of this debate is very valuable, particularly with a view to the report that is to be considered by the Council."
"For instance, you, Mrs Péry, tackle a range of issues on which I am in agreement; however, when we come to the problem of the market, a problem to which many of you have referred, I have clearly to remind the House that the professional organizations do not fit in with a free market situation - as you, Mrs Péry, are perfectly well aware - and that, consequently, since these bodies represent a departure from the basic rules, membership of professional organizations cannot be made compulsory; far less, it seems to me, can withdrawal costs be made compulsory for those who do not belong to the professional organizations."
"I am afraid therefore that we need to look at the proposal concerning the markets in all its complexity, and it is for that reason that the seminar, dedicated solely to the issue of the markets, that Parliament and the Commission are organizing jointly with the industry for the month of October - in fact I believe that the date has already been set for this single-topic seminar bringing together the Commission and Parliament and the European industry and focusing on the market issue - will help us to produce some ideas. It is in fact common ground that a problem exists, but there are times when the solutions proposed seem frankly to me to be impracticable or counter-productive."
"Let me give you an example: if we arrive at a withdrawal price that is too high, or kept high, do we not perhaps risk encouraging purchasers to buy imported fish which is, objectively speaking, less expensive?"
"I say that because I believe that some negative effects that we do not wish to see could also occur."
"For that reason, although I am not today inclining towards one idea rather than another, I have to say that the seminar with the sector on that one topic may help us take into account all of the constraints, including the fact that it will, in my view, be rather unlikely that we shall ever have the power to change the common organization of the trade or GATT - we may want to believe that but frankly it seems to me to be rather unrealistic, not because I am someone who gives in easily but because, in those terms, the balance of power is, to be honest, overwhelmingly weighted against us."
"Moving on to the measures to conserve resources, the Commission endorses many of the principles expressed by the rapporteur."
"But I would venture to say that, fundamentally, as far as financial assistance is concerned, what the report is basically proposing is more or less permanent compensation to anyone having to leave the profession."
"I have to say that the Commission is encountering huge opposition here, although it has sought - with some success, I believe - to introduce elements of social policy into the common fisheries policy, much against the will of some States, as Mrs Péry is, I imagine perfectly well aware; this is, moreover, of an optional nature, but now that the possibility is available to them, many Member States, although in favour, are not particularly disposed to make use of it."
"At any event, I believe that this debate and those that follow will help us all to reach the stage that we have all to face - and the Commission certainly has to face - namely the 2002 reform, change or time-limit for the common fisheries policy."
"And for that, apart from the other reasons, I thank the rapporteur."
"Turning now to the other two reports - on NAFO and the Antarctic."
"The Commission very much welcomes the report on NAFO, but the rapporteur will allow me to make two points: I have already said on a number of occasions in the House that the conflict whose political objective was, I am afraid, to expel the Community fleet from the NAFO international waters, has for the time being been resolved with the Community fleet which is within the NAFO zone."
"In those terms, I consider this a positive aspect at least."
"The overall package, which was then made multilateral in relation to all the monitoring measures and so on, has also, I believe, been a positive factor; like you, I realize that the current situation in relations between the European Union or, rather, the Commission and Canada appears to have improved but is far from satisfactory - quite the reverse."
"I therefore believe that we should persist in order to achieve a more balanced outcome, bearing in mind specifically that while things have certainly improved we are still a long way away, in my view, from a balanced and satisfactory state of affairs."
"A third factor, however, on which I do not particularly agree, is that of the voting system in NAFO."
"I believe - and not just because I believe in the European Union and its importance - that it is better to speak with a single and authoritative voice than with six different voices and the dissonant tones of various Member States."
"I say this not just from a political point of view, because I believe that having a common fisheries policy means speaking with a single voice, otherwise it is not a common policy."
"I am concerned, particularly in an area as sensitive as fishing, about the differing positions of the various Member States because I am not certain that they are always moving in the same direction: in fact, I seem to recall that there have been occasions, when this was possible, when we took up positions that were not particularly in tune with one another."
"As far as the other report is concerned, you Mr Arias Cañete know perfectly well that, currently, there are no Community fishing vessels operating in the Antarctic."
"That being so, it is frankly not possible to draw up a report on by-catches because there are no - Community at any rate - fishing vessels fishing in that zone."
"The Community has, as you know, been a contracting party to Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources since 1982, and I believe that, that being so, is already complying with the four amendments that you are proposing."
"I have already told you that I am unable to accept Amendments Nos 1 and 3 for the reasons I have already explained, nor can I accept the amendment concerning the programme of scientific observation which has been under way since the early 1990s."
"But what the Commission can undertake to do is to transmit the data as rapidly as possible; in fact, we shall also be able to look into the possibility of collating the data in a uniform manner - that is something we can do but, of course, using data collected by others."
"The final report is Mr Kofoed's report."
"The Commission will keep Parliament informed about the measures adopted to safeguard the wild salmon stocks in the Baltic; it will inform the House of the progress achieved by the various working groups dealing with this issue; but I cannot accept the amendments proposed to the effect that the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission should consider the possibility of providing for limited fishing of cod on top, as you will be aware, of the introduction of a TAC which is in fact one of the milestones of the common fisheries policy."
"As regards the procedure for consulting Parliament, which Mr Kofoed backed, the Commission is quite prepared to inform the House of the deliberations of the different sessions of the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission in real time, that is to say not immediately it receives the official documents."
"The Commission undertakes to do that: however, Mr Kofoed is aware that the House can express an opinion only on a formal proposal for a Council regulation that has been put forward, obviously, by the Council itself."
"That proposal is not submitted to the Council by the Commission until the 90 day period for raising possible objections has expired, that being the time-scale set down in the Baltic Convention."
"I think then that I have explained the procedural issue and the simplification of procedure and have also entered into specific commitments on the provision of information, as far as the Commission is concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that I have made those brief technical comments on the four reports, allow me to make a number of points on certain issues of a more general nature that have been raised in the House, particularly concerning the Commission proposal on POP IV."
"Let me begin by reminding you that Mr Arias Cañete had asked me to attend the committee on 29 May, something I could not do because that was the very day that the Commission discussed and approved POP IV: the problem was therefore that of being in two places at once, a problem I am, unfortunately, not yet able to resolve."
"Incidentally, on the afternoon of the 26th, the Commission will be taking part, at the chairman's invitation, in the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries which has on its agenda the elements of POP IV."
"At this stage, allow me to mention three things: firstly, we have, clearly, a whole series of misunderstandings and, maybe, inadequate information."
"I am sorry, for example, that Ms Malone is not here, but I have no idea where she read that the structure of the fleet is not taken into consideration."
"That is not true, nor is it written down anywhere - quite the reverse."
"As you know, there is a general proposal to reduce the mortality rate of certain stocks."
"This is not a generalized reduction of 40 per cent of the European fleet - that is categorically not the case!"
"The plan provides for a reduction in the mortality rate of certain stocks whose situation is more desperate, and that reduction can be achieved by cutting the fleet and/or by managing fishing."
"That more general decision will be attached to the 13 national plans which the Commission will have to negotiate with the thirteen Member States."
"There is therefore an obligation to meet an objective, an obligation to achieve a specific result, to put in legal terms, but the way of achieving the result may be a combination of reducing fishing capacity and/or cutting down on fishing."
"The objective of reducing the mortality rate by 40 per cent concerns some stocks whose plight the experts consider to be desperate."
"On this occasion, we had two committees of experts: the usual group and the Larsen group."
"I would inform the House - which is aware of this - that every Member State is in practice represented in those committees, that the decisions of the committees are taken unanimously and that, in the end, after having consulted two committees of experts, I have to believe someone, I cannot conjure up a third, fourth or fifth committee of experts!"
"It is clear that, at an international level, there will always be some experts who do not agree with the conclusions of their expert colleagues, but sooner or later a decision will have to be taken on the basis of some data."
"The third point: there are then stocks in which mortality rates will fall to a lesser degree because their situation is less serious; there are stocks for which reductions are not yet needed but in regard to which the Commission is proposing that there should be no increase as a result of improved technology: we have therefore a reduction over six years of 12 % - 2 % annually - to prevent increased fishing as a result of improved technology."
"These are arrangements that we are setting in place with the fishermen."
"I would point out that, before we submitted POP IV, we held 38 regional conferences with the fisheries sector."
"I repeat: thirty-eight."
"That proposal did not then come out of the blue: it, along with various other issues, was discussed in 38 regional conferences."
"But it may be said that that is not enough: of course, 50 is a larger number than 38 but there comes a point at which 38 seems to me in itself to represent a great effort."
"In addition, we set up meetings between the experts and the fishermen so that they could talk to each other, given that one of the objections is always that the fishermen do not believe the experts."
"Certainly, it is difficult to set up ten committees of experts!"
"Small-scale fisheries, which provide more jobs, are excluded from this programme."
"Non-industrial fishing is not therefore part of the programme specifically because the Commission does not consider itself a 'Super-Larsen' , that is having to deal with biological issues only; the Commission takes the view that it also has responsibility for mediation at a social level, to take account of the social impact."
"Therefore, small-scale fisheries, which provide more jobs, are not covered by the proposed reduction."
"But clearly, ladies and gentlemen, we shall, if you wish, discuss all of this again on the 26th."
"As far as the gallineta is concerned, I can inform the honourable Member that that type of fish, which could be fished freely, has never been fished by the Spanish fleet."
"It began to fish scorpion fish - gallineta in Spanish - in November and December of 1995, no earlier."
"If I have to propose a TAC and a quota then I have to take into consideration a specific period and, as in the case of NAFO, the chosen period is five years."
"The honourable Member will allow that a fleet that began fishing two months ago cannot have the same quota as a fleet from another Member State that has been fishing that type of fish for years."
"I therefore think that a degree of reasonableness would really help everyone to act a little more responsibly."
"A final point, ladies and gentlemen: I do not enjoy proposing cuts in the fishing effort, that is plain;"
"It may be self-evident but that is how it is."
"I urge you to believe that the proposed measures are the minimum needed to secure a future for that sector."
"It will be for the governments to take a decision: unanimously they can also reject the Commission proposal."
"But they know that, in terms of democratic transparency, we have all to shoulder our own responsibility."
"It is true that we must give the sector a sign of confidence, but ladies and gentlemen, we must be aware of the distinction between conveying confidence and conveying an illusion!"
"There is a future for the sector, but on certain conditions: that it is able to modernize, that it is able to change, that it is able to meet challenges, including that of the globalization of the market and of technological change."
"We all have a responsibility to say this, because we can all do at least one thing, both you and I and the fishermen: increase the number of fish."
"That is just what we are not doing!"
"And if there are no fish, then there is no sector for an industry which is one of your concerns, ladies and gentlemen, but - believe me, is one of mine too!"
"I must thank the Commissioner for the information she has given us but my question remains unanswered."
"My question was: who gave the Commission the information used as the basis for the proposal for a 40 % cut in Portuguese sardine catches?"
"Mr President, I would ask Mrs Bonino to read the transcript of my speech, where she will see that I did not refer to her at any time, and I am quite sure that she has fulfilled her duties as a Commissioner."
"I referred to a Spanish minister, criticizing the fact that she accepted a 20 % reduction of the scorpion fish quota at the start of the negotiations."
"I said that this was a clear mistake on the part of the minister in question, but I did not refer to the Commissioner at all."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner if she would reply to the safety factor which is all-important."
"Safety should be the prime objective of the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"There is a very serious situation in Ireland."
"If fishermen want to make their boats safer they are prevented from doing so because it is suggested by the Irish authorities and by the Commission that they are adding to the capacity."
"This is totally untrue."
"They are making them safer."
"They are not increasing the capacity of the vessel."
"They are not increasing the carrying capacity."
"They may be increasing the tonnage but there is no relationship between one and the other and Commissioner Bonino should take this matter on board and try to ensure that the boats are safer."
"We have an ageing fleet and this should be taken into consideration."
"Mr President, I do not like to speak in the European Parliament on domestic policy issues, but since a Spanish socialist Member has made some personal remarks about a Spanish minister, I think I have a duty to explain the problem to her."
"It is not a question of a mistake by our minister."
"The fact is that for years, during the time of the socialist government, the Spanish fleet asked the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for permission to fish for scorpion fish in the NAFO zone."
"The former socialist minister repeatedly refused that request."
"Now, with the establishment of a TAC and quotas based on historical rights, the problem is that unfortunately our fleet does not have historical rights in that fishery."
"That is the problem, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo. And it is not the fault of our minister, but of the former socialist government."
"Mr President, as usual, this debate on the fishing industry has aroused a great deal of interest."
"Please forgive me, but many questions were asked which I was unable to answer individually, although we shall be seeing each other again on 26 June."
"With regard to the report containing the scientific data on sardines, this data has twice been passed to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, a body which brings together the leading scientists in this field, including those from Portugal."
"I described the situation concerning sardines - notably in Portuguese waters - in the House last year."
"The problem is not a new one, therefore."
"As for the question on safety, MGP IV in fact provides for the establishment of facilities to increase safety at sea, provided these are compatible with the need to conserve resources."
"In accordance with Article 10 of Regulation No 3699, modernization of the fishing fleet, in particular for occupational health and safety reasons or with a view to the use of more selective gear, continues to be a priority of the structural programmes."
"This must not lead to developments which conflict with the aims of revising fishing capacity."
"It is therefore possible to achieve this goal, even under MGP IV."
"I hope that this answers the question."
"I shall not go over the national issues again, except to confirm that this is the first time that a TAC for this type of fishery has been established."
"I would add that after a long debate, the Commission and the Member States have shown themselves to be reasonable and understood perfectly well who had historic rights and who did not."
"I have no wish to restart the debate, but I should simply like to clarify the Commission's proposal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the four reports will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Practice of the profession of lawyer"
"The next item is the report (A4-0146/96) by Mrs Fontaine, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive (COM(94)0572 - C4-0125/95-94/0299(COD)) to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a Member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the honour of presenting to the House, on behalf of Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, concerns the freedom of establishment of lawyers."
"This is a subject which we need have no hesitation in describing as thorny, given the intense debate, not to say controversy, to which it has given rise within the profession in question over the last few months."
"Now, thankfully, the mood is one of conciliation, and it is against a more serene background, therefore, that I shall try to answer some of the basic questions that certain Members, at one time or another, will have quite legitimately asked themselves."
"Firstly, why is a special directive for lawyers necessary, when respect for subsidiarity naturally remains a key principle?"
"Quite simply because the Treaty has given us the task of ensuring the freedom of establishment of all the regulated professions in the countries of the European Union; and also because, for the last four years, the entire profession, with the sole exception of the lawyers of Luxembourg - a country which, as we know, is particularly exposed to the freedom of non-nationals to practise their profession - has been calling for this directive."
"We asked them why, and I well remember our colleague Jean-Pierre Cot questioning the chairman of the Consultative Committee of European Bars."
"Their answer was that experience had revealed the shortcomings, limitations and inadequacies, as far as the profession of lawyer is concerned, of the general directive which Parliament approved in 1989, and which has been in force since 1991."
"Thus the aptitude test for joining the bar of a country other than one's own has frequently been used as an effective protectionist barrier."
"Similarly, the right of lawyers to practise their profession permanently, under the professional title of their home country, on a basis other than the restricted and temporary context of the provision of services, is still being disputed."
"And while their freedom of establishment is subtly hindered in this way, the Union's lawyers are forced to watch powerlessly the proliferation in their own countries of large, multidisciplinary practices, of American or Japanese origin or inspiration, which are able to circumvent the obstacles and tap the European legal market."
"The Commission heeded this call."
"It produced a proposal for a directive, which it submitted to Parliament in March 1995."
"In the very difficult circumstances of which the House is aware, this draft directive provided us with an initial working document, on the basis of which we have tried to square the circle, as it were."
"What does that mean?"
"Although, as I have said, the desire for this directive amongst the profession was almost unanimous, opinions on what the directive should contain were sharply divided."
"Some wished the aptitude test for joining the bar of a host country to be retained and the permanent practice of the profession under the home-country professional title to be authorized."
"Others, conversely, wished the aptitude test to be eliminated and the practice of the profession under the home-country professional title to be restricted to a certain length of time."
"If we have succeeded in this impossible task - and I have no wish, of course, to anticipate the result of tomorrow morning's vote in plenary - if we have succeeded in reconciling the irreconcilable, in securing the support of a large majority for the broad outlines of a consensus, then I have to say that it is thanks to the tremendous sense of responsibility demonstrated by every member of our committee."
"We were guided by two imperatives: the need to listen carefully to the profession; and the need to respect the spirit and the letter of the Treaty, as clarified by the case law of the recent Gebhard judgment."
"And we were guided, I would add, by a common political will to achieve a result."
"I should like to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that I appreciated this cooperation greatly."
"Things were not easy for any of you: neither for our German colleagues, nor our British colleagues, nor our Spanish colleagues, nor for your rapporteur, particularly in view of the fact that she is a national of one of the - let us say - more reticent Member States with regard to this issue."
"We all knew that concessions had to be mutual and that, at the end of the day, no one could be entirely satisfied with the result."
"I should also like to pay tribute to the very great political awareness of Commissioner Monti, who understood and accepted the necessary amendments that we proposed to him."
"You accompanied us, Mr Monti, with a great deal of attention and political intelligence, down a road which was nevertheless full of pitfalls."
"In my capacity as rapporteur, I thank you."
"I sincerely believe that the compromise that we have adopted is well balanced."
"Integration into the host-country bar is facilitated by the elimination of the aptitude test."
"However, the competent authority of the host Member State will be able to verify that the lawyer in question has been practising seriously and effectively for the requisite amount of time."
"The right to practise without a time restriction under the home-country professional title has been accepted, but a Community national who declines to join the host-country bar and chooses to practise under his home-country professional title alone will be subject to the same professional and ethical rules as his counterpart in the host-country bar."
"In this context, I should be grateful if Commissioner Monti would clarify this important guarantee for us."
"Finally, provision has been made for joint practice, but we have taken care to protect lawyers from any danger of unfair takeovers by other professions."
"If tomorrow, as I hope, the House votes in favour of this compromise, I trust that it will help to dispel, once and for all, both the fears and the whiff of protectionism which may persist in some quarters."
"Because it is a matter of urgency for the European legal profession to organize itself in order to adapt to the inescapable reality of the globalization of world trade."
"It is a matter of urgency for the Union's lawyers - taking advantage of the new freedom offered by this directive - to forge organic links between their practices and set up European practices which are capable of resisting the competition of large firms from outside the Community."
"Finally, it is a matter of urgency for them to build a European partnership, so as to be able to raise the level of their services further still and meet the challenges that will face this especially noble profession in the coming years, which is so eminently symbolic of European democracy."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by complimenting Mrs Fontaine on her diligence and care in drawing up this document, and on her cooperative spirit, which has ultimately led to an excellent result."
"I would appeal to Commissioner Monti: we really did not take this matter lightly, and we have, I believe, achieved a very good result."
"The legal profession needs this directive, and I hope that the Commission will soon express an opinion on this matter and follow Parliament's proposals if at all possible."
"Things are moving at last in the European legal profession."
"The internal market has given rise to a good deal of cross-border economic activity: the creation of companies, mergers, subsidiaries and partnerships."
"In addition, people are engaging to a growing extent in cross-border activities which are not merely economic."
"Lawyers have seen themselves for too long as a part of their own national judicial system, and not as consultants whose services are also needed across borders."
"I am extremely grateful to the CCBE, the association of European lawyers: it has made a major contribution to a fresh understanding of legal practice, and has been arguing for more than a decade in favour of facilitating the freedom of establishment for lawyers in other Member States."
"Without the persistence and the helpful suggestions of the CCBE on the proposal for a directive which is now under discussion, we would not have reached this stage."
"In the mid-1970s, in its landmark judgment in the Reyners case, the European Court of Justice ruled that legal practice was covered by the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment."
"Twenty years later, we are at last making this principle of primary Community law a reality, at least in respect of the right of establishment."
"After the 1977 directive on the provision of services and the 1988 directive on the recognition of higher education qualifications, the results of which - as the Commission has acknowledged - have not been satisfactory in practice, we now finally have a proposal for a directive to facilitate the establishment of lawyers."
"This directive is a necessary one: firstly, it makes it clear that lawyers can establish themselves permanently in another Member State and practise the law of the host country, under the home-country title."
"This did need clarifying, because despite the Court of Justice ruling of 30 November 1995 in the Gebhard case, doubt is still being cast on this right."
"I would therefore draw attention to what is probably the most important sentence in that judgment: membership of a professional body cannot be regarded as a constitutive element of establishment."
"Secondly, the integration of lawyers wishing to join the bar of the host country is to be facilitated."
"They will no longer be expected to sit an aptitude test under the directive on the recognition of qualifications, but will be able to prove their aptitude by practising the profession for three years."
"I would stress that this arrangement is in line with the case law of the Court of Justice, which made an important judgment in the Vlassopoulou case in 1981, at the time when the directive on the recognition of higher education qualifications had just been transposed."
"This judgment obliges the Member States to take account of the title acquired by the lawyer in the home country to practise the same profession."
"Should the knowledge and skills of the lawyer not correspond to the specific knowledge required in the host country, that country can demand that it be acquired differently, for example through practice."
"This judgment therefore entitles lawyers to prove their ability by means of successful practice."
"Thus the Vlassopoulou case forms the basis of the provisions for integration into the bar of the host country, as proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizen's Rights."
"The arrangement proposed by that committee, approved by a large majority of its members, is a fair and liberal one."
"It is also courageous."
"It demonstrates that European spirit which is so often lacking nowadays."
"And since I have just said that the committee's proposal is a courageous one, I should now like to thank Mrs Fontaine not only for her diligence and her care, but also for her courage!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I really do believe that the directive being discussed today at first reading is a very important one."
"There still remain a number of professions within the European Union - albeit not many - to which the rights of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, as laid down in the Treaty, have not so far been applied."
"Lawyers have until now belonged to this category, since there have naturally been restrictions on the practice of the legal profession because of the differences between legal systems."
"I therefore warmly welcome the presentation of a directive which will solve precisely this problem, and will in principle grant lawyers the rights enjoyed by all other European citizens in the practice of their professions in Europe."
"These provisions are long overdue, and represent a major step forward."
"And that is no doubt why the vast majority of lawyers have expressed support for such a directive becoming European law in the near future."
"It is, however, only natural - and what else could one expect of lawyers? - for there to be disagreement as to what should be included in this directive, and how the problems should be solved."
"Within the legal profession, there has been some dispute about how, but not whether, to proceed."
"It has therefore been the task of the committee, and tomorrow it will be that of the House, to resolve this dispute over the approach."
"I believe that thanks to the help and the willingness to compromise of everyone concerned throughout the discussions, in particular the rapporteur, the Legal Affairs Committee has produced what is a truly viable compromise."
"There were two main points at issue: firstly, whether or not to retain an aptitude test."
"Our view here was that in principle a test can be dispensed with, if a lawyer can provide evidence of sufficient practical experience in the country to which he moves."
"This was a courageous decision, and one which runs counter to what is to some extent a majority view among both the legal profession and the governments involved, whose opinions will be sought again in the course of the legislative procedure."
"The second point was the question of so-called compulsory integration."
"Here the Commission originally proposed that after the expiry of a certain period of time, the lawyer must have an opportunity to decide either to become a full member of the local bar or to return home."
"The committee decided to abandon this principle of compulsory integration, simply because it was our unanimous view that this is not in keeping with the principle of proportionality."
"It is illogical to allow a lawyer to practise in a foreign country for a certain period of time and then, merely because a certain period has elapsed, to tell him that he may not do so any longer unless he applies formally for membership of the bar."
"The committee proposes that the House should take a decision on this important point as well."
"My group and I believe that it should be possible to find a compromise in the Council on the proposals contained in this report, and that after everything we have heard today from the legal profession throughout Europe, they should be broadly acceptable in principle."
"I would therefore appeal to the Council not to block - by failing to act - an important decision in the interest of this group of professionals, but to carry forward this draft legislation in the Council on the lines which I hope will be approved here tomorrow by an overwhelming majority, and to adopt an appropriate common position on this proposal."
"In the light of our discussions with the Commission, I take it that the Commission is likely to accept in principle the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizen's Rights, even though it has not yet stated its views officially."
"But it will no doubt do so over the next few days, or indeed at our sitting today or tomorrow."
"All things considered, the PPE Group supports this report in the amended form produced by the Legal Affairs Committee."
"The amendments represent a broad compromise between national interests, the interests of lawyers, and also between the different views of the political groups."
"Mr President, I am very glad to see our rapporteur in this role, as we have just had an eventful time together in a conciliation procedure, but now I can contradict her a little in the open."
"Mr President, the rapporteur talked about squaring the circle and finding an acceptable compromise with which everyone could be happy, because it ultimately gives everyone freedom of establishment."
"But for the Liberals this is not enough, because we do not believe that there is any reason why there should be different rules for lawyers from those which give any other professional group freedom of establishment in the European Union."
"Why can doctors, who deal with life and death, move from one Member State to another and look after patients there, whereas lawyers cannot?"
"I simply do not understand it."
"But the answer is, of course, as it has always been: professional groups tend to wish to protect themselves from outsiders and adopt protectionist practices."
"And unfortunately there are still traces of this protectionism here in this directive in the form of the equivalence test, just like in the Cassis de Dijon case, rather than relying on mutual trust."
"There is still only a limited right of establishment for people to practise under the home-country title, and we wish to see equal treatment for everyone throughout the Union."
"We have tabled a number of amendments on this subject, and we hope that the rapporteur and the House will respond favourably to them."
"The debate is adjourned and will resume after the evening suspension."
"The next item is Question Time."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Commission (B4-0566/96)."
"Question No 40 by Mark Killilea (H-0435/96)"
"Subject: Termination of the EU's Helios programme"
"Will the Commission confirm that the EU's HELIOS Programme for the disabled is to wind up at the end of this year?"
"Can it confirm that the staff in the HELIOS Brussels office have already been told that they are to be let go by the end of the year?"
"Will it also confirm that it does not intend to renew the programme for a further 4 years, and that there is no comparable programme being put forward to replace it?"
"Given that there will be no successor HELIOS Programme for the foreseeable future, will the Commission formally and extensively consult disability groups on what action they want for follow-up programme?"
"Why has there been no consultation on these proposals?"
"Disability is the first programme to be abandoned by the Commission because of the problems with Article 235."
"Is this an indication that disability is a low priority with the Commission?"
"The Commission has been active for many years in promoting better living and working conditions for people with disabilities."
"As has been clearly indicated in its White Paper on the future of social policy and its rolling social action plan, the Commission is committed to a continued strengthening of the Community's contribution in this field."
"Already the potential of the structural funds in supporting people with disabilities has been enhanced."
"In addition to the HORIZON employment initiative, significant resources are also targeted on people with disabilities through the mainstream structural fund programmes."
"Quite clearly therefore it is the structural funds, and in a very special way the European Social Fund, which constitute the most important financial instruments at Community level for improving the situation of people with disabilities and the Commission is anxious to build on this."
"As far as HELIOS is concerned, the Council decision on 25 February 1993 establishing the HELIOS II programme provided that the programme was to be carried out in the period 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1996."
"Consequently, the contracts with outside experts assisting the Commission in implementing the programme will finish at the same time as the programme itself."
"The final evaluation report on the implementation and results of HELIOS II will not be available until the middle of 1997."
"Pending that evaluation it would be premature to propose any further programme of the HELIOS type."
"In the meantime, however, the experience of, and the lessons learned to date from, HELIOS II are being actively considered by the Commission in the context of a review of its overall strategy in this field."
"Although, as I have already mentioned, the final evaluation report of HELIOS II will not be available until well into next year, it is already possible to set out the overall strategy to provide both continuity and reinforcement of its action."
"The Commission recognizes that the European Parliament, the NGOs and, most importantly, disabled people themselves have high expectations of continuity of effort in this regard."
"Accordingly, a communication setting out the main lines of its strategy will be issued by the Commission in the near future."
"Finally, with regard to consultation of groups representing the concerns of disabled people, the Commission fully recognizes the value of the communications, practices and the experiences developed within the HELIOS programme, and by the NGOs and the European networks dealing with disability issues."
"The Commission intends to consolidate and further develop its links with these in a common endeavour to encourage the development of better policies and the implementation of better practices throughout the European Community."
"In this context the House may be assured that future strategy and any new initiatives will be discussed with the disability groups and, in particular, with the European Disability Forum."
"I thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"I want to compliment him on the wonderful work he has done to help the disabled since he came into office and also on the recent statement in Mayo concerning the funds that should and could be spent by national governments for the disabled."
"I have a few points."
"Is it not rather odd that it takes until the end of the HELIOS programme before an assessment is made?"
"Could it not have been made to coincide with the ending of the HELIOS programme?"
"Then perhaps, in a different form but with the emphasis on the same strategy, the HELIOS could be applied under a new name in the mainline programme which is to be announced by the Commission in the very near future as outlined by the Commissioner."
"I would make the following suggestion."
"It is fundamental in the allocation of structural funds or other major programmes that the amount of money available for the physically disabled should be identified."
"(The President urged the speaker to conclude) I am sorry, Mr President, but I am sure you, unlike the Council, can allow a few moments for the disabled and less well-off in our society."
"I thank the honourable Member for his interest in this matter."
"I can assure him that it is a shared interest."
"He will be aware that the programme runs out at the end of December."
"The full evaluation will take place some months after that."
"It was not possible of course to carry out the evaluation until the programme was finally completed."
"I must tell Mr Killilea that we have an interim evaluation on the HELIOS II programme which was carried out by independent experts."
"They highlighted a number of problems."
"Consequently, I think it is much better that we have a really dedicated programme on the next occasion so as to take full advantage of that evaluation and the further details in the final evaluation."
"As regards finance, the HELIOS II programme was designed to co-finance the exchange of ideas simultaneously right across the Union and so it nicely complements the European Social Fund which cofinances innovative action in the Member States."
"I am trying to get a better understanding between the cofinancing for the international networks and the co-financing at Member State initiative level."
"As you know, in the preliminary draft budget some ECU 6m has been allowed under heading B 34102 for 1997."
"That is a proposal for the preliminary draft budget."
"It has been adopted by the Commission as a whole but it does not commit the budgetary authority."
"The budgetary competence for non-compulsory expenditure rests with Parliament and it can take its own decision in that regard."
"I am more confused now that I have heard the Commissioner than I was before."
"Could he answer some simple questions."
"Is there going to be a comparable programme in the future?"
"Is disability a priority of the Commission?"
"Will there be continuity from the HELIOS II programme?"
"It sounds to me as if HELIOS II is going to come to an end, the Commission is going to think about what it might do in the future and then it hopes the issue will disappear."
"Is there going to be continuity?"
"Is it a priority of the Commission?"
"Will there be comparable programmes in the future?"
"Let there be no confusion on this matter."
"The question of disability and what can be done to help people with disabilities is of the highest priority for the Commission."
"Let that be clearly understood by everybody."
"It is certainly our intention to have another programme."
"There will be continuity of understanding and consultation with the people with disabilities themselves."
"We do not want to go into the next programme until we have completed evaluation of the existing one."
"That is why we are taking some time to consider what is the best way forward and to get the best synergy possible."
"It is the highest priority and because it is the highest priority we are not just allowing a follow-on of what has been done heretofore because some uncertainties have been identified in the interim report."
"I also wish to join in the thanks to the Commissioner for his work in the area of disability and in particular to welcome his commitment to involve the NGOs in the area, especially the European Disability Forum."
"He mentioned that it is a priority within the Commission."
"I think everybody accepts that as true."
"In his discussions with the Italian presidency and the incoming Irish presidency, has he had any commitments from them that it will also be a priority for the Council?"
"Secondly, is it possible to remove the blockages which have been put in place because of dependence on Article 235 by Member States, particularly in programmes that relate directly to alleviating the poverty traps which disabled people have fallen into because of the lack of work at national level?"
"If not, then what are the proposals from the Council - especially the incoming Irish presidency if it has any - with regard to implementing a new article to ensure that these social action programmes can be undertaken?"
"Firstly, I should confirm here that I have heard nothing to suggest that any less priority would be given to people with disabilities and to what can be done for them by either the Italian presidency or the incoming Irish presidency."
"On the contrary, I have only heard very positive remarks at all times concerning what can be done."
"There is the continuing situation with regard to Article 235, as the honourable Member has mentioned, and I have to say that Article 235 is the only possible legal base for the actions that are carried out under the current Helios programme."
"The House knows very well the difficulty we have been having concerning some of the social programmes insofar as the use of Article 235 is concerned."
"It should be stated here that the Council's Legal Service has confirmed the principle of using Article 235 to achieve Treaty objectives where there is no specific legal base."
"We might also note that the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights made a similar recommendation when we talked about the programme for the elderly and that there was no other adequate legal alternative."
"So I was perfectly satisfied that Article 235 is quite sufficient and proper in these circumstances."
"You can rest assured that everything will be done to promote this matter as effectively as possible under the Irish presidency."
"Question No 41 by Ivar Virgin (H-0412/96)"
"Subject: Closure of nuclear power plants in the EU on safety grounds"
"Have all nuclear reactors in the EU been fitted with pressure-reducing filter systems so that even major accidents do not pose risks to the public?"
"Do grounds exist for shutting down any reactor in the EU as a result of safety requirements not having been complied with?"
"Is there any safety-related evidence which is giving the Commission cause to consider recommending that a reactor be shut down in any country?"
"There are various kinds of safety measures, systems and procedures which are needed to limit the effect of a serious accident on the reactor shield, depending on the type of reactor and the national legislation in this sector."
"Such measures are provided for at all the nuclear power plants in the Community where there could be a risk of excess pressure within the shield."
"The national nuclear safety authorities ensure that the safety standards in their countries are complied with."
"All those Member States with nuclear power plants also have qualified, independent nuclear safety authorities which issue operating licences and, if necessary, order plants to be shut down."
"At present, the Commission therefore has no plans to recommend the closure of any nuclear power plants in the Community."
"Thank you for your answer."
"The background to my question is the fact that it was decided, in connection with the very intensive debate we had in Sweden at the beginning of the 1980s after the Harrisburg accident, to invest in safety measures of the kind I mentioned in my question, namely pressurereducing filter systems."
"As the question undeniably is of more than national significance I believe it would be reasonable for the Commission to take an active interest in these issues."
"I should therefore like to ask if the Commission actively supports plans to make this kind of safety investment in other countries."
"My judgement of the matter is that, precisely as a result of these safety investments, the Swedish public have a confidence in nuclear power which they would not have had, or would have been unlikely to have, if the investments had not been made."
"I agree with the questioner that it is important, when it comes to the development of nuclear power, that the population should have confidence in what is being done, and there is no doubt that safety measures play a very significant role."
"The Commission therefore also supports the safety measures taken by the Member States."
"The situation is that under the Euratom Treaty, the Commission does not have the authority to intervene and introduce common safety standards for the Member States, but through the various resolutions which have subsequently been adopted, we have been given scope for cooperating with them to secure mutual recognition of the various national standards."
"This means that in many areas, a common stance has been formalized to some extent on these important safety-related matters."
"Question No 42 by Anita Pollack (H-0448/96)"
"Subject: Potential trade war between Italy and the USA"
"What is the Commission doing about the USA threat to stop importing all fish products from Italy by 28 July unless Italy stops all illegal driftnetting?"
"On 28 March 1996, following a ruling by the United States Court of International Trade, the United States identified Italy as a country engaged in large-scale driftnet fishing in international waters."
"As a result sanctions may be introduced against Italy."
"The timing of US internal procedures allows 30 days from 28 March for consultations between the United States and Italy, with a further 90 days to reach agreement."
"In the absence of agreement the United States has 45 days in which to apply sanctions, which would take the timetable of the procedure to early September."
"The Commission sent a diplomatic démarche to the United States State Department on this issue, which states that the Community shares US concern over the incidental death or serious injury to marine mammals caught through drift-net fishing whether large-scale or not, but reiterates Community opposition to the extra-territorial application of US jurisdiction."
"The Community also stresses that such unilateral trade sanctions contravene the basic principles of the WTO and the United States' obligations within that organization."
"The Community reserves its rights under the WTO should such trade sanctions be introduced by the United States."
"I thank the Commissioner for his fairly predictable reply."
"I wonder if the Commissioner would have come to Parliament about this issue if we had not asked the question first?"
"We have about US$1 billion worth of products involved here, including jewellery and perfume as well as fish products."
"We really need to know what the implications are for multilateral trade agreements."
"Does the Commission think it might be useful to try to persuade Italy to stop using illegal drift-nets?"
"While we have EU rules which limit drift-nets to a maximum of 2.5 kilometres in length, is the Commission aware that the Italian swordfish fleet uses nets as long as 20 kilometres?"
"Scientific studies show that less than 1/5 of the targeted species that are caught in the nets are actually used, while the rest of the catch is often thrown back dead."
"So what is the Commission going to do to persuade Italy to put a stop to this very sorry state of affairs?"
"The Commission has started infringement procedures against Italy as provided for under Article 169 of the Treaty."
"The issue will soon be raised again with the Italian authorities."
"I hope that a satisfactory outcome can be achieved without delay."
"If that is not the case, then the Commission will proceed with the case to the Court of Justice in the normal way."
"As Mrs Pollack has already indicated, there is a clear risk to the Community fish market in connection with this issue, since the amounts at stake in a ban on the import of fish products into the United States would be in excess of PTA 100 000 million."
"It should also be borne in mind that the same organization which brought this matter before the US Court of International Trade is also investigating the activities of the fishing fleets of other Member States using drift nets in the Atlantic."
"Consequently, should not the Commission take this matter seriously and consider that the way to avoid these possible sanctions, which may have a serious impact on the Community fish market, is to ban the use of these nets, the illegal use of which may cause substantial damage to the entire Community fish market?"
"The position is that under United States' legislation, if the matter is not resolved, the United States would and could introduce sanctions against marine products from the Member State concerned, that is from Italy."
"We do not regard that as justifiable for the reasons that I have given and reserve the right to take action in the World Trade Organization to deal with that situation should it arise, although it has not arisen."
"I hope it will not arise because we also take the view that the action that has taken place is contrary to Community law and it is for exactly that reason that we have started infringement procedures against Italy."
"I share the concern expressed about the infringement of the law and, therefore, I very much hope that the issue can be resolved by Italy causing the necessary action to be taken for the procedure not to need to go forward and therefore, of course, the United States' sanctions also not to proceed."
"Question No 43 by Wolfgang Nußbaumer (H-0446/96)"
"Subject: Standards and regulations on certification"
"What is the Commission's assessment of the effect on competitiveness of the numerous and different standards and regulations on certification within the European Union and what measures does the Commission intend to take in this connection?"
"How does the Commission guarantee that a standard which does not meet the fundamental requirements provided for in directives, but which is referred to in the Official Journal, conforms to Community provisions?"
"Mr President, standards are in the first instance private norms, in that they are drawn up by standardization organizations but do not generally have a binding effect."
"They can of course become binding if the Commission makes them mandatory and incorporates them into safety provisions, but that only happens in exceptional cases."
"The existence of different private norms alongside one another is of course damaging, and that is why we set up the three standardization organizations CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, whose workload has increased substantially."
"At first, the formulation of these European standards, which replace a multitude of national standards, made a slow start."
"After all, every standard requires technical preparation."
"More recently, however, these bodies have been working very effectively: over 1000 European standards per year are currently being produced, which means more than four standards every working day, and that is a considerable number in view of the sometimes difficult technical preparatory work."
"It is not too many, though, because these standards do replace a whole multitude of national standards. Cooperation with national standardization bodies is also very good."
"The CE mark, which is not a quality standard, but simply confirms that a product meets the European standards, is being used increasingly, and is also having an impact on the certification procedures serving the needs of the internal market."
"In principle, the standards drawn up by these organizations have no technical flaws, and this is ensured by the fact that they are checked by independent experts from outside these bodies."
"However, should a standard exceptionally fail to meet the relevant basic requirements in full, it is withdrawn by the Commission, once its shortcomings have been noted and after the appropriate consultation procedure has been followed."
"Thank you for your answer, Commissioner."
"I am always being told that many SMEs are deterred from patenting their inventions by major procedural and, above all, financial obstacles put in their way by the relevant authorities."
"How can the Commission encourage the Member States to reduce their red tape, thus removing the competitive disadvantages suffered by European firms, especially in relation to American and Japanese companies, and giving them an incentive to develop new processes and products?"
"First of all, to my mind, one must distinguish between standards and patents."
"It is of course very much to the advantage of small and medium-sized firms to apply standards, so as to offset to some extent the disadvantages which they suffer in calls for tender because of their size."
"In order to make smaller firms more aware of standards and facilitate their application, we are working closely with an association created by small and medium-sized enterprises, whose brief is to ensure that these standards are known and complied with during the production process."
"I believe that, as a result, more and more small firms will begin to apply standards."
"Patents are of course something quite different."
"I do not know whether that was a slip of the tongue, because patents have nothing to do with standards."
"Naturally, a patent must be registered in accordance with certain procedures."
"This is done either nationally or through the European Patent Office, which is increasingly taking over the work of the national patent offices."
"It is true that the fees charged are sometimes fairly high, which in the case of the European Patent Office - where we have a certain amount of influence - is due to the fact that the Office is funded entirely from these fees."
"The European Parliament itself regards it as essential that such authorities and agencies should be funded out of their own revenue, and clearly this is a financial burden which we cannot reduce."
"Commissioner, to what extent does European standardization go hand in hand with international standardization, given the fact that over 40 % of European standards have already been recognized internationally?"
"Is it not our duty to respect not only the three standardization bodies in Europe, but also the worldwide standardization network, for example in the telecommunications sector?"
"The honourable Member is absolutely right."
"What you say is indeed logical, and ideally standards would be applicable internationally."
"In many sectors, we already have a global market, and you rightly mention telecommunications."
"Together with the European standardization organizations, therefore, we are attempting to ensure that these standards apply worldwide."
"In practice, there are two ways of doing this: the first is to participate in the work of the international standardization bodies which already exist."
"Here we are more active than anyone else: for example, almost 80 % of the work leading to such international standards - and, incidentally, of the financial resources too - is provided by the European Union."
"I myself would not have thought this massive percentage possible, but at a meeting with our American friends, who have always accused us of seeking to use our European standards as a form of protectionism, we looked into who does what in the international standardization bodies."
"The Europeans carry out the bulk of this work."
"Secondly, there is a method which is very effective once a standard has already made an impact on the market."
"The best example of this is GSM, the technical standard for mobile communications."
"Once such a standard has made its impact on the market, this impact spreads to the global market, and we hope that many of the standards which we are drawing up in this new sector - telecommunications - will have a global impact."
"Question No 44 has been withdrawn."
"Question No 45 by Allan Macartney (H-0336/96)"
"Subject: Commission policy and criteria with regard to the need for NGOs to have expatriate presence in the countries where they work"
"Many NGOs work through local organizations in developing countries, in recognition and support of the experience and capacity that exists in those countries."
"In the past, the Commission has supported this approach and encouraged European development NGOs to work with local counterparts."
"In the fields of food aid, rehabilitation and longer-term development, the Commission has on numerous occasions stressed the importance of civil society and private initiatives in developing countries."
"Yet, on other occasions, Commission services have turned down applications by European development NGOs on the grounds that those organizations do not have sufficient expatriate presence in the country concerned."
"What criteria do the Commission apply in determining whether there is a need for European NGOs to have an expatriate presence in a particular country?"
"What are the advantages for the Commission and for the NGO programmes of the use of expatriate European staff as opposed to staff of local organizations?"
"Does the Commission agree that, in the light of its discussions on the linkages between emergency aid, rehabilitation and long-term development, there is added value in strengthening local organizations by working through them?"
"Mr President, the Commission entirely agrees with Mr Macartney that it is important to strengthen local organizations and enhance their role in guaranteeing the linkages between emergency aid, rehabilitation and development."
"The importance of this aspect was especially highlighted in the recent Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on this very issue."
"Generally speaking, the Commission bears in mind, as far as possible, the need to strengthen and implicate local partners in the execution of the various financial instruments."
"Against this background, as far as possible, NGOs must resort to local staffing, as mentioned in the very conditions of co-funding for executing structural development projects."
"It is obvious that this approach must be adapted according to the specific aims of the different budget rubrics and in situ conditions."
"When assessing requirements for an expatriate presence for a given project, the Commission bears in mind the objective of the given project, the country's logistic and technical capacity in terms of the planned action, the experience and financial management capacity of the beneficiaries."
"As a result in emergency situations and/or during the rehabilitation stage in countries which have just undergone serious crises and whose political, economic and social structure has suffered profound upheaval, it may be necessary to resort to a greater expatriate presence than, for example, in normal development stages."
"Resorting to expatriate aid workers is usually done so along with a unit of training staff to teach the local people so that the project's viability in the medium or long term can be guaranteed once the foreign staff have left."
"I do not know whether to be reassured or otherwise by the Commissioner's response."
"He seemed to be saying all the right things."
"If I could just clarify it a bit, did I correctly understand him to say that, other things being equal, he would prefer to rely on local staff in NGOs rather than having Europeans acting to some extent as minders, which I take it could well be the perception?"
"The reason I ask that is because, after many years of decolonization, there is still an impression in some countries that the European Union has not changed its basic mentality."
"I hope I am wrong and perhaps he could confirm that I am wrong in that regard."
"Let me reassure you that you are right in your concerns but wrong in your subsequent conjectures."
"In fact, in 1995, of the 67 projects which we financed under the budget lines that are mainly concerned with rehabilitation and crisis management, only seven of those projects fell into the category to which you referred in your question, in which reinforcement of European personnel was required."
"The reason was that the administration was in a shambles and it really was not possible to carry out some essential projects if we did not contribute some expertise of our own."
"But the principle is that unless there is a local partner - we always try to be the main force in the project - we simply do not finance the European NGOs."
"This is a very strong principle."
"You will see that in the report we are presenting to the Council and Parliament at the beginning of next year that this is set out as one of our main objectives."
"Thank you for the question because it is an important one."
"Question No 46 by Marianne Eriksson (H-0461/96)"
"Subject: Development aid policy"
"An increasingly small proportion of EU aid goes to the world's poorest countries, most of which are sub-Saharan ACP countries."
"The EU's insistence on giving priority to aid to Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region is being pursued at the expense of the very poorest countries."
"What is the Commission's position on this problem?"
"Does it intend to endeavour to change this state of affairs and, if so, how?"
"Mr President, European Union aid to sub-Saharan Africa is comprised, as you know, of resources earmarked in the Union's budget and the European Development Fund which, as you know, too, is currently and against the will of the Commission not yet receiving European budget funding because of the Council's refusal."
"The authorizations granted in the framework of the European Development Fund have continuously increased."
"Under the VIth Fund the funding levels reached 7.5 billion ECU rising to 10.9 for the VIIth and 12.8 for the VIIIth."
"In other words, the funding for the EDF has gone up by almost 20 %."
"The share of g overseas aid taken up by the Fund has remained steady since 1991, around 45 % of all Community overseas aid."
"This is important and especially so since of the 48 least developed countries identified by the UN, 40 of them belong to the ACP and are funded in terms of overseas aid by the European Development Fund."
"As far as the Union budget is concerned, the importance attributed to the ACP countries and especially the poorest ones in the framework of aid and cooperation policies has likewise not gone down over recent years."
"Indeed the Cannes summit set a share-out of aid among various geographical groups, namely the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, ACP countries, Asia, Latin America, the former Soviet Union and former Yugoslavia."
"This share-out will remain in effect until 1999 and nothing suggests that it will be changed to the detriment of resources earmarked for the ACP countries."
"European Union aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is indeed important and has steadily increased since 1990."
"Resources for the Mediterranean region will also increase substantially given our new Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"But I should like to emphasize that none of this has bene to the detriment of the ACP countries."
"I have given some figures but I should like to emphasize that translated into dollars, the currency usually used for development aid cooperation, the increase from the VIIth to the VIIIth EDF budget was almost 50 %."
"When translated into local currencies - i.e. purchasing power on the ground - the increase is far greater than 50 %."
"In other words, ladies and gentlemen, I can say with some certainty that the number of projects which the European Union will be able to fund under the VIIIth EDF will probably will half as much again as those funded under the VIIth Fund."
"I should like to thank you for your answer."
"What you said was not unexpected, I must admit."
"One of the reasons I asked the question is that the Swedish government has now decided to make cuts in aid in Sweden, partly on account of the EU aid programme."
"I have examined EU aid with this in mind."
"Even though I can agree with the Commissioner that in ready money the changes are not so large, it is clear that it is emergency aid which the European Union has agreed to which is also at the expense of more long-term development projects."
"I therefore believe that my question still requires an answer."
"Am I making a correct interpretation, does the Commission share it and if so, how does the Commission intend to work to improve things for the 20 poorest countries in the world today?"
"Overall public expenditure on aid by the international community has decreased over the last decade, not because the European Union and its Member States have decreased it - on the contrary, we have increased it - but because some of the major donors, namely the United States of America, have dramatically decreased their contribution and also because the Japanese, who were one of the major contributors, decided after the Kobe earthquake to reduce their aid commitment."
"The second aspect which I would like to underline is that the multilateral approach is not a substitute for some of the bilateral approaches."
"In that regard I have been urging Member States that we should coordinate our efforts and find ways of working together and that there should be no decrease in the bilateral effort which has been crucial in many countries and places for many different reasons."
"The Nordic countries especially have set an example of very good cooperation, especially in ACP countries and through some of the best NGOs we have working in the ACP countries."
"I therefore hope that Sweden, as one of the main countries that has pursued that policy, will continue to do so in future."
"A second aspect concerns the poorest countries."
"The Commission has decided that the funds provisionally earmarked for the next five years should allow for a greater increase for the poorest countries - the poorest of the poor."
"Therefore we established a system that means that of the poorest countries no-one will get less than a 25 % increase in their EDF funding."
"Most probably they will receive 50 % more in the five years to come as regards the EDF financial envelope."
"Why have we done this?"
"Among other reasons, because we have two tranches in EDF spending."
"In principle the poorest countries will be less able to absorb it and therefore it will be the better off that will get some extra money in the distribution of the second tranche ."
"In creating this imbalance in favour of the poorest countries at the beginning, we have tried to make sure that the overall balance is not destroyed at the end of the next EDF."
"Nowadays not only the quantity of resources available is crucial but also the coordination."
"That is the reason why the Commission is now engaged in a very intensive coordination effort with Member States and other international donors, namely the World Bank which, as we know, is one of the main donors, and also United Nations agencies such as UNCTAD, UNIDO, UNICEF, FAO and others."
"It is a deliberate policy which is already paying off."
"I will be able to come back in September after a seminar we are holding with the World Bank to report on the common action that we have decided to undertake in order to maximize the resources available for assistance to the ACP countries."
"Question No 47 by Graham Watson (H-0317/96)"
"Subject: Microsoft monopoly"
"Is the Commission aware that Microsoft is exploiting its monopolistic position in the computer software market to the detriment of European suppliers and users?"
"Having secured around 80 % of the market in this sort of software, Microsoft enjoys an unrivalled domination in the sector."
"According to the magazine 'Personal Computer World' , the computer software giant sells copies of Microsoft Office to US suppliers for only $80 whilst charging UK and presumably other European competitors £140, almost twice the US rate for exactly the same package."
"High levels of demand for the Microsoft Office, which includes WORD wordprocessor and EXCEL spreadsheet, amongst consumers limits UK, and hence European, suppliers' competitive ability and diverts business to the US."
"What action does the Commission intend to take to end such a blatant example of predatory pricing which clearly breaches the spirit of GATT negotiations?"
"The Commission shares the honourable Member's concern about the behaviour of dominant firms and we are particularly concerned where abusive behaviour by a dominant firm may be impairing the ability of its European customers to compete."
"The extent to which Microsoft , which appears to be a dominant supplier, can charge different prices to different customers and other aspects of their licence contracts with computer manufacturers are currently being discussed with Microsoft 's management."
"I am grateful for that information from the Commissioner that this is being discussed because this strikes me as a blatant example of predatory pricing which clearly breaches the spirit of the GATT negotiations."
"If the allegations contained in the magazine, Personal Computer World , are true - they are certainly reported very bravely in view of the possible loss of advertising - they suggest that this practice is more wide-spread than it should be."
"Indeed it is possible that this is not the only case of predatory pricing by this particular company."
"I do not believe that there is any way in which we can prevent what is a very good product being the standard for office software in Europe."
"All attempts to promote alternatives to it from Europe will probably be a waste of money because it is a very good product and very successful with consumers."
"But pressure, adverse publicity and perhaps financial penalties for predatory pricing are more likely to be successful."
"Any assurance that you can give the House that action could be taken if this is discovered to be true would be gratefully received."
"As I said, we are discussing this with the management of Microsoft ."
"Before coming to conclusions one must be very much aware of the fact that first of all, the pricing information we have is of a confidential nature. But on the other hand, we have already seen a range of licence fees."
"They are very different."
"It is not appropriate to jump to a conclusion now."
"I must be aware of very different situations which need to be looked into more closely."
"On the other hand one should not forget, again before jumping to conclusions, that there are different fees for different services."
"Comparing only two amounts if not good enough."
"I want to stress that point."
"Therefore please accept that I cannot be more specific today."
"But I confirm that the Commission is discussing this with the necessary confidentiality and with determination to find out what is really happening."
"Question No 48 by Pat Gallagher (H-0390/96)"
"Subject: Tendering procedures for mobile phone licences"
"With regard to the awarding of a second mobile phone licence in Ireland, can the Commission confirm the accuracy of the statement made by the Irish Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in the Dáil Eireann on 22 November 1995 regarding the European Commission's involvement in the award of the second mobile phone licence, including the following comment by the Minister, ' A cap of £15 million was put on the licence fee in the context that Eircell would also pay £10 million. That led to the approval in advance of the selection process by the Commission' ?"
"What is the view of the Commission regarding the content of letters sent by the Irish Department of Transport and Energy and Communications, in June and on 5 July 1995 to the bidders for the second mobile phone licence process, to the effect that the EU and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications had fixed a £15 million 'entrance fee' for the new operator?"
"To understand the involvement of the Commission in the Irish tender procedure, it is necessary to recall that the Commission opened a formal proceeding regarding the maintenance of the GSM monopoly in Ireland in May 1994."
"On 8 March 1995 Minister Lowry confirmed that all the preparatory work for the opening up of the GSM market to competition was completed."
"By letter of 27 April 1995 the Commission had to draw the attention of the minister to certain conditions of the call for tender which could appear to be discriminatory."
"The main issue was the amount the applicants were invited to pay for the right to the licence under clause 19."
"It was explained that such an option resulting in a fee which is only imposed on the second operator can significantly distort competition and favour the extension of the current dominant position of the incumbent telecommunications organization."
"At the same time it was stressed by the Commission that it was not entirely clear from the competition documentation submitted by the Irish authorities whether Telecom Eireann which already offered its own GSM service would also have to pay the same amount as the new competitor."
"The Commission letter also mentioned that such an initial payment would lead to higher tariffs to recoup the money paid thus rendering the mobile service less affordable and restricting consumer access to the market contrary to the objective behind Council Recommendation 87/378."
"Subsequent to this letter, the representatives of the Irish Government during a bilateral meeting held in Brussels suggested to cap the initial payment and to impose a similar payment on Telecom Eireann."
"The Commission considered that if such an approach were followed, together with additional measures such as the right to establish own infrastructure, there would be no grounds for further action under Article 90(1) in conjunction with Article 86 irrespective of the option fee imposed on the second operator."
"The role of the Commission is not to choose a given approach but to ensure that the approach chosen is in conformity with the rules of the Treaty."
"During these bilateral talks, the bidding procedure was suspended until the official confirmation of the Commission on 14 July 1995."
"After that date the Commission was not involved in any of the subsequent stages of the selection process."
"The Commission was not consulted on the letters of June and 5 July 1995 mentioned in the honourable Member's question."
"I thank the Commissioner for his detailed reply."
"I would say to him that there is concern in Ireland over the allocation of the second mobile phone licence."
"This is a key element in our telecommunications strategy."
"There was confusion as to the role of the Commission and I am pleased that has been clarified by the Commissioner this afternoon in view of the correspondence from the Irish authorities indicating that the Commission was responsible for the delay in expediting the process."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if it is customary for the Commission to become involved in the capping of fees as was the impression given by the Irish authorities."
"This evening's reply is important in the light of the political and media speculation in Ireland over the last few months."
"Could he confirm if the Commission could be involved in any way in the delay in expediting the process?"
"Well, first of all let me recall that it is our policy to try to convince the governments not to impose a fee for a new operator."
"But if a government does so - which was not only the case in Ireland, it was also the case in Belgium, Italy and Spain - then the Commission obviously asks the authorities to be even-handed and to impose the same fee on the incumbent operator, who is usually already on the market."
"But that is the second-best choice because, at the end of the day, the consumer has to pay the bill."
"Again, if the government chooses another approach, then it should be an even-handed one."
"In the light of our remarks, the Irish Government was willing to cap the fee."
"That was an attempt to limit - to put it in this way - the bill to be paid by the consumer, because our first concern is to have competition and by having competition also to serve the consumer best and to have the most attractive tariff."
"Question No 49 by Anne Van Lancker (H-0392/96)"
"Subject: Implementation of the guidelines on aid to employment"
"On 12 December 1995 the Official Journal published the guidelines on aid to employment ."
"These guidelines provide for a number of derogations from the rules of competition and the rules relating to state aid to firms for the benefit of certain groups of workers and unemployed persons who are difficult to place."
"Can the Commission say to what extent Member States (and regions) have been availing themselves of these opportunities and announced or taken measures to support employment for specific categories of workers?"
"Which Member States have done so?"
"Do firms in the social economy sector (such as those described in the Commission's communication on local initiatives ) and sheltered workshops qualify?"
"Is the Commission considering an initiative aimed at encouraging the various authorities to take advantage of these measures?"
"The Commission has tried to make its policy on this subject rather more transparent and to define the rules and practice as clearly as possible for the various national and other authorities which are likely to be providing state aid for employment."
"There are, of course, a number of practices and instruments in use."
"The guidelines to which the honourable Member has referred are designed to make it clear which general measures do not come under the rules on state aid or, if they do come under these rules, when the Commission has no objection to them, such as when aid is provided for certain categories of workers who are difficult to place: the long-term unemployed, unemployed young people and female workers."
"The Commission has now gone a little further in its interpretation, and as you know there have recently been a few cases where it has applied this in practice. I am thinking here of what is being done in France to help cities with extremely poor areas, for which extra aid can be provided without us seeing this as contravening the rules on state aid, because the effects are purely local and thus cannot be regarded as distorting competition."
"In the context of the guidelines, two governments have notified us of their intention to take certain measures - I think this was what the honourable Member wished to know - in Sweden, where the measures were ones which had already been taken earlier and we are now discussing with the authorities how they can be adapted to comply fully with the rules, and in Spain, where we considered that there was no reason to raise any objection at all."
"I can also assure the honourable Member that there is never any problem with purely local initiatives, since they can never be regarded as distorting trans-frontier competition."
"There is no reason why they should not go ahead."
"What we cannot allow are measures specifically designed to distort competition with neighbouring countries in particular, or measures which are claimed to be aid to employment, but which are really also designed to give firms an advantage in a given sector."
"The Commission has no choice but to oppose these."
"For the rest, you know how seriously the Commission takes the problem of unemployment, you are familiar with the White Paper, you know about the initiatives which President Santer and the Commission have proposed."
"I do not think anyone could accuse the Commission of not being militant here, if I may use the word, but we also have to try to maintain a proper balance and ensure that such measures do not result in distortions of competition."
"My thanks to the Commissioner for his detailed reply."
"It clearly proves that social principles can still be observed even when competition rules are applied, and I am very pleased to see it."
"I think far too few people realize that this is possible."
"I would just like to ask the Commissioner whether I can conclude from this that social clauses may be included in public invitations to tender, provided that they do not give an advantage to a particular firm, but simply seek to create opportunities for a particular social group which faces difficulties on the labour market?"
"I do not wish to give a specific answer on this, because I feel that it is something that should be dealt with by the Commissioner responsible for the internal market."
"Clearly, we have no objection to governments providing aid for special categories of workers who have difficulties in accessing and staying on the labour market, or for bodies dealing with such workers, for example."
"But where the measures affect competition and have a cross-border impact, then we naturally have to impose certain limits."
"We try to interpret the concept of permitted state aid for employment as broadly as possible, provided that the governments or authorities are not trying to use this to gain an unfair advantage over one another."
"One thing we do hope is that, as the White Paper recommends, we can gradually bring labour costs down - not what people actually earn, but the additional related costs, so that labour is less severely penalized than it is today."
"Question No 50 by Jörn Svensson (H-0460/96)"
"Subject: Competition rules"
"A company called Danisco has a monopoly over the sugar market in Scandinavia."
"It has decided to close down a profitable sugar refinery on the Swedish island of Gotland and is putting obstacles in the way of someone who is interested in taking over the refinery."
"Current legislation does not prevent such tactics."
"Does the Commission intend to take steps to tighten up the rules of competition so that such situations cannot arise?"
"Since the matter raised by the honourable Member has not been referred to the Commission under the EC competition rules and the Commission does not have all the relevant information at its disposal, it is not in a position to comment on the merits of the case as such."
"In principle, the Commission would not, on the basis of the competition rules, oppose operations whereby a company, even in a dominant position on a national market, for reasons of restructuring aimed at rationalization of production, moves production from one production unit to another within this market."
"This is happening every day."
"Obviously, when a company in a dominant position is abusing its position, for instance, by behaving in such a way as to keep other competitors out of that market at any price or buying other companies to close them down to limit potential competition, there might be a problem."
"But in this specific case we have not been received any specific complaint or any information."
"Therefore, I cannot be more specific."
"Mr President, thank you Commissioner for your answer, even though it was by its nature rather vague."
"We shall perhaps return to this question and I will then try to produce more concrete information on the case as such."
"What we are talking about is in the first instance to all intents and purposes a monopoly; no sugar is sold in Sweden that does not come from this particular company."
"I consider that this in itself is a situation which should call for steps to be taken."
"Secondly, this company is preventing the establishment of an alternative on the island of Gotland, which is important from the point of view of regional policy and where the sugar industry plays a major role."
"A small follow-up question: what attitude would the Commission adopt towards stricter Swedish legislation to prevent monopolistic behaviour in the sugar industry of the kind we are seeing today?"
"Since Sweden has only recently become a Member of the European Union, some of the problems which might arise and monopoly situations which are there have to be tolerated for the time being."
"In this respect I would ask national competition authorities if necessary to perform their own function."
"But if it is a question of a dominant company or monopoly abusing its position then that must be established."
"You must have evidence to show that."
"If you say that the company in question is trying to prevent another competitor from buying that company and wants to close it down in order to avoid competition and if you have the evidence, you can send this to the Commission or the competitor could file a complaint."
"That is why we have competition rules and a competition authority which, as you know, is the Commission."
"As long as we do not have a complaint and as long as there is no evidence, the honourable Member will understand that the Commission has no reason to act."
"Question No 51 by Mikko Rönnholm (H-0493/96)"
"Subject: Business concentrations in Finland"
"Finland is in a strange position at present as regards competition policy: banking and insurance activities and the retail trade have been concentrated in the 1990s into ever fewer hands."
"In 1991 the market share of the two largest banks taken together was 55 %, whereas in 1995 it was almost 80 %."
"The corresponding figures for the retail trade were some 60 % in 1985 and nearly 90 % in 1995."
"The emergence of business concentrations particularly since Finland's membership of the EU is causing surprise among Finns, because it results in rising costs and a falling level of services."
"Does the Commission regard the current competition situation in Finland as contrary to the Union's competition policy, and if so, what has the Commission done and what does it propose doing to remedy this situation and prevent the wrong picture being given in Finland of the effects of EU membership?"
"It is not surprising that when countries join a big single market such as the one we have there is also a movement of concentration, mergers and acquisition."
"This is part of the game and is happening every day everywhere in Europe."
"Obviously, and fortunately I would say, there are rules of the game."
"We have had the merger regulation since 1989."
"In the most important cases the Commission has the exclusive right to vet the mergers and the acquisitions."
"By the way, since 1988 we have had to vet more than 400 cases of big mergers and acquisitions."
"Everyone would agree that it has been a rather successful policy and in several cases we had to impose conditions on such mergers and acquisitions."
"In Finland there was the merger between Kymmene and Repola ."
"We imposed some conditions on that."
"In some other cases the Commission went as far as giving a red light and did not allow a merger or acquisition to go ahead."
"That is the rule of the game."
"The basic rule is that acquiring a dominant position by merger or by acquisition is not allowed."
"This is a real guarantee against too big mergers and certainly against the creation of dominant positions by means of mergers and acquisitions."
"I should also tell you that we have another instrument, namely Article 86."
"No-one should point the finger at a company which acquires a dominant position by virtue of its own strength rather than by merger or acquisition."
"But if it is abusing that position, the Commission can act and possibly impose heavy fines and this occasionally has been done."
"We have rules and if there are cases which the Commission should know about or where competitors think they have a case, they should file complaints with the Commission."
"Not that I am asking for extra work."
"Last year there was an increase of one-third in the number of cases, more than 30 % of the number of cases in the competition field, and this was only partly because of enlargement."
"Mr President, as pointed out in my question, the situation looks serious to the Finns, since the business concentration in question has taken place since we joined the Union. I would therefore once more request the Commission to underline the importance of competition, and to make its opinion known on the present situation, where acquisitions in the retail trade clearly have been made at a price considerably higher than the market price."
"Let me just say one thing."
"First of all, as you probably already know, the Commission wants to reduce the thresholds for the implementation of the merger regulation, because we are only competent with regard to big mergers, that means beyond ECU 5 billion for the companies concerned, which is really a large amount of money."
"We would like to reduce that threshold to ECU 2 bn, which would already give more scope for the Commission to look into that kind of merger."
"This might well apply in the case of Finland."
"There is the so-called Dutch clause - Article 22 of the merger regulation - which allows national authorities to take a case before the Commission even if the figure does not reach the threshold."
"So the government can send a case to us and the Commission will scrutinize it and if appropriate take a decision."
"So it is already possible for a national government to take that step."
"Although this clause is rarely used, it could well be used very soon in Finland, if I am well informed."
"I cannot be more specific but as far as I know the Finnish authorities are rather in favour of that kind of cooperation."
"Question No 56 by Felipe Camisón Asensio (H-0422/96)"
"Subject: Tobacco farming in the EU"
"What prospects does the Commissioner for agriculture envisage for tobacco farming in the EU in general and in Spain in particular?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell the honourable Member that, as provided for in the basic Council regulation on tobacco, the Commission will shortly be presenting a proposal on the future tobacco regime, to apply from the 1998 harvest onwards."
"The reform of the tobacco sector, carried out in 1992, will be reviewed at the same time."
"This review is not yet complete, and I therefore regret that at present, I am unable to make any detailed comments."
"With regard to Spain, however, I would make the point that, as in other less-favoured regions of the European Union, tobacco growing represents practically the only source of income for many small farmers there."
"Your answer was not a very specific one, Commissioner."
"However, I am grateful for the information you have given us concerning tobacco farming in the European Union in general, and in Spain in particular."
"I had hoped that this question would provide an opportunity to set out some specific guidelines for the future for the many small tobacco farmers in southern Europe - Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - and, more specifically, in the north of the province of Cáceres, Extremadura, which is the area that I am familiar with on a daily basis."
"You will be aware, Commissioner, that these farmers and their families are concerned for their future, since tobacco farming is an activity of great social importance which creates and supports a large number of jobs in the regions concerned."
"And I am sure that it is quite clear to the Commissioner that what must never occur is a drastic reduction in tobacco farming without prior provision for farming of an alternative, substitute crop with the same characteristics in terms of socio-economic benefits."
"This consideration must be taken into account, I believe, in the proposals for 1998, to which the Commissioner has just referred."
"Since the honourable Member is well acquainted with the procedure in the House, you will know that - once the Commission has completed its report - there will obviously be an opportunity for Parliament to discuss the issues you have raised."
"I am well aware how important tobacco growing is for many small farmers in the European Union."
"According to our estimates, some 400 000 jobs throughout the Union depend on it."
"Question No 57 by Ulf Holm (H-0428/96)"
"Subject: Subsidies to tobacco growers"
"About ECU 1 billion is paid to tobacco growers in the Union every year, whilst the smoking of tobacco causes diseases and human suffering."
"The provision of medical care for smokers costs vast amounts of money every year in the Member States."
"EU and national health programmes are aimed at reducing smoking as a way of combating cancer and other diseases."
"Does the Commission intend to cut aid to tobacco growers in future, in order to achieve consistency with its health-related objectives?"
"Does it intend to introduce measures to help tobacco growers switch over to growing other products which satisfy more basic human needs?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question is now being put the other way round, as it were."
"The questioner asserts that aid for tobacco growing leads to an increase in smoking, thereby compounding the health risks."
"But if you look at the state of the international market in tobacco, you will note that all that would increase, if the European Union were to discontinue its aid for tobacco growing, is imports on the one hand and unemployment on the other."
"People would be unlikely to smoke either more or less."
"After all, we do not subsidize the cost of cigarettes or cigars or any other smoking materials; all we try to do is enable European tobacco growers to operate cultivation methods and structures which can keep pace with world market prices for tobacco."
"Thank you for your answer, Mr Fischler."
"In view of the damage which tobacco causes and the health programmes run by both the Union and the individual Member States it is of the utmost importance that we should reduce smoking."
"There is naturally a conflict here and this is why I asked my second question about whether the Commission has any proposals on how to change production over from tobacco cultivation to the cultivation of some product which is more humane and more geared to good health."
"This is the answer I was really after in that the question you answered earlier mentioned that a great many small farmers continue to cultivate tobacco."
"How does the Commission intend to deal with this problem and find a new crop for these small farmers to grow?"
"I would repeat that even if we were to give these small farmers an opportunity to grow different crops, that is no reason to expect people in Europe to smoke less."
"The two things are completely separate, and must be kept apart."
"In any event, I think it would be premature to hold a detailed discussion today."
"I can assure you that our report, soon to be presented, will also ask what would happen if aid for tobacco growing were discontinued, so that you too will be able to assess the likely results and consequences of such an option."
"Some Members of the House - including the last questioner - have drawn attention to the importance of retaining this aid and preserving jobs in tobacco growing."
"We shall be able to discuss this with one another."
"Commissioner, I must say that I tend to take Mr Holm's line and I am glad that he has tabled the question, because it is the inconsistency of Community expenditure that worries many of us in this House."
"When I last looked at this issue, I discovered that 80 % of the value of the product is in fact Community subsidy to tobacco growers - 80 % - and that is not very helpful."
"The annual payment that some of the tobacco growers get is, in fact, more than the value of the land that tobacco is grown on."
"So, again, there is a huge inconsistency in what the Commission is trying to achieve."
"I tend to agree with alternative production, but some of these growers are very small growers indeed."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I would like to suggest to you that what we should do to try and get consistency in Community expenditure is, in fact, to decouple the payment from the product."
"I have a good deal of sympathy for what you say, but you should realize that you have at the same time given evidence of the fact that tobacco cannot be grown profitably in the European Union without subsidies."
"So a decision has to be made: either not to provide aid, but that then means no tobacco growing; or to keep the door open for tobacco growing, and that can only be done by granting aid."
"As to whether aid to tobacco growers is currently being provided in the best possible way, that is open to discussion, and will likewise be addressed in my report."
"I therefore do not wish to embark on a full discussion here and now."
"I wish to point out that subsidies for tobacco production not only go to the very poorest Members of the European Union but also to countries like France, Germany and Austria, which have among the highest income per head within the Union."
"Surely we should not be subsidizing very rich countries to produce what you have just said is a very unprofitable crop when there is absolutely no economic reason for doing so?"
"We should do away with that completely and help, through structural funds, those countries where there is a real economic problem and help them to develop alternative crops."
"Mrs Hardstaff, with the best will in the world, I cannot go along with your assertion that there are simply poor countries with poor farmers, and then rich countries with rich farmers who are not deserving of support."
"Unfortunately, because of the structures which exist - even in the country with the best structures in the European Union, namely the United Kingdom - some farmers are experiencing real income problems."
"It cannot, I am afraid, be inferred from the fact there are many wealthy farmers in the UK that those who do have problems there deserve no support."
"We cannot discuss the matter on this basis."
"Question No 58 by Gerard Collins (H-0427/96)"
"Subject: Emergency aid for Nyre Valley sheep farmers"
"Has the Commission been made aware of the freak snow storms in the Nyre Valley, Co. Waterford, Ireland last March which resulted in large scale losses of sheep and has the Commission been requested by the Irish Government to make emergency aid available to the Nyre Valley farmers?"
"Will the Commission now bring forward proposals to aid the many farmers who have had to endure large scale losses as a result of the abnormal weather conditions?"
"Mr President, the Commission is aware of the difficulties referred to in the question, which were caused by this snow storm and the freak weather conditions in the Nyre Valley in Ireland."
"However, I can tell you that the Irish authorities have not sought assistance from the Commission."
"The reason is very simple: as you know, the Community is not responsible for disaster relief and protection, which is the responsibility of the Member States."
"As the author is not present Question No 59 lapses."
"Question No 60 by Christine Crawley (H-0453/96)"
"Subject: Job losses in agricultural industries"
"What does the Commission estimate is the number of jobs lost and under threat in the European Union, in agriculture-related industries as a result of the BSE crisis and subsequent export bans?"
"What mechanisms for monitoring the effect on jobs has the Commission put into place, and what support will the Commission be making available to those people and industries affected by the BSE crisis?"
"The Commission has no precise statistics on how many jobs have been lost, or are at risk, in the processing industry, in slaughterhouses or in the cattle trade, as a result of the BSE crisis."
"We do not possess such information."
"It goes without saying, however, that the Commission is well aware of the problems and has begun to consider how they can best be minimized."
"One of the most important short-term measures which we have taken in this context is of course intervention."
"If, with the aid of intervention, we can compensate to some extent for the current slackness of the market and hasten a return to more normal market conditions, then that is the best thing we can do for those employed in this sector."
"Over and above that, to my mind, it is chiefly a matter of seeking to adopt longer-term confidence-building measures to boost the consumption of beef."
"Here the Commission is of course trying to help find solutions to overcome these serious difficulties and to restore consumer confidence."
"Also of relevance in this context - and this has major implications in terms of employment - are the measures agreed for animals over 30 months old which have recently been put into effect in the United Kingdom."
"The same applies to the measures, still to be agreed, which are intended to accelerate the eradication of the BSE disease."
"I believe that all these measures, taken together, do provide some relief in these difficult circumstances."
"I thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"I find it disappointing given the scale of the crisis that we have with BSE that the Commission has not yet asked for figures or started to look at the monitoring of the situation as far as jobs are concerned beyond the measures that the Commissioner has spoken about such as intervention and confidence-building."
"It is the Commission's responsibility to produce an annual employment report in the European Union and therefore I would suggest that it is very important that the Commission actually starts some scheme of monitoring the jobs and the sectors that are under threat in this crisis."
"I know anecdotally, as an individual Member of the European Parliament, that there are thousands of jobs under threat across the European Union because of the BSE crisis, not only in my own constituency, but in many of the European Union countries outside the United Kingdom."
"So I believe that it is important for the Commission to take this very seriously."
"I would ask what steps the Commission intends to take to ask for figures from the Member States on the threat to jobs and jobs that have already disappeared because of the BSE crisis?"
"Perhaps I might add that certain programmes are being implemented on a continuing basis: there are, for example, the Structural Fund resources, which can be used to assist Objective 5b or 5a areas, and which could be applied to support the restructuring of the rendering industry in the United Kingdom, for instance, or to promote investment."
"Other initiatives can also be taken under the Objective 3 and Objective 4 measures; these offer very specific support."
"With statistics alone, we cannot help anyone."
"However, if you think it important to have precise figures on the employment situation in this sector, I shall gladly pass the matter on to my colleague Mr Flynn, who is the Commissioner responsible."
"We could perhaps carry out a detailed survey, or else obtain information from the UK authorities."
"Mrs Crawley's question was about people in associated industries, the people who lost their jobs as a result of the ban, who work in the road haulage industry, the slaughterhouses, the meat-processing industry."
"I asked the Scottish Office if there are any programmes we can use to help, for example Objective 5(a) or Objective 5(b)."
"The Earl of Lindsay tells me that there are quite insurmountable obstacles in using EC structural funds."
"There are detailed legal obligations which cover these measures and it is not possible to set aside these provisions."
"But Objective 5(a) concerns grants for marketing and processing of agricultural products."
"If people are prevented from marketing or processing agricultural products, could we not use Objective 5(a) funds to assist them with this particular problem that we have at the moment?"
"I think we actually need to look at the scale of what is involved here."
"If you think that intervention costs are lower, I would point out that across the EU, the total amount in intervention has reached 150 000 tonnes. The cost of intervention for 100 000 tonnes is ECU 240 million."
"This means that we have already spent ECU 360 m on these measures alone, to enable the animals to be slaughtered immediately, because ultimately this boosts employment in slaughterhouses."
"If they are then stored in refrigerated warehouses, people are employed there too, and so on. If you now consider that an additional 25 000 animals per week are currently being slaughtered, under the provisions on animals over 30 months old, you will get some idea of the effect this is having on employment."
"I therefore believe that these large-scale measures are in fact the most important contribution in terms of employment."
"Moreover, I would draw your attention to the fact that the volume of turnover is significantly greater in the United Kingdom than in many other Member States."
"Although prices to farmers are low, the turnover of slaughterhouses is higher than in other Member States."
"The question of employment can certainly not be seen merely in the UK context."
"I should like to come back to Objective 5(a) and particularly budget line 886."
"I understand that from the period from 1994 to 1999, ECU 226.487 million were available to the UK to use for marketing and processing."
"In fact I understand that the UK Government is only wanting ECU 51 million of that, therefore not taking up ECU 175.304 million."
"For me that is a massive dimension of funding which could very well be invested in the UK economy to help those people in the industry."
"If you were to have a request from the UK Government to reinstate that ECU 175 million to use to solve the crisis and help the workers in the industry, would you be prepared to look at that favourably and would you be prepared to released those monies to the UK?"
"The figures which you have given tally exactly with my own figures."
"It goes without saying that the Commission is prepared to take decisions on measures under any directive, but we do need a request from the government responsible."
"As you will see from the footnote, the Commission has asked if we could take Question No 94 from Mrs Crepaz on basic foodstuffs - consumer protection."
"Question No 94 by Irene Crepaz (H-0465/96/rev. 1)"
"Subject: Basic foodstuffs - consumer protection"
"Which final products are directly or indirectly affected by the lifting of the ban on gelatine, tallow and bull semen?"
"What measures have been taken to inform and protect consumers (certificates, labelling, information campaigns)?"
"What is the Commission's attitude to the statement made in the context of the BSE crisis that producers of basic foodstuffs should take responsibility for these?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to bull semen, the final products covered by Decision 96/362 include products containing gelatine and tallow, which in the United Kingdom are manufactured strictly in accordance with the requirements of that decision."
"Under the decision, the raw material used to manufacture these products must originate from cattle under 30 months old that are not infected with BSE or suspected of infection."
"In addition, only tissue from types of raw material in which the virus has never been detected may be used."
"The raw material must be processed under veterinary supervision and in accordance with the procedures laid down in the annex to the decision, whereby an independent laboratory must certify that any infectious residue which may have been present in the original materials has been rendered inactive."
"The products listed in the annex must be labelled, or otherwise marked, with details of the manufacturer and the manufacturing process, and must bear a certificate of fitness for consumption issued by a veterinary official."
"The composition of the final products is visible to the consumer from the list of ingredients, which must appear on the label pursuant to Directive 79/112 on the labelling of foodstuffs."
"The Commission will consider the question of extending the rules on product liability to primary producers in the context of its current work on preparing a green paper on food legislation."
"Thank you for your comprehensive reply, Commissioner."
"I just have a brief supplementary question. The health of consumers really should be our overriding concern, and with regard to final products we now know, for example, that gelatine is contained in cake glazes and in jelly-babies, which are so popular with children."
"Can you assure me, with a clear conscience, that these do not contain any pathogens, and that they represent absolutely no health risk to consumers?"
"And with regard to bull semen, can you state with a clear conscience that no disease can be transmitted through it?"
"In reply to your last question concerning bull semen, I can say the following: we based our decision on the view of the experts on the Scientific Veterinary Committee, according to whom there is no risk associated with bull semen."
"As far as gelatine and tallow are concerned, perhaps I might describe the present situation once again: firstly, we asked the scientists to define a procedure which ensures that any possible trace of the BSE virus is inactivated, in other words destroyed."
"Secondly, we have stipulated that every manufacturer of gelatine and tallow in the United Kingdom must obtain a licence from the British Government."
"Thirdly, we have ensured that only certain specific products may be used to manufacture gelatine and tallow, namely those which I have already described."
"Only such tissue may be used."
"Fourth, the British Government is obliged to inform the Commission as soon as it awards a licence to an industrial company."
"Fifth, the Commission carries out an inspection in the UK - and invites all the other Member States to join it - and only once all these matters have been resolved to our satisfaction will the Commission formally decide that a particular British company may once again place gelatine or tallow on the market."
"Even then, every consignment must be accompanied by a certificate from the veterinary official, stating that all the rules have been complied with during the production process, and indicating the frequency of inspections carried out in that company by the veterinary official."
"In effect, this means that we now have a blueprint for the future, and it is now up to the British Government - and of course the industry in Britain - to see how rapidly they can adapt their procedures so as to meet the requirements for safe production and enable these inspections to be carried out."
"No one can say at present when exports of gelatine will in fact be resumed."
"Question No 61 by Roy Perry (H-0474/96)"
"Subject: BSE"
"The significant difference between the large number of cases of BSE in the United Kingdom and the declared cases of BSE in other Member States has been partly attributed to the United Kingdom's greater vigilance and understanding of this disease."
"BSE has only recently become a notifiable disease, and it is evident that this disease has not been as closely monitored in other Member States in comparison with the United Kingdom."
"Does the Commission consider the statistical evidence of BSE to be both accurate and equivalent for all Member States, and has it set up a mechanism whereby cases of BSE can be accurately monitored and confirmed throughout the EU?"
"Mr President, according to the latest information, the most likely cause of the BSE epidemic is the feeding of cattle with meat and bone meal derived from processed materials containing sheep carcasses affected by scrapie."
"The unusually high incidence of BSE in the United Kingdom, compared with the other Member States, can be attributed to various factors."
"A risk assessment of these factors has revealed that the circumstances which can cause such a high incidence of the disease, and also a high prevalence of scrapie - a change in the method of processing carcasses and a high proportion of meat and bone meal in feed - exist to this extent only in the UK."
"BSE became a notifiable disease throughout the Community under Decision 90/130/EEC, in the context of Council Directive 89/894."
"Commission Decision 94/474/EC stipulates that where carcass inspections reveal clinical signs of BSE, such animals must be confiscated and their brains examined for BSE."
"The Commission has arranged training courses for national experts on issues relating to the detection of BSE, so as to ensure that all the Member States are adequately equipped to diagnose it."
"The Scientific Veterinary Committee, having examined the question of disease monitoring by means of sample checks, concluded that such a procedure would be unlikely to contribute significantly to detection of the small amounts of the BSE virus which might exist in the Member States."
"I thank the Commissioner for his reply but I have to say that farmers in my constituency say to me they have grave doubts about the validity of statistics in other countries of the European Union which are very low compared with the United Kingdom."
"Only this weekend there are reports from scientists in such places as the Dutch Institute of Science and Health and Tübingen University, which throw grave doubts on the figures coming from other European countries."
"Between 1985 and 1989 57, 000 cattle from the United Kingdom were exported to countries in the European Union."
"Had they remained in Britain those scientists would have expected something like 1, 600 cases of BSE to be declared."
"In reality only 30 cases have been declared and I repeat the question: does the Commission have any system at all for monitoring and validating the statistics that are coming from these other countries?"
"Has he any comments on these reports now coming from European scientific foundations?"
"Mr President, the Commission keeps the scientists informed continuously both of the detailed statistics and the most recent history of the disease, and frequent discussions also take place in meetings of the BSE subcommittee of the Scientific Veterinary Committee."
"The fact that, to date, 99 % of cases have occurred in the United Kingdom and only around one per cent in all the other countries of the world is not attributable to other countries being less meticulous as regards the obligation to notify the disease."
"This disease is notifiable in all countries, and we can therefore assume that the Member States are fulfilling their responsibilities in this respect."
"It would also be very useful in future - although a good deal of research is still needed - if we could find out not just after an animal has been stricken with BSE that the sickness has occurred, but could also test for the disease, as it were."
"That is why I have asked the so-called Weissmann Group to propose some research projects, so that such tests might become a reality as soon as possible."
"That would considerably facilitate the handling of this disease."
"That concludes Question Time. Questions not taken for lack of time will be answered in writing."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.27 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Practice of the profession of lawyer (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0146/96) by Mrs Fontaine, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive (COM(94)0572 - C4-0125/95-94/0299(COD)) to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a Member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained."
"Mr President, the draft directive which is the subject of this debate has two objectives: on the one hand, to give effect to the freedom of establishment of lawyers within the European Union by means of a specific directive; and, on the other, to facilitate the participation of legal experts in crossborder commercial operations in which, by virtue of the very nature of the internal market, international, Community and national legislation are increasingly overlapping."
"There is no reason why these two objectives should conflict, but nor are they are necessarily complementary, as this draft directive makes clear."
"Indeed, certain safeguards built into the draft directive, and which can be seen as an attempt to ensure expert advice in cross-border operations, do themselves represent obstacles to the freedom of establishment, such as the restriction of the practice period and the retention of aptitude tests."
"These restrictions, if applied, would give rise to different conditions for the practice of the profession in a host Member State for migrant lawyers and lawyers who are nationals of that Member State, and this would obviously be a violation of the right of establishment, which is based on the principle of equal conditions."
"Certainly, it is not all negative."
"The draft directive has some positive aspects which I have no difficulty in recognizing, such as the satisfactory solution to the question of professional and ethical rules; the establishment of the possibility of group practice; and the completion, in spite of the restrictions I have referred to, of the Community legal framework for the freedom of establishment of lawyers."
"However, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur - which, as she herself said, are the product of a compromise - markedly improve the draft directive, especially those aimed at guaranteeing the right to maintain more than one place of work within the Community, strengthening consumer protection and safeguarding the independence of the legal profession and the right to practise independently."
"Finally, I am obliged to say that we should have taken liberalization much further and deleted all references to temporal restrictions, including the requirement of three years' regular pursuit of an activity involving the law, which I regard as a lesser evil."
"In these restrictions, certain features of the type of corporatism which I reject survive, although a reasonable effort to achieve a compromise has been made. Naturally, on behalf of my group, I support that effort."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the peculiarities of the British legal system, with the division of the legal profession into solicitors and barristers, and the peculiarities of the Romano-Germanic legal systems which apply in the majority of the other Member States, have too often resulted in a total lack of reciprocity in the freedom of lawyers to exercise their profession in another Member State."
"Mrs Fontaine's report concerns the interests of the legal profession as a whole."
"It deals in particular with the question of the right of migrant lawyers to practise their profession permanently under their home-country professional title in another Member State."
"The National Front and the Group of the European Right support the original position of the French bar, which was in favour of the automatic integration of migrant lawyers into the host-country bar and the adoption of the host-country professional title following a period of practice in that country."
"Like many lawyers in France and other Member States, we have reservations as regards the possibility of practising permanently under the home-country professional title, without any limit of time."
"And like the French bar, we are opposed to the absence of genuine controls and restrictions on the activities of migrant lawyers in host Member States."
"We also wish to protect the interests of citizens subject to the law, and we are calling for genuine and de facto equal treatment of lawyers registered in France, for example, and migrant lawyers."
"In particular, fiscal and public service constraints must not be a burden on host-country lawyers alone."
"The French bar expressed its opposition to the first draft of this report, which it considered to be prejudicial to the profession."
"Mrs Fontaine and her colleagues in the Legal Affairs Committee have finally drawn up a compromise text."
"We pay tribute to the rapporteur's considerable efforts, but we are not entirely satisfied with the resulting text, in which, against all the odds and with a great deal of perseverance, she has managed to combine a variety of points of view."
"It is for this reason that we are reserving our position on the report and the draft directive."
"Mr President, the draft directive on the practice of the profession of lawyer is the outcome of fruitful cooperation between the Commission, Parliament and the profession concerned, aimed at achieving a balanced text which effectively ensures the freedom of establishment, whilst retaining certain essential safeguards."
"Following the adoption of the general directive on the mutual recognition of qualifications, the bars of Europe - with the exception of the Luxembourg bar, which bowed out from the start - took the view that there was a need for a specific directive to give full effect to the 1988 directive, and not to restrict its scope, as Mr Wijsenbeek seems to believe, if I understood him correctly."
"The profession, as represented by the Consultative Committee of the Bars and Law Societies of the European Community, worked hard on this project for a number of years."
"The CCBE made sufficient progress to convince the Commission of the need to submit a proposal for a directive, but not to achieve the very broad consensus necessary for the adoption of the text."
"We undoubtedly owe it to the authority, patience and persistence of Mrs Fontaine that it was possible for the profession and the European Parliament to overcome the remaining obstacles and reach agreement on the text submitted to us."
"I should like to make two comments concerning this text."
"Firstly, the debate has understandably centred on the remaining obstacles: aptitude tests, and the right to practise under the home-country professional title."
"However, this should not lead us to forget the other important provisions of the text."
"I am thinking in particular of those concerning joint practice, which should enable our bars to compete on an equal footing with large-scale United States and Japanese practices, which have never needed directives in order to cream off the legal market in Europe by playing on our divisions."
"My second comment concerns the particular question of the right to practise under the home-country professional title, an issue on which, as was pointed out a few moments ago, the French bar is especially sensitive."
"I believe that the proposed text gives the necessary assurances."
"It clearly makes migrant lawyers practising under their home-country title subject to the regulations, codes of conduct and disciplines of the bars of host Member States."
"Lastly, Amendment No 35, which provides a useful clarification of the integration mechanism that is being established, will meet the expectations expressed by a number of bars, including in particular the Paris bar."
"It now remains for the Council to put the finishing touches to the text, with the help of Mr Monti."
"Is it being overoptimistic to hope that it will do so quickly?"
"The adoption of this directive has been dragging on for some ten years now - if not for the 17 or 18 years of other directives."
"In any event, it is undoubtedly desirable to consolidate the consensus which has been achieved on Mrs Fontaine's report without delay."
"Mr President, the proposal for a directive which we are discussing today is undoubtedly one of those measures which, to paraphrase Robert Schuman, strengthen the building of Europe."
"And this measure, like so many others, bears the hallmark of men and women who have proved capable of overcoming national fears and prejudices in the interests of a European vision of Europe, as Carl J. Friedrich says in his book 'Europa: Das Entstehen einer Nation' ."
"Besides your own name, Commissioner - and I wish to echo the praise of previous speakers - that of the rapporteur, Nicole Fontaine, a French and European lawyer, whose good offices will for ever be associated with this directive, stands out on this list."
"And I should also like to place on record, in the report of Parliament's proceedings, the efforts of another lawyer, this time European and German - Hans Weil, who from his position as chairman of the CCBE, the legal profession's representative body in the European Union, illuminated the debate with his intellectual honesty and rigour."
"Tomorrow's vote will therefore have the particular importance of setting out the future of Europe's legal profession."
"At the same time, however, it will be of general importance, since the issue under discussion goes beyond the strictly professional domain to encompass European society as a whole, and to encompass the citizens whom this Parliament represents - because indeed, we lawyers are the 'voices of the law' , to use the fortunate expression coined by Alfonso X, Spanish and European king, in his compilation of the laws of Castile."
"The debate on this directive in committee brought to the surface the most obscure national fears and the most deep-seated mistrust between those of us who are called upon to pursue this common project of social, cultural and political integration, based on the rule of law."
"In the face of such mean-spirited and short-sighted attitudes, the Committee on Legal Affairs, led by the rapporteur, has managed to achieve through the amendments a comprehensive solution which is both prudent and courageous - as Mr Rothley rightly pointed out - and which I am sure will receive the overwhelming support of the House tomorrow."
"For let no one doubt the fact: European integration must be based on the rule of law."
"Europe will be a Community of law, or it will be nothing - in other words, it will rapidly return to being what, strictly speaking, it has never ceased to be: a single market governed by the prevailing economic forces."
"Europe will be a Community of law, or it will be nothing."
"And this project will only be consolidated if professionals in the legal arts, especially lawyers, become aware of their social function and prove capable of rising above the particularities of national legal systems, to build Europe on the acquis communautaire represented by the general principles of the law, as refined by our legal history and embodied in the Union's founding treaties."
"For if lawyers are not capable of ensuring that the general takes precedence over the particular, of emphasizing that which unites over that which divides, can we realistically expect this attitude from those who are not specialists in the law, which is the art of integration par excellence ?"
"Lawyers must prove capable of recognizing the fact that the principle which ultimately governs acceptance of a case is the ethical obligation not to participate in a lawsuit, not to give advice, without sufficient knowledge."
"And this rule requires a Spanish lawyer, for example, not to take part in a case involving the statutory provisions of a Catalan will, although his professional title formally permits him to do so, in exactly the same way as it requires him not to participate in a case involving German inheritance law."
"It should not be forgotten that what prevents him from taking part in these cases is the responsibility imposed by his professional code of conduct not to participate without sufficient technical knowledge."
"I am coming to the end, Mr President."
"I referred to the social function of lawyers."
"The legal profession is faced with the exciting challenge of combining the inevitably commercial aspects of the practice of the law with its social function."
"Because its ultimate raison d'être , beyond any other consideration, is to defend our citizens, our fundamental rights and public freedoms, and the spiritual heritage which constitutes the foundations of European civilization."
"Clearly, the creation of an area of freedom and security is everyone's joint task."
"But lawyers will play a particularly important role in this respect."
"As the voices of the law, they must speak out clearly and firmly in defence of the law and justice, and in defence of Europe, in order to ensure that the European Union provides a reference point and an incentive in a world of turmoil."
"Mr President, following a virtually unanimous request put forward by lawyers, the Commission has presented a proposal for a directive, which we are now discussing."
"The general directive from 1988 on the acknowledgement of qualifications with respect to this sector has proved poor and inadequate, since most Member States of the EU have chosen an alternative permitted by the directive involving the introduction of a compulsory aptitude test for professional practice, which in reality has hindered the free practice of the profession of lawyer."
"It is regrettable that despite the experience gained from the regulations in force and from the practice of the European Court of Justice, the Commission has not presented an amended proposal to this general directive nor a proposal which would at least make the free movement of lawyers possible."
"I consider this free movement to include not only the free movement of practising lawyers, but also the actual freedom to offer one's services."
"The Commission has however chosen to give a special sectoral directive and to maintain the principle on a restrictive aptitude test."
"Today the Committee on Legal Affairs is proposing 27 amendments, by which fundamental changes are made to the Commission's proposal."
"The purpose of these amendments is to increase the opportunities for a lawyer of one Member State to establish himself in another Member State."
"The committee proposes that it would be possible to practise the profession of lawyer in all Member States provided that the lawyer permanently uses the professional title from his own country."
"The group that I represent is not certain whether the proposal put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs in principle is consistent and logical."
"We have therefore presented amendments with the purpose of emphasizing that each lawyer has the right to move to a Member State other than where he has qualified for the profession and to practise the profession in accordance with the regulations of the host Member State."
"May I ask the Commission to give its view in detail on the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the group that I represent."
"Finally I would like to congratulate Mrs Fontaine on an excellent report."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Fontaine on her excellent report, on which there are a number of comments I wish to make."
"With this report, we are at something of a crossroads."
"The legal professions, of which lawyers are one of several - business trustees, notaries and the like - are of course based on their national legal systems."
"In recent years, however, there has been a growing need within the European Union for these professions - to which I myself belong - to look beyond national borders."
"This has obviously made it necessary to get to grips with other legal systems."
"I am not in favour of compartmentalizing this profession by erecting an artificial barrier to access, and the report says the same thing."
"On the other hand, the legal safety of the citizens in our countries is at stake."
"That means devising a system which will serve two purposes: on the one hand, free access to the profession must be guaranteed, in any country of the European Union; and, on the other, a lawyer must have sufficient knowledge of the legal system concerned to ensure that clients and companies receive the best possible advice."
"I believe that the Commission's proposal - to lay down a clear definition of this professional title throughout Europe - is a very good one; the discussion about whether lawyers can operate in joint practice, or in companies with share capital or partnerships, is also very welcome, because I think that this question will be of particular relevance to the profession in the future."
"The functions of lawyers should not, in my opinion, be seen in narrow terms, but they should also be regarded as business advisers."
"In the future, it will certainly be necessary to do this."
"If these directives and the debate on them open up such a prospect, then the report is a good starting-point for a very fruitful discussion."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Fontaine and colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights for their considered and intelligent discussion of this topic."
"This is an important plank in the freedom to establish services and the completion of the single market."
"It gives room for recognition of the fact that lawyers can practice under home title in other countries."
"It is particularly important for lawyers in England and Wales as English law is an international commercial law."
"It is particularly important in the areas of shipping contracts, i.e. charter parties, commercial contracts, insurance, reinsurance, banking contracts and rescheduling of debts, which often specify English law as a law-governing contract even though neither of the parties is of English origin."
"I would like to flag up one linguistic problem."
"Amendments Nos 25 and 35 should state 'public interest' and not 'public order' as has been translated."
"In conclusion, this is the usual understated, erudite competence which we expect and usually find from Mrs Fontaine."
"Mr President, the report that we are scrutinizing today is a compromise."
"A compromise which embraces various approaches and attempts to indicate ways forward on the important issue of the practice of the profession of lawyer in a country other than that in which the qualification was obtained."
"However, Mr President, I do not think that it matters very much that the result of so much time-consuming hard work, which has been overwhelmingly approved in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the plenary and accepted by the great majority of the administrative councils of the Bars and Law Societies of the European Community, is a compromise."
"Of much greater importance, in my view, is the quality of the compromise, and in that regard Mrs Nicole Fontaine deserves all our congratulations."
"Because this compromise, as set out in her report, leads in the right direction."
"It gives real meaning to freedom of establishment."
"It constitutes an advance for the Union and for Europe."
"We are getting rid of provisions which, essentially, have perpetuated protectionism and cast doubt on our reason - how else could the imposition of examinations on professionals who have practised their profession for years be explained. So I think that we should all accept that Mrs Fontaine's compromise is a good step forward."
"On such a subject it is only natural that many people should have had reservations and objections."
"We in Greece, too, have had a lot of difficulties."
"Just as an example, I can mention the problem of the establishment of law firms in Greece via a particular method and with elements that are not applicable in other European countries."
"Of course, we all had to surmount those problems rather than persist with reservations which would have worked against the solutions put forward today by Mrs Fontaine."
"I followed at close hand the first stage of this substantial and lengthy endeavour of hers which has led to today's outcome, and I think that both she and the Committee on Legal Affairs, and, from tomorrow, the whole of Parliament, will be able to feel well-satisfied with the new prospect that has been opened up."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine, on this report on the proposal for a directive on the practice of the profession of lawyer."
"I believe that ensuring the freedom to practise the profession of lawyer throughout the European Union represents a further step towards achieving the political integration of the Union and guaranteeing the democratic rights of all its citizens."
"We must interpret the rules concerning access to the professional title of a host Member State, whereby automatic entry to the bar is prevented and a period of practice in the host country is required, as a positive step which in the short term will enable the system to function and, in the long term, may be adapted to new circumstances."
"The current problems may well be simply the kind of temporary difficulties which are characteristic of an adaptation period - a period which will pave the way for the proper functioning of the system in the future."
"Furthermore, I welcome Amendment No 7 to Article 1, which provides for the establishment of the professional title 'lawyer' in all the official languages of the Spanish state. It is a good thing that this recognition of all Spain's official languages should appear in a text concerning the profession of lawyer, since lawyers are traditionally the most important defenders of human rights and the collective rights of peoples."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to congratulate Mrs Fontaine on her excellent report and thank her for the understanding that she has shown throughout her work for Luxembourg's special circumstances."
"The Luxembourg bar currently has 620 lawyers, 27 % of whom are non-nationals."
"This is clearly proof that the free movement of lawyers is a reality in Luxembourg."
"Furthermore, national and non-national lawyers in Luxembourg coexist in a harmonious and collegiate way, and the user of legal services - the citizen - has confidence in lawyers registered with the Luxembourg bar, whatever their nationality, because he has the assurance - since all these lawyers have received specific training in Luxembourg law, which is different from French, Belgian, German or any other law - of being properly defended before the courts by lawyers who know both their job and Luxembourg law, as well as the specific jurisprudence of the country."
"If this new directive is applied, what is in danger of happening?"
"Firstly, the user of legal services will no longer know where he stands."
"Will the lawyer he chooses be familiar with Luxembourg law or not?"
"There will be a risk of being poorly defended before the courts, and this will lead consumers to choose their lawyers according to nationality, something which at present does not happen in Luxembourg."
"Consequently, instead of promoting the free movement of lawyers, the new directive is in danger of hindering it."
"Furthermore, there will also be discrimination between national and non-national lawyers who have taken the supplementary courses in Luxembourg law and their colleagues who are admitted to the profession without having undergone the same process."
"In order to protect the users of Luxembourg's legal services, without jeopardizing the freedom of movement, and to defend the interests of lawyers of all nationalities registered with the Luxembourg bar, I have tabled two amendments. The first concerns the obligation to know the law of the host Member State, and the second concerns the requirement to be familiar with the languages legally recognized as judicial languages in the host Member State."
"I should like to thank in advance all those Members who are kind enough to support these amendments."
"Mr President, I too extend my congratulations to the rapporteur, especially for the compromise text that she has produced, with which I find myself overwhelmingly in agreement."
"There was one very important point that I made at the committee stage which, I regret to say, has not been taken up by the services: that is to point out that Article 10(3) should be correctly translated into English as 'public interest' , not 'public order' ."
"As colleagues are aware - particularly those who follow football and other sporting events where public disorder is very much the order of the day - it is important that the text should read correctly in all languages."
"I would like your assurance that tonight the services will take this on board and that Article 10(3) will now read 'public interest' , and not 'public order' ."
"This problem has already been dealt with by the relevant services."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to join the ranks of those congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine, on her tremendous feat of having produced this excellent report."
"I also welcome the objective of this report - to improve freedom of movement for lawyers by means of this specific supplementary directive - especially as the general directive fails to clarify the question of the right to practise on a permanent basis under the so-called home title, and because the aptitude test laid down in Directive 89/48 has often been a real obstacle to the freedom of establishment of lawyers."
"Personally, however, I wonder whether the approach of the Fontaine report to solving these problems will find favour with the professional groups concerned and, more generally, if it will meet the needs of people seeking legal advice."
"Guided by the Community-spirited principle of mutual trust between the Member States, Mrs Fontaine, you have drawn up a very far-reaching proposal."
"Through your exemplary work, you have managed to align the position of the European Parliament with that of lawyers in many areas."
"The amendments to Articles 2 and 5 of the Commission proposal, on the practice of the profession and home titles, address comprehensively what is a pressing concern of lawyers."
"However, the crux of this directive is the provision in Article 10 which eases the existing requirement of an aptitude test."
"This certainly goes too far: to my mind, it is not enough to guarantee automatic, complete integration after three years of effective and unbroken activity in the law of the host country, without any formal criteria."
"I suggest taking up the proposal of the CCBE that an interview, rather than an examination as such, should be held."
"That would, I believe, be a thoroughly fair compromise, which would in particular suit the smaller Member States."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"Satellite personal communications services"
"The next item is the report (A4-0179/96) by Mr Hoppenstedt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision (COM(95)0529 - C4-0517/95-95/0274(COD)) on an action at Union level in the field of satellite personal communications services in the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Ronald Reagan launched his Strategic Defence Initiative - known as 'Star Wars' - in the early 1980s, the general reaction was to regard it as a piece of science fiction."
"The plan was for a network of satellites to monitor the entire planet in real time in order to detect enemy missiles and knock them off course, possibly using lasers."
"Although the project is more than likely to be mothballed indefinitely, it had a spin-off in terms of research - initially subsidized research - into satellite technologies."
"That is why America is now the leader in the field."
"The main practical uses of these satellites are in telecommunications and broadcasting, services that we use very intensively."
"Most telecommunications or broadcasting satellites currently in use are geostationary, orbiting at a height of 36 000 km, and of course they need to have a 'footprint' on the earth's surface, which is a relatively cumbersome and unwieldy arrangement."
"For that reason, development work began on new technologies using satellites at lower orbits."
"Some of these are at a height of 10 355 km, but there are also some in the range 7001400 km, the so-called LEOs - low earth orbit satellites - which are the subject of our debate today."
"I believe there has been a lack of awareness among Europeans in recent years as regards the development and use of these new technologies."
"The leaders in the field are American companies which are able to obtain licences in America but then seek to operate throughout the world."
"In Europe, we have failed to give European companies a stake in this area of development."
"We are merely passengers in these sectors, trying to hitch a ride without knowing exactly where we want to go or who is in the driving seat."
"That is why it is vital for the industry in Europe to wake up and play a part in shaping satellite development, and in particular to have some structural involvement so that we can also then keep pace in terms of jobs."
"No matter how many white papers on employment we produce, we shall never make up for any missed opportunities in this field."
"The Commission has responded in the right way by stating that it has a responsibility to spur the Member States of the European Union into action."
"We must keep reminding them that this particular area of satellite technology is one in which new markets will develop."
"The Commission has done a good job in this respect."
"Unfortunately, however, the Member States of the European Union were caught napping again at the ITU conference in Geneva last year, and allowed Bill Gates and his new company to reserve all the frequencies in individual countries throughout the world for data transmission through a system of 840 orbiting satellites."
"This means that terrestrial frequencies may face new competition in a form over which Europeans no longer have any influence."
"A considerable number of launchers will also be needed to put 844 satellites into orbit."
"That will cost money and that is added value - and we may miss out on our share of it."
"In this proposal, the Commission has asked to be involved in issuing licences and in international negotiations with third countries."
"The Member States - who are not our main concern in this debate, although as rapporteur I had to bear them in mind in order to achieve a practicable result - are naturally also involved, because they are responsible for allocating frequencies."
"Here in Parliament, therefore, we have proposed that in the event of a failure to agree on frequency allocation, or in international negotiations on the issue, the Commission should be given a mandate."
"I hope that the Council will recognize the pragmatic nature of what we are asking for, and will not interpret it as weakness on the part of Parliament."
"I am sure that the Commission will assert its rights in negotiations with the Council, so that a sensible outcome can be achieved for European companies."
"I am also sure that the Commission will continue to press for a mandate from European companies and the Member States, because only recently, at the WTO conference, the Americans tried to have the whole satellite system excluded from the agreement on telecommunications."
"What they were up to there is not clear."
"We must be vigilant in this area, and I am sure that the Commission too will continue to take a lively interest in it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to make a number of points that I put forward in the Committee on Energy, Research and Technology, that were mentioned in my opinion and follow on quite naturally from what has just been said by the rapporteur on the substance, Mr Hoppenstedt."
"There is an important difference between satellite telephone services and multimedia services via satellite."
"In the case of the former, the reference is to mobile terminals whose main purpose is planet-roaming, the possibility then of travelling all around the world with just one telephone terminal."
"The technology is there, the international consortia have been set up - and European industries are also involved in them - and the pilot projects are ready to get under way."
"In contrast, the multimedia satellite service sector, Teledesic - that of Bill Gates, let us be clear about this - is still at the stage of technological development, particularly as regards onboard satellite processing in which interesting possibilities of technological competition between the United States and Europe remain."
"Furthermore, the content of the services and the actual operators have yet to be clearly identified."
"That being so, I have suggested that a clearer distinction be made in the Commission proposal for a decision between the approach to the former and the latter."
"As regards satellite telephone services, given the very small number of potential operators and the relatively limited interest in Europe for that service as compared with the cellular service, GSM, there seems to be no justification for the Commission setting up a new selection procedure which would delay bringing the new services into operation."
"Moreover, the fact that there are several operators means that competition is secured."
"I agree with the rapporteur, however, on the need to harmonize the procedures for the award of licences, but I do not think that the role of the Commission can extend beyond that segment."
"I have spoken on other occasions in the House - and Commissioner Bangemann will remember this - in favour of a 'European Federal Communication Commission' ."
"I am therefore in favour of the European Union having a regulatory function but I do not believe that this dossier justifies the Commission being given responsibility for selection."
"Through Amendment No 11, however, I am suggesting that we increase research into, the promotion and regulation of multimedia satellite services, the other category in fact."
"It is in that sector that the future of the information society is being played out and it will be important that Europe is not caught unprepared."
"To conclude: there has been substantial agreement with the views of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the rapporteur, Mr Hoppenstedt, whom I congratulate on an excellent piece of work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Hoppenstedt has explained with his customary skill and great clarity, we are examining this evening a proposal for a decision on an action at a Union level in the field of satellite personal communications services."
"In fact, a network of satellites covering the whole planet in real time already exists."
"It is the bastard offspring - so to speak - of President Reagan's 'Star Wars' project."
"This network makes possible the creation of satellite personal communications systems, which will offer the equivalent of cellular phones with a world coverage - although, of course, at a far higher cost - and will therefore be used in sparsely populated regions which are not served by cellular networks."
"Substantial investment will be necessary to achieve this goal, and this opens up some interesting prospects for the European space industry."
"Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that this project also covers fields other than telephony, notably multimedia communication."
"A project of this importance undoubtedly requires a coordinated approach at international, and especially European level."
"And it is in this context that the Commission is envisaging the adoption of a single Community procedure for selecting operators and granting licences to them."
"Whilst I understand the Commission's thinking, I have to say that, on the whole, I do not support its proposal for a decision, an attitude which is very much in line with that of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"Besides the problem of the Member States' sovereignty, which is largely ignored in the Commission proposal, there are other considerations which disturb us."
"Indeed, given the small number of potential global competitors, who are bound to reach agreement on the distribution of the available spectrum, we feel that it is pointless to impose the selection of operators."
"Moreover, the proposal does not seem to take account of the requirements of the draft 'licences' directive regarding harmonization and the possibility of obtaining an authorization which is valid throughout the Community from a single regulatory body."
"Even if this directive does not concern individual licences, it could provide a framework for discussions which the Commission should try to complement."
"Like the rapporteur, I approve the Commission's concern to establish a harmonized Community approach to the issue as soon as possible."
"Finally, we believe that prior to any international negotiations, Community cooperation should be promoted, with a view to establishing a single position which the Commission can then defend in international forums."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hoppenstedt's excellent report brings us up to date on the implementation of an information infrastructure project of which the least that can be said is that it is truly global."
"The strategic implications of the systems and services involved are considerable, and very important to the European market and European industry, especially in view of the global consequences of the transfers of technology from the military to the civilian sector, in particular in the United States."
"At international level, the question of satellite personal communications systems and services recently took a new turn when, in the multilateral negotiations on telecommunications in the WTO, the United States decided to adopt a more intransigent attitude, threatening to exclude this sector from any future agreement. At present, therefore, there is no guarantee that satellite systems will be included in the final commitment that the United States will make at the end of the negotiations."
"Furthermore, the fact that a mechanism exists in the United States for granting space segment licences will give rise to discrimination against systems of non-US origin."
"The Commission's initial draft has provoked strong opposition from a number of Member States. This is mainly for institutional reasons, since it provides for implementing procedures which are difficult to accept - especially as regards the powers attributed to the Commission - and give rise to serious doubts as to their conformity with the Treaty."
"In view of the new situation created by the state of the negotiations in the WTO, it is essential to harmonize the negotiating positions within the Council as soon as possible, and to refer to the mechanisms provided for in the draft directive on licences when it comes to matters concerning the harmonization of authorization conditions and the content of terrestrial segment licences."
"The amendments adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, at the instigation of Mr Malerba in particular, make some important improvements in this respect, for example the removal of the questionable mechanism for the selection of space segment operators by the Commission."
"Another step in the right direction is the proposed integration of the rules on the terrestrial infrastructure for satellite personal communications services into the harmonized system of licences and authorizations."
"In the view of the UPE Group, the proposed amendments in the international section also help to improve the draft decision, except for the possibility of giving the Commission a mandate to negotiate the allocation of frequencies within the ITU, in place of the Member States."
"There does not appear to be any good reason for such a delegation of authority, which would also seem to be incompatible with the current statutes of that organization."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Hoppenstedt, but also take the opportunity of making the following comment of my own: when will the Commission finally submit a framework directive that will allow us to debate the basic outline conditions for liberalization of the telecommunications sector and the preconditions in terms of social policy?"
"And when will the common framework for general authorizations and individual licences - which the Commission has already submitted - make its progress through the legislative procedure?"
"I should also like to raise some questions which, while they may be naive, concern what I regard as fundamental issues."
"Firstly, there are the conditions for harmonizing selection, as referred to in the reports and by previous speakers."
"I think it is clear that the Commission has consciously chosen not to make a sharp distinction between satellite-based personal communications on the one hand and broadband multimedia services on the other, in order to have an instrument that will allow it effective involvement in selection decisions in the latter area."
"That is by no means an unwise move, if one recalls the saga of satellite broadcasting and the key role that it played in the establishment of private television channels."
"My second point is that a market is being talked about here, and at the same time we are being told that there are currently three providers operating across the world."
"I cannot help recalling the words of the great John Locke, the founder of modern liberal thinking, on the question of what constitutes a market: ' Being but two they could not agree' ."
"Does this mean that if they had been three, it would have been possible to set up mutual relations based on the exchange of equivalents? If there is anyone here who believes that, I will buy them a drink!"
"I should like to begin by thanking the House, and in particular Mr Hoppenstedt, for the swift response to our proposal, since in spite of all the differences between your position and ours which came across clearly in the debate, there can be no disagreement on one point, namely that if we do not act quickly, no solution will be achievable - whether it is the one proposed by the House, that sought by the Commission or a compromise between the two - because what Mr Hoppenstedt said was true: our competitors, especially in the USA, are wide awake!"
"They scored a partial success at the ITU conference."
"They are going to invite European companies to take part in the venture, indeed they are already making moves in that direction, but Mr Hoppenstedt was also right to say that the European firms are likely to end up as passengers. Their share will not be enough to give them a decisive role, and they will certainly not be able to determine the course of events."
"There are many possible definitions of a market."
"Where there is only one operator, however, there is no market, but rather a monopoly."
"The problem with satellite communications, for whatever purpose they are used, is that in place of the public monopolies which existed in Member States in the past, there will now be a private monopoly."
"Parliament has repeatedly warned us that while deregulation might break up public monopolies, it could open the way for private ones."
"I am genuinely at a loss to understand the tone of the debate. On the one hand, while we are to remain vigilant, there is thought to be relatively little chance of our competitors turning their lead into actual monopoly positions; on the other, our proposals are dismissed as an understandable but basically unacceptable attempt by the Commission to acquire new powers."
"That is certainly not what we are doing, and the selection procedure, which has attracted various comments in the debate, must definitely not be the norm."
"It may even be that it is the exception, and we go so far as to assume that that will be the case."
"To that extent, we do not regard the arguments which have been put forward here in favour of the amendments as being conclusive."
"Of course the House was right to make the point in the debate that satellite personal communications will come under the general 'licences' directive which is soon to be approved."
"However, that directive does not address issues of harmonization - which are certainly not covered by individual licences - and nor are there any plans for the coordination of decisions by the individual countries in good time, and that is the crucial factor."
"I have always had the greatest respect for Mr Hoppenstedt's contribution in this area, even before I took over this portfolio on behalf of the Commission, but I must be absolutely frank about one thing, and Mr Hoppenstedt knows that it is a point of difference between us. What Parliament is proposing here with these amendments may well be the position which eventually emerges as a compromise from the Council."
"That is quite possible, and we can only hope that a compromise does emerge."
"But in terms of tactics and strategy, I think it is illadvised to open discussions with the Council from such a position, and that is why we are against allowing individual national licences which would merely be coordinated."
"Such a system will not be in place in time and it will not work, quite apart from the fact that in some cases, Mr Caudron, there are inherent anomalies, for example if every Member State has to issue individual satellite licences."
"Luxembourg is a country for which I have the very greatest respect, but I have to query the idea of one or more satellites intended for use in satellite personal communications in the European Union having to be authorized in Luxembourg."
"I can adapt to many things, but you must forgive me if I have some difficulties with that."
"What I am saying is that we agree with the House on the need for action."
"However, I am not sure that the Council will move sufficiently on the basis of what Parliament is proposing here."
"Nor do I see why a distinction should be made between systems that use the frequencies assigned to mobile telephony services and broadband multimedia systems, which also operate on higher frequencies."
"In terms of regulatory policy, the two categories are quite comparable, and I do not think the difference in use is a justification for separating them."
"Let me end by saying that I have felt during this debate as if I was arguing with the Council. I will leave it to the House to decide whether or not that is a compliment."
"Thank you very much, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Two or three-wheel motor vehicles"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0199/96) on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council (C40149/96-00/0470(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on certain components or characteristics of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (rapporteur: Mr Barton)."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate all the individuals and organisations who have contributed to creating the compromise package before Parliament on the future of two- and threewheel vehicles."
"I give particular praise to individual bikers who have directly lobbied their Members in all Member States and in a very responsible manner argued for measures which will improve safety, reduce pollution and tackle the very real problems created by an irresponsible minority of bikers who ride bikes with very noisy exhaust systems."
"The European Union as a whole needs to learn the lessons pioneered by the European Parliament; that good legislation is only made possible when you have constructive dialogue with the citizens who are directly affected."
"This exercise has been made possible in this case because of the work of national and international bikers' rights organisations coordinated by the Federation of European Motorcyclists, or FEM."
"I should pay a special tribute to their secretary-general, Simon Millward."
"This process stands as a classic example of how to connect the citizen to the workings of Europe."
"The Council must now take this backing seriously, unlike when it responded at first reading."
"It is simply not acceptable for the Council to ignore practical proposals such as the one that would make it unlawful to trade in illegal, noisy exhaust systems."
"These are the systems that create the greatest nuisance and give biking in general a bad name."
"Nor can we allow manufacturers to brand specify replacement parts such as tyres."
"The customer must be allowed to choose from a range of suitable replacement parts as long as they meet the relevant technical and safety specifications."
"By way of an example, a manufacturer such as BMW cannot require that only, say, Pirelli tyres could be fitted as a replacement when, for example, Dunlop or other manufacturers had made perfectly suitable and possibly, in some cases, superior alternative tyres."
"Parliament's package requires that before we agree the next stage of controls on noise and emissions joint research should be done with riders' organisations and manufacturers to ensure that realistic and practical proposals are forthcoming."
"If the Council's position on anti-tampering was not amended, riders would be discouraged from the maintenance periodically needed to minimize pollution levels."
"After all, it would be ironic if such proposals were by default to jeopardize the future of two- and three-wheel vehicles."
"Motorbikes have a positive role to play in providing an economical as well as an enjoyable form of personalized transport, causing far less congestion and pollution than their four-wheel counterparts."
"I urge Parliament to approve en bloc all the amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy with the exception of Amendment No 3, which hopefully will be replaced by a new compromise amendment, Amendment No 20."
"Sadly it seems inevitable that the Council will not immediately embrace our amendments."
"Nevertheless there is one message that it must understand: if the European Union is to be connected with the everyday concerns of its citizens on biking or, for that matter, any other subject it can only do so in dialogue with the people directly affected."
"Parliament has conducted a meaningful dialogue on this item and we will not take kindly to that work being ignored by ministerial officials meeting in secret."
"A very important democratic principle is at stake."
"Mr President, we could have a very interesting discussion on what Mr Barton has said about the people concerned by this directive."
"This is precisely what I wish to talk about."
"For those who view motorcycle noise from the other side, the non-bikers who mainly see only the negative aspects of biking, this has been a very difficult debate, because when one interest group makes itself heard as loudly as those representing the heavy bikers, it is difficult for Parliament not to side with them."
"Given that the representatives of the non-bikers have not made themselves heard at all, I think that we in the House have actually done quite a reasonable job."
"Exhaust emission requirements are to be tightened up and the possibilities for tampering with engines drastically curtailed."
"However, when it comes to noise, major concessions have been made compared with, for example, a voluntary directive which has been in force in the Netherlands and Germany since 1978."
"What Parliament is now proposing is much less strict on noise levels and the measuring methods used."
"Personally, I think this sends out entirely the wrong signal both to users and the industry."
"All motorcycles sold in the Netherlands and Germany already meet strict standards, measured using even stricter methods."
"The main argument put forward by the biking lobby, that these stricter standards will mean the end of air-cooled engines, is manifestly wrong if you look at which models are sold in the Netherlands and Germany."
"The real argument is probably that less noise will mean less engine capacity, which leads me to suspect that the lobby we have been talking to mainly involved 'superbikers' ."
"But the Council also has no room to talk."
"The real problem is with souped-up engines and illegal exhaust systems, but up to now it has rejected every compromise proposed by those who take the noise problem seriously."
"This fortunately includes the rapporteur and many bikers themselves, who have called for steps to be taken to enforce greater compliance with existing noise limits."
"I sincerely hope that the negotiations that we will certainly have to hold with the Council and the Commission will produce satisfactory solutions to the problems of noise and the use of illegal exhaust systems."
"Mr President, I think we need to go for the conciliation procedure. The Council has refused to incorporate our amendments from the first reading in the common position, so I think Parliament now needs to show that it means business."
"We must be sure that we get the 314 votes we need tomorrow, but they must be votes based on the facts of the issue, not used as a negotiating tactic, which is the approach the Council seems to be taking. And I would bet a good European motorbike that we win, Commissioner, then we can both ride on it."
"The Council is playing a strange kind of game."
"On the one hand we have the 80 decibel limit, but since the first reading the Council has come up with the idea of using the highest result of the four measurements instead of the average, which actually brings it down to 78 decibels in practice."
"Terribly environmentally-friendly, do you not think?"
"In fact, it is not."
"As Mr Metten has already said, the Council is refusing to deal with the problem of illegal exhaust systems, so all this is just window-dressing really."
"Not even the rules as they stand at the moment are being obeyed, and the police, for example in Amsterdam, are sitting with their hands in their pockets."
"So simply tightening up the rules will not achieve anything."
"I would ask Mr Bangemann whether the proposed measuring system has been influenced in any way by pressure from the Germans, whose technical skills could give BMW a major competitive advantage."
"We need to have standards that are realistic and likely to gain public support."
"So we should go for 82 decibels and a total ban on the production and sale of illegal exhaust systems, because they are the root of the problem, not the decibel level."
"Anti-tampering is only useful in this context to prevent category-hopping."
"What the Council means is upgrading a moped to a small motorbike, and a small motorbike to a large one."
"But it has missed the point here, because all marking and plating does, even for larger bikes, is to create more red tape."
"The idea of using shear-bolts too will mean an enormous increase in costs for European bikers, who already find it expensive enough to maintain their machines."
"Finally, let us make an appeal to the bikers themselves."
"82 decibels and an average measurement result are fine, but be strict with yourselves and with others."
"Do not allow those who spoil things for everyone and flout the rules to get away with it."
"Help the police to take effective action against offenders."
"Cooperate with the police."
"Then there will be no need to change the rules in 2001, as Amendment No 20 calls for. I am looking up at the public gallery when I say: the ball is in your court."
"Mr President, in my opinion the Council has given way to Parliament on a number of issues."
"Parliament seems intent on pandering to the bikers, so that as far as the House is concerned they can go on making as much noise and creating as much pollution as they like."
"A very sad state of affairs, in my opinion."
"As Mr Metten said, on the one hand we have the bikers, who seem to revel in noise, fumes and dirt, and on the other we have the powerlessness of those who, as far as Parliament is concerned, simply have to accept that these young people have the right to come and disturb them."
"I would invite the rapporteur, the Commissioner and all the Council ministers to visit our river dykes and listen to the noise of the hundreds of motorbikes that come to shatter the peace of the local inhabitants from Ascension Day onwards and throughout the summer."
"I cannot understand why we have to protect the bikers' interests, and not the interests of these poor people."
"Why should they have to stay inside with their doors and windows shut?"
"I find it both incomprehensible and disgraceful."
"The possibilities for technical progress which Parliament usually regards as so important when it comes to environmental issues are being completely ignored here."
"The rapporteur is under pressure from the bikers' lobby to which he himself belongs and which is still not content."
"Mr Barton has tried to sink any attempt to tighten up the regulations."
"The vast majority of my group remain totally opposed to giving any ground on harmful emissions or noise at second reading."
"I really cannot understand what is happening here, and I can only hope that the Council will stick to its guns in the next round."
"Mr President, on a point of order, it was mentioned that I was part of the bikers' lobby."
"As an elected Member for all citizens in my constituency I take great exception to being considered part of the bikers' lobby."
"I will work with the bikers' lobby and I will work with all responsible lobbies but I really resent being called part of the bikers' lobby."
"That is not true."
"Mr President, the European Parliament can be quite content."
"The Council has incorporated almost all its amendments from the first reading in the common position, except on the permitted noise levels, where it would not accept Parliament's rather curious wishes."
"And rightly so, in my opinion, because the noise limits originally proposed by the Commission were included in the second phase of the directive as long ago as 1987."
"The House would lose all credibility if it decided to relax the noise limits now."
"Amendment No 11 would be a slap in the face for the innovative motorbike manufacturers who have voluntarily kept to the existing limits, only to be told in 1995 that they must now meet stricter requirements."
"This sort of ungentlemanly conduct is not acceptable."
"The bikers' lobby argues that it is not the requirements that need to be tightened up, but how they are monitored."
"They see maintenance as the problem and feel that emphasis should be laid on preventing mopeds and motorbikes from being tuned up, by banning the sale of tuning kits."
"In fact, we must cover both."
"Bikers who make too much noise not only spoil things for others who are out enjoying themselves, they also spoil things for other bikers who behave in a more socially responsible and environmentally-friendly way."
"The anti-tampering measures are absolutely essential, as are the stricter noise limits."
"But we should not be thinking of simply keeping the 1987 noise levels in force until 2006, as Amendment No 3 proposes."
"Anyone who believes that this will put us in the best possible starting position for the conciliation procedure is entirely mistaken."
"In negotiations, it is extremely important that your opponent takes you seriously, which is hardly likely to be the case here."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to commend all the many people, not least in Denmark, who have campaigned actively for this proposal."
"There has been effective lobbying by the motorcycling population, not only members of the well-known groups, but also ordinary office workers who ride their bikes on Sunday."
"They have helped to persuade the European Parliament that the positive aspects of motorcyclists' outdoor life should be supported."
"Clearly, there can be situations where motorcycle noise may be a nuisance, but the point at issue here is not whether people are sensitive to noise, and I disagree strongly with the Greens, but they are still too much under the influence of cyclists."
"The point here is that the Commission has once again had its technical experts produce some fairly absurd regulations, without any regard for common sense or the realities of the outside world."
"The standards for noise should match the actual situation."
"And there are in fact not many people who can tell whether the noise level is higher than 82 decibels."
"The Commission should concentrate instead on ensuring that the motorcycles produced in Europe do not suffer from unfair competition."
"After all, unemployment is one of the worst problems in Europe today, so it cannot be of any help if we make it impossible to keep jobs in Europe by imposing unreasonable requirements on our own workplaces in the Union."
"I very much welcome the substantial amount of work which Mr Barton has done on this issue, and there have been a number of creative attempts to bring the points involved home to the Commission."
"Indeed, even Mr Bangemann has been for a motorcycle ride with Mr Barton to find out that Parliament's proposals were on the right lines. Motorcyclists are people who like the outdoor life and the quality of life, and for goodness' sake let us stop spoiling this with stupid limits which cannot be measured."
"So I would say finally to the Greens once again: this may have been a brave attempt to do something for cyclists, but I am an active cyclist myself, and I think you should stop producing such ideas, because it will end up with people selling their bicycle and buying a motorcycle instead."
"Mr President, this is a strange evening."
"In the previous debate, I heard the kind of arguments which I normally encounter only in the Council, and now I am listening to myself."
"What I said two years ago has been said by almost every speaker except Mr Blak - and another thing, Mr Blak, I have not yet taken a motorcycle ride with Mr Barton, but I have done so with Mrs Larive and that was, if anything, more enjoyable than with Mr Barton."
"However, I am also prepared to go for a ride with Mr Barton, I have no difficulty with that."
"Of course I understand - and I say this to Mr Barton - that when an elected representative has a special relationship with a particular section of the population or of his electorate, he can sometimes become a mouthpiece for ideas of this kind, and that is quite legitimate, it is part of his function."
"However, I cannot accept the way in which Mr Barton has sought to exceed that process today, implying that he represented the people, whilst Commissioner Bangemann represented who-knows-what."
"In any event, it is not industry that I represent in this case."
"I have in fact tended to assume the role of my colleague Mrs Bjerregaard."
"It has always been my position that motorcycles should be subject to the same standards which Parliament applies to cars, light commercial vehicles and heavy goods vehicles."
"It is not often that I agree with Mr Metten, but I was really impressed by his speech this evening."
"It could have come from my own lips, and I can only congratulate him on it."
"Incidentally, I found it amusing that England beat Holland 4-1 this evening, but four Dutchmen spoke after Mr Barton, so that redressed the balance."
"What course of action is open to us as things stand now?"
"I would say that since the Council has adopted a good many of Parliament's amendments, we should finally bring this process to a close."
"The file has now run to 657 pages!"
"I would therefore ask you to appreciate that I cannot accept those amendments which seek to improve on elements already agreed by the Council."
"Parliament will be doing itself a favour if it decides to accept in essence what the Council has already accepted."
"That is substantially more than the motorcycle lobby could have expected at the outset."
"There is nothing wrong with lobbying, and of course people have to defend their interests, but motorcyclists are by no means the only people involved here."
"There are also those who suffer from the activities of motorcyclists."
"Mrs van Dijk reminded us of that."
"I would add that you have no need to invite me to measure noise levels - invite Mr Barton and other Members of the House!"
"I would not wish to imply that your invitation is in any way threatening - please feel free to invite me, but not so that I can listen to motorcycle noise."
"There is no need for that. From the start, I have said that we should treat this issue just as you would any other."
"I am, however, prepared to accept the position previously established by Parliament, and to that extent I too am part of this democratic process and I can accept that, even if it is hard for me to swallow at times."
"I would therefore propose that we should accept nine of the 20 remaining amendments, namely Nos 6 and 7 and Nos 13 to 19."
"The latter are all concerned with the procedure for measuring noise levels, and their purpose is to reinstate the text originally proposed by the Commission."
"The common position made the procedure more rigorous, effectively introducing more stringent limit values."
"I would point out that the measures to counter noise pollution are already tightened up considerably in the Commission's original proposal, because we are making the optional limit values binding."
"With our proposal, we are therefore roughly midway between what the Council is seeking - which is even tougher - and the significantly less stringent proposals from Parliament."
"We cannot accept the remaining 11 amendments, for the following reasons: Nos 1, 4 and 5 are at odds with the prohibition on introducing to the market equipment that does not comply with the provisions of the directive."
"We have already stated that quite clearly in Article 15 of the framework directive."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 2 because trailers are definitely not covered by these provisions."
"Amendment No 3 seeks to postpone the date on which the limit values come into force."
"If we wish to postpone the whole thing until the year 2006, then we can let this go too."
"Why not, Mrs van Dijk, seek a postponement until 2026?"
"I wonder how that would be received?"
"The amendment tabled yesterday on the same subject is likewise unacceptable and would create substantial delay."
"Amendments Nos 8 to 11 are intended to delete various provisions relating to anti-tampering measures."
"We need to consider for a moment what is meant by anti-tampering measures - we are not concerned with DIY enthusiasts, Mr Barton, or young men who buy themselves a motorbike and then make alterations to it in an attempt to give it more power, all of which is perfectly understandable."
"But with these amendments you would seek to permit, for example, any illegal modifications to motorcycles above a certain cubic capacity, in other words to big bikes."
"Do I see you shaking your head?"
"This is something which we really cannot accept, therefore, and for that reason we have to reject, in this context, these measures whose only purpose is to allow performance-enhancing modifications with a minimum of risk."
"I would note in passing that these amendments refer to the Commission's original text which was not queried by the Council in its common position, nor by the House at first reading; in other words, from a purely formal point of view, the amendments are in a state of limbo, as it were, because they refer to something that has neither been proposed by the Commission nor adopted by the Council in its common position."
"We are unable to accept Amendment No 12 on sound level limits."
"Measures which have already been considerably diluted, because their application is to be optional, are being watered down further still, and I would say to Mrs Larive who wondered at the Council's attitude: I wonder not at the Council on this issue, but at Parliament."
"In every other area, you find fault with us."
"Today we approved a programme on motor oils and its impact on emission levels for cars, a joint proposal by my colleagues Mrs Bjerregaard and Mr Papoutsis and myself, and I have no doubt that Mr Barton will tear it to shreds."
"He will ask how we came to set such low limit values."
"Wait and see."
"Section 7, paragraph 4, contains the following note: ' L'inclusion du point 4 ' ."
"It is in French, Mr Barton, if you would please bear with me."
"France had a victory tonight too, so..."
"The inclusion of paragraph 4, ' Provisions concerning the branding of components' , in paragraph 3 implies that the provisions concerning branding will only apply to mopeds and light motorcycles."
"In that case, mediumweight and heavy motorcycles would be completely excluded from the scope of the anti-tampering measures."
"(DE) Imagine such a situation, if you would!"
"Caught between motorcyclists on the one hand and a group of decent people on the other, Parliament has to find a way of remaining consistent."
"You must stick to the line that you have taken - and things have come to a pretty pass when you need an Industry Commissioner to tell you that."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Leghold traps and pelts"
"The next item is the report (A4-0151/96) by Mr Pimenta, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(95)0737 - C4-0105/96-95/0357(SYN)) amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91 prohibiting the use of leghold traps in the Community and the introduction into the Community of pelts and manufactured goods of certain wild animal species originating in countries which catch them by means of leghold traps or trapping methods which do not meet international humane trapping standards."
"Mr President, the reason we have this report from Mr Pimenta today is that the Commission has back-tracked on legislation properly carried by the European Parliament and approved by the Council of Ministers."
"There really is a serious problem of lack of democracy here, which we have to continue to pursue."
"When the regulation of 1991 was approved it was agreed that imports of fur into the European Union from countries which had not banned this barbaric and cruel leghold trap would cease in 1995."
"We had the debate about the substantive issue back in 1990, withstanding ferocious lobbying in the process, and we won the argument."
"It is a little unfair that we have Commissioner Bjerregaard here tonight to take the flak rather than Sir Leon Brittan."
"But of course this is the price of so-called collective culpability, unfortunately."
"So I am sorry for Commissioner Bjerregaard."
"But the collective Commission decided to operate a let-out clause and to wait for a fairy tale, which was the hope that an international committee in Geneva would come up with a humane leghold trap, thereby letting off the hook the major fur trapping countries."
"So it extended the deadline for a year until 1996."
"There is and there will be no such humane trap."
"So the impossible dream did not materialize and towards the end of last year the Commission started to get nervous in the face of threats from Canada to take the European Union to the WTO under GATT."
"There is an available solution for the fur-trapping nations and that is to ban this leghold trap and to use some of the different kinds of methods which are available."
"But let us face it; the Canadian Government is making huge amounts of money from an industry designed for rich people to wear fur coats."
"It is on quicksand as far as its arguments are concerned on this issue."
"Anyone with a grain of backbone would have been able to face up to this threat."
"It is perfectly clear that we have plenty of GATT clauses for legal people to argue under: Article 20 is one that comes to mind."
"But the Commission decided in its infinite and arrogant wisdom that a possible and dodgy threat from a foreign government with a big vested interest in making a lot of money out of its exploited indigenous people was more important than democracy, more important than the European Union's own law, duly enacted, more important than the interests of 350 million citizens and consumers and more important than animal welfare."
"One could go on for hours about this sorry saga."
"There are facts and figures that could be argued well into the night, but the essence is that the Socialist Group and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and this Parliament are outraged that the Commission sees fit to flout the democratic process of the European Union in this way."
"We will not stand for it."
"There is no case for the pathetic and weakkneed new proposal from the Commission, belated though it is, and it knows it."
"We fully support the excellent report by Mr Pimenta which we know is based on very carefully researched facts."
"There is only one way forward for democracy, for animal welfare and for a citizens' Europe and that is to implement the original regulation and to ban imports of fur from countries which are continuing to use the leghold trap."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of the so-called leghold trap regulation is a never-ending saga: this is episode five, if we are counting in years."
"Why is that?"
"Could it be that we took the wrong approach in trying to exert indirect influence, through legislation, on activities which quite justifiably meet with our disapproval?"
"Events would seem to support that conclusion."
"Since 1991, it has been the position that the regulation was to enter into force on 1 January 1996."
"That should have allowed sufficient time to work out the implementing provisions."
"Although I was not a Member of the House in 1991, I would point out that the aim was to see more humane trapping standards applied."
"In particular, the use of leghold traps was no longer to be permitted, and rightly so."
"But the regulation has failed to meet its objective in this respect."
"Of course, there are various reasons why it has failed and I shall go on to analyse those reasons briefly, one of which I have mentioned already."
"A dilemma then arose."
"By the end of the year, no implementing provisions had been drawn up, so they could not be applied."
"At this stage, the Commission submitted a fresh proposal."
"It is my view that this proposal cannot possibly be approved, for a number of reasons."
"For a start, both the timeframe and the objectives are very vague."
"On the basis of such a regulation or proposal, negotiations could go on forever and I think that cannot be in our interest."
"What is presented in this regulation is an over-simplification."
"Mr Pimenta, who courageously and quite rightly chose a different approach, therefore has my best wishes."
"This is an approach that we can support, although I make no secret of the fact that we have different views and expectations on certain points."
"Let us consider the situation of the native peoples, especially in Canada."
"Mr Pimenta does indeed mention the figure of 1045 people, the fact that wages are low, and so on."
"But there is another point that we must bear in mind: in the areas where these people work and hunt, there are no species which are threatened with extinction."
"There are no problems with conservation and the environment."
"The people are adamant that their areas should be preserved and protected from so-called 'industrial progress' ."
"Now we come to the anomaly in our approach: we are creating a situation in which a people who strongly defend the causes of animal and environmental protection - causes which we support - are suffering because of us, and may lose their livelihood."
"We therefore have a duty to take account of the native peoples and what they require to make their living."
"The regulation does take account of these factors to some extent, and we have tabled some amendments which should improve the position."
"I hope that they will also have the support of the House."
"We do not agree with the rapporteur, however, that the implementing provisions themselves should be included in the regulation."
"That is the Commission's task, which is for it to perform."
"So we would remove the items in question, but I have to stress that this does not mean that we disagree with the way they have been formulated."
"Basically, all the Commission has to do is copy them out."
"However, we believe that their inclusion here would require the House to consider every change in detail, and we do not have the time."
"We ought to bear that in mind."
"It is a job for the executive, and in principle that means the Commission."
"If we bear that in mind, we may find the best way to proceed."
"The working party is still seeking to establish standards, and however illusory these may be, they have not yet been ruled out."
"Where do you draw the line between humane and inhumane methods?"
"Perhaps the working party will eventually come up with an answer to that question."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important that we succeed in laying down international rules to enable us to reach a framework agreement on catching wild animals using traps or methods that do not involve cruelty."
"The availability or otherwise of any type of trap, be it the kind that kills or the kind that restrains animals, should in any event be based on standards agreed between the States of the Union, third countries and the indigenous population, with professional trappers, those who study wild animals and veterinary experts being consulted."
"The negotiations currently under way for the definition of standards for more humane traps are going well and represent a first step towards an international agreement founded on scientific knowledge and the concern better to protect animals."
"That being the case, even if a final agreement has not been reached by 31 December of this year, it will be appropriate to assess the progress achieved by that point in time but not to place a radical ban on imports of pelts obtained from wild animals caught in traps."
"We have, however, to bear in mind that an important part of the way of life of some indigenous peoples - the Inuit, for example - is based, for environmental reasons, on hunting and fishing which currently still represent an important economic resource."
"If, on the one hand then, it is vital that a framework agreement is reached on rules on trapping without cruelty, it is also necessary that those same rules should safeguard the interests of the indigenous population."
"The entry into force of the rules must also allow the countries which produce the pelts of wild animals to adapt to the legislation by guaranteeing, as requested, that the methods of capture using traps which they employ for the species contained in the list comply with the standards adopted: immediate or premature entry into force would thwart the efforts so far made to facilitate methods of capture or practices which are not cruel, but would above all put at risk the livelihood of 200, 000 people involved in the pelt processing industry and employed in the Union."
"That is a risk that we cannot accept and which can be avoided by adopting a reasonable time-scale for the entry into force of the rules."
"We should bear in mind that combating unemployment is a priority not only of the individual Member States but also of the Union as a whole."
"Finally, one last point: on issues of interest such as this, it would be helpful if the Commission consulted Parliament in good time and not at the last moment as has happened in this instance."
"Mr President, there is really no need to go through all this again."
"In 1991, the European Environment Ministers decided to ban the import of pelts from countries where leghold traps are still used."
"The ban was to come into force on 1 January 1996, one year after leghold traps were banned in the countries of the European Union."
"We were therefore totally taken aback when, at the end of last year, the Commission proposed that the import ban should be postponed indefinitely."
"The Commission has yielded to pressure from the fur trade and the threat from the United States and Canada that they would fight the ban on the basis of the WTO rules."
"The interests of trade are apparently more important to the Commission than democratic decisions to reduce the suffering of animals."
"The European Parliament must not make the same mistake."
"What happened at the end of 1995 was that Commissioner Bjerregaard lost out to Commissioner Brittan, and I think she should be ashamed that things were allowed to go so far."
"The European Parliament must reverse the Commission's decision."
"I can only agree with Mr Pimenta when he says that once legislation has been proposed, the result can never be that no legislation is adopted, since this would set a precedent that would undermine the credibility of the Commission and of the whole Community decision-making process."
"That would be completely unacceptable for us."
"We all know that leghold traps deliberately condemn animals to a slow and lingering death, which is what makes the pelts such good quality and brings the best prices."
"Leghold traps are extremely brutal instruments and must be banned."
"There must be more humane trapping methods, but we in the House must not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by postponements and other tactics into delaying the approval of these methods."
"Throughout the whole debate, the importance of leghold traps for native peoples has been deliberately exaggerated."
"The Commission wants to introduce an automatic exemption from the import ban for native peoples, but such an exemption would undermine the whole directive."
"I entirely agree with the rules proposed by Mr Pimenta on the subject."
"We should give Mr Pimenta's very detailed report our fullest support, but we also wish to see some immediate action."
"One of the things the Commission must do now is to publish the list of countries which do not use leghold traps."
"It should be required do this within the next month, otherwise Parliament will take it to the Court of Justice."
"I should like to ask the Commission whether it intends to publish this list in the immediate future?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, if we agree that leghold traps are a cruel and inhumane means of trapping animals, and if the European Union has banned their use within its territory, it is surprising that the import of pelts from third countries in which animals are caught by means of these traps should be accepted."
"The successive postponements of the entry into force of Regulation No 3254 cast doubt on the Commission's political will to comply with Community law, when it should be setting an example in this respect to the Member States."
"The Commission knows that the talks between Canada, the United States, the European Union and Russia aimed at establishing humane standards may go on for ever; it is extremely difficult to determine these standards."
"Mr Pimenta's proposals include the necessary implementing provisions, take account - in various amendments - of the social and economic implications of the regulation for the indigenous peoples, and bear in mind the responsibility of the Member States to help improve those peoples' living and working conditions."
"They provide for the ban on imports to be lifted once credible rules, including a reasonable implementation period, have been agreed."
"Commissioner, we all know that without clear rules and specific deadlines it is very difficult to ensure compliance with Community law."
"We have seen this with regard to the legislation on the substances that are destroying the ozone layer and on CO2 levels, and we are seeing it with regard to this regulation. This regulation must be implemented, if we wish to ensure respect for, and the credibility of, the Community's institutions."
"Mr President, this is lunacy!"
"Here we have a five-year-old regulation - a piece of legislation adopted by the Council - and the Commission simply digs its heels in and fails to put through the implementing provisions."
"Is this what we can expect to see in future?"
"Along comes a lobby group - in this instance the Canadian, American and Russian fur industry - and kicks up a big fuss, and we are left with nothing."
"If that is the shape of things to come, then we can save ourselves a great deal of work."
"I think it is outrageous!"
"Even more outrageous - and I shall not mince my words here - is the fact that virtually no notice will be taken of the amendments and proposals in Mr Pimenta's report, although they are excellent and have our full support."
"And where will we be then?"
"We might as well shut up shop for half the week, because half our work is not being taken seriously by the Commission."
"What exactly do they think they are doing?"
"I shall tell you another thing."
"Over the next year, there are to be talks on humane trapping methods, and humane traps are to be developed."
"What rubbish!"
"There are no such things as humane traps."
"Whether or not there is a bit of padding on the teeth of a trap, the animal in it will die a miserable death."
"Nor is there such a thing as a selective trap."
"An animal cannot read a sign that says 'Lynxes please do not use this trap' !"
"There are no selective traps."
"Protected species also get caught, and trapping is simply inhumane."
"If people insist on catching animals, then they should be sensible and shoot them."
"Any other method is inhumane."
"I fail to see one good reason for supporting the fur lobby, hunting animal species and damaging the environment to the point that they are now almost all extinct."
"Damn it all, why should a few people deck themselves out in furs?"
"There is no call for it."
"We must develop a different relationship with the gifts that nature has given us, and that certainly does not mean that we have to carry off the last remaining animal pelts."
"As for those who are so concerned about human beings - and I hear endless expressions of sympathy for the poor native peoples - I have to tell them quite frankly that they are hypocrites."
"We are shamelessly hypocritical when we import uranium which continues to be mined at the sacred sites of native peoples; when forests are felled and people lose their homelands and we import the wood."
"Those are the facts, if you please, and I would ask the Commission seriously if it has any intention of respecting our regulations, or if the situation will simply continue as before, with nothing being done!"
"Mr President, our group firstly wishes to pay tribute to the work of Mr Pimenta, who has addressed this particularly complex question with his customary tenacity."
"This issue has all the elements of a psychological drama which we should very much keep in mind: the campaign against the unnecessary suffering of animals; the need to ensure the survival of northern indigenous peoples and their traditional way of life; the pressure from commercial lobbies and governments, which use unscrupulous arguments; and an interinstitutional conflict between Parliament and the Commission, which prefers to evade its responsibility to Parliament rather than risk opposing some of its partners in the World Trade Organization."
"On the majority of these points, we agree with the Committee on the Environment's proposals."
"First of all, I should like to say that we must indeed put pressure on the negotiators to define satisfactory trapping standards."
"Too much time has been lost already."
"By ensuring that the ban comes into force as soon as possible, we shall increase the chances of achieving a result swiftly."
"Even if it may sound paradoxical, or even absurd, you will see why the date of last January should be retained."
"It is unthinkable for Parliament to accept being presented with a fait accompli in this way."
"It is a question of principle."
"Furthermore, the procedural schedule in Parliament which is necessary to prepare for second reading and conclude this legislative procedure will provide an additional breathing space which must be used to good effect by the negotiators in the International Organization for Standardization."
"However, I would stress the fact that the interests of indigenous peoples whose survival may depend on hunting must also be taken into account."
"The inability of the Commission and their governments to conclude the negotiations must never constitute a threat to their way of life."
"In this respect, while there are some sound points in Mr Pimenta's arguments, we believe that it is preferable to follow the Commission proposal."
"Our group will therefore be supporting the Committee on the Environment's amendments, with the exception of Amendment No 24."
"Mr President, there are two almost irreconcilable interests in the debate on the use of these inhumane leghold traps: the economic survival of a group of hunters who have no other means of earning a living in the short term, and animal welfare."
"From the outset, Mrs Sandbæk and I have adopted the position that the native hunters must not be deprived of their livelihood, and I am pleased that the amendments from the Committee on the Environment now specifically call for attention to be given to this threatened group."
"We too are aware that the number of genuine native hunters is relatively small, and that they are just about able to support themselves."
"But this is no reason to stop them selling any more furs at all because of the trapping methods which they use."
"Here in Europe we apply transitional measures in all kinds of situations, and I see no reason why we should not do so with trapping methods."
"This is, after all, what this group of people relies upon to earn their daily bread."
"We very much hope that all the political controversy surrounding this piece of European legislation will finally result in the speedy introduction of safer trapping methods."
"There can be absolutely no doubt, as far as we are concerned, that these barbaric traps must be abolished."
"The Pimenta report is, in my opinion, a good compromise between the various viewpoints."
"What I should now like to hear from the Commissioner is what is happening about the proceedings against the Netherlands, which has declared that the regulation will come into force as originally scheduled on 1 January?"
"Mr President, the rapporteur deserves to be thanked for taking over the job of doing the Commission's homework."
"As we approach the end of the millennium, our society must give the same priority to preventing cruelty to animals - preventing unimaginable and prolonged suffering among living creatures - as it does to consumer protection."
"Preventing cruelty to animals is almost a form of consumer protection from a different angle."
"It means protecting consumers from going about clad in the fashionably processed suffering of mammal species."
"A person's ethnic origin can never entitle them to use cruel trapping methods."
"It is quite amazing that the USA and Canada have so far refused to recognize that leghold traps are inhumane."
"It is scarcely possible that regional development and the welfare of the people concerned should depend solely on the use of leghold traps, which are not even a traditional trapping method."
"We should also recognize clearly that the decline in recent years in the sale of furs and skins is part of a pattern of changed practices on the part of consumers."
"By following the proposals of the rapporteur, the European Parliament would be sending out a positive signal."
"Mr President, as I stated in the last discussion about this issue, I was the hapless rapporteur on the first report on the leghold trap."
"That was in 1990."
"In the course of preparing my report I did a great deal of research; I took it extremely seriously."
"I was the butt of - as Mrs Pollack has said - some of the most ferocious lobbying ever seen in this Parliament."
"I am very happy indeed that Mr Schnellhardt has said, on behalf of my group, that we will be supporting Mr Pimenta's report."
"But I wish I could agree with my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, that the Commission should be left to get on with the job."
"I do not think it has done, and I do not think it did in the past what this Parliament asked it to do in 1990."
"Mr Pimenta faces the issue that was the most agonizing for me, personally, in my work on the report: the serious concern he has for the indigenous people in Canada."
"I met them."
"I went out on a trap line."
"I have seen exactly what happens there."
"As a result of what I saw then I deliberately set out to give longer time to develop an alternative method of trapping in order to cause the minimum amount of difficulty to the indigenous people in Canada."
"But unfortunately it took quite considerable time for anything to be done on that."
"It was clear when I was in Canada in 1990 that nothing had been done on it up to then."
"What I think happened was that the Commission just kept its head down and hoped that it would all disappear; that it was a flash in the pan and that nobody would take it terribly seriously and nothing would have to do be done about it."
"But a lot of attitudes have changed radically in the last few years, particularly on issues of animal welfare."
"Nobody ever thought that the poor old cows or sows or whatever were really being taken seriously."
"In the last few years we have started to look on these as moral issues."
"I think we have to continue to do so."
"I am very happy to support Mr Pimenta's report."
"Finally, if I lived in northern Canada in the cold and wind that exists there - and I lived in Canada for well over a year in the 1960s - I would wear a fur coat."
"I would probably wear one of those long furry things that were quite cheap and very practical at the time."
"But the market for fur coats now has generally collapsed."
"It is really only those rich people who live in southern hot countries who are buying them."
"So I ask myself: do we really need to go the wall about a political issue like this?"
"But the trap that Mr Pimenta has held up is evidence that this is a very nasty piece of work."
"By now we should have found some alternative to it."
"Mr President, intimidated by the threats of the Canadian and US Governments to appeal to the World Trade Organization, the Commission agreed, in July 1994, to suspend for a year the entry into force of the rules."
"As was absolutely predictable, that postponement failed to produce the hoped-for results in the search for traps that do not involve cruelty."
"Once that deadline had expired, the Commission took it upon itself illegally to suspend the entry into force of the regulation itself as of 1 January 1996, for the sole purpose of according the Americans and Canadians a further opportunity of developing so-called 'humanitarian' trapping standards."
"That task, which the North Americans in fact gave to the ISO - the International Standards Organization - back in 1987, has proved hopeless for two reasons: the clear impossibility of developing trapping methods that are not cruel and the substance of the research which focuses less on studying improbable methods of trapping without inflicting pain than on legitimizing those methods already used by Canadian and US trappers."
"It is therefore vital that the House confirm robustly and resolutely that it is a matter of the utmost urgency that the general principles of Regulation No 3254/91, on which I worked, as a Commissioner, along with Parliament in the early nineties, are complied with: if it is allowed to slip further the real intention will be to get rid of it for good."
"It is in that firm belief that, as mentioned by Mr Bloch von Blottnitz, the Greens are prepared to support the amendments to the Commission text tabled by Mr Pimenta: Amendments Nos 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 28 in particular remedy the unacceptable loopholes which the Commission proposal to amend Regulation No 3254/91 would allow for the purpose of continuing to bring into the European Union pelts obtained using traps."
"Mr President, this is not the first time that I have had the opportunity of discussing this issue with the House; several speakers have already described the course of events, and so I shall confine myself here this evening to the formal response which can be given to today's debate."
"First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pimenta, for his report on the extremely vexed question of leghold traps."
"I know that the Commission and Parliament essentially have the same goals in this area."
"We differ as to how those goals can be achieved."
"As is made clear by Mr Pimenta's report, Parliament is in favour of introducing a trade ban and then discussing the conditions for it to be removed."
"You will be aware that the Commission's stance, following its most recent decision, is the opposite, and we have therefore already had talks in the quadripartite group - including the USA, Canada and Russia - with a view to achieving results before we begin to consider what further steps can be taken."
"Given the fundamental difference in our approach, it will come as no surprise to the House that the Commission is unable to accept the proposed amendments."
"In addition, there was a direct proposal from Mr Eisma, who asked me for a response to Parliament's letter of 13 May to the Commission."
"The Commission has not yet come to a decision on the request from the President of Parliament for it to publish a list of countries which prohibit the use of leghold traps."
"Naturally, the Commission will respond to this request within the deadline which it has to give a reply."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Market organization in beef and veal"
"The next item is the report (A4-0203/96) by Mr Jacob, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(96)0242 - C4-0291/96-96/0148(CNS)) providing for additional payments to be made in 1996 with the premia referred to in Article 4b(6) and Article 4d(7) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal and amending Article 4i(4) of that Regulation."
"Mr President, on this report, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development unanimously agreed to the Council's request for urgent procedure, in view of the extreme urgency, complexity and sensitivity of this issue for all beef and veal producers, as well as all European consumers."
"Firstly, I should like to say that I am presenting this report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, in my capacity as chairman of that committee."
"The proposal submitted to us by the Commission is, in my view, fundamentally balanced, in that it contains a section devoted to specialized breeders - in other words, producers of suckler cows and young bovines - and another section devoted to the national element, which will enable each Member State to adapt and respond according to its own specific circumstances."
"I tabled a number of amendments which did not receive the support of the Committee on Agriculture, and which I am now retabling in plenary on my own behalf."
"These amendments seek to increase the aid to specialized producers to ECU 50 for each animal."
"What seems essential to me in this debate is to support those specialized farmers and breeders in Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and France who live from the production of beef and veal alone and whose future depends on this activity, as opposed to other farmers who are undoubtedly affected by the crisis, but who produce beef and veal alongside other activities."
"I therefore believe that it is important to support these specialized producers, whose animals have never seen an ounce of meat meal in their lives, because they are reared on grass. There are producers of this kind throughout Europe."
"These are the producers who should be supported in particular, and that is why I am proposing to increase the compensation to ECU 50 for suckler cows and young bovines."
"I am also making this proposal in order to send a political signal, because all that people can find to say to me on this subject is: ' The package will be inadequate, and so we shall have to show self-restraint and distribute it as widely as possible' ."
"I am surprised, however, by those who are defending this kind of argument."
"They are the same people, one should remember, who react vigorously from time to time to prevent the common agricultural policy from being touched, saying that they are against renationalization."
"Now the same people are rejecting all those amendments which are designed to support specialized producers, in favour of distribution by the Member States."
"If there is one category of breeders who should be supported, in my view it is traditional breeders."
"Undoubtedly, other breeders are affected, and that should be taken into account."
"But let us not forget those who are currently losing around FF 2000 per animal, and who are now in an extremely difficult position, because they have no borrowing arrangements, few investments and social security entitlements, and low incomes - an average of FF 50 000 for beef and veal producers."
"For such farmers, the consequences of this crisis are dramatic."
"It is therefore necessary to increase the package proposed by the Commission."
"This package is inadequate - and I am sure, Commissioner, that you are aware of that today."
"Given the extent of the crisis, there is a need to increase the proposed package substantially in order to provide support for these farmers, whose role goes beyond the mere production of beef and veal and is very important in terms of the development and management of Europe's regions."
"I have therefore tabled these amendments, and another which I should like to deal with by supporting the amendment by my colleague Mr Happart concerning the increased use of plant proteins in animal feed. I entirely endorse this amendment."
"I believe that it is essential."
"This means, however, that there is also a need to renegotiate a number of matters."
"The agreements on plant proteins concluded during the GATT negotiations must be discussed again."
"They no longer hold good!"
"Similarly, we must have an assurance that meat meal has not been used in the production of imported beef and veal, since the current situation will give rise to an increase in protein prices to the benefit of third countries - which has already begun - since the European Union has a substantial shortfall in protein production."
"In conclusion, Commissioner, I believe that it is important to support specialized producers, and so I am retabling my amendments in a personal capacity, even though they did not obtain the support of the Committee on Agriculture."
"Furthermore, I also believe that it is important to strengthen the European Union's capacity for protein production, since given the extent of the crisis, we cannot accept the GATT agreements in the form in which they were concluded."
"This sector must therefore be completely redeveloped."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I take a slightly different view from Mr Jacob, although I respect his opinion: while it is right to applaud the speed with which the Commission moved to take this measure to support producers affected by the BSE crisis, it has to be said that in substance that particular measure is the source of a good deal of injustice."
"While the Council had said that it was necessary to support in the short term all beef and veal producers, with the idea of earmarking no less than ECU 534 of the ECU 650 for the supplementary premium for male cattle and suckler cows, in my view, the Commission is ending up by helping only a section of European producers. And it is precisely those producers that are already enjoying the largest helping of aid from the common organization of the market in beef and veal."
"It is true that there is a need for speed and to commit spending, which has to be kept within very strict timescales, but it is also the case that there is something to think about here: I ask you, Commissioner, to consult the table that appears on page 49 of the first volume of this year's price package from which it is clear that there is a small minority of countries which have many more premiums than they do head of beef cattle and a majority of countries where the imbalance is precisely the reverse."
"We could discuss at length, Mr Jacob, whether there are specialized producers and, if so, which producers they are and whether priority should be given to that group or to others."
"But what I do not want to see this evening is those producers who have specialized in obtaining premiums being advantaged."
"I believe that all should be given the same opportunities and that Parliament's amendments - at least those of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development whereby the flexible portion available to the Member States would be increased from ECU 116 m to ECU 424 m - will make it possible largely to resolve this problem."
"More resources would certainly have been better but we have to be realistic."
"We have then to be very careful to check that national aid becomes the exception and not the rule."
"I ask you, Commissioner, whether we ought not to conclude from this that some kind of review of the COM in beef and veal is needed, and whether the time is not now ripe, given the news we have heard, to move on to other measures, since the eradication programme seems to be beginning to achieve some results."
"You, Commissioner, have had the courage to take difficult decisions which have laid you open and continue to lay you open to criticism and probably will cause acute tension in the European institutional balance in Florence two days hence."
"I therefore believe, Commissioner, that it is very important that there should be mutual understanding between Parliament and the Commission and a shared perception of what we want to do and the way to do it, including as regards this evening's measures."
"I therefore believe that it is for you this evening to show consideration for the work of our committee - our group, the Socialist Group, is counting on this."
"Mr President, since early 1996, when the British Secretary of State for Health reported that new cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease had occurred among humans in the United Kingdom, beef consumption has once again plummeted."
"The market for beef has collapsed not only in the United Kingdom, but in virtually every region of Europe, including Member States which have not had a single case of BSE."
"Thankfully, the Commission has taken a range of measures, including buying in beef and an export ban to protect consumers."
"To reduce the impact of the heavy losses suffered by beef producers, the Commission promised an emergency programme."
"For technical reasons connected with the budget, that programme must be paid for immediately, in other words by October 1996."
"We are grateful to the Commission for its proposals."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has considered the document that was submitted and has formulated a number of principles for approval by the House."
"The committee is calling for a standard subsidy for suckler cows and male cattle."
"The subsidy should amount to an additional grant of ECU 10 per head."
"At the same time, I must acknowledge that dairy farmers have also suffered losses."
"The price of cull cows and calves has fallen just as sharply as that of beef cattle."
"Furthermore, the Commission itself admits that it will be hard to include all the stock that should, in fairness, attract compensation payments."
"Let me give you one or two examples: for instance, those cases where farmers are claiming subsidies for growing pasture instead of livestock premiums, or where they have not kept within the limit of 2.5 livestock units per hectare."
"Virtually all the farms in these categories will be excluded, because they are not currently entitled to premiums."
"For those reasons, the committee decided to increase the proposed sum to be made available to the Member States to compensate for losses that would not otherwise be covered."
"In the short time that is available, it will not be easy, even for the Member States, to distribute this money in such a way as to compensate farmers to some extent for their losses."
"We should therefore give the Member States as much latitude as possible, so that they can get the money to the farmers in good time."
"We have to be clear that these subsidies are only a drop in the ocean."
"Nonetheless we must make the most of them."
"I shall be grateful to you if we can find a viable means of doing so."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in my view, the Council's proposal for a regulation properly has the air of an emergency measure in what is developing into a real crisis, not only from the economic point of view but also because of its political and institutional implications."
"It seems to me, however, that the haste has been ill-advised because instead of remedying situations of hardship, the measure is likely to compound the imbalance and the discrimination that exists between those countries which already make full use of Community resources and others that suffer from an historical disadvantage linked to the system of producer premiums."
"In the table of statistics, mentioned by Mr Fantuzzi and annexed to price package for which I was the rapporteur, we voted, at the last part-session, for a state of affairs that is worrying to say the least."
"There are countries which receive amounts far in excess of their entire production."
"Right at the head is Luxembourg with 227 %, followed by Ireland with 147 % and France with 123 %."
"At the bottom, needless to say, is Italy, which has received only 29.6 %, although with 2, 200, 000 head, it is Europe's main producer."
"It is not my intention to pave the way, here in the House and in these circumstances, for national claims, but it is at any rate right to ask the Commission and Council to prevent chronic under-utilization of Community resources becoming the inescapable rule for emergency measures."
"The subdivision into the three methods of intervention - suckler cows, male cattle for fattening and the national element - seems to be completely inappropriate and allows only 30 % of Italian producers to have access to the premium."
"We therefore propose concentrating resources as much as possible on the national element by unhooking the measure from the system of premiums."
"But that is not enough: it also seems appropriate to give the Member States the opportunity to award national aid to offset the loss of income on cattle excluded from the premium."
"To conclude, Commissioner, the resources of ECU 650 m are clearly inadequate."
"It seems then that in Italy alone we are talking about an estimated ECU 250 m. And so I ask myself, with no more than a hint of bitter irony: will the other fourteen countries be content with the remaining ECU 400 m?"
"Mr President, in our opinion the Commission is entirely justified in proposing to make ECU 650 million available for dealing with the effects of the BSE crisis."
"The crisis which individual farmers are currently facing is not their fault, it is the result of failings on the part of the governments."
"And if it is the governments which have failed, it is also up to the governments to put things right again."
"We wonder whether ECU 650 m will be enough, but I am assuming that it is not possible to make more available at the moment."
"We do have some fairly major objections to the Commission's proposal itself, which as we see it gives an unfair advantage to extensive cattle breeders."
"The BSE crisis affects all beef producers, both extensive and intensive farmers."
"We therefore feel that measures must be taken which deal with both sectors fairly."
"The amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on Agriculture are definitely heading in the right direction."
"More is still provided for the extensive farmers, but the national governments are now in a better position to provide support for the intensive farmers too."
"This gives the Member States the scope to channel aid towards the sectors which they judge to have been worst affected."
"We think it is also very important that this should not mean the renationalization of agricultural policy, as Mr Jacob suggested."
"It does not need to be."
"The Commission must be careful to keep a close eye on competition, but it is primarily up to the Member States to take the lead here."
"Mr President, I spoke earlier in the debate on leghold traps."
"Now, however, I should like to put things in perspective: cattle breeders - and, by extension, the entire beef and veal sector - are today the human victims of the economic consequences of the epidemic of mad cow disease that has been raging since 1986."
"For several years, beef consumption has been falling in Europe."
"For the last three months, the beef and veal sector has been totally disaster-stricken throughout the European Union. As time has passed, it has become absolutely vital to draw up a rescue plan for the beef and veal sector, from the producer to the retail butcher."
"Such a plan requires a coordinated, comprehensive and united approach."
"Among the possible measures, the matter of greatest urgency is immediate compensation for producers, in order of priority."
"Firstly, there are the specialized beef and veal producers with herds of suckler cows."
"Beef is the only source of income for their farms."
"They have taken the full force of the crisis, and their loss of income is in direct proportion to the fall in prices."
"What are they doing?"
"They are waiting, while millions of cows grow fat in the fields and a solution is postponed."
"And secondly, there are the dairy farmers, for whom beef nevertheless represents around a quarter of their income, in the form of veal calves and cull cows."
"Tens of thousands of breeders, whose loss of earnings is currently put at between FF 1500 and 2000 per head of fattened animal, are waiting for our decision with impatience."
"They will find it hard to understand why we have reduced the proposed aid to an additional ECU 10 per premium."
"I ask myself, moreover, whether we were not unwittingly misled at the time of the vote in the Committee on Agriculture the other day."
"Consequently, I call on the House - without, of course, rejecting the Committee on Agriculture's amendments as a whole - to support Mr Jacob's amendments, which favour non-intensive breeding."
"Let us not forget that in order to repair beef's image and restore consumer confidence, there is a need to discourage industrial production methods and replace them with natural methods, for example by encouraging the production of protein plants."
"Commissioner, a crisis of unprecedented gravity is affecting the cattle breeding sector in the European Union."
"And it is to be feared that as well as being exceptionally grave, it will be exceptionally long."
"It took only a few days and a few decisions - or an inexcusable lack of decisions - for consumer confidence to be lost."
"However, there is no doubt that it will take months, or even years, and also firm guarantees of quality control for that confidence to be restored."
"We must face the fact that as well as this exceptional crisis, there is a structural problem of adjusting supply to demand, to which solutions have to be found within the totally destabilized economic environment obtaining in the sector."
"Breeders are hostages to this situation, and they no longer know what to do."
"Faced with a widespread slump in sales and unduly low selling prices, they still have to meet their costs."
"At the same time, they are being asked to invest substantially in order to comply with environmental requirements, particularly in terms of the campaign against nitrate pollution."
"The cost of setting up environmentally friendly systems of storage and effluent treatment is very high, at a time when some breeders are wondering whether to continue their activity in the current economic situation, or if they should switch to more extensive farming methods."
"Since the European Union has not yet clearly indicated how it intends to resolve the economic and structural crises affecting the beef and veal sector, I think it is wise to pause before applying any measures which involve heavy investment in cattle breeding."
"There is surely no logic in asking breeders to invest now in plant which is of no use in the future, but for which they will still have to make the annual repayments."
"If we are to avoid hindering the establishment of a new European cattle breeding policy, we must not delay in showing cattle breeders, who are in the midst of a crisis, that the Union understands their concerns for the future and will not require them to invest in plant which may subsequently prove useless or unsuitable."
"In conclusion, I should like to draw attention to one of the implications of changing the composition of animal feeds."
"If animal proteins are replaced with plant proteins - for reasons which I think are quite legitimate - we shall have to review the agreement on protein plants concluded in the context of the GATT agreements, because the European Union's rate of self-supply is currently low and will increasingly decline."
"It is for this reason that we shall be supporting Mr Jacob's position."
"Commissioner, the least that can be said is that we were not caught unawares."
"It was impossible not to know."
"The laxity of the last few years was bound to have serious consequences."
"As a result, in order to restore consumer confidence, we need to follow the path of the contaminated meat meal, identify the holdings where this meal has been used as cattle feed, single out the animals which are contaminated or likely to be so, slaughter them, analyse the brain, spinal cord and lymphatic fluid, and incinerate or deeply bury the carcasses of the animals which are contaminated or suspected of being so."
"The cost of the analyses and the destruction of the carcasses, as well as that of the compensation for the loss of earnings of the beef and veal sector as a whole, should of course be borne entirely by the producers of this type of cattle feed."
"Those who have cheated have to foot the bill - and I am choosing my words carefully."
"It is unacceptable, it is criminal, that meat meal deemed unfit for consumption in the United Kingdom should have been exported for consumption in other countries."
"If the directives on the labelling of food products were applied throughout the Union in such a way as to indicate the region of breeding and slaughter, consumers would be able to decide in a more informed way whether or not to buy this product."
"It would only be necessary, for example, to label meat from the United Kingdom 'British beef' for consumers - households or restaurants - to know exactly what they were buying."
"In any event, the BSE crisis has demonstrated the fragility of the European Union, the instinct for renationalization, and the failure - or rather the non-existence - of European policy."
"Consequently, Commissioner, I should like to ask you the following question: to which budget will the administrative costs of providing these ECU 10 or so of compensation per animal be charged?"
"Mr President, first I would like to thank the Commissioner for coming forward with the proposal so promptly."
"I welcome the idea of setting aside a portion of the package to be distributed by the individual Member States to meet the needs of farmers facing acute financial problems."
"However, the crisis in the beef industry is unprecedented and much deeper than anything witnessed in the past."
"The losses to livestock farmers are colossal."
"In Ireland alone it is estimated that losses so far - since 20 March - are in the region of Irish £250 million."
"The price fall has not yet levelled out."
"In my view, stability will not return until decisive, radical and refocussed eradication measures are put in place and are seen by consumers to be producing results."
"Losses will continue for as long as we have not restored consumer confidence through total and complete eradication."
"It is obvious that the size of this package is totally inadequate to meet the real losses incurred by farmers."
"A package several times greater would be necessary to compensate farmers even for the losses incurred so far."
"I therefore propose that the fund be substantially increased."
"As a first step the package should be increased to ECU 1, 000 million."
"Also, the situation must be kept under constant review."
"The ECU 116 million - that is, ECU 9.5 million for my country, Ireland - to be distributed to Member States to meet cases of acute financial distress is also inadequate."
"Whatever the final figure is, we must ensure that this money is also used to support the producers of heifer beef who, under the present system receive no premium or compensation of any kind. Their losses have been greater than those of the producers of male cattle."
"This needs to be recognised and included in the package before us."
"Mr President, I wish to acknowledge the Commission decision to provide ECU 650 million compensation package for farmers who have and still do experience serious financial losses resulting from BSE."
"The collapse of the beef market is undoubtedly the most serious catastrophe to hit European agriculture and indirectly, employment in the agri-food sector."
"Scientists differ in their interpretation of the impact, if any, of BSE on public health."
"Consumers are understandably concerned and confused."
"In the process European farmers - the people on whom we rely to produce our food requirements - are in serious financial difficulty, so much so that many of them, even with compensation, will be forced out of business."
"In relation to the proposed compensation package I would say to the Commissioner that payment should be fast and efficient."
"There is no need to remind the Commissioner that the beef sector, even before the advent of BSE, was in financial difficulty."
"The problem with export refunds and the associated difficulty of developing third country markets had a bad impact on the profitability of the entire European beef sector."
"In our desire to compensate all farmers affected, and in particular the farmers most affected, we should try avoid introducing an over-bureaucratic system which would only tend to slow down the payment of compensation."
"I believe we should use the existing established structures of the special beef premium and suckler cow grants, both of which are part of the agreed CAP framework, as a means of determining the shareout of the additional funds between Member States while at the same time allowing individual governments to decide how best the package can be applied to each sector."
"I also believe that as a short-term measure and for the purpose of dealing with the build-up of animals due to the market collapse, beef heifers should be included with steers as being eligible for compensation."
"I do not believe that the compensation package of ECU 650 million is sufficient, but it is a start."
"We must put the system in place immediately for its implementation."
"My concluding comment is: get this money into the system fast; intensify our efforts to restore consumer confidence in beef as a quality food product, which is what it is; and assist in every way possible to develop third country markets as a profitable outlet for European beef."
"Mr President, I seek to paint a broader picture here tonight."
"A week ago I brought four workers to Brussels to make their case for recompense."
"They were workers from the Midland Meatpackers, one of the many abattoirs in my constituency which has been cruelly hit by the BSE crisis."
"They represented hundreds of workers who have already lost their jobs or whose jobs are under threat."
"They came to Brussels to seek justice."
"They are the hardest hit sector of the whole beef industry for their skills are not transferable."
"So they see themselves as having no future."
"They have lost everything."
"In two days they met many of the influential people and groups within Parliament."
"You, yourself, generously gave them some of your time."
"The workers returned home to Northamptonshire buoyed-up and encouraged by the support from all sides."
"You, Commissioner, are on record as saying that those most severely affected should have priority funding."
"But fine words are cheap and that encouragement will soon melt away."
"I tonight would remind you of your words."
"I would remind you of the undertaking in the Treaty on the CAP which promises the means for agricultural workers to find gainful employment."
"I would remind you that money is available both in Objective 5(a) and 5(b) and in Objective 4 to find recompense for these workers."
"So, I have five questions to put to you, Commissioner."
"First of all, do you agree that these workers are entitled to recompense and do you endorse it?"
"Secondly, that the funding that I have mentioned should and could be used for that purpose?"
"Thirdly, that although the UK Government has opted out of Objective 5(a) it could and should be encouraged to take that option up again and use the money accordingly?"
"Fourthly, will you give an undertaking that all funding will be allocated on the basis of need, not just to farmers and abattoir owners but to everyone who has been so cruelly affected by this appalling disaster?"
"Finally, will the Commission urge the UK Government to use the contingency funding at its disposal to offset the job losses?"
"If you give these undertakings, Commissioner, you will demonstrate that the European Union is indeed an institution that has at its heart the wellbeing of all its citizens irrespective of influence, status or political favouritism, and as such you will be an institution that will be applauded."
"Mr President, I would like to add my voice to those expressing their concern about those beyond the immediate farms who are being affected by this crisis."
"A county council in my constituency, Shropshire, has produced this report."
"I believe it is the first report of its kind to look at the local impact on the economy of the BSE crisis."
"It paints a very worrying picture."
"We already know that at least 700 jobs have been lost in meat processing, road haulage and in the markets."
"We also know that an estimated £100 million has been taken out of our local economy and that will have further knock-on effects."
"We also know that this impact is being felt most acutely in our small market towns which already have fragile rural economies and that is why they already qualify for Objective 5(b). This is a blow that they just cannot cope with."
"We now need to focus on how we can bring help to those people."
"We need to look at Objectives 5(a) and 5(b). Possibly we need to look at something like a RECHAR or RESIDER programme for agriculture, but action is needed very, very quickly."
"Commissioner, I have your copy here."
"I will give it to you before you leave tonight."
"There have been reports on the BBC tonight that the Commission meeting here has worked out a formula for the end of the ban on British beef."
"I would be very grateful if tonight you would tell us exactly what that formula is so that we can report it back to our constituents."
"Mr President, losses have been suffered."
"Very large losses have been suffered, Commissioner, in this animal health disaster."
"We could have dealt with this disaster on the basis of a simple principle - that of the assumption of responsibilities: by the British producers of Doncaster, in Yorkshire; by the British Government; and by the French importers."
"You have opted for the principle of solidarity."
"You are making the responsibility collective, and that is all very well."
"On this basis, compensation should be provided for all losses."
"But no, you have decided on a figure of ECU 650 million for the 81 million cattle that are affected."
"That actually makes ECU 8 per animal."
"According to the proposal, it is ECU 10 per animal."
"Mr Jacob's proposal of ECU 50 per animal - which is little enough - has been rejected. And the idea of an additional premium for non-intensive farms has been rejected too."
"In other words, you have rejected responsibility in favour of solidarity, and you have dismissed solidarity in favour of greed, mediocrity and accounting."
"Nor is there any provision for preventive measures - Mr Happart referred to this - or the renegotiation of the agreements on protein plants and oilseeds."
"I must say, Commissioner, that this affair is getting off to a very bad start."
"I am not addressing you personally, but the Commission as a whole, as well as your predecessors, who bore a very great responsibility and who, when the time came to meet that responsibility, did very little, as the records make clear."
"Put yourself in the place of the cattle breeders."
"I understand why they have doubts about European integration and the protection that it will afford them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the House sincerely for the urgency with which it has addressed the important issue that we are debating today, and also for the speedy way that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and particularly its chairman Mr Jacob, put together this report."
"The first point I have to emphasize is that since 20 March, beef producers throughout the European Union have found themselves in a major crisis and have been facing serious financial pressures."
"Since that date, the Commission has initiated a whole range of measures, starting with the opening of intervention which has already accounted for 150 000 tonnes of meat, with a further 30 000 tonnes earmarked for intervention in June. We have made use of every market instrument at our disposal, from an increase in export refunds to private storage, in order to at least reduce the impact of the problem."
"Like you, however, I am aware that all of this taken together is not enough."
"We must go a step further and provide additional income subsidies."
"There is a general consensus - and this was evident again from today's debate - that producers must be helped as quickly as possible, with a minimum of red tape."
"However, this also means that we must organize the income support within the 1996 budget."
"The fact that the EAGGF year ends on 15 October means that we must design our measures in such a way that they can be implemented before that date."
"We therefore began by trying to estimate the loss of income among beef producers which could be expected in the current year, and to establish how much scope we had in the 1996 budget."
"On that basis, we came up with the figure of ECU 650 million which is being discussed today."
"As I told the House earlier in the month, an additional ECU 200 m has been earmarked for support measures in connection with BSE."
"When that is spent, however, we shall have exhausted all the scope available to us, according to the current estimates of our budget margin for this year."
"This means that we cannot go above the sum of ECU 650 m."
"We then come to the question of how the ECU 650 m is to be shared out."
"Under the first proposal, made by the Commission on 20 May, additional payments were to be provided only to those producers who had claimed premiums for suckler cows or male cattle in the previous year."
"While this option is a very simple one to implement, it does, of course, have certain disadvantages."
"The Member States therefore sought a more flexible approach and called for account to be taken of those issues which were not addressed adequately in the proposal."
"In response, we came up with a flexible arrangement for 20 % of the ECU 650 m total, a figure of ECU 116 m, which was to be shared among the Member States, with the option of including in the distribution of that sum those producers who are receiving no premiums, or only limited premiums."
"According to the amendments from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, it is now proposed to allocate a larger proportion of the total for national distribution and a smaller proportion for topping up cattle premiums."
"However, an option as far-reaching as this would lead to serious problems, particularly as regards the coherence of the measures in question, and above all would jeopardize the main objective of getting these sums of money paid out to farmers quickly, in other words before 15 October."
"This objection concerns in particular Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 13."
"Also, a considerable period of time would be required to set up appropriate new administrative and indeed monitoring mechanisms in time to be effective, and this would create difficulties that would make it impossible to ensure that the resources were shared out in good time."
"However, the Commission recognizes Parliament's wish to create greater flexibility and will convey that concern to the Council, to the extent that it does not jeopardize the main objective to which I have already referred."
"As for the request that the Commission should do its utmost to ensure greater use of plant proteins in animal feed, and to guarantee that cattle are fed solely on plant rather than animal products, I must emphasize on the one hand that there is already very considerable support for plant protein cultivation in the European Union, and on the other that a prohibition on feeding animal or bone meal to ruminants has been in place for some time, and of course we intend to retain that prohibition in the future."
"Moreover, we believe that we must take a rather cautious approach to further intensification of stock-farming, particularly in view of likely consumer trends in the Union."
"Finally, as regards the option of providing national subsidies, I would point out that measures of this kind were applied during the last beef crisis in 1990 and 1991."
"By providing government subsidies, Member States can address specific problems of their own that are not fully covered by the Community resources."
"On the question of assistance for those employed in the processing industry, I would remind you that I addressed that issue in depth during Question Time earlier today."
"President Santer, in his speech tomorrow morning, will give his detailed views on the Commission decision this evening on the so-called framework programme submitted by the British Government."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)"
"Topical and urgent debate (objections)"
"The next item is the vote on objections concerning the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance (Rule 47)."
"On Item II, Nuclear Waste:"
"Mr President, I am surprised that you have allowed the objection in the topical and urgent debate pursuant to Rule 47, i.e. to switch the question of the transporting of atomic waste with the subject of elections in Bosnia."
"I am referring to Rule 47, which says that a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with paragraph 1 cannot be included on the agenda for a debate on topical and urgent subjects etc. etc.... if the subject covered by this motion is already on the agenda for that part-session."
"Now there is absolutely no doubt, Mr Hänsch, that the subjects of the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and elections are already on the agenda, since they feature in several reports that are to be debated this afternoon."
"The reports by Mr Alavanos, Mr Mendiluce Pereiro, Mr Giansily, Mr Titley and Mr Pex are of course concerned with this subject."
"I am very surprised that you should ever have allowed the motion by the Group of the European People's Party."
"In doing so you have created a precedent!"
"I am therefore requesting that the matter should be discussed again this afternoon, at the Conference of Presidents, because up to now it has always been argued, in practice, that subjects for topical and urgent debate are not allowed if the subject is already being dealt with in other debates."
"Mrs Roth, we shall discuss the matter at the Conference of Presidents this afternoon, as you wish, but as far as this morning and the topical and urgent debate are concerned, Parliament has taken its decision and will abide by that decision."
"European Council in Florence - IGC"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the statements by the Council and Commission on the preparation for the European Council meeting in Florence on 21 and 22 June; -the oral questions by Mr Morán López, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, to the Council (B40444/96-0-0115/96) and to the Commission (B4-0445/96-0-0116/96) on the progress of the IGC.I have just discovered that the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs is still on his way here."
"He has not yet arrived, so I propose that we should follow a procedure that is somewhat different from our normal one, and begin the debate with the Commission's statement, so as not to waste any time."
"I have also arranged for the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs to be informed of this."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Santer, is prepared to open today's debate by giving his statement."
"Mr Santer, please take the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council to be held in Florence in two days' time is of special significance for the future of our Union."
"I am therefore pleased to have this opportunity of letting you know the Commission's position on what it considers to be the priority items on the European Council's agenda."
"Before doing so, however, I would first like to congratulate the Italian presidency on the work accomplished during the last six months, of which Florence will be the crowning achievement."
"The task has not been easy."
"The problems confronting the Union have been numerous and difficult, and the internal political situation in Italy can hardly have failed to add to the worries of Mr Dini and his colleagues."
"In spite of that, they have succeeded in driving forward the European ship by keeping the Union as one of their foremost priorities."
"They have held to the course identified at the Madrid European Council despite all the Cassandras and siren voices that could have deflected them from the direct route to the achievement of our objectives."
"I should like to offer my sincere thanks to the Italian authorities, and more particularly to Mr Dini for his dynamic and enthusiastic contribution as President of the European Council and of the General Affairs Council."
"Mr Dini will shortly be giving you a complete survey of the European Council's Florence agenda."
"It is still the business of the presidency to decide on this agenda, so that I can restrict myself to dealing with the Commission's major priorities."
"The Commission is seeking a new impetus both in the fight against unemployment and in the work of the IGC, and it would like the European Council to restore calm in our institutions, which are being seriously disturbed by the so-called 'mad cow' crisis."
"As has often been said, employment is our first priority."
"It is this conviction which led me to propose a Confidence Pact for jobs and it is this same conviction which was the basis of the communication from the Commission I presented to you on 5 June in Brussels under the title 'Action for jobs - a Confidence Pact' ."
"I will not repeat the details of this communication here, but will simply remind you that our aim is to launch a collective approach, involving public authorities and the social partners, by defining their respective commitments, in a coordinated global strategy."
"Everybody should shoulder their responsibilities and everybody should take on concrete commitments at their own level."
"The foundations of the strategy for jobs now exist and are sound."
"Since the adoption of the White Paper 'Growth, Competitiveness, Employment' in 1993, the fifteen Member States have been united in the same basic choice of macro-economic and structural policies which have been reinforced during successive European Councils."
"Moreover, my tour of European capitals has confirmed to me that all the governments and all the social partners are more than ever aware that the highest priority must be given to the fight against unemployment."
"The approach outlined in my proposal for the Confidence Pact has been welcomed in the great majority of capitals."
"The panel of social partners has stressed its importance and urgency, and the tripartite conference held in Rome last weekend gave it wide support."
"The conclusions of this conference totally agree with the Commission's communication and correspond exactly to the spirit of my proposal, seeking a mobilization of all those involved and an assumption of responsibility at all levels."
"I hope the European Council in Florence will follow the same line and that the Heads of State and Government will build on the foundation of the support recorded for the Pact."
"Thus, Florence could be for employment what Madrid was for the single currency: namely, a confirmation of the political will and an instruction to the Council of Ministers to take short-term decisions and to start work leading to later decisions."
"The Confidence Pact is not something that can be achieved overnight."
"It is a matter, as I have just said, of determining responsibilities, mobilizing all those involved, creating synergies, energizing all the elements which can help to create jobs, whether it be the internal market, the macro-economic policy, or anything else."
"This must be done as a matter of urgency and to the greatest possible extent."
"Something concrete must be achieved in the short term."
"This is the approach adopted by the Commission in its communication on the Confidence Pact and I hope the European Council will follow our lead by declaring itself in favour of the Pact and by confirming the main lines of action defined in our communication: namely, firstly, the creation of a favourable macro-economic framework with sustainable growth, based on monetary stability and a sound financial policy."
"Secondly, full exploitation of the potential of the internal market."
"Some real progress must be made before the end of the year in order to complete and improve it."
"Our competitiveness must be strengthened, small and medium-sized enterprises must be helped and our access to world markets must be opened up."
"One aspect particularly close to my heart is the construction of trans-European networks."
"These are an indispensable element in the infrastructure and without them the potential of the internal market cannot be fully realized."
"The European Council has expressed its own wishes in calling for trans-European networks."
"It should now, this time once and for all, decide on the resources to be made available for their construction."
"The Commission has made its proposal in line with this reasoning and I ask the European Council to be faithful to the same reasoning, which in any case follows from its previous decisions."
"The third line of action to be followed is to speed up reform of the system of employment through closer monitoring of the implementation of the Essen priorities, by activating national employment policies and opening up large sites for future employment."
"Fourthly, as a matter of priority, using European structural policies for job creation in allocating the uncommitted ECU billions available up to 1999."
"That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is our first priority for the European Council."
"The message from the Heads of State and Government should be one of confidence."
"In that way they can show citizens that Europe is a force, a force for a large-scale mobilization in the battle against unemployment, a force that will bring about the convergence of national policies and that will create the added value necessary to rescue us from the jobs crisis."
"A message of confidence, I also hope, for the second major item on the Florence agenda: the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us be frank."
"The situation at the moment does not fill us with enthusiasm."
"The Italian presidency has started work with a great deal of commitment, and it is not their fault if their work lacks dynamism."
"We have to recognize that negotiations have not really started."
"Let us not make the mistake of thinking we have plenty of time or that we can calmly await clarification of the political situation in this or that Member State."
"The problems to be solved are numerous and complex."
"Their solution is urgent if we seriously wish to prepare the Union for enlargement, as already decided in principle, if we wish to convince citizens that the Union is a project with which they can identify, and if we wish to avoid the mistakes of the past by creating the margin of time necessary for democratic debate before, and not after, negotiations."
"Do the negotiators fully understand this urgency?"
"Have they a clear vision of the aims of the Intergovernmental Conference?"
"I am not alone in asking myself these questions."
"I heard them from many delegations during the conference which has just been held in Rome."
"I conclude from this that there is an awareness among Member States that something has to change."
"This awareness must be transformed into a new impetus that the European Council should give to the work."
"The political will expressed at the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference in Turin on 29 March must be confirmed."
"We must change into a higher gear."
"We must fully commit ourselves to negotiation, and do so at a level worthy of the high ambitions for the future of an enlarged, more securely based and efficient Union."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the third important subject for the European Council in Florence is the so-called 'mad cow' crisis that has shaken the Union over the last few months."
"Our farmers throughout the Union have suffered serious financial losses, consumer confidence has been undermined, our institutions have been paralysed and the damage caused by the crisis is severe."
"The European Council offers the chance of a turning point, a chance that must be seized."
"Yesterday evening, the European Commission set out its position, which it will formulate in a document for Florence at the request of the General Affairs Council."
"One principle is essential for the Commission."
"All our actions must be based on, and inspired by, the absolute and sole imperative of protecting the health of our citizens."
"Lifting the ban on British exports is therefore strictly conditional upon the eradication of BSE."
"Since the source of this disease is in the United Kingdom, it is the British authorities who must put into effect the eradication measures required for the ban to be lifted."
"This has been the constant position of the Commission ever since the beginning of the crisis on 21 March, and it will remain its position until the end of the crisis."
"It will not be affected by political pressure, by blocking moves, even by the use of the veto."
"The biggest mistake that could be made would be to turn the crisis into a politicians' issue."
"We cannot play around with health!"
"(Applause) And in respecting this principle, it should be possible to come to an agreement in Florence about preconditions, about the stages and procedures that will allow us to consider, step by step, the normalization of the beef trade with the United Kingdom, but any decisions will have to be based on the best and most recent scientific knowledge available."
"Any decision will necessarily have to pass through the normal procedures, with the full participation of veterinary and scientific experts from Member States, and any decision will have to be subject to rigorous monitoring, prior to its implementation, before the ban can really be relaxed."
"There will be no blank cheque!"
"The Commission for its part will contribute fully to the search for a solution to the crisis."
"It expects the United Kingdom to do the same, not only by taking all the steps necessary to restore consumer confidence and to stabilize the market, but also to enable the institutions to function normally."
"To put it bluntly, the Commission expects the policy of non-cooperation to end."
"Without this commitment, there will be no agreement in Florence!"
"(Applause) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have restricted myself to the three topics that in my opinion are matters of priority for Florence, but I also express the hope that the European Council will ensure that everything is in place so that, at its next meeting, it can take the decisions necessary, according to the agreed programme, to move towards the introduction of the single currency."
"I also hope that, as a result of the commitments entered into at its meeting in Cannes, the European Council can finally lift the blocking of Europol, thus making it possible to increase the cooperation essential for strengthening the internal security of the Union."
"Here then, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, are the hopes and expectations that I wish to express on the eve of the European Council in Florence and, as I already know, are yours also."
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you Mr President of the Commission."
"The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Presidentin-Office of the Council of the European Union, Mr Dini, is also here now."
"I should like to welcome him most warmly, and ask him to speak straightaway."
"Mr President-in-Office, please take the floor."
"Thank you very much, Mr Dini."
"I shall now call upon the author of the oral questions, Mr Morán López, to speak."
"Mr President, Mr President-inOffice of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should firstly like to thank you for the clear and detailed information you have given."
"The responsibility for organizing the launch of the Intergovernmental Conference has fallen to the Italian presidency."
"It is not necessary to remind the House that, at this stage of the process of European integration, the work of this conference is crucial."
"On the one hand, it must strengthen and consolidate Europe's institutions; and, on the other, it must fine-tune them with a view to the enlargement of the Union."
"We should remember and applaud the fact, in this context, that when the Italian presidency addressed the issue of the participation of Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference, it took a positive line."
"The stance adopted by certain other Member States, on the other hand, will prevent Parliament from participating to the extent that it was involved - and with good results, I believe - in the Reflection Group."
"Nevertheless, it should be recognized that the degree of Parliament's - and, by extension, the European public's - involvement in the Intergovernmental Conference will be far greater than it was at the time of the negotiation of the Maastricht Treaty."
"There is therefore a need to recognize this and address the important issues with which the conference will deal from the perspective of Parliament and the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"We know that in its initial stages, under the Italian presidency, the conference has identified the Member States' positions as regards the issues involved in the revision of the Treaties. And we cannot fail to be concerned at the fact that certain Member States are resisting both the extension of codecision to all legislative acts and the institution of qualified majority voting in the Council as the general rule."
"As things stand, there is a risk of the conference becoming bogged down or leading to only minimal revisions, thereby defining a European Union which is inadequate in terms of the challenges which we are facing and the demands of European public opinion which can clearly be discerned, in a process which ultimately provides the Union with its legitimacy."
"The European public - and Parliament as its representative in our contacts with intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations - have set out a series of demands which Europe's institutions have to meet in order for a new process of social legitimation to take place."
"Firstly, there is the strengthening of European citizenship, as well as effective cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs, especially as regards the bringing of certain third-pillar matters into the Community domain and the stepping-up of cooperation on others, including the improvement of internal security and the effective combating of terrorism and organized crime, with all the consequences that derive from this, not least as regards the Treaties."
"With regard to employment and social protection, the European public wishes them to be dealt with in a separate Treaty chapter."
"I welcome Mr Santer's words and initiatives in this respect."
"On the basis of what Mr Dini said, I am confident that the Italian presidency supports this approach, and I would urge both the presidency and the Commission to continue along these lines, since without the degree of social integration represented by full employment and adequate social protection, the Union will be deprived of its legitimacy."
"The Union's institutions must be more effective, more democratic and more transparent."
"We know that at the current stage of the conference, issues such as the weighting of votes, the extension of qualified majority voting and the simplification of legislative procedures have not yet achieved a minimum consensus."
"All this gives rise to hope and concern: hope in the work of the Italian presidency; concern at the existing problems and the UK Government's blocking of the Community process."
"Consequently, the committee of which I am chairman is calling for an effort from the Italian presidency, and asks the President-in-Office what measures, what initiatives, the presidency intends to take to ensure that the Florence summit is the success we wish it to be."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking both Mr Santer and Mr Dini for their speeches this morning."
"The detail of much of what they have said will be taken up by colleagues from my group who will speak later in this debate."
"As leader of the Socialist Group, I want to concentrate on the major political issue which currently confronts the Union."
"My group today wants to make it entirely clear that we utterly condemn the aggressive and offensive campaign waged by Conservative politicians and some of the media in the United Kingdom against our partners in the rest of Europe."
"We want to express our shared horror at the apparent ease with which connotations of war, the language of hate and the symbols of intolerance have so readily been invoked in the United Kingdom."
"The British Government has chosen a policy of non-cooperation with its partners in Europe."
"They have chosen to veto European actions across a wide spectrum."
"They have been responsible for preventing action, for example, to fight fraud in Europe and to deal with insolvency by which so many companies in Europe are affected."
"Unbelievably, they have refused to allow 1997 to be designated European Year against Racism."
"These, amongst approximately 70 other EU actions, are all vetoed."
"I ask myself: is this an appropriate, reasonable or coherent way to make friends and influence people?"
"Is this the way to solve a crisis of consumer confidence?"
"Will it deal with the real public health fears of Europe's people?"
"The answer has to be no."
"Perhaps the British Government has cause to bring the European Union to its most serious decision-making crisis ever."
"Have I missed something?"
"Was BSE exported to Britain by another Member State of the Union?"
"Of course not!"
"The British Government's inept handling of the British-generated BSE crisis has led to collapsing beef sales all across Europe."
"All the European Union's industry is paying the price for one government's incompetence."
"This Friday and Saturday in Florence our fifteen prime ministers have a job to do."
"They must take real action to fight the scourge of unemployment in Europe which Mr Santer so eloquently described."
"For my group it is entirely unacceptable and unforgivable for one government to prevent action on measures to create jobs when that same government has in its own hands the resolution to this institutional crisis."
"Every Member of this House wants to see the ban on British beef lifted, but every Member recognizes the need for substantive scientific evidence to determine the resolution to this crisis and every Member recognizes the concern of their own citizens."
"Abandonment in Britain of government control has allowed free rein to an industry responsible for contaminating massive swathes of its own country's dairy and beef herds."
"When action was finally taken to ban the use of such foodstuffs in the domestic market, that same industry had absolutely no scruples of conscience about selling potentially infected foodstuffs to feed the herds in the rest of Europe."
"Where is the morality in that?"
"Where is the sense of decency and where is any modicum of acceptable business ethics."
"In the view of my group this is the political reality of ill-considered, ideologically motivated deregulation of the Thatcher sort."
"Yesterday the Commission adopted a framework agreement for dealing with BSE which is designed to come into being simultaneously with the abandonment of the British Government of its policy of non-cooperation."
"We welcome that positive signal from the Commission but there can be no half measures."
"The Conservative Government in Britain must abandon its non-cooperation policy fully and immediately and the framework agreement must be posited on substantiated scientific data."
"I am a Londoner, I am British and I am European."
"I am proud to be all of these."
"I call on the British Government to respond in the spirit of the Treaty and allow Europe to function for the good of all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, I think we all agree that the European Union is going through a severe crisis, for two reasons."
"The first is the risk which looms of a crisis of public confidence in Europe's ability to safeguard something as essential as public health."
"It would be paradoxical if the European idea were to founder in a crisis of confidence over contaminated animal feed and the risks of the disease being transferred to humans."
"For this reason the Commission must draw up a plan with the aid of independent experts and get this disease eradicated."
"I think the most important need now is to restore confidence."
"Some Member States have had the courage to tackle this in the past."
"In my country amongst others we eradicated swine fever with help from the European Union."
"And the crisis is extremely acute because the fundamental rules of the European Union are being challenged."
"We live and work in a legally constituted community which is based on fundamental rules of law. These include, for example, Article 5 of the Treaty, and I quote Article 5(2) of the Treaty which says that Member States ʼshall abstain from any measure which could jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of this Treaty'."
"Respect for Community law, and respect for Article 5 of the Treaty, means that a Member State cannot place itself outside the European system of law by deliberately blocking the normal working of the European Union."
"So the UK Government's policy of non-cooperation has consequences, for public opinion, and for ourselves too."
"This policy of non-cooperation has done more than anything else to highlight the need, the urgent need for more widespread majority decision-making in the Council."
"These, then, are the two fundamental problems facing the Florence European Council. There is no doubt, Mr President-in-Office, that the meeting will be dominated by these two fundamental questions."
"We hope a solution will be found to them."
"In recent months Parliament has been accused of being too long-suffering, has been criticized for that."
"It is true that we have spent much time and effort on efforts amongst the big groups to talk and to seek a solution."
"Without success, unfortunately."
"This is why the resolution put down by various groups of people from the various political groups is particularly clear and particularly critical."
"I hope the European Council will take this resolution seriously."
"We had hoped that the Florence Council would be a Council for jobs."
"We need to talk about the IGC, of course, about foreign policy, but the major objective was jobs."
"The most original feature of this debate, I think, was the promise you made on jobs, Mr President of the Commission."
"You called to mind a number of essential things."
"For example the fact that the existence of a single market and a single currency, so characteristic of the American economy, enables that economy to develop new activities and create new jobs."
"But your statement, your ambition to establish the social dialogue, your ambition to find new ways and means of solving the enormous social problem of unemployment, are especially original and promising."
"They are a sign of hope."
"I sincerely trust that the Florence Council will not degenerate into squabbles over mad cow disease, but that it will produce a sign of hope that social dialogue, the originality of your proposal, of your pact of confidence, will prevail over squabbles which threaten to damage public confidence in the European idea."
"Mr President, the Florence European Council provides an opportunity, not to be lost, to put a positive stamp on this six months which frankly, up to now, has not produced the expected results."
"True, the presidency's work was made more difficult by the national elections and the crisis in relations between Great Britain and the European Union."
"On that point let us hope that by keeping to the course it was right to adopt the Italian presidency can succeed in saving the Florence summit, which British intransigence has put at risk."
"We hope the summit can produce positive results on the fundamental issue of unemployment which you yourself described, President Dini, when you inaugurated the Italian term, as the most urgent problem to be dealt with, and you confirmed that position today in this Chamber."
"So we ask you to speed up the initiation of a policy to stem the tide of unemployment and commit your successor to continue the battle against this great European evil."
"18 million unemployed bring shame on the Union."
"Here the question of the single currency also needs to be clarified."
"We are firmly convinced that if the Euro is to become the currency of all the Member States, it should be introduced with the simultaneous participation of all. A currency that divides cannot fulfil the role of bridge to political union, with a common foreign and security policy which needs to have its bases strengthened in Florence."
"We want the Italian presidency to leave a strong impact for the Irish presidency to inherit, but so far the presence we are asking for has not been sufficiently felt in the crises involving former Yugoslavia, Israel and Lebanon, or in the Mediterranean."
"Europe cannot look eastward only, it must also turn its spotlight on the South."
"Emigration, transport, agriculture and fisheries are all Mediterranean issues which need to be examined more closely in the last moments of this six months than has been the case up to now."
"Finally, a word on Slovenia: as an Italian, I call for real guarantees and protection for our citizens who have suffered economic damage caused by former Yugoslavia."
"The Italian presidency now has a good card to play on the Council table to recover lost time."
"It is up to you, Mr President-in-Office, spurred on by playing at home in your own Florence, to demonstrate that you have the political determination and initiative necessary to ensure that the judgement on the Italian six months is positive."
"Mr President, paradoxically there is a useful side to the otherwise unjustifiable blocking of European Union decisions by Great Britain."
"In fact it demonstrates to the full the fragility of the Union's present institutional mechanism."
"Intergovernmental cooperation is a cumbersome and inadequate instrument: that has been seen and is still seen in the European Union's lack of presence in foreign policy, as witness Yugoslavia."
"It is a real contradiction to have a common currency, but no common economic, fiscal, or employment policy, no common foreign policy, and no common justice policy."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party hopes that contradiction will be resolved in a positive way and that Europe will take the path of federalism."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is certainly not moving in that direction, at least not so far, and President Santer was right to state that clearly."
"When the Council opens in Florence, I hope the Italian government will recognize all this frankly, and make it no routine meeting but a turning point in the political history of European integration."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, the European United Left, I should like to make three comments which reflect three general but deep concerns."
"The first is the impression that the Intergovernmental Conference is becoming dissipated and stagnating, with the added problem of the BSE crisis."
"It could be said that the conference has begun to lack intensity and substance."
"We wish the conference to be consolidated. We wish to see fresh impetus given, and decisions taken at the Florence summit which signify that the IGC exists and is meeting with a response from the European public."
"The second concern is the role of the European Parliament."
"Despite the efforts of our representatives, starting with the President of Parliament, it must be said that Parliament does not have the necessary weight in the Union's democratic balance, at a time when there is a call for greater democracy, transparency and representativeness in Europe's democratic fabric."
"At times, Mr Dini and Mr Santer, Parliament seems to be playing a role similar to that played by the government of a country which is not yet a Member State but which wishes to join the European Union: it has a presence, it can speak, but it takes little part in decision-making."
"We are calling for the requirement of Parliament's assent for any revision of the Treaties to be recognized swiftly and written into the Treaty."
"And the third concern is European society and unemployment."
"You have never struck us as being a dogmatic politician or economist, Mr Dini."
"You will therefore understand that in the eyes of many European citizens, the urgency and rigidity of the conditions for achieving the single currency in accordance with the German conservative model are serving to legitimize policies which are sometimes anti-social and, to a large extent, discourage public investment in the Member States."
"They do not, therefore, promote employment. Our group does not give much credence to the stability pact, or indeed the confidence pact."
"We need different macroeconomic policies which generate employment."
"And we do not wish to be told, a few months or years from now, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, what Chancellor Kohl was told by German demonstrators in Bonn with a large banner: ' You, the European Union, are not combating unemployment, you are combating the unemployed' ."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, the Greens feel bound to express our deep concern about the future of the European Union, because while we are discussing the Intergovernmental Conference which has opened in Turin, events external to that Conference are undermining Europe's prospects."
"What has happened with the mad cow crisis and the United Kingdom's decision to block business shows that there is lack of respect for Article 5 of the Treaty, and that the existing Treaty is no longer tenable and would be even less so should there be enlargement."
"Given this situation I believe we must vigorously confirm, the European Union must vigorously confirm that an effort is needed within the Intergovernmental Conference to achieve greater internal democracy and establish the conditions necessary for enlargement to go ahead safely."
"And that is why it may be important - and I say this particularly to representatives of the European Socialist Party - for the European Union, under attack from the United Kingdom and faced with these blocking tactics, to act as fourteen countries for the time being, because by its obstruction the United Kingdom has de facto withdrawn from joint decisions."
"We must be in a position to move forward, above all reassuring consumers about BSE, all European consumers, starting with British consumers who face difficulties as a result of their government's decisions."
"We must work harder all round, in every sense, starting with the Florence Summit."
"On employment, the Greens are not at all satisfied to be told yet again that the only alternative is to reiterate the need for major infrastructure projects, and that the agreement obtained on the trans-European transport network is a great result."
"Here too we have seen a debate about the prerogatives of the European Parliament and an attack on the Maastricht agreements, with Parliament prevented from discussing fourteen projects on the pretext that the decisions had already been taken, which meant Parliament was denied the opportunity of co-decision."
"Such attacks call into question and threaten the future of Europe, and they do not augur well for good progress at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It does not solve the employment problem if the most we can do is offer firms new profit margins, which provides no guarantee of employment, and also damages the environment and social security."
"Nor are we satisfied with what we have heard on foreign policy."
"We have heard nothing about Albania."
"We have heard that the Turkish premier will be present in Florence despite was is going on in Turkey internally and externally, and we do not have a commitment to MEDA."
"But we are satisfied that this administration has finally made an agreement with Slovenia."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, it is a real shame, President Dini, that you arrived late this morning at the debate on preparations for the Florence European Council, as you would have been able to hear President Santer's speech which brought some politics into this debate rather than simply presenting us with a list of expenditure as you have done: frankly that could probably have been circulated as a working document."
"Allow me to draw your attention to some of the points made by the President of the Commission: on the IGC, President Santer confirmed that the record so far is hardly exciting, and we all know President Santer is a byword for prudence so I think that says it all."
"The Italian presidency, the government you led earlier, and the present government, chose not to give the negotiating group the necessary political profile and substantially the result is that not one step forward has been taken in six months."
"President Santer has taken a clear, firm and consistent position on the British crisis, without any pretence of mediating on everything and between everyone, based on the health of European citizens and consumers, and that came through in his speech."
"Will the Italian presidency support these priorities? Will it confirm that the ban will only be lifted when the disease has been eradicated?"
"Will the Italian presidency do everything in its power to make the British government face up to its responsibilities on BSE and the intolerable paralysis of the institutions, which, incredibly, you seem to regard merely as a source of regret?"
"Does the Italian presidency confirm that any decision on the subject will be based first and foremost on the most precise scientific evidence possible?"
"True, the presidency has cleared the way for the agreement with Slovenia, overturning the position of the Dini government on that, and will sign the agreement on Uzbekistan: a drop in the ocean, in my view."
"Mr President, I was rather surprised and pleased by Mr Santer's words on taking up his office: less and better."
"In 1993, there were 17 000 EU rules, so a clear-out was needed in the mass of legislation."
"Now the subsidiarity principle was to be applied: let the Member States take care of those matters which cannot be dealt with better in Brussels."
"It was the right approach, but unfortunately Mr Santer has not been able to deliver the goods."
"There are now 21 392 regulations, directives and other laws."
"The quantity of legislation has increased elevenfold in 22 years."
"But instead of a clear-out, it is now planned to press on regardless with majority decision-making and hence more government from Brussels."
"We propose a different approach."
"The limits of the EU's powers should be defined, so that it deals with international topics. EU legislation should begin and end in national parliaments, so our citizens are able to keep track of it."
"The Commission should only put forward proposals if asked to do so by the national parliaments. The EU should only be able to adopt common minimum rules, and standards should become a voluntary means of assistance instead of a centralized dictatorship."
"It is all very well for a fruit wholesaler to be able to refer to common standards on the size of strawberries in international trade, but my mother-in-law does not need any EU rules to sell the freshly picked strawberries from her garden to people who can see the fruit."
"It is all very well to have common minimum rules on the employment of children, but my wife and I do not need an EU directive to decide whether our son should deliver newspapers."
"It is all very well to have common rules on what kind of toxic substances can be deposited in groundwater, but it is worse than mad cow disease when a majority in the Commission in Brussels is ready to stop a local authority setting tougher limits on the pollution of groundwater, which is not an international commodity..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker) ... and I would not least suggest to the President of the Commission that he should open the Florence summit by putting forward a long list of proposals to abolish..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, you have mentioned the achievements of the preceding six months, and you have listed the goals to be achieved in the next six months, but we have really heard very little of the results obtained in the Italian six months."
"Perhaps you took out those pages, but I cannot believe there were any extra pages, because everyone knows the standard times for speeches in this Chamber, you more than anyone."
"I do not think Italy has brought any honour upon itself with its lax attitude to Slovenia over property taken from Italians and not yet restored."
"Nor is it to the credit of our presidency that there has been no reference to human rights in countries we import from, countries which use child labour and where social security is totally lacking."
"We ought to be trying to protect the physical and moral health of these people, and protect our economy."
"As regards the grave embarrassment of the British government and the economic damage, it might have been avoided if something had been done earlier."
"I remember asking the Commission a question a year and a half ago, and the reply was that everything was under control. So much under control that we are where we are today!"
"We are delighted with the initiative to create a European Observatory for Racism and Xenophobia and we would modestly suggest a home for it."
"We see Mantua as the home for this agency, because that is where the pilot project saw the light of day, establishing how and when the phenomenon of racism and xenophobia arises, if only inside Italy."
"As we live through the final days of the Italian presidency and approach the Florence Summit, I would like to remind everyone here of the need to return finally to the aims of the founding fathers of the European Union."
"We talk too much about money and economics these days and never about the deeper political union which is the indispensable prelude, the sine qua non , for achieving economic union, the single currency and a minimum of welfare."
"It is impossible, inconceivable, that the unemployment afflicting 20 million citizens in Europe can be eliminated if we do not achieve the political union that will give impetus and power to economic union."
"There will certainly be interests, outside Europe too, seeking to impede the achievement of this union, but we are ready to fight for it in the knowledge that despite different cultural and political origins there are people in this Parliament who stand by political union, because they know that is where the future lies, and the alternative is war between poor people."
"If political union is not achieved first - I wish the Italian presidency would commit itself to this - enlargement will only lead to massacres of poor people by other poor people and a constant rise in unemployment while the rich and powerful keep getting richer and more powerful."
"We do not want oligarchies, we want democracy for all citizens equally, and we also want to remind the Italian presidency of the obligation to act in such a way that all are equal inside the European Union, and in particular that the problems of Italian firms should be dealt with by the same standards as other countries."
"It so happens that at the moment we are the only country where a formal decision has been applied on the issue of telephone systems, while no measures have yet been applied in other countries in the same position."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I would like to concentrate on the fact that Florence is the last act of the Italian presidency, so it is important to use it to the maximum advantage of our common destiny."
"After all the talk of recent years, we expect the Italian presidency to close the six months by bringing concrete proposals and measures to Florence."
"What is more, Mr Dini, you won acclaim from Parliament by committing yourself to that last time you were here."
"I appreciate the Italian government's decision to hold a national conference on employment as an operational follow-up to the confidence pact between the social partners, an initiative we resolutely support and consider extremely important."
"I hope the decision will be taken in Florence to do the same throughout Europe, but the Florence Council can also decide to refinance the funding for small and medium-sized firms agreed at Copenhagen, indicate approaches to revision of the labour market and working time to be agreed between the social partners under the confidence pact, and above all decide to finance the trans-European networks and the most innovative part of the White Paper, raising the loan on the financial market called for by Delors and never authorized by the Council."
"This is a fundamental political issue which demonstrates the capacity of the European Union to intervene in the economy at moments of crisis."
"We are hoping for long-awaited concrete measures, and if they do not come it would be better to abandon the employment programmes."
"There is resistance to serious discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference, as President Santer has clearly stated, and I think he did well to say so and it should also be said openly to the citizens of Europe."
"We are alarmed at delay which could turn into paralysis, loss of the sense of Europe and the general interest, and regression to purely national visions."
"Our criticism goes out to all the governments holding back the work on significant issues."
"Now that the presidency is ending, and with it the obligation to be the mouthpiece for common positions, we call on the Italian government to become a resolute driving force at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, it is the heartfelt hope of the great majority of this Parliament that the Florence European Council is not remembered only for the mad cow crisis."
"The joint resolution to wind up this debate refers to the issues on the table: the Intergovernmental Conference, employment, the CFSP, the third pillar, the internal energy market."
"Great hopes hang on the effective capacity to finalize a timely and credible response to the tragedy of unemployment."
"I live in an area of Europe where unemployment is over 20 % of the population of working age, where of 100 young people looking for work 55 do not find a job and many of them, long term unemployed, are now well over thirty-two years old."
"This is a tragic situation, which goes well beyond tolerance limits and has serious economic, social and civil consequences, affording easier penetration to organized crime."
"This situation makes me indifferent to byzantine disputes about dual European and national responsibility and obliges me to demand an effective and urgent European initiative, which really adds to the efforts of the national, regional and local governments rather than using them as a comfortable alibi for inertia and delays"
"So I want to thank you and support you, President Santer, on the method adopted and the merits of the European Commission's proposal."
"You have presented a confidence pact to governments and social partners and Europe must be in a position to sign that pact, especially with the younger generation, on the sure grounds that Europe will help them build a better future through its measures, its choices, its greater capacity to respond to the new challenges of globalization and because it is really prepared to gamble on their willingness to make a commitment, their inventiveness, their creativity and their intelligence."
"We are pleased to note President Dini's assurance of availability, on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, we also want to thank you for the very useful work done in the last few months despite the election campaign which kept you busy in Italy, finding echoes in some of the speeches here."
"We are cheered by your commitment to start the negotiating stage of the IGC as soon as possible."
"There is a widespread conviction that unless the problem of the Union's democratic deficit is confronted and resolved, it will not be possible for the planned enlargements to take place and it will not be possible to give the European Union the desired impetus."
"It must be the hope of us all, and I have almost finished, Mr President, that within a year Europe will really be able to plan its future, its borders, its aims, and its democracy. What better way to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome?"
"Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to the Italian presidency, Mr Dini, and to the Commission President, Mr Santer, for their valuable contributions to this debate here this morning."
"Next week's European summit must concentrate on defusing the tensions which have been allowed to build up in recent weeks between the British Government and its European partners."
"The policy of non-cooperation which the British Government is now pursuing in Brussels has had an entirely negative impact and must be abandoned at the earliest opportunity."
"In Britain much of the anti-European rhetoric which has been unleashed following the government's decision to adopt an obstructionist approach to European decision-making has been profoundly disturbing."
"Responsible political leaders in London must now take the initiative and reassure the British people that they have nothing to fear from their neighbours in the European Union."
"European leaders, especially the British Government, can help to restore some balance in relations between Britain and the rest of Europe by agreeing on a framework for resolving the BSE problem at the summit."
"The European Union must also take steps to restore the confidence of consumers and producers in beef as a healthy, safe and marketable product."
"It is imperative that the protection of the health of our citizens is our only priority and that all decisions will be based on the best scientific evidence available."
"I commend President Santer on his principled stand on this issue, defending the citizens of Europe."
"The beef crisis has already diverted attention from important work under way in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The beef crisis has diverted attention away from fighting unemployment and international crime."
"The Intergovernmental Conference must prepare for the expansion of the European Union to include the former communist countries in Eastern Europe."
"It is important that these negotiations are undertaken in a calm and rational manner."
"Unfortunately, the debate on Europe which has been under way in the British media has been characterized by an absence of calm and rational comment."
"Finally, the danger now is that agreement at the IGC will be much more difficult to achieve because of the antiEuropean forces unleased in the United Kingdom."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we realize we are taking a rather anomalous position: in Italy we use our casting votes to support the centre-left government, here we are about to vote against the compromise your presidency has put its name to, because it raises a concern which is above politics."
"As we all know, eighteen million people are unemployed in Europe, not to mention the millions of unemployed who are not counted, and the winds of recession are blowing."
"If it was raining at first, in terms of unemployment, it threatens to hail tomorrow."
"And what is Europe doing?"
"Very little in our opinion and that in the wrong direction, as the speeches by President Santer and Minister Dini today confirm."
"Europe is substantially saying it maintains the Maastricht convergence towards the single currency, when that is now virtually impossible without ferocious deflationary effects and there is actually a move to relax the deadlines and modify the specific methods of implementation. But Maastricht is still there as a scourge to the national governments to attack social provision and, as has been seen in Germany, that cannot be done without acutely intensifying social conflict."
"The confidence pacts are an attempt to make more room for investment policy to increase growth, but now even the European Parliament's committee recognizes that growth alone does not create jobs, so political Europe is oscillating between Maastricht and some kind of anticyclical policy. The former aggravates employment problems, the latter does not resolve them, so we are getting into a real blind alley, and Europe is threatened, more than threatened now, with a crisis of social cohesion, and the prospects for European civilization and democracy are dim."
"We are very worried and alarmed. We believe that unless there is a radical change in direction the crisis in Europe has already begun."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs is quite right to complain about the status quo tendency of the Intergovernmental Conference's work so far."
"But has this Parliament done enough to overcome this policy of timidity and lack of imagination?"
"Yet the task that lies before is plain for all to see. That task is to transform an economic community, an area without internal borders, into a union of nations, a political union, like it says in the Maastricht Treaty."
"There is no democratic way of creating such a union other than by entering into a process that will produce a constitution, in order to overcome Europe's East-West divide, thereby providing an initial response to the enormous challenges facing society today."
"Where should the initiative for such a process..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, it is already three months since work on the IGC opened officially in Turin and we are forced to recognize that we find ourselves in a blocked situation."
"Some will say that it was difficult to achieve more results in such a short time, forgetting that the reflection group under the chairmanship of Mr Westendorp had already done the spadework and that this preparatory work should have allowed the negotiators to start on real negotiations from March onwards."
"We think it is time to sound the alarm since, in our opinion, the problem is not restricted to the question of the British veto, unacceptable as it is."
"There is a real danger of getting bogged down, of a woolly compromise and of a downward revision of the Treaty, against which the European Parliament should rebel."
"There is, in particular, a marked absence of political impetus and of an overall vision, which are lacking at the very moment when the building of the Community has to face crucial challenges."
"Are we ready, as an institution, to respond to these challenges when faced with the hesitations of our governments?"
"My group is convinced that there is no alternative to the pursuit of integration and that this will only be viable on a federal type basis."
"That is why, if the difficulties persist, we think serious consideration will have to be given to the idea that those who wish to go forward should do so and in that way make all States face their responsibilities."
"It is surely better to take the risk of a political crisis now, rather than pursue negotiations which would risk leading us, on the eve of enlargement, to woolly and inadequate compromises which would jeopardize for ever the future of our Union."
"Mr President, on the eve of the Florence Council, the governments of Member States still seem to be hesitating to endorse the federalist proposals that the European institutions are urging upon them."
"They are right to take a second look at them, since by listening to bad advice from the Europe of today, they would jeopardize the opportunities for the Europe of tomorrow."
"Today's Europe is divided into peoples."
"We need not ask why: it puts the abolition of frontiers before security, free trade before jobs and health, and superstates before the sovereignty of the people."
"How would citizens identify themselves in such a Europe?"
"The mad cow affair is unfortunately a good illustration of our drifting off course and the IGC should learn the lessons from this if it really wants to solve the problems of concern to citizens."
"First lesson: our agriculture, with all frontiers open, is in danger of sliding down the slippery slope of levelling down, whereas, in accordance with the spirit of Article 100a, we should set a high standard of quality for ourselves."
"To stop such a slide, however, we must adopt strict standards and a genuine Community preference."
"Second lesson: States should have the right to use Article 36, particularly to protect the health of their people, even in areas already harmonized, something which is in any case expressly provided for in Article 100a for the environment."
"Third lesson: the abolition of controls on goods at internal frontiers on 1 January 1993 has at the same time dismantled information and verification systems and has increased fraud."
"This must be rectified as a matter of urgency."
"Fourth lesson: since the beginning of the crisis, the Commission has sought to maintain the movement of goods without control - this is called free movement - and has gone as far as threatening Member States with the Court of Justice if they protected themselves and has rejected transparency because the press has revealed that pressure has apparently been exerted on experts."
"We think the IGC should allow better control over the powers of the Commission and that it should impose on that body a general duty of transparency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, caught between the uncertainties in the East and the mad cow disaster, the Intergovernmental Conference is marking time and nothing gives us any reason to think that the Florence summit will be able to unblock the situation in a Europe whose machinery is beginning to seize up for the simple reason that it was bound to happen one day."
"It is not so much the cows that are mad as the utopian project that we are always chasing after."
"The British government, like the Anglo-Saxon multinationals involved in totalitarian feeding, like the Commission and like the governments of our countries, bears an overwhelming responsibility for the undermining of both cattle feed and human foodstuffs."
"But it is scandalous to use this situation in an attempt, practically if not institutionally, to get round the unanimity rule."
"The British government, after all, is defending its own interests."
"Whether it is trying to continue exporting its glaucous gelatinous products is its business."
"It is up to others not to accept these goods."
"It must be recognized that it is because of the pressure from the Commission that the British government has been reduced, in retaliation, to try to block what it could in order to assert its point of view."
"We have here a striking demonstration that it is absurd to seek to merge the old European nations."
"Too much Europe is killing Europe."
"The Europe we wanted and still want is one with a multiplicity of cooperation agreements, between States of course, but even more between industrial, commercial and agricultural enterprises."
"By dint of seeking to govern and legislate in all areas, we arrive at a situation where any crisis in a single area leads to a threat of a general break-up."
"That is what will happen sooner or later, since no yoke can hold peoples who want to be free."
"Putting an end to the unanimity rule is finally allowing the Commission to exercise increasingly compulsory powers."
"There is thus nothing to say that legislation will not be forced on us tomorrow on euthanasia, the liberalization of drugs or the democratic legalization of satanic cults."
"Mr President, I believe that Mr Santer presented the issue in its proper terms this morning."
"What we have today is a crisis of confidence of Europe's citizens in the Community institutions. And I was particularly reassured by the Commission President's statement this morning to the effect that the Commission will act solely on the basis of the best scientific reports with regard to the issue of mad cow disease."
"However, the President of the Commission will perhaps agree with me that the crisis of confidence of Europe's citizens in the Community institutions may be caused partly by certain past actions of those same institutions."
"More specifically, with regard to public opinion in Spain, great concern has been caused by reports in the Spanish media that a senior official in the Directorate-General for Agriculture, Mr Mansito, has been relieved of his duties and in particular of the chairmanship of the Veterinary Committee as a result of his firm stance in defence of scientific criteria."
"With regard to the Council - and I now wish to refer to the excellent speech by the President-in-Office, Mr Dini - I would stress that Europe's citizens are also concerned at the fact that, at present, decisions in the Council are not being taken in accordance with the need to protect public health, but on the basis of political horsetrading."
"I trust that the President-in-Office, with his characteristic rectitude, will prevent the Council of Ministers from being turned into a forum for political horse-trading."
"Lastly, I wish to express my clear support for the stance of the President-in-Office."
"At present, the British Government is violating not only the spirit of the Treaty, but also - as both Mr Martens and the President-inOffice said - Article 5 of the EC Treaty. This is a clear infringement which must be eliminated."
"Europe began with a Greek god in the form of a bull."
"I am sure that it will not end with an insular mad cow."
"There is one thing that we must realise, and the BSE crisis has made this clear: this Intergovernmental Conference must make progress on decision-making mechanisms that will prevent a destructive government from obstructing the European Union's ability to act."
"For this reason, the introduction of the principle of taking majority decisions in all matters involving legislation is the clear consequence of the BSE crisis."
"This is one of the tasks that we must set ourselves at this Intergovernmental Conference."
"President Dini, I am grateful to you and to Mr Faggiolo for your friendly attitude towards Parliament."
"I am also sure that, in the final version of the Italian report on the progress made by the Intergovernmental Conference to date, issues such as ability to act, transparency and the objectives of the European Parliament will be adequately taken into consideration."
"Let me make a second comment."
"The NATO Council in Berlin has taken away the excuse used by all those who, on the grounds of their alleged consideration for the USA, were previously against a defence-policy identity for the European Community."
"The NATO Council, with the agreement of the USA, stated quite clearly that such a defence-policy identity is in the interests of both parties and is in the interests of the development of transatlantic relations, and that for this reason we Europeans are called upon to develop our own capacities, in order to fulfil common objectives for the protection of peace and freedom."
"I believe that these tasks will have to be set by this Intergovernmental Conference, as will many other things."
"Allow me to make one final comment."
"Mr Santer, I am grateful to you for your remarks."
"If the Commission succeeds in ensuring that the elimination of the BSE crisis takes place subject to the condition that the policy of non-cooperation is abandoned, so that step by step, by taking all veterinary and medical knowledge into consideration, and by taking corresponding control measures at European level, the confidence of consumers can be won back, so that they feel that their health is not in danger, then we are in a position to solve this BSE crisis."
"If you are going to stick to these conditions accordingly, then we are also in a position to make this clear to our consumers."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I am intervening especially on behalf of the French Delegation of the UPE Group consisting, as you know, of elected Members from the RPR and the CNI."
"I should like to make three observations."
"The first, to say to you, Mr President of the Commission, that we particularly appreciated your speech."
"This morning, you set out in magisterial fashion the order of priorities: nothing is more important than public health."
"It was essential that Europe should declare this to be its position and should do so in the strongest terms, here and now."
"Having said that, we should not forget the reality, soon to be a tragic reality, of the economic problems that are about to arise."
"We must realize that, within a few months for certain, anger will be brewing up in our beefproducing countryside since, while consumption within the Union has decreased to an often significant extent (even though for some countries the drop is quite moderate), exports have now fallen to zero or almost zero."
"The necessary steps must be taken to reverse the tide of opinion both internationally and amongst buyers outside the Union."
"The second remark is to say that the position of Great Britain is morally indefensible and politically completely irresponsible."
"To mix up the problem of the beef crisis with the functioning of European institutions is pointless and scandalous, unless it is a deliberate and in the end convenient camouflage of a wish to block the IGC."
"Thirdly and lastly, the IGC should fight back."
"Florence should mark a new turning point: Europe cannot afford the luxury of a crisis."
"We ourselves are pleased at the firm determination of the French authorities to create the conditions for this initiative at the Florence summit."
"Florence should have been the moment for all of Europe to take stock of the many critical decisions that weigh upon us, in particular unemployment, as underlined by President Santer, and the democratization of our institutions."
"Instead, it has been hijacked by the behaviour of one Member State."
"The waters of a flood of Anglo-Saxon self-delusion are lapping at the steps of the Fortezza del Basso."
"Many people in Britain are shocked, saddened, angered and ashamed by the antics of the British Government."
"The President-in-Office of the Council spoke of solidarity with the British Government."
"Mr President, please think about solidarity with the British people instead."
"(EN) British Government representatives will claim that their policy of non-cooperation is all about defending vital national interests."
"Well, I challenge them to explain the method in their madness."
"They claim to want an efficient Europe that gives its citizens value for money: so they block moves to crack down on fraud."
"They claim to want a Europe in which businesses can grow and prosper: so they block moves to support those very businesses."
"They claim to want a Europe that is moulded in Britain's interests: so they threaten to block all discussion of the big issues that face us today, from common foreign and security policy to justice and home affairs."
"If that is protecting vital national interests, then clearly Britain is suffering from mad minister disease."
"The hard core of Euro-sceptics is running the show, driving ministers to show how tough they are on Europe with ever more extreme acts of folly."
"I make two suggestions."
"To the British Government I say: wake up."
"Conservatives are supposed to believe in strong leadership."
"If they still do, then it is time to start showing some."
"The British people want to see evidence that they can lead in the interests of the whole nation and in the common interest of the community of European nations, not in the interests of 20 disgruntled back-bench Members of Parliament."
"To the rest of Europe I say: do not give in to blackmail."
"My constituents have suffered more than most from the BSE crisis."
"But it would do no favours to Britain, or to the Union, to give the impression that these tactics have worked and it would probably result in an unworkable agreement."
"As British ministers should know all too well, it is never right to negotiate when someone is subjecting you to blackmail."
"Now they should learn that there are no exceptions to that rule."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the President-in-Office of the Council is not here any more as he has quite reasonably decided to follow the example of many Members of Parliament. I agree with President Santer when he said the record so far was not positive."
"As Mr Santer said, this is not a negative judgement on the Italian presidency - it is as well to remember Mr Santer's whole sentence and not continue the election campaign which has not borne good fruit in Italy anyway."
"The Italian presidency has actually done well in conditions that have frequently been very difficult."
"In my view, President Santer's negative judgement is on the deadlock in the construction of Europe as a whole."
"One need only think of what we regarded as positive intentions proposed in Turin, which have remained intentions, perhaps partly because of the British difficulties."
"But I am convinced that the difficulties also reside in the fact that we continue to concentrate only on monetary union instead of working for the political unity of our continent, with the risk that the monetary and financial objectives may collapse as well."
"So I think it is right to ask for one more effort, as the final act of the Italian presidency, to establish a real plan of action that can be adopted and applied in every country of the Union."
"It is not enough to speak of a confidence pact, President Santer, because there is no confidence, there can be no confidence in a Europe with 18 million unemployed."
"There is one more thing I want to ask for at the Florence Summit: let the door be opened to the possibility of renegotiating important matters like the deadlines for the single currency and greater flexibility in the accounting parameters."
"I ask that to save the European Union and relaunch it, so that together we can all avert the threat of real shipwreck."
"Madam President, by way of an introduction we heard Mr Santer express the wish that the Florence summit should be a real turning point, marking the mobilisation of Europe to ensure real progress on the labour market and the creation of more jobs."
"Like millions of people in Europe I am sure, I share this wish."
"However, if it is to be possible it is essential that EMU should be discussed by the Intergovernmental Conference and that the convergence criteria should be revised because the cuts which are now being made throughout Europe in order to meet the convergence criteria are instead increasing unemployment."
"I believe we all agree that all countries must have sound economic policies."
"However, sound policy also means pursuing a policy which prevents social exclusion."
"It is high time, Madam President, to review this politically high-risk project which is creating social unrest and political tension in Europe."
"Put EMU on the agenda for the IGC!"
"Madam President, I listened with great interest to what Mr Santer and Mr Dini said to us here this morning."
"Both gentlemen highlighted the lack of progress to date at the IGC negotiations."
"While recognizing that the problems are very complex, they can only be solved by courageously taking the first decisions on the various items on the agenda."
"The crisis of confidence in the Member States will have to be overcome."
"The negotiators will have to move into a higher gear if they are to reach successful conclusions."
"As Mr Dini said, we in the European Parliament are in the best position to reflect the concerns of our citizens."
"I know that many items which people want tackled are high on our agenda but they are not being dealt with at the IGC."
"I want to lobby unashamedly for the European anti-poverty network."
"A priority must be the fight against poverty and social exclusion and in particular the discouragement of the 18 million unemployed."
"We are all very concerned about the impact on employment of the beef crisis."
"But consider for a moment the plight of the millions of people in long-term unemployment and the many people who have never had a job and who struggle through life in dire poverty."
"The fight against unemployment must be put on a par with attainment of EMU."
"We need to redress the balance between economic policies and social policies by providing for a social audit of all European Union policies."
"We should enshrine fundamental rights for all citizens of the Union in the Treaty: the right to a decent income, health care, education, housing, work, training, welfare services, community and family life."
"These must be guaranteed to all residents of the Union without discrimination."
"Finally, the behaviour of the British Government with regard to the beef crisis is unacceptable."
"I fear that if beef is allowed to take over the Florence Summit it will augur very badly for a successful summit in Dublin."
"Madam President, despite the Commission's honest efforts to solve the BSE problem - and I greatly appreciate President Santer's initiative - it increasingly looks as if we are about to have one of the strangest European summits of the past 15 to 20 years."
"At a time when the European Union's heads of government need to be addressing urgent problems such as unemployment - and we have an excellent proposal on that - or the conduct of the IGC, EMU, enlargement, the role of the Union in Yugoslavia after the pull-out of US troops, for example, and a host of foreign policy issues, relations with Russia, Israel, with Turkey which cannot keep its hands off Greek islands, in short, at a time when the Union has a lot of important things on its plate this European summit looks like becoming a ridiculous mad cow farce."
"No prizes for guessing what the man in the street will have to say about that!"
"The negative attitudes towards Europe which are already firmly rooted will flourish even more as a result."
"Three brief remarks, Madam President."
"On BSE first."
"I totally agree with Mr Santer that BSE is a public health matter and must be resolved in a responsible manner."
"I approve of the proposal which has now been put forward. I hope the United Kingdom will accept it."
"But at the same time I must say the chances are that it will not."
"In that event we should seriously consider having the other fourteen summit members simply take decisions without the United Kingdom."
"The United Kingdom would then have to refer the legitimacy of those decisions to the Court of Justice."
"As regards the IGC, it has to be said really that little progress has been made."
"The progress report we have now received says little more than last December's Westendorp report."
"I think we need to indicate that it is important for something to be done."
"We want our citizens to play more of a part."
"We want more openness and transparency."
"We want more democracy."
"We want better arrangements for internal security and better results from our external policy."
"These things have to happen."
"Parliamentary assent is needed to all these things."
"One last remark."
"The resolution now before us mentions Yugoslavia."
"We are very keen, and the resolution reflects this, to have an inquiry into Srebrenica."
"I would draw this passage to the attention of the Italian presidency; will they consider it carefully?"
"President Dini - I shall address him even if he is not here at the moment - during the six months that has seen the start of the Intergovernmental Conference in Turin, the government holding the presidency - the Italian government - has changed radically."
"Only President Dini has retained a fundamental role in the handover, moving from Prime Minister to Minister of Foreign Affairs: his responsibilities on Europe are quite undiminished."
"So we look to President Dini, and naturally to President Santer, to guarantee the continuity of the work begun in Turin."
"Since Turin, in fact, the European Union has moved into a phase of total renewal, a renewal applying to issues and problems which this Parliament, together with the other institutions, has clearly identified and which have been mentioned this morning: unemployment, the single currency, peace and economic growth, free movement inside the internal market, social cohesion, consumer protection."
"On this last point we have a problem which certainly did not originate three months ago, which has already siphoned off too many resources from the work in Turin and which threatens to have a negative impact on the work in Florence: the mad cow crisis."
"As President Dini reminded us this morning, Turin has produced two main issues: administrative and fiscal deregulation and bureaucratic simplification."
"These are essential conditions of economic recovery, above all for small and medium-sized firms, the real cogs in that recovery."
"The Italian presidency has not been without merit, and still has a chance at Florence to leave a lasting impression, especially on its the Irish successors, who cannot really be expected to have a Mediterranean vision of Europe."
"It is worth remembering that Italy will not hold the presidency again for at least seven and a half years, and by that time Europe will either be finally built or will not be built at all."
"Madam President, concerning the Florence European Council, my first words must be to condemn the United Kingdom government for its obstruction used to retaliate illegitimately against the Union's measures to combat the scourge of BSE."
"Despite everything this crisis has the merit of showing how impossible it is for us to maintain the Treaty rule according to which one Member State can boycott the normal functioning of the institutions and prevent decisions being taken that all the others want, decisions in this case that not only concern vital interests but are also aimed at protecting public health."
"As priorities for the Florence summit and, as it happens, in accordance with the joint resolution that we are adopting, I should like to emphasise the following points: adopting a clear strategy to get the IGC going and redefining the respective priorities, unblocking the resources needed to implement measures planned in the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, giving support to the Middle East peace process on the basis of the scrupulous respect by all parties of the agreements in force and, finally, pursuing actions and current programmes in former Yugoslavia following on from the Dayton agreements in order to reach a lasting peace."
"Madam President, as the beef crisis continues so the British Government's still largely indiscriminate non-cooperation policy appears increasingly counter-productive."
"There is simply no sense in blocking measures which, for example, prevent fraud, reduce red tape, promote minority languages and step up the fight against racism."
"Whatever happens with the beef ban, if the British Government now disrupts the Florence summit it would be an act of folly and stupidity."
"On the summit agenda will be proposals for a stability pact to boost job creation, measures to encourage small and medium-sized businesses, measures to boost investment in trans-European networks and measures to ensure that the single market operates more effectively."
"With 18 million people without work in Britain and throughout the European Union it would be madness for the British Government to block this proposal."
"Jobs must be the Florence priority and nothing - absolutely nothing - should be allowed to distract us from this objective."
"I want the beef ban to be lifted immediately but I also recognize that the British Government must bring forward proposals which will command genuine consumer confidence."
"The events of the past few weeks have undoubtedly harmed the European Union and weakened Britain's standing and undermined her influence."
"The Florence summit has to be seen as an opportunity for a fresh start."
"The onus is firmly on the British Government to demonstrate that it is serious about constructive, European cooperation."
"If a Conservative Government is not up to that task it should make way for a Labour Government which is."
"Madam President, the harrowing experience of the tragedy in Yugoslavia has highlighted the absolute need for a common foreign policy and precisely targeted preventive diplomacy."
"A lot is said about this vital need, but little is done."
"The worst thing of all is that there is no mechanism for dealing with dangerous situations immediately they arise."
"That is precisely what is missing now in the case of the Aegean."
"For some time, the behaviour of a country bordering on that sea has been generating intolerable tension in the region."
"For some time, various reports have pointed to an imminent danger of a hot conflict."
"What is even more worrying is that the country in question, Turkey, actually felt free to embark on this behaviour after it was granted - with the blessings of all of the partners - a closer association with the European Union via the customs union."
"When Turkey provoked the dangerous incident on Imia, it was the Americans - not the Europeans - who intervened and sent Mr Holbrooke, the architect of the Dayton accords, to take the heat out of the situation. And he it was who noted, somewhat scornfully, that the European Union seemed to be asleep."
"However, Turkey has been stirring up trouble even since Imia. There have been threats of war, frenzied statements by ministers, brazen territorial claims and aspersions about the sovereignty of Members of the Union."
"Time is running out. If the Florence Council really wishes to promote a common foreign and security policy and preventive diplomacy, it should point out very clearly to that mischief-making country that if it wishes to reap the benefits of European cooperation it must honour its obligations to the European Union and show respect for international legitimacy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the escalation of the mad cow crisis shows how lies, economies with the truth and secrecy create a climate in which hatred, fear, xenophobia and suspicion can flourish."
"It hardly needs saying that this may ultimately jeopardize the ratification of amendments to the Treaty."
"When Major then blames the European Union for the crisis this is the ultimate example of the attitude adopted by an awful lot of governments whenever they use and misuse the European Union as a lightning conductor, an umbrella or a scapegoat."
"That too fuels scepticism and disbelief amongst the public."
"The Intergovernmental Conference must strip governments of the institutional instrument they might use to play this obstructionist game again in future."
"The instrument they make use of, ladies and gentlemen, is the secrecy of their deliberations and the secrecy of voting in the Council of Ministers."
"I thus call on the IGC to address itself to the ending, once and for all, of secret voting in the Council's activities as legislator and generally speaking to the promotion of transparency."
"Madam President, three months after its official opening and despite the efforts of the Italian presidency, the Intergovernmental Conference is at a standstill."
"The first reason for this is the general lack of political impetus."
"The problems to be solved by the conference are not technical but political."
"Only the ministers and Heads of State and of Government can provide the indispensable impetus."
"They should become personally involved, which has not yet happened, if they wish the conference to make progress."
"The second reason is the blocking by the British Government."
"The blocking of the conference started well before the 'mad cow' crisis, but since it was expressed in a civil fashion the other Member States could delay the moment of truth."
"The blackmail by the British Government over 'mad cow disease' is forcing Member States to ask themselves the following question sooner then they expected: how can the present United Kingdom Government be bypassed, how can we progress without it?"
"A fine result for Mr Major."
"He isolates himself and shows by his attitude the vital importance of majority voting."
"The European Council in Florence should lay down a few guidelines for the Irish presidency so that the Intergovernmental Conference does not find itself in Dublin at the same point as it is today."
"Our resolution details the priorities."
"I shall deal with only four of them."
"The new chapter on employment to highlight the wish to put employment at the top of European Union priorities; public services as a central element in European citizenship; codecision for the European Parliament covering all legislative acts; making majority voting the general rule; and finally the simplification of the Treaty, a subject that should be tackled after Florence if we want to have a chance of making progress in that direction."
"This Parliament, I hope, will not approve a minimal reform."
"Nor will some national parliaments."
"Ambitious reforms are the only way."
"Madam President, last week the Committee on Regional Policy met in Brussels. At that meeting, two Austrian heads of provincial governments, who had entered into office as a result of democratic elections, could not be given formal accreditation owing to the British policy of non-cooperation."
"The problem in the Committee on Regional Policy was solved in the spirit of European cooperation."
"We must do the same thing on the subject of BSE, and in doing so we must not, above all, forget our own farmers at home."
"Yesterday evening many millions of Europeans had the pleasure of seeing the excellent match between England and the Netherlands."
"I should like to ask our British colleagues what would have happened if Europe had followed a policy of non-cooperation in the European football championship."
"But there are more important things in Europe than the Committee on Regional Policy and the European football championship: unemployment, a Europe that is able to act for itself, economic and monetary union and many other things."
"And here we really do need the cooperation of everybody."
"As far as unemployment is concerned, we need not only cooperation, but also workable plans, not mere catch-phrases."
"There are massive conceptual differences here, between us, the Group of the European People's Party, and other groups within this House, in particular the Socialists."
"Employment cannot be guaranteed on paper only."
"A paper employment chapter in the Treaty is simply too little, and if it were to result in a centrally controlled employment policy for Europe, then that would be too much."
"Jobs are created by the economy, and above all by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Member States and the Union must cooperate with one another in order to create the framework conditions that we need to get more jobs."
"I shall end with a quote from a young, twenty-five year old man, who wrote to me as follows, ""Let us not forget that the European Communities did not arise out of sheer affection between nations, but out of the experience of terrible catastrophes caused by senseless nationalism and ignorance of one's neighbours' . Let us not disappoint that young man!"
"Madam President, at a time when European citizens are expecting solutions to the burning issues of employment and an indication as to what kind of Europe we want to build together, the EU decisionmaking has come to a deadlock because of one government's policy of obstruction."
"Hopefully this situation can be resolved at the summit in Florence so as to make decision-making regarding both employment and the IGC efficient."
"Not only economic growth but also co-operation between governments and employers' organisations and trades unions is required in the fight against unemployment."
"We have to be able to agree jointly on a policy which would channel economic growth into investments."
"Similarly productivity has to be improved and new means of work-sharing has to be found."
"It should not be forgotten that we also need to invest in research and education in Europe."
"Although the IGC is still at the stage of general discussion, as far as I know the initiative put forward by the Finnish and Swedish foreign ministers regarding the development of WEU as a means of crisis administration within the EU has received support."
"This initiative is to a large extent similar to Parliament's standpoint."
"NATO's decision concerning the possibility of using NATO forces in European operations also fits into the whole picture."
"The common foreign and security policy should be made more efficient."
"We should also ensure that countries not belonging to defensive alliances are given equal opportunities to participate in the forming and implementation of a common foreign and security policy."
"In today's Europe non-alliance should not be seen as a way of avoiding responsibility, but could instead increase stability and security."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is an astonishing degree of agreement to the effect that as far as the third pillar is concerned, results have so far been unsatisfactory."
"Even the British Government is entirely in agreement with this view, and this is contrary to many of our citizens' expectations regarding European policy."
"If we look for the reasons, the first thing that we find is the requirement that there should be unanimity in the decisions of the Council of Ministers."
"However, if we look beyond this, we find that, on grounds of national sovereignty, it is claimed that certain decisions should not be taken on a Community basis, but ought to remain the preserve of the national authorities."
"Yet suppose that Community police action would guarantee the public greater protection from crime than would a national procedure, then that would mean that the public were being deprived, in the name of national sovereignty, of a protection that they were actually entitled to."
"If sovereignty leads to a situation in which the public are deprived of possible protection against crime, then I cannot imagine that sovereignty in that sense is supported by the will of the people."
"Therefore, in the context of the summit and the negotiations over the Maastricht Treaty, the concept of sovereignty must be examined under the microscope."
"Sovereignty is the basis of the nation state, and in the foreseeable future we shall no doubt need that as the organizational model for the purposes of performing public duties."
"However, sovereignty must concentrate on those key areas in which it is indispensable, and it must allow a little room to manoeuvre so as to enable Community duties to be performed, not least as far as the third pillar is concerned."
"Madam President, the Florence summit and the Intergovernmental Conference are confronted with problems that show up certain weak spots."
"Owing to certain disagreeable developments in one specific area - and here I need name only the key words: BSE, health, and the behaviour of the British Government, and I say 'British Government' deliberately, because I do not mean the British people or Great Britain itself - a situation has arisen in which all further progress is being blocked, on certain fundamental issues and also, at the same time, on what one might call everyday decisions - and there must be about eighty of these already."
"Although I would urge us all to seek to convince one another by means of argument, and also show a certain amount of patience and understanding in the present situation, it should not be possible for unjustified blockades to be set up, which have no basis in fact."
"I call upon the British Government to give up its current obstreperous behaviour."
"In that sense I support all developments that lead to future changes, and that also includes the area of common foreign policy and common security policy, where we must have the necessary flexibility - See Point 9 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs - to make further developments and measures possible, without being obliged to participate, but also without being able to prevent decisions being taken."
"The Florence summit was intended, as the Italian presidency comes to an end, to sum up the progress that has been made over the last six months, to open up prospects for the future and to introduce the next presidency."
"On all the subjects that are to be discussed, this summit is especially important, because an initial report is to be given on the results, to date, of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"To sum up, I should just like to go over, briefly, the main points for discussion at the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"They are concerned with further institutional development, of deepening and broadening."
"I support the present motion for a resolution."
"Particularly important are those developments that give the European Parliament more weight."
"They are also concerned with questions of security, and with universal services."
"Important, here, is the progress that has been made in the third pillar - and I shall just mention Europol in this context - and particularly the economic and social components, in which the employment situation and the strong joint efforts that are being made to improve it are given the highest priority."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, when you find yourself in the presence of fourteen partners who say 'yes' to a Commission proposal and only one who says 'no' , not because it disagrees with the proposal but because it wishes to pressurize the others to obtain their support for another decision - and it cynically admits this and makes no mystery of it - you are clearly faced with a breach of the law."
"You may therefore declare that such a decision is valid and the recalcitrant wishing to contest this validity will have to prove it before the Court of Justice, and I wish him good luck."
"I am astonished, Mr President-in-Office, that neither you nor the legion of legal advisers surrounding you have not yet thought of this solution."
"This also goes for the President of the Commission."
"You are the guardian of the Treaty and you cannot allow the solemn commitments embodied in Article 5 of the Treaty to be reduced to a useless scrap of paper in this way."
"It is therefore your duty to act, and not only by threats, which are undoubtedly expressed with much conviction and I must acknowledge are well-directed, but are so far without effect."
"Since you have such means at your disposal, why not use them?"
"Madam President, we must hope that this does not simply turn into a Council meeting about mad cow disease - Florence is much too beautiful a city for that."
"Certainly it is an important question, especially as it has resulted in a political game which is only increasing the public's mistrust of the Union."
"However, let us ensure that at least the other fourteen Member States are prepared to accept their responsibilities."
"Mr Dini said that it is important that the EU does not give the impression of being an artificial construction."
"I agree with this."
"We must show that we really can use the Union to deal with the problems which concern the public."
"This means employment and nothing else."
"I am totally convinced that this is the common message from this House and the common message from the people of Europe."
"In this connection there are now a number of initiatives which can be taken up, from France, from Sweden and now also the Commission's idea of a confidence pact."
"I hope that Mr Dini will take the following message with him: take up all these initiatives and show that it is possible to achieve something concrete in Florence."
"Finally, Madam President, there is another area in which fine words must be given some substance."
"This is the question of openness."
"We must have a system of rules so that EU officials know what is required."
"Things should not be left to their discretion."
"The basic rule must be that all documents which are received by or emanate from the EU institutions should be public."
"It should be entirely possible to start this work while the current IGC is in progress."
"We do not need to wait for an IGC lasting one and a half or two years' to be over before instituting reforms in this area."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when more than 18 million people in the Community are unemployed, then the Union, as a union, is challenged, even when the main responsibilities involving employment policy lie with the Member States, and above all the social partners."
"The confidence pact for employment in Europe, as proposed by the Commission, is absolutely essential, as are employment alliances at all levels."
"That is social dialogue in action, and subsidiarity in action."
"But subsidiarity also means that when the primary, smaller competent body cannot master the task alone, then the larger body must become increasingly active in a subsidiary capacity."
"We need an agreement to release additional investments for trans-European networks, without increasing public duties as a whole."
"We need to concentrate resources on investments that create jobs, including those in the EU Structural Funds."
"However, there is no way that these resources should be taken out of ""traditional' social policy, i.e. Chapter III of the Community budget."
"On the contrary, other parts of the budget should be brought into play, parts in which there are unspent surpluses, for example, in the case of the Funds as well."
"The confidence pact favours greater flexibility, productivity-oriented wages and a reduction in costs accessory to wages."
"I hope that at the Florence summit substantial progress will be made on the main aspects of the confidence pact, as well as the white paper on employment, and that the main features of the European model will become clear, namely partnership and the social market economy."
"Madam President, in his remarks, the President-in-Office of the Council spoke about the third pillar - and many Members have done so too - and he said that as far as the third pillar is concerned, the expectations of the public must be fulfilled, with regard to internal security in Europe."
"And in fact this is correct: the third pillar is concerned with a series of important areas of the policy of the European Union, areas that are relevant to security."
"But if we look at what the third pillar contains - and the President-in-Office of the Council also mentioned Europol - then it seems that fulfilling the security needs of the citizens of Europe is a sad story."
"This is because, for a long time now, all those who are involved, who are concerned with security in Europe, have known that we are conducting a debate that could be summed up in the following comparison."
"If the European Union were a car, its bodywork would be that of a Lamborghini, whereas its engine would be that of a Cinquecento , and a spluttering one at that."
"That is the major problem that hits us when we look at the Europol Convention."
"The main problem is that as far as internal insecurity goes, progress is being made, whereas as far as internal security is concerned, Europe is just not getting to the point."
"And in this specific case Mr Herman has put his finger on the problem."
"But it has to be said, unfortunately - and we do not believe that it is right - that the voting is still fourteen to one, and this shows that if Florence does not make any further progress on the institutional reform of the European Union, then this summit will once again be futile."
"We really must succeed in fulfilling the needs of the population, and their expectations of the European Union."
"It must be possible to take essential future decisions, including, for example, those that are concerned with internal security, because the extent to which a citizen identifies with the institution in which he lives is always dependent on how secure he feels there."
"We shall only make progress in ensuring that the citizens of Europe identify with Europe, and we shall only be able to satisfy their need for this identification and their need for security, when we finally take seriously the question of the institutional reform of this Union, especially where the third pillar is concerned."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, European summits have to be concerned with fundamental issues, and in Florence, the question is whether we say yes to the Community, or yes to blackmail."
"For ten years the Tory Government has said no to European social policy, and now it is saying no to the basic European consensus."
"That really is the limit!"
"The character of Europe as a mutually supportive community is now at stake."
"Oh yes, the European Union is more, much more, than just a free trade zone, and membership is based on treaties and on trust."
"As far as the present situation is concerned, this means that negotiations are needed on the subject of the BSE crisis."
"The principles of the EU and the health of its people, however, are not negotiable."
"Anyone observing how calmly the fourteen Member States have accepted the British policy of obstruction will realize just how low our expectations of the London Government's willingness to cooperate have sunk."
"If we no longer have any expectations, then the Intergovernmental Conference cannot possibly be successful either."
"But if it is not successful, what future will there be for Europe?"
"The European Union needs Great Britain, and Great Britain needs the European Union."
"The only solution to the present crisis must therefore be that Great Britain must stay, and the Tory Government will have to go!"
"Madam President, I had intended to say a few things in connection with the institutions today, but the speech of the President-in-Office has forced me to turn to something else, specifically to the Turkish Prime Minister's mischief-making in Florence."
"Is it proper, Mr President-in-Office, at a time when Turkey is flagrantly violating international law, that you should have announced it to us just like that? As if nothing, absolutely nothing, was happening in the Mediterranean!"
"Mr President-in-Office, that country is officially disputing Europe's frontiers, and its conduct gets worse each time the European Union butters up to it."
"At a time when Europe Union has a credibility problem how can the leadership of Europe possibly adopt a neutral position when international law and the legal civilization that our societies have established through thought and the shedding of blood are officially held up to ridicule?"
"Have we learnt absolutely nothing?"
"Does the fact that those frontiers are long make it as if they do not exist?"
"It will be a terrible pity, Mr President-in-Office, if the Council undermines its own credibility again in Florence by giving the impression that the arguments of the market count for more than those which emanate from international law and respect for human dignity."
"It is credibility that we are fighting for. Exactly who gets hurt each time credibility is lost hardly matters."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Dini, I could be very brief."
"However, I wish to thank you for the support given by various speakers both to the President-in-Office and to the Commission seeking to make the European Council in Florence a true success and a turning point so that our Union can continue not only to exist, but also to achieve your ambitions."
"The strategy developed by the Commission for the European Council in Florence is embraced by the overall strategy that I had the privilege of presenting to you myself, here, when the present Commission was appointed."
"As President Dini repeated just now, this strategy aims at making Europe a Union closer to its citizens."
"To do this, we must concern ourselves with the problems facing our citizens today."
"These involve three aspects."
"First, unemployment and jobs."
"Our citizens fail to understand why Europe, with its huge internal market of 370 million inhabitants and 15 Member States, is not succeeding in solving their daily problems."
"We must therefore concern ourselves in the first place with the problem of unemployment and jobs."
"Although some people say today that social and economic policy is first and foremost the responsibility of Member States, I continue to believe that a convergent policy for the European Union and its 15 Member States, applied to the largest internal market in the world, should succeed in producing a multiplier effect and giving added value to the financial outlay agreed nationally."
"This is therefore the direction to which we wish to commit ourselves in Florence."
"The second problem concerns what we call in Community jargon the problem of the CFSP, the common foreign and security policy."
"Our citizens see daily on television a Europe playing no part in world policies and world strategy."
"Our citizens want more Europe not less Europe in the areas of foreign policy and security."
"This is what we should be focusing on more strongly during the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I am very pleased that the presidency has put the question of external security on the agenda of the Florence European Council, particularly after the decisions just taken by the Atlantic Alliance at the Berlin meeting."
"Thirdly, our citizens are now feeling insecure about some of the problems facing them, problems like organized crime, the fight against drug trafficking, etc., and about the absence of a common policy on security and asylum."
"They want Europe to be playing a part in such matters and they want us to solve these problems in accordance with their own wishes."
"We therefore hope that, in Florence, we can unblock some of the dossiers, such as that of Europol, which is something we have been talking about for several years but has not yet seen the light of day."
"Citizens no longer understand."
"If we wish to restore their confidence, we must be able to act so as to solve their particular problems."
"There remains, clearly, the problem raised a short while ago which seems to be casting a shadow over the Florence summit."
"With regard to this, I would like to add, without repeating all that I have said on the subject here, either today or on 5 June, that the Commission has always shouldered its responsibilities in this area."
"It has been, and will continue to be, guided in its actions solely by the necessity to protect the health of its citizens."
"It is in this spirit alone that we have taken the decisions concerning beef derivatives subject to a number of conditions and restrictions."
"It is in the same spirit that, yesterday evening, we adopted a general framework, a procedure and an approach designed to lift the British ban step-by-step, but only on the basis of clear scientific considerations and according to the procedure provided for by our institutions."
"Of course, Mr Herman is undoubtedly right to ask why, as guardians of the Treaty, we do not go to the Court of Justice."
"We are facing a political problem."
"Chairman Wilfried Martens cited Article 5 of the Treaty."
"I myself cited it before you on 5 June."
"I am not giving up hope, and I say quite frankly that, in the next few days, a political solution will be found to a problem that is frustrating the working of our institutions."
"We are committed to this."
"It is the role and duty of the Commission to make proposals to this end based also on the request from the General Affairs Council."
"If the situation can be unblocked in this way and a political solution achieved, then I hope we shall not need to resort to the extreme measure of appealing to the Court of Justice."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, greatly encouraged by the support you have given us here today, I know that both President Dini and I will do our utmost to prove ourselves equal to the high ambitions you have just expressed."
"So strong is the support we have received today that I think I can now repeat what I have already said, that the European Council in Florence should be, for employment and for the other problems on the agenda, what the European Council in Madrid was for the currency."
"I thank President Santer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a moment."
"Votes"
"Madam President, I would mention that this proposal was part of a price package for which I was rapporteur and was the only one not passed by this Assembly."
"As rapporteur let me say that there were very important reasons for that vote. It was a decisive 'no' to the grubbing-up campaign which is gravely damaging European vineyards."
"As rapporteur I ask that this vote be confirmed, and that consequently we vote against the proposal of the Commission to extend the old regulation which is no longer appropriate to a changing situation."
"This will mean we also have an excellent opportunity to ask the Agriculture Council which is meeting next Monday and Tuesday to prepare a new document."
"So I repeat, I ask that the vote against the extension of the current regulation be confirmed."
"(Parliament rejected the Commission proposal)"
"Madam President, the Commission understands the concerns that have been expressed with regard to the grubbing-up aid scheme in the wine sector."
"However, I wish to emphasize once again for the Commission that this proposal was only intended to cover the period from the end of this campaign until the adoption of the reform of the wine sector."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has sent a clear message to the House."
"If this is now confirmed, the Commission will do its best to find a solution in this direction within the framework of the pricepackage discussions in the Council."
"I hope that that message will be received with generous acclamation by Parliament."
"Madam President, the Commission is maintaining its proposal on grounds which are not wholly convincing, I was the rapporteur on reform of the wine sector, which has now been awaiting variation by the Council for a long time, too long, and a code of conduct has existed between the Commission and Parliament since March 1995 whereby if Parliament rejects a Commission proposal the latter undertakes to withdraw it. Now, as this has not been done in this particular case and I have not heard that any particularly important and exceptional reasons exist to justify for putting it forward again, I would ask Parliament to remit the vote to the next session so that the Commission has time to think again and produce more convincing arguments."
"A proposal to postpone the vote is put before our Assembly."
"Does anyone wish to speak against?"
"Madam President, at the request of the rapporteur, we have just confirmed our opinion, which seems to me essential."
"I am totally opposed to Mr Fantuzzi's proposal, because in fact what we are in danger of passing is that the whole of the 'price package' be called into question."
"I therefore urge the leaders of the Socialist Group to think hard about the consequences of Mr Fantuzzi's proposal."
"If it is accepted, the Council of Ministers will be unable to adopt the 'agricultural price package' next week because this regulation will not be included."
"That is why, as the rapporteur Mr Santini has confirmed, Parliament has held to its opinion."
"Our position on this remains as it was and I reject Mr Fantuzzi's proposal."
"Madam President, just a second to reply to that statement."
"This is about extending a regulation for a year without any consequences, except that obviously growers who grub up their vines would no longer receive rich premiums."
"It will increase the pressure on the Commission to commit itself to thinking seriously about reform of the COM for wine and will in no way prevent any of the other regulations in the price package being adopted."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Madam President, with regard to the text of the joint motion for a resolution on the European Council in Florence which is to be put to the vote - and there is always a certain amount of haste in putting resolutions to the vote - I believe that something has escaped the attention of the authors. Recital A refers to the political blackmail being used by the United Kingdom; and paragraph 3 also refers to the United Kingdom."
"What we wished to say, however, was 'the government of the United Kingdom' . I should therefore like to table an oral amendment to the effect that the term 'United Kingdom' should be replaced by the term 'government of the United Kingdom' in recital A and paragraph 3."
"I would also point out that the original French version of paragraph 3 refers to the need to 'induce' the UK Government to face up to its responsibilities."
"The English version, however, uses the word 'compel' ."
"The English version does not therefore correspond to either the French version or the Spanish version, which I have before me. I would therefore ask the translation services to revise the English version of paragraph 3, replacing the word 'compel' with a word which implies agreement, in keeping with the French version."
"Mr Medina, some of your points concern the language versions."
"We take note of these."
"There is then a proposal to add the word 'government' ."
"Madam President, I understand quite well the political reasons behind this request of the Socialist Group."
"But if you look at the Treaty and at point 3, we should read Article 5 of the Treaty which says very clearly that Member States shall take appropriate measures."
"That means Member States and we do not ask that from governments."
"The reference made in this particular point to Article 5 makes it impossible to accept that oral amendment."
"Madam President, I am solely putting forward what was the intention of the people who drafted the original text."
"Clearly there are linguistic problems in two areas which can be sorted out in the text."
"But the other point concerns the clear intention when the compromise text was put together."
"Paragraph 3 does not reflect properly the intention of those who drafted the text."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, since you are opposing this on behalf of your own group, we do not accept the oral amendment."
"We shall not start a fresh debate."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, may I ask you for an answer concerning the legal status of Amendments Nos 8 to 11?"
"The European Commission has maintained, both in committee and yesterday evening in the plenary, that these amendments are in violation of our Rules of Procedure, specifically of Rule 72(2), since they are allegedly new amendments which amend the original Commission text."
"Can I take it, since the matter is now being voted on by the plenary, that this view of the European Commission is not deemed correct?"
"I think it is important to be clear on this before we begin negotiations with the Council."
"I have asked the opinion of the presidency services, who do not share the opinion of the European Commission, and I am therefore relying on the advice given to me."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Madam President, I should like to draw attention to a number of instances in which the different language versions of the amendments - in particular the Spanish version - need to be brought into line."
"In Amendment No 5, for example, the words 'doit obtenir ' in the original French version have been translated as 'debe permitirse ' , which is not the same thing."
"More importantly perhaps, in Amendment No 23, the word 'établis ' has been translated as 'residentes ' ; and I would point out - though not as emphatically, since I do not know English as well as I know Spanish - that it has also been translated as 'resident' in the English version. With regard to the profession of lawyer, these are different concepts, I believe."
"Furthermore, in Amendment No 25 to Article 10(5), the word 'de ' is missing, altering the meaning."
"Finally, Madam President, Amendment No 35, which was tabled by 29 members of the PPE Group, needs to be brought into line with Amendment No 25 by adding the word 'relevant' to the term 'competent authority' . This is a point on which our British colleagues insisted; and, although Parliament's translation service duly added the word 'relevant' in Amendment No 25, they failed to do so in Amendment No 35."
"Madam President, in relation to Amendment No 25 to Article 10(4), there has been a specific request that the words used are 'public interest' , not 'public order' ."
"The words 'public order' have no meaning in this context in English."
"Could you please confirm that this will be translated as 'public interest' ?"
"Madam President, I fully accept Mrs McIntosh's interpretation of the English version."
"On the other hand, the French version must continue as 'ordre public' ."
"This must be quite clear."
"Madam President, on this very important point, the French expressions 'ordre public' and 'intérêt public' in no way have the same meanings. 'Intérêt public' would mean that the State could make use in some way of a potestative clause to release itself quite unilaterally from the obligations of the Directive."
"The words 'ordre public' presume a direct breach of the most fundamental laws of the State or possibly of its own security."
"I believe it is extremely important to keep the words 'ordre public' in the text."
"I do not know what the exact English translation is, but I believe the English concept of 'public interest' is much wider and much more vague than the French expression 'ordre public' ."
"We agree on the fact that the basic text is the French text and that the other language versions will have to be completely in accordance, on the point of substance, with what is voted through in French."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Madam President, I should like to have the reaction of the European Commission."
"Madam President, Mr Pimenta can anticipate the reaction of the Commission since he well knows that, partly due to his effective efforts, these issues have received the most thorough attention."
"Parliament must make its decision on its choice of procedure and of course that is Parliament's privilege."
"The Commission cannot really add anything useful at this stage to that consideration."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Welcome"
"On your behalf, I would like to welcome a delegation from the Tunisian Chamber of Representatives."
"Votes (continuation)"
"Madam President, in the motion for a resolution on broad economic guidelines there is at least one expression that is open to misunderstanding."
"Therefore I should like, on behalf of my group, to make an explanatory statement regarding this expression."
"We are of the opinion that a ""relaxation of monetary policy' is only possible where it does not lead to the endangering of price stability, of interest levels and, therefore, of a possible upturn in the economy, because this is the prerequisite for the creation of new jobs in Europe."
"Only if this is made clear are we prepared to agree to this resolution as it stands."
"Madam President, of course, anyone can explain whatever they want to, but a vote taken in this House cannot be tied to the fact that a complex situation, like the policy mix that we need in order to solve the problem of mass unemployment, is now being defined, unilaterally, by Mr von Wogau, as being a tautology."
"This sentence, as it stands in the text, means what it means, and anyone can think what they like about it, but that does not alter anything."
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Each European Council held at the beginning or end of a Member State's presidency of the Union is always the time for the public expression of certain wishes after having passed judgement on several questions."
"On the eve of the Florence summit at the end of the Italian presidency, I should like to draw attention to three points that seem to me essential, if not vital, for the future of our Union."
"Firstly, I am in broad agreement with the analysis presented by the President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, and I repeat his turn of phrase here: Madrid was the Council of currency, Florence should be the Council for jobs."
"But may I be allowed to add this: let us stop shouting all over the place that our priority is the fight against unemployment in Europe!"
"We have all understood this!"
"Let us act!"
"Talking is not enough. We must act and show the political will to put an end to rising unemployment and to bring it down."
"The European Union will once again emerge discredited if no concrete proposals emerge from this Council to expand employment, both by creating jobs with major public works and by economic measures to promote growth, and not forgetting job sharing."
"We cannot continue to do nothing for the 19 million or so in Europe who are still unemployed and creating a life of poverty for nearly 50 million."
"This is the priority that the Florence Council should take on board, with a timetable and specific commitments."
"Secondly, what we need now is a political Europe!"
"The Intergovernmental Conference provides the means to achieve this."
"But with the way it is going today, there is a great need to hurry."
"Nothing has been established and nothing constructive has emerged from the first debates."
"We are really looking at a debate among selfcentred experts, not to mention the stench from all the nationalists."
"Today, the IGC is bogged down."
"It too needs a strong statement of policy in Florence."
"In six months, it may be too late."
"Reconstruction of the treaties is essential to the establishment of the political Europe that has long been hoped for and must be accompanied by a social Europe."
"Thirdly, we cannot contemplate the Florence Council, carrying so many hopes and expectations, being put at risk by the mad cow crisis."
"There is a real public health problem here and it should be quickly cleared up."
"Every precaution should be taken."
"But I will not accept the adoption of blocking tactics, even blackmail, which imperil European construction, now at a turning point in its history."
"I dare not imagine that some of us might be completely irresponsible."
"Where mistakes have been made, there must be redress."
"The diplomatic terrorism being used is pointless!"
"I should like to end by thanking the Italian presidency which, in difficult circumstances, has been able, in spite of everything, to work and make progress on certain issues."
"Having said that, these six-monthly rotating presidencies are showing their serious limitations and this strengthens my conviction that there must be a more stable European government."
"May the IGC move us forward in this matter."
"The current obstructionist tactics of the British Government are to be deplored."
"The BSE crisis was a direct consequence of its own political ineptitude and there was no justification for punishing the rest of the European Union for its own mistakes."
"Hopefully the Florence Summit will bring an end to this unfortunate episode."
"However, it must resolve it in a way that does not reward blackmail."
"If blackmail tactics are seen to succeed on this occasion then a real danger exists that other Member States would be tempted to apply similar tactics when it suits them."
"One of the lessons to be learnt from this saga is that the IGC must refine the decision-making structures of the European Union to ensure that there is no repetition of these circumstances when one Member State is able to hold the entire European Union to ransom."
"The European Council in Florence will take place under the shadow of the harsh anti-popular measures imposed in Germany by Mr Kohl which demand further cuts, albeit nominal, in the incomes of working people and the abolition of substantial rights in the social insurance and pensions fields as a means of catering for monopoly interests and combating the economic crisis, and which will serve as a model for the wider economic policy to be pursued by the European Union in all of the Member States."
"At the same time, however, this European Council will take place under the shadow of the struggle being waged by German workers and their comrades in other countries against the high-handed, anti-democratic and antipopular policy being imposed by the Brussels masters in the framework of the Maastricht Treaty."
"The acceptance of the scenario for the third stage of EMU and the move to the single currency, the refusal of the governments even to re-examine EMU in the framework of the intergovernmental conference and the acceptance, even by the majority in this Parliament, of the imposition and perpetuation of a Europe of two speeds all make it manifestly obvious that the institutions of the EU are completely indifferent to the real problems and demands of Europe's peoples and are kow-towing to the dictates of large-scale capital."
"The European Union's inability to develop positions of its own on international problems, the waiting on each occasion, that is, for a lead from the United States, applies not only to issues of vital concern to it, such as the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East, but, also, sadly, to the expression of support for its own Member States; for Greece, for instance, faced as it is with the expansionist policy of Turkey which keeps on pushing territorial claims and is drawing heart from the culpably neutral stance adopted by the European Union and its Member States and from their persistence in continuing and widening economic and other relations with it while it blatantly violates international law, occupies the northern part of Cyprus and tramples on human rights within its own borders."
"The move to strengthen policing at the European level via uncontrolled mechanisms, the attempt to exert joint control over the Union's foreign receipts and the unification of the policy approach on immigration matters, in particular the formulation of common rules for the deportation of citizens of third countries, constitute a further erosion of the sovereign rights of the Member States and are detrimental to the democratic links and friendly relations which many of them maintain with movements which are progressive and concerned for peace."
"Unfortunately, the majority in this House has rejected certain proposals that we put forward, among them proposals relating to employment, in the shape of an overall policy to combat unemployment which demanded, in particular, the establishment of a 35-hour week without wage reductions, the non-blockage of Cohesion Fund resources in the event of failure to meet the EMU criteria, full acceptance of the principles which underpin the fundamental obligation to provide public services, via the rejection, first and foremost, of competitive tendering, and the taking of measures to combat racism and xenophobia."
"Indeed, it has done the very opposite by approving provisions which will lead to an upsurge of militarization, to greater inequality, to de-democratization of the Community's institutions and to a continuation of the present economic policy which has already put 18 million people out of work and 55 million below the poverty line."
"In my opinion the European Council summit in Florence should discuss and take a decision on the following subjects:"
"Shelving plans for a common currency.-Measures in the respective Member States of the EU to increase employment and alleviate poverty.-Ensuring that the enlargement of the Union to include states which wish to join and which used to be part of the former Soviet bloc takes place as quickly as possible.-Speeding up the rate of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.The European Council should also make it very clear to Albania, Belarus and Turkey that their cooperation with the European Union is being severely damaged by the infringements of human freedoms and rights which are now occurring in these countries."
"It should also once again be stressed that the EU should stand for cooperation between sovereign states and that there must never be any move towards a superstate."
"If in the future Europe is to be a stable and peaceful continent where democracy and human freedoms and rights are honoured and established principles, any federal tendencies within the European Union must be opposed."
"Once again, President Santer has given us a demonstration, rhetorically speaking, of how to square the circle, since he has said that combatting mass unemployment is the Union's highest priority and , at the same time, he has reaffirmed that we should stick to the basic decisions of current economic policy in terms of macroeconomics and structural policy, i.e. pursuing a policy of saving, at the expense of much-needed reproductive spending, combatting inflation when there is no inflation, and sticking to the Maastricht strategy for economic and monetary union without taking the losses into consideration."
"As long as the Commission is not prepared to take on board Parliament's constructive criticism of this economic policy, which is based on superficiality, wishful thinking and unilateral opportunism as far as the financial markets are concerned, and as long as it is not prepared to enter into conflict with the Council, and in particular with certain particularly powerful Member States, including Germany, then all the Commission's initiatives, which in themselves are to be welcomed, and which are intended, somehow and in spite of everything, to improve the way in which the unemployment problem is taken into consideration, will either never get off the ground or will, at best, remain relatively ineffectual."
"I believe that this House is entirely prepared to offer the Commission its firm support in the disputes that will be inevitable if the necessary corrections are made to our economic policy."
"However, the condition attached to that support is that the Commission itself must explicitly correct the objectives and clearly identify the problems that it faces."
"Only in this way can we really achieve a European employment pact, in the teeth, as it were, of the finance ministers' rejection and of five or six more powerful Member States."
"At the end of the day, the fate of the European Union will probably be decided by this issue of mass unemployment."
"We call upon the Commission to face up to its historic responsibilities, instead of continuing, with honeyed words, to pretend to be doing something."
"Intergovernmental Conference"
"At the last IGC member state governments failed to convince the citizens of Europe that the European Union was relevant to their needs and had answers to their problems."
"As a consequence the Maastricht Treaty was nearly rejected and the EU was catapulted into temporary crisis with the concept of European integration seriously undermined."
"If the same mistakes are not to be repeated, this IGC must focus on the primary concerns of the European public."
"The obvious area for concerted action at the moment is devising policies to combat drug trafficking."
"This has been confirmed by recent public surveys that although they demonstrate little public awareness of the IGC itself, they nonetheless show that a majority of public opinion wants priority to be given to tackling the drug problem on a European-wide basis."
"While I welcome the fact that the Irish Government has made this area one of the priorities of the Irish presidency, I seriously question the commitment of our European partners."
"This is evident in a number of ways."
"The UK's blocking of the ratification of the Europol Convention deprives the EU of one of its major weapons against the drug barons."
"The absence of a united approach by all governments, as illustrated by the permissive Dutch approach to soft drugs making it a virtual supermarket for drugs; the violent opposition of France and opposition from Belgium and Spain to a proposed 16.7 % increase in the budget for the European Drugs Unit is difficult to comprehend, particularly when the existing budget is a pathetic £4 million."
"In fact the total budget for combatting drug abuse and drug trafficking amounts to a mere £24 million - a damning indictment of current EU policy and the low priority being given to the drugs issue."
"If the present IGC in its revision of the Treaties fails to remedy the situation then it could be heading for disaster and deservedly so."
"If the European Union fails to utilise its existing powers properly and to build on them then it does not deserve to be given increased powers."
"Barton recommendation"
"There are two proposals in this report which we do not agree with even though we voted for the report as a whole."
"1.We consider that the individual Member States should in future continue to have the right to refuse the registration or the use of vehicles if they are so moved.2.One can of course argue that the decibel limit for heavy motor cycles can be increased from 80 to 82 because an untrained ear cannot hear the difference."
"However, we believe that there must a limit somewhere."
"Nor is it sufficient to measure the average values in noise tests."
"It is the peak noise values which are of interest as it is those which cause nuisance."
"We have voted for the Barton report, although we do not agree that issues concerning the noise made by motorcycles and the like should be dealt with at Union level."
"However, we regard the report as being less regulatory, less protectionist and less arbitrary than the Council's extreme common position."
"In Mrs van Dijk's statement yesterday, she gave the reasons for the position of the majority of the group."
"The minority, however, on the basis of the same ecological and social objectives, came to a different conclusion."
"Why was this?"
"We are working on the assumption that highly fundamental environmental objectives are best achieved by effective practices being changed and not by maximum limits set by the administrative authorities."
"Especially in areas where the active cooperation of many individual operators is necessary, the strategy of regulating environmental pollution by means of maximum limits is restricted by the willingness of those operators to organize their own cooperation."
"With this in mind we support the demands of motorcyclists for workable compromises on maximum limits, with the simultaneous ending of illegal practices."
"The cooperation of the motorcycling organizations should in our opinion be a central element in making two-wheeled motor vehicles, which from the social point of view are an essential means of transport, ecologically defensible and harmless to health as well."
"In addition to this, we believe that the arguments of the motorcycling organizations regarding the use of catalysers on two-wheeled motor vehicles and the problem of ""sheer bolts' are founded on fact and should be taken seriously."
"Fontaine report"
"Madam President, no profession is excluded from freedom of movement and freedom to practise within the Community."
"Quite rightly our rapporteur has reminded us that this key principle is established by Article 52 of the Treaty of Rome."
"Here, we have worked for decades to set up this freedom of movement."
"I was myself a rapporteur on the free movement of midwives in 1969, if my memory serves me well."
"We have always done our best to set up freedom of movement for workers and freedom to practise for professionals, particularly in the liberal professions, by avoiding regulations which would in the end have had the effect of discriminating between nationals and migrant workers."
"Community legislation on the freedom of lawyers to practise has had the effect that almost one third of lawyers currently registered with the Luxembourg bar are non-nationals."
"I understand the efforts made by, amongst others, the Community Bar Council to facilitate the practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a Member State other than that in which the professional qualification was obtained."
"The more so because lawyers in my country - which has no law faculty - are obliged to obtain their professional qualification in another country."
"However, we do prescribe further training periods and examinations for them to master the specific features of Luxembourg law, since there can be no question of favouring non- nationals over nationals as regards these additional tests."
"In order to maintain the quality of services provided by lawyers, there can be no question of levelling down by abolishing the additional training periods and tests prescribed in Luxembourg."
"Because some of the proposals from our Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights go beyond what would be adequate and non-discriminatory, I cannot vote for these amendments and I have, a fortiori , also voted against the report, because the amendments we tabled were rejected."
"We are in favour of this report, which represents a step towards balanced regulations authorizing lawyers of one European Union country to practise in other countries of this same Union."
"We congratulate our colleague, who has produced a most competent report and has played an important part in furthering the compromise obtained, which goes in the direction of the very clear interests of the professionals in the various countries concerned, France among them."
"From the French point of view, this agreement is reached in an area where our national tradition is that of considerable expertise which can be of benefit to clients throughout the European market, something we are particularly pleased about."
"The present Directive and the related report are arousing dismay and opposition among Luxembourg lawyers."
"Dismay, because the Commission's approach is inconsistent."
"Just when the transposition of Directive 89/48 on the general system for recognition of degrees is still in progress, with all the problems described in the Commission's report of 15 February 1996, it is now sought to force the hands of the States, in different sectors, by extreme liberalization."
"Luxembourg lawyers do not understand why the system introduced by Directive 89/48 can no longer serve."
"It has contributed to vast liberalization of the profession in Luxembourg, where over 27 % of lawyers are foreigners."
"At the same time, it has ensured that these lawyers, whether foreigners or nationals, offer the safeguards and knowledge needed to serve their clients on the spot."
"Dismay also because the new stage of liberalization will create new discrimination between those who will be admitted without any restriction and those, whether foreigners or nationals, who have to take an additional examination in the country where they will be practising."
"Our opposition to this new Directive will therefore be understood."
"It contains a serious defect because it offers no safeguards to clients: a foreign lawyer who sets himself up with his home-country professional qualification and wants to work in Luxembourg law may know nothing about this specific law."
"I shall be told that clients will very quickly discover this."
"True, but it is irresponsible to allow the market to operate as regulator of a profession which is, when all is said and done, of public interest."
"A foreign lawyer who sets up in Luxembourg with his home-country professional qualification may know nothing about the languages used in that country."
"I shall be told that, in that case, he cannot practise; but it will still be the market that will have to clarify this state of affairs, and I refuse to let the market control these choices."
"Without going into the details of Mrs Fontaine's report, I may say that, although I willingly accept the need for liberalization of the legal profession, the method chosen by the Commission and by Parliament does not reassure me."
"That is why I support the amendments tabled by the Luxembourg Members and am against Mrs Fontaine's report."
"Like the French Members of my Group, I have voted against Mrs Fontaine's report on the proposal for a Directive on the rights of lawyers to practise."
"There are already two Directives on lawyers, that of 22 March 1977 regulating the provision of services and that of 23 December 1988 relating to the equivalence of degrees."
"The new Directive seeks to go further by wider liberalization of the conditions under which lawyers can practise in all European Union countries."
"However, lawyers cannot be compared with a marketed product."
"Neither is their profession comparable with that of banks and insurance, for example, for which it has been possible to harmonize the conditions for equivalence and practising without too much difficulty."
"The law in each of our countries, on the other hand, has, and will retain in the future, its own specific features and peculiarities."
"The conditions for admission to the profession of lawyer are not identical; those for practising the profession of lawyer are even less so."
"The duration of the right for a lawyer to practise under his home-country professional qualification in a Member State other than his own should therefore not be extended indefinitely, but on the contrary should be lowered from five years (period laid down in the Commission's proposal) to three years in order to facilitate speedy integration into the profession of the host Member State."
"Better protection of consumers' rights would also have been ensured by providing that, during this intermediate period, the lawyer can practise law in the host Member State only by acting together with a lawyer practising in that State."
"Failing which, because it validates over the whole Community the admission of a lawyer to the bar of his home country, the text will end up juxtaposing fifteen different professions in what we wish to be a single market."
"As regards access to the profession of the host Member State, the aptitude test has rightly been abolished, seeing that a lawyer wishing to gain access to the profession of lawyer in a State other than his own is required to furnish evidence of effective and regular professional activity for a period of three years in that State."
"But there should also have been a provision that a lawyer so admitted to the profession of the host Member State must use his home-country professional qualification alongside the professional qualification of the host Member State."
"Consequently, I hope that when the Council examines this Directive, it will reconsider these very debatable proposals."
"In the vote on the report presented by Mrs Fontaine on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive to facilitate the practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a Member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained, I took account of the tremendous progress represented by this directive towards giving effect to the fundamental principle of the freedom of establishment and practice of the liberal professions - in this case, that of lawyer - in the European Union."
"I should also like to emphasize my particular satisfaction at the adoption of Amendment No 7 to Article 1(2)(a), which recognizes the variety of professional titles in accordance with the different official languages of the Member States of the Union, which in the case of Spain are Castilian, Catalan, Basque and Galician. This is a good indication of the European Union's recognition of the linguistic diversity which enriches it."
"The European Parliament once again demonstrated that it does not want or is unable to understand the inherent special problems of the small countries of the Community."
"The Socialist Member, Mr Fayot, and I tabled an amendment reflecting the fears of the Luxembourg legal authorities about the process of registering a foreign lawyer with the relevant bar, but this amendment was unfortunately rejected."
"I remain firmly convinced that the host Member State should be able to apply to legal consultations about the law of the host Member State the conditions that its legislation lays down for its own nationals, insofar as they are in conformity with the provisions of Directive 89/48 and inasmuch as they are justified by a concern for nondiscrimination in respect of its own nationals and by over-riding reasons of general interest."
"In other words, I maintain that in every country, including mine, the defence of a citizen should be fully guaranteed by legal assistance from persons properly qualified in the law of the Member State in question."
"Now, it is established - and who will dare contradict me on this point? - that this qualified assistance is no longer guaranteed if a Member State is deprived of the right and ability to judge and assess a lawyer's knowledge of national law."
"It should be stressed, moreover, that the vote of the European Parliament for the Fontaine report will not change in any way the very special situation in my country, which has to cope with different legal systems."
"Thus, administrative and constitutional law are essentially Belgian in spirit whereas civil and commercial law are influenced by France and Belgium."
"Tax law has its origins in German tax law and decisions, both administrative and those of courts, refer to German case law."
"Another difficulty lies in the fact that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a trilingual country, so that the question of languages is an essential one for a lawyer practising his profession in the Grand Duchy."
"It should also be emphasized that very many Community nationals holding foreign law degrees are currently keeping terms in Luxembourg and are successfully taking examinations at the end of their training."
"Having said that, I remain convinced that the system at present in force in my country genuinely offers the citizen-lawyers of Europe the chance to practise and establish themselves in Luxembourg, as long as they can provide proof of their qualifications in Luxembourg law."
"For all the above reasons and because I am persuaded that the arguments developed in the proposal for a Directive will not receive the agreement of any Luxembourg citizen, I shall vote against the report presented by Mrs Fontaine, which has shown understanding for the problem specific to my country, and I congratulate her for that, but whose arguments have not been followed by the qualified majority."
"""To make new progress in the construction of a cultural Europe' ; that is how the rapporteur describes the size of the task that she had to cope with."
"Anyone who knows anything about the differences that have had to be overcome, for example between the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany on the one hand and France and Spain on the other, will be bound to admit, on seeing the results of all this work, that the rapporteur has carried out her task with a great deal of sensitivity as well as energy."
"The report is an impressive example of how the policy that the Community has pursued since 1988/89, a policy of mutual recognition of qualifications gained in a Member State on the basis of mutual trust between the Member States of the Union, can also be applied successfully in the case of lawyers' rights to become established anywhere in the Union."
"The content of the new directive may thus serve as a convincing example of the sensible application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"The rules in force in Member States remain unchanged, but the lawyer who practises in a country other than his country of origin is also subject, in the same way, to the rules of the Member State in which he is established and in which he practises."
"It is also worth mentioning, and appreciating, that the report has also taken on board and applied the judgments given by the European Court of Justice in the cases of Klopp and Gebhard Bahnen regarding freedom of establishment."
"The report itself is thus a testament not only to the diversity of European legal practice but also to a new, cooperative legal culture."
"It deserves the full support of Parliament."
"Hoppenstedt reportLindqvist (ELDR), Eriksson, Sjöstedt and Svensson (GUE/NGL), Gahrton, Holm, Lindholm and Schörling (V), Bonde, Lis Jensen, Krarup and Sandbæk (EDN), in writing."
"(SV) As opponents of the Union it was with great satisfaction that we read a report which opposes the Commission's integrationist zeal."
"We share Mr Hoppenstedt's view that the Commission should not decide on licensing or have the right to negotiate on personal communication services vis-à-vis third countries and in international bodies."
"In this connection, as in many others, it is the Member States which are in the best position to take sovereign decisions."
"As is made clear in the rapporteur's explanation of the amendments which have been tabled, including Nos 10, 12, 15, 17 and 19, the committee feels that it is unnecessary to lay down special EU procedures for selecting and authorizing space segment and gateway service operators, since the effective number of global competitors in this particular sector is already so limited that it should be possible to create a basis for sensible coexistence among these very few operators in the future market in satellite personal communications."
"However, attention is rightly drawn in the report to the need to establish a common legal framework for authorizing services and also a 'one-stop-shopping' system to prevent incompatible national decisions on satellite systems from being taken."
"All in all, the rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has succeeded in carrying out a critical but balanced assessment of the Commission's proposal."
"I can therefore fully endorse the rapporteur's conclusions, which should be seen in the light of the need for international coordination of satellite personal communications services and in the context of the other EU legislation in the telecommunications sector, in particular the Commission's proposal for the 'licences' directive."
"Pimenta report"
"Madam President, the excellent report by Mr Pimenta raises the fundamental question of the hierarchy of standards."
"Does the European Commission rank below GATT and the World Trade Organization?"
"In 1991, Mr MacSharry told us that he was moved by the fact that the bones of animals caught in traps were torn, that they cut their own tendons and skin with their mouths or teeth so that they could escape."
"And it was reaffirmed that, from 1 January 1995, there would no longer be any leghold traps."
"Then, in 1994, it was explained to us that there were technical problems and that the ban had to be postponed to 1 January 1996."
"1 January 1996 has been and gone, but we are now told about the Inuits who from time immemorial - even though steel did not yet exist - have trapped animals in steel leghold traps."
"The reality is quite simple."
"The reality is the World Trade Organization, which wants freedom of movement without any kind of hindrance."
"We have given in over fruit and vegetables, by adopting United Nations standards!"
"We have given in over the WTO bananas by submitting to the wishes of American multinationals!"
"Perhaps we shall give in over hormone-treated meat and we are now in the process of giving in over leghold traps!"
"There is no European Union, there is only a world market and although there are still innocents who believe, even the greenest of innocents are forced to recognize that they have been rolled in contaminated cattle meal."
"Madam President, I was glad to see Parliament giving such tremendous support to Mr Pimenta's report."
"The debate on hunting and humane trapping methods has been both long and heated, within the EU and in the rest of the world."
"As a result there are now 60 countries which have prohibited hunting using leghold traps."
"Of these, 22 countries have introduced the prohibition in the last five years."
"This shows, among other things, that hunting can be carried out without the terrible leghold traps."
"After all, I don't suppose that there is anyone here who believes that the Lapps in Sweden, for example, have stopped hunting because fox traps are prohibited."
"In the EU the import ban should have entered into force on 1 January 1995."
"However, as a concession to the wishes of the major fur-exporting countries, particularly Canada, its entry into force was postponed till 1 January 1996 - a most remarkable occurrence."
"There is no legal instrument which would allow further postponement and something now has to happen."
"It is with dismay that we now discover that despite this the Commission is proposing amending the regulation in a way which will constitute a regression of a decade for the EU and all of us."
"It is reasonable to ask why."
"Is it out of fear of countries such as the USA and Canada?"
"Is it out of fear of the WTO, or what?"
"No matter what, it is to say the least deplorable and unworthy of an organisation which claims to represent a humane approach."
"Humane hunting methods and leghold trap regulations have become a symbol of the conflict between animal welfare, indigenous peoples, markets, trade and the environment."
"An institutional question of principle has now also arisen here, namely, what happens when Community legislation is undermined by, for example, the Commission?"
"Unlike the Commission, the Green Group in the EU Parliament has not changed its standpoint and has not given in to pressure and has therefore supported the report."
"When the Commission appeared before us last December, we expressed our dissatisfaction at its failure to implement the ban on the import of pelts of certain wild animals caught by means of leghold traps."
"Today the Commission is presenting us with a new regulation designed to cover up this failure. However, there are serious doubts about the legality of this regulation, because as well as setting an unfortunate precedent with this kind of approach, the Commission does not have the power to postpone these import restrictions."
"And so?"
"And so we welcome Mr Pimenta's excellent report which, despite the legal equivocation I have referred to, introduces the necessary corrective elements by means of suitable amendments which were approved by the Committee on the Environment and restore the obligations contained in the text of the original regulation."
"It is to be hoped that on this occasion, Parliament's voice will be heard - although it must be said that having deliberately failed to comply once, there is nothing to say that the Commission will not re-offend."
"We trust that that will not be the case."
"The Danish social democrats in the European Parliament are sceptical about this new regulation, since we do not think the Commission is entitled, on its own initiative, to postpone legislation which has been adopted."
"A dilemma arises for us in the vote on leghold traps, however."
"On the one hand, there is no doubt that leghold traps are an inhumane trapping method, and that use of them should be eliminated."
"It is therefore an excellent idea to ban imports of pelts from animals caught using leghold traps."
"On the other hand, we are very concerned about a repetition of the events we saw in the past with the ban on imports of pelts from seal pups, when the Greenland trappers were left to suffer the effects of the ban, which had serious social consequences in Greenland."
"So we are anxious to avoid a general ban affecting imports of pelts from animals not caught with leghold traps, and that a ban should not deprive the indigenous Arctic population of their livelihood."
"The best approach for all the parties concerned is to establish clear rules as soon as possible, so that any switch to other trapping methods can begin."
"We therefore have to reject the attempts by the Canadian Government to delay an international agreement on humane trapping methods."
"Canada's indigenous population has been used as an excuse for the Canadian Government's inertia in the international negotiations on new trapping standards."
"These delaying tactics have been emulated by the United States, amongst others."
"If we vote against the regulation, it would be an acknowledgement of the forces which have worked against change."
"The situation is not entirely clear-cut, but we have decided to vote against some amendments which would be detrimental to the situation of the indigenous peoples whilst generally supporting the Pimenta report, because we must show our contempt for leghold traps and for the governments which do not want to do anything - either for animal welfare or the indigenous peoples."
"I would like to express my support and that of the Green Group for the report by Mr Pimenta on trade in skins of animals caught in traps."
"Despite the fact that this issue has been discussed for years now, no agreement has been reached with Canada and the United States so the Commission's proposal to remit this again cannot be accepted."
"There must be a ban on imports of skins of animals caught in a cruel way, especially as the European Union has already prohibited the use of traps on its own territory."
"Such a ban does not conflict with the GATT agreements, because the COM regulation includes a clause protecting health, environment and ethical interests."
"As regards the legitimate rights of the indigenous populations, it has been shown that only some of them live exclusively from hunting and their income can be replaced or increased by new occupations, underpinned by local aid."
"We therefore urge Members to vote for the amendment tabled by the Green Group, which clarifies the terms of the ban, involving both indigenous peoples and animal protection organizations in a consultative capacity, and providing for proper involvement of the European Parliament."
"I support the Pimenta report as I am angry that the Commission has so far failed to implement the ban on importing furs from animals captured using leghold traps."
"It is unacceptable that this ban is still not in force six months after it was due to be implemented."
"Many people in my own constituency are concerned about animal welfare issues - and rightly so."
"If we want Europe to be known as a civilized part of the world then we must act in a civilized way towards animals."
"I hope the President's proposed legal challenge to the Court of Justice over the Commission's failure to act is swift and successful."
"However, I am also aware of the need for us not to dictate our standards to native peoples in other parts of the world - so the Pimenta report's idea that native communities who do not use leghold traps can still trade with Europe, regardless of the position of their national authorities, is a sensible and fair compromise."
"Jacob report"
"Madam President, here is an animal health disaster."
"Damage has been done and must be put right."
"One way of doing this was simple: it was that of responsibility, responsibility of the enterprise owned Mr Mudler - who is not a colleague of ours - of Doncaster in Yorkshire."
"This way was not chosen."
"What was chosen was solidarity, but solidarity also implied that there should be full compensation for the damage."
"But what has the European Commission decided?"
"Well, simply that we are going to compensate by a lump sum: ECU 650 million to be shared among 81 million cattle, which amounts to about ECU 8 per animal."
"And effectively, provision is made for an additional subsidy of ECU 10, that is 50-60 francs."
"Responsibility has been rejected in the name of solidarity and we end up with rapaciousness, mediocrity and accountancy."
"This is where we are now, faced with a disaster for which the Commission is partly to blame."
"Neither direct damage, indirect damage, immediate damage nor induced damage are being compensated for in full."
"Just now, we saw Community law give way to UN standards, now Community law is giving way to the standards of natural law, which imply that those responsible should make amends."
"Madam President, I welcome the Commission proposal to support the hard-pressed beef farmers throughout Europe."
"The reduction in beef consumption across Europe has totally destroyed the market for beef and beef products."
"This has placed many farmers in serious financial difficulty."
"I understand the need to restore consumer confidence in the red-meat industry."
"This we must strive to achieve, but we should never forget that beef farmers, through no fault of their own, have faced a serious crisis since this problem has been blown out of all proportion by the press and the media throughout Europe."
"We must do everything possible to restore confidence throughout the industry once again."
"I could not support the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to reduce the level of support through the suckler cow and beef premium."
"But, although the proposal is not perfect, it is at least a good attempt to help and to achieve a new beginning."
"It will take a long time to recover from this crisis, but we must not ignore it."
"In fact, as we move towards the autumn, the problems may well increase and develop to an even greater extent."
"To subsidise a sector of production which is hit by a crisis in this way is not tenable in principle."
"The European Union cannot subsidise each sector of production hit by a fall in sales."
"Of course measures against BSE must be taken, and these should include stopping the use of bonemeal in animal feed."
"Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will not be furthered by the EU Parliament now sending out the signal that as soon as a fall in sales occurs in any part of the agricultural sector the producers in that sector will receive compensation."
"It is not therefore possible to vote for this report, even though we are of the opinion that forceful action must be taken to counter BSE."
"The current beef crisis is worse than anything that occurred in the past."
"For example, in Ireland alone it is estimated that the accumulative loss since the middle of March is in the region of £250 million."
"The fall in prices will continue until we restore consumer confidence and an effective and comprehensive eradication policy is fundamental to achieving that."
"The present proposed package is totally inadequate to meet the real losses incurred by farmers."
"I would like Parliament to support the proposal put forward by myself and colleagues to increase the package to ECU 1, 000 million."
"Furthermore the situation should be kept under constant review."
"A total of ECU 116 million of which ECU 9.5 million id proposed for Ireland is a woefully inadequate proposal."
"Furthermore, whatever final figures are agreed it is imperative that the money is used also to support the producers of heifer beef who currently received no premium or compensation of any kind."
"Their losses have in fact been worse than those of the producers of male cattle and this must be recognized."
"We would have been very pleased to see that our Parliament was taking on its responsibilities with regard to the mistakes arising from the mad cow crisis, and that it was taking good note of this by showing itself capable of reacting to the helplessness of farmers."
"We are forced to say, however, that nothing of the sort has happened!"
"The vote taken today is highly significant: a reduction in additional aid; suckler cows and young male cattle at ECU 10 per head instead of ECU 20 and 25."
"It is well known that only the interests of a certain number of countries are being satisfied, to the detriment of the general interests of the European Union."
"As a result, the interests of specialist breeders, who are of course those most affected by the current crisis, are neglected to the advantage of mixed and intensive cattle rearing."
"I remarked previously, during the last part session in Brussels, that my amendment asking the Commission for a full enquiry in order to identify the responsibilities of the various parties involved (cattle food industry, Member States, Community institutions, etc.) for the propagation of BSE had been rejected by a large majority of the Members of our Assembly present."
"Was there complicity, thus taking advantage of the ignorance of cattle breeders and scapegoat consumers who, in every case, will pay for an affair for which they are in no way responsible?"
"The matter is sufficiently serious for the governments of Member States to wake up to this at the Florence summit and not to allow the internal political problems of Great Britain to interfere with the search for a financial and political solution to this case."
"It is almost impossible at EU level to judge what support might be needed by individual meat producers in the Member States of the EU because mad cow disease hits different producers and different countries so differently."
"Support should instead be decided at national level in accordance with local and regional circumstances."
"Broad economic guidelines"
"Madam President, while we are promised with every major new European project that it will increase growth and employment, the report of the European Monetary Institute records, on the contrary, a steady drop in the average growth rate in Europe which, and I quote, ' was 4.7 % in the 1960s, 3.3 % in the 1970s, 2.2 % in the 1980s and 2 % so far in the 1990s' ."
"It does not add, as it could have in order to give a complete picture, that unemployment is following a reverse curve and stands today at close to 11 % in the Union, in spite of a tiny plateau in 1995, which does not give reason to anticipate any reversal of the trend in the future."
"In this worsening situation, the Commission merely plans to continue as before."
"It even specifies, and I quote, ' that if this strategy does not yet seem to have produced globally satisfying results in the Community, it is because it has not been implemented with sufficient vigour and credibility' ."
"This assessment is undoubtedly partly true, particularly as regards reform of the job market, reduction of charges on the low paid and adaptation of the education system, including professional training, to market requirements."
"But it must all the same be wondered whether a policy that fails constantly is not wrong somewhere."
"Our view is that the Union is pursuing the broadly counter-productive objective of forced convergence, and that it is suffering from the absence of a genuine measure for international trade protection."
"In view of this trend, the Commission's report quite clearly shows that the criteria for public deficit and government debt will not be fulfilled on average at the end of 1997, unless between now and then there is a hoped-for miraculously vigorous resumption of growth."
"This amounts to tossing a coin over the question of the single currency coming into force."
"For a reform of that importance, is this really responsible?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the preamble of the joint motion for a resolution is very enlightening: economic stagnation, unemployment at record level, sluggish demand, declining public investment, depression amongst businesses and consumers."
"However, we should ask ourselves why this has happened because there in fact are examples of brilliant economic success in Europe."
"Norway and Switzerland in the west, for example, or the Czech Republic and Estonia in the east."
"All these countries have the following features in common: first, they have a strong national currency within a space of a small country, which proves that it is possible for a small country to have a strong currency."
"Secondly, none of them is a Member of the European Union and is therefore not obliged to apply the deflationary policy of the convergence criteria."
"History also teaches us that the centres of growth in Europe were often small States or free cities particularly in Italy or Flanders, and not large artificially unified continental conglomerates."
"In order to give new impetus to growth in Europe, we must abandon the unrealistic objective of monetary union, and copy the examples of these small independent states, Norway or Singapore, which show that national independence and the conditions for growth are entirely compatible."
"Referring to the national compromise and the Edinburgh agreement, the Danish social democrats naturally cannot support those elements of the resolution which run counter to Denmark's four reservations."
"There is much that is good in the economic guidelines, for example the concentration on employment."
"I have voted against as I am against EMU."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Aid to former Yugoslavia"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0174/96 by Mr Alavanos, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission (COM(95)0564 - C4-0535/95) on 'humanitarian aid to the former Yugoslavia: prospects and guidelines' ; -A4-0184/96 by Mr Mendiluce Pereiro, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council (SEC(95)1597 - C4-0595/95) on 'reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia' ; -A4-0204/96 by Mr Giansily, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the communication from the Commission (COM(95)0581 - C4-0608/95) on 'the European Union's financial contribution to reconstruction in former Yugoslavia' ; -A4-0178/96 by Mr Titley, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the communication from the Commission (COM(95)0582 - C4-0519/95) on 'reconstruction in former Yugoslavia: EU aid administration and international aid coordination' ."
"Mr President, we are beginning a debate on a number of reports dealing with aid and reconstruction in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia."
"The reports coming to us all the time are, I think, rather worrying."
"Various objectives of the Dayton accords, such as freedom of movement, are turning out to be pie in the sky."
"Refugees are being allowed to return to their homes only after checks by the armies of the controlling ethnic groups."
"Thousands of refugees - there were new waves of refugees after Dayton - and the Croat and Serb sides, but also the party of President Izetbegovic, are contributing to a resurgence of ethnic cleansing. Of course, we can now say that there is peace and not war, which was not the case some months ago."
"However, this peace is, firstly, very fragile. Secondly, it is being used less for reconciliation and more for consolidation of the gains made through the ethnic cleansing that took place during the war."
"Thirdly, it is engendering greater division rather than unity."
"The activation and mobilization of the international community as regards aid and reconstruction which can, in my opinion, in addition to the humanitarian aspect, constitute a very significant political intervention in developments in Bosnia and in the former Yugoslavia as a whole, should, I believe be assessed in that framework."
"The International Institute for Peace Research in Stockholm has stated, accurately, that the Dayton agreement has brought the deep conflicts which continue to exist in the former Yugoslavia very clearly into focus, and that the impediments of the break-up of Bosnia, which are still in place, can only be surmounted by international aid and a flow of trade and information."
"The mobilization of the European Union and the international community has to be seen in that context, I believe, and, of course, the European Union carries a big responsibility because it has been up until now, and will continue to be, the biggest contributor to economic intervention in the former Yugoslavia."
"That is the basis on which the Committee on Foreign Affairs gave unanimous approval to the report that I am presenting."
"I would like to emphasize a few main points."
"Firstly to say that the humanitarian aid should be viewed as a link, as a bridge, to the policy for reconstruction overall."
"However, it does have its own autonomous features, and because of its urgency and its humanitarian nature, as a means to ensuring the survival of people and saving lives, it is important that it should not be tied to political conditions, to political requirements, but should be available to all sides and to all regions of Bosnia."
"My second point is that while the aid must, of course, be directed towards the provision of food and clothing, it must also be aimed towards meeting other needs, including the provision of medical equipment, encouragement of the return of medical staff to Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia, initial repair of damaged water supply, natural gas and electricity grids and the re-establishment of transport networks, all of which are essential in order to provide the people of Bosnia with a modicum of basic normality in their lives."
"My third point is one that the World Bank has given special emphasis to: namely that the aid should be used in such a way as to encourage the mobilization of local resources and the setting in motion of an autonomous economic dynamic in Bosnia."
"As my fourth point I mention mine-clearance. This must be accepted for what it is - an essential element in the approach to the problems, closely linked with the provision of aid."
"IFOR is playing an important role in mineclearance, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs is minded to promote budget lines to assist the process."
"Lastly, Mr President, I want to stress the importance of encouraging the return of refugees, but in a realistic manner, from western Europe, and of supporting NGOs, especially those established locally, as means to breaking down the final barrier in Bosnia, namely the barrier of enduring fear and hatred, and in order to permit the revival of a multi-ethnic society in that land."
"Mr President, we have discussed the issue of former Yugoslavia so many times in Parliament, in relation to numerous resolutions, that the report which I am presenting today refers only to the new developments which directly concern the reconstruction proposals and the corresponding communication from the Commission."
"However, I should like to draw the House's attention to a number of points which I believe to be very important."
"Firstly, it should not be forgotten that the Dayton agreements have been signed - and signed in their totality - and must be complied with in both their letter and spirit."
"And I stress this because many people are now questioning the wisdom of holding the elections on the date which is planned; of holding them throughout Bosnia; of applying the principle of conditionality; of bringing firm pressure to bear to remove those accused of war crimes from public office, arresting them and bringing them before the International Tribunal in the Hague - something which some people even believe might be considered a provocation."
"Many of us take the view - and many people here in Parliament felt that the Dayton agreements were too much the result of a belated exercise in political realism designed to offset the disastrous consequences of this war - that now the Dayton agreements have been accepted by the parties, it would be extremely dangerous to start adding further doses of political realism which would not actually help their implementation."
"In this context, I think it is important to highlight a number of points. As rapporteurs, I and several other Members have just been on a seven-day fact-finding mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"We were able to see that progress is being made in a number of fields, above all in military terms - although I do not wish to fall into the trap of saying that the military aspects of the Dayton plan are working, but the civil aspects are not. Given the differing degrees of complexity of the two aspects and their treatment in the Dayton agreements, this is a generalization which we cannot accept."
"We must do away completely with the impression that what the Americans are doing is working and what the Europeans are doing is not."
"However, it is true that the implementation of many of the civil provisions of the peace plan is facing serious problems. I shall draw attention to some of these, of which everyone is aware."
"There is only relative freedom of movement: people are able to move around individually and in small groups, but there is no generalized freedom of movement."
"Only small numbers of refugees have been able to return home, and then usually to territories in which their ethnic or religious group is in the majority."
"As regards democratization, the options of the democratic opposition political parties are minimal, and I am sorry to say that none of the political forces represented here in the House has made a serious attempt to support the creation of non-ethnic, non-radical political options in the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In my view, this reflects a serious lack of responsibility on the part of all the democratic political parties represented in this Parliament."
"Karadzic continues openly and directly to pull the strings of the government of the Republika Srpska , and there are considerable doubts that he will be arrested before the elections."
"And I would say that the responsibility of President Milosevic, who is the real protagonist in the manoeuvring which has led to the disastrous failure to arrest Karadzic, and the responsibility of President Tudjman to remove from political office and detain a number of war criminals in Mostar and Herzegovina, such as Dario Kordis and others who are less well-known, mean that we must keep up strong, sustained and unequivocal pressure on Belgrade and Zagreb if we wish the Bosnian peace process to move forward."
"There is not a great deal of positive information concerning the forthcoming elections, although I should like to express my personal concern - and that of many Members of this Parliament, I believe - at the debate surrounding the date of those elections. Many of us believe that it is not a question of the date itself, but of meeting our responsibility as the international community to ensure that the conditions are as favourable as possible by the planned date."
"Consequently, if we continue to fail to support the democratic parties, and if we continue to fail to bring maximum pressure to bear for the arrest of the war criminals and so on, postponing the elections will not represent a significant change."
"I shall end by saying that in terms of actual reconstruction, the results of the European Union's action can be seen in Mostar, although there are serious political problems, such as the lack of reunification."
"However, physical reconstruction can be seen in Mostar."
"It is not visible in the rest of Bosnia."
"It would also be a good idea for the Commission to examine whether the mechanisms, procedures, rules and regulations applied in an operation of this scale and with this degree of political responsibility are suitable for this or future actions which we are required to carry out beyond our borders in the framework of the CFSP."
"I would say that they are not, and that - without wishing to criticize in the least the Commission or its agents on the ground - it is important for the Commission to tell us which of these mechanisms and procedures will be useful in the future and which will not."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in presenting this report of an apparently strictly budgetary nature, I should like first to draw the Assembly's attention to the origins of this affair and then to its financial implications, and also to its political implications, which to my eyes are immensely important."
"First, the origins."
"The proclamation of the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 25 June 1991 led to the intervention of the Yugoslav Federal Army two days later and at the same time provoked war which had disappeared from our continent since 8 May 1945."
"To begin with, the old European demons - differing judgements and analyses and failure to understand what was happening, then divisions over what to do - led Europeans not to intervene and to watch the progress of the war as an exotic phenomenon which would come to an end some day."
"The consequences for the rest of Europe first appeared as a subject for reflection by our pseudo-philosophers looking for moral imperatives, but mostly for cheap personal publicity, and not as a crucial issue for the whole of our continent."
"And sending in the UN blue berets, whose only orders were to keep the combatants apart, could give the impression of a profound lack of interest in a conflict on the doorstep of the Union of 12, later of 15."
"For five years, the Europeans, who love justice and freedom, watched sadly and in dismay something which the rest of the world saw as an illustration of the powerlessness of Europe."
"And then came 16 June 1995 when, under the name of the rapid reaction force, the West froze the situation on the ground, before presiding over a withdrawal of the opposing forces and achieving on 21 November the global peace agreement for Bosnia, concluded at Dayton in the USA."
"Three weeks later, the agreement signed in Paris at the Elysée Palace Conference created two entities, the Croat-Muslim Federation and the Serb Republic of Bosnia, and decided on the deployment of an international peace-keeping force under NATO command, the implementation force , amounting on 1 February 1996 to 65, 366 men."
"This Pax Atlantica - there is no other possible expression - since 54, 220 of the soldiers come from 15 countries of the Atlantic Alliance - is now accompanied by a plan for reconstruction."
"These are the financial and political implications of the peace we are discussing today."
"What our Assembly should consider at this sitting is what any Assembly with budgetary powers should do, that is, provide the financial resources to transform peace through arms into a return to normality by moving on to the reconstruction of this region of Europe devastated by war."
"On this subject, we have in fact three reports apart from mine; those of our colleagues Mr Alavanos, Mr Mendiluce and Mr Titley which, even if they cover the same geographical entity, relate to three different types of reality, graduate their approach to the use of appropriations and are in fact complementary."
"For in an ideal situation, the more rebuilding progresses and the less we shall need humanitarian aid, the more it will be possible to mobilize appropriations for housing and employment and the more those with homes and jobs will once again become free human beings."
"Our Assembly should therefore now take formal note, by a vote that we hope will be in favour, of its involvement in the process of funding reconstruction."
"Although the first Conference of donors on 20 and 21 December 1995 took place hurriedly and at some distance from our Assembly, the next, on 12 and 13 April in Brussels, gave it a substantial role as Mrs Müller, Mr Mendiluce, Mr Titley and I represented you there."
"This second Conference had been preceded by a trialogue under the responsibility, for our Assembly, of Mr Samland, during which a broad convergence of views with the Council and Commission emerged."
"This positive action demonstrated that in this matter the Council, the Commission and the second branch of the budgetary authority shared the same objectives."
"The Committee on Budgets unanimously pronounced itself in favour of the Alavanos report on humanitarian aid."
"In our view, no limitation whatsoever, whether budgetary or legal, can be imposed on humanitarian aid, when it is needed to deal with a distressing situation and above all to help the innocent: the women, the elderly, the children abandoned along the road having fled from the fighting."
"Let us simply remind ourselves that, apart from the 200, 000 who have lost their lives, 3, 600, 000 others have been displaced and their homes destroyed or damaged, so that 80 % of them are now dependent on international aid."
"As for the Titley report, which deals with the management of European Union aid and the coordination of international aid, the Committee on Budgets has also expressed an opinion which was unanimously adopted and which emphasizes the need to provide credible justification for the resources committed by the European Union."
"The justification for this use of appropriations is only a condition adding to those we have consistently urged in this Assembly for many years, particularly the re-establishment of the rule of law, the restoration of basic freedoms, the creation of a civil society and naturally cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague, for which the operational funds should be substantially increased on this occasion."
"As regards Mr Mendiluce's report, the Committee on Budgets has also expressed a favourable opinion for the same reasons as those stated concerning the Titley report."
"Turning to the report entrusted to me by the Committee on Budgets, I wish firstly to draw my colleagues' attention to the importance of the contribution from the European Union."
"Although contributions are theoretically shared between three major participants, the European Union, the USA and the other countries wishing to give aid, it is useful to recall that only the contribution from the European Union is the subject of a multiannual programme, which also requires a review of budgetary perspectives up to 1999 on which discussions have already started."
"This is reflected in a withdrawal of funds under two main headings of our budget, as a result of the simultaneous adoption of our budget on 13 December and the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on the following day."
"I remind you that in December we approved a sum of ECU 400 million programmed as shown in the table on page 14."
"The Committee on Budgets now proposes to you that we confirm the Commission proposal to release ECU 600 million from the PHARE programme for the period 1996-1999."
"For information, I should like to remind you that the budgetary commitment for the PHARE programme over this period amounts to ECU 6, 690, 000, 000, so that the ECU 600 million allocated to the former Yugoslavia represents less than 10 % of the Union's outlay in assisting the CEECs."
"ECU 1 billion over five years which is a symbolic figure as the ECU 400 million and ECU 600 million have to be added together represents less than the average annual unused appropriations of the combined PHARE and TACIS programmes."
"The table on page 12 also shows the proposed breakdown for democratization, sanctions, antipersonnel mines and the city of Mostar, the Gordian knot and focus of all the difficulties experienced by that unhappy country."
"It is now clear that the particularly tight programme approved by the Committee on Budgets, especially as regards the progress of Category IV, which you will find on page 14 of my report, will be greatly facilitated by proper regulations for the use of these appropriations, which have finally just been proposed by the Commission."
"The arrival the day before yesterday of these draft regulations proposed by the Commission nullifies point K in the preamble of my report."
"This is a minor comment, but I now wish to make a major comment."
"Yesterday morning, I was opposed to urgent examination of this document."
"Because of its importance, it seemed to me to call for a particularly detailed examination by our Assembly, examination all the more so because we have consistently maintained that the regulations for the PHARE programme are totally unsuitable and have demanded regulations fully adapted to the exceptional situation in the former Yugoslavia."
"A few more days reflection will therefore be useful for a careful examination."
"To conclude and to get away a little from figures, I should like to mention a quotation."
"The President of France declared recently: ' Recent history has provided Europeans with a good illustration, in Bosnia, of their present opportunities and limitations."
"On the positive side is the Franco-British military cooperation and the German decision, taken at the prompting of Chancellor Kohl, to participate in external peacekeeping operations."
"On the negative side is the present inability of Europeans to engage in a large-scale politico-military action on their own responsibility."
"We must put an end to what is perceived by the world as European powerlessness."
"We must build our common European defence policy, to which we are committed by the Maastricht Treaty' ."
"I will add for my part that our Assembly must also participate in this."
"By adopting these four reports which in fact form only a single one, our Assembly will play its full part."
"We have often been criticised for being inclined to discuss matters of little importance."
"This time, make no mistake, this is a major report and, by approving it, you are preparing yourselves to take a major political act."
"Mr President, we should all be clear that there is no peace in Bosnia at the moment in any sense in which the ordinary person would understand that word."
"There is very little sense of reconciliation, there is virtually no freedom of movement and few refugees have been able to return home."
"Instead, international military force has merely brought about a halt in hostilities."
"It has provided us with a very small window of opportunity to show the local population that they have a stake, both politically and economically, in the future."
"They will get a political stake when elections are held and, despite all the difficulties, it is vital that these elections go ahead on schedule."
"The economic state will depend on the success of the international reconstruction effort, which is the area my report deals with."
"In assessing that effort we should remember, firstly, that the destruction was enormous: the basic infrastructure was extensively damaged or destroyed, only 20 % of houses were left undamaged and 60 % of industrial capacity was destroyed."
"Secondly, the basic structures of society were missing."
"Government institutions have had to be built up from scratch."
"The legacy of the old state-run economy means that there are great problems concerning property rights, which hinder economic reforms, and there have been major issues concerning Bosnia's international debts which had to be resolved before the financial institutions could offer assistance."
"Thirdly, economic reconstruction is not the same as humanitarian aid."
"Reconstruction involves careful planning, extensive consultation and the implementation of long-term financial management."
"It therefore takes longer to produce results and requires patience."
"Given these and many other difficulties, the reconstruction effort mounted so far by the international community has been remarkable."
"The Commission in particular has achieved a great deal, particularly in Mostar."
"Therefore, the concerns I am about to outline should be seen in that context."
"There have been two major international donor conferences which have jointly raised US $1.8 bn."
"That amount contrasts, of course, with the US $7 bn which the IFOR operation is costing."
"It is also a misleading figure."
"In making their pledges governments have sometimes juggled the figures."
"The real amount is less than US $1.8 bn, which has caused some of the reconstruction projects to be scaled down."
"Further, the money has been very slow to materialize."
"In April only half of the money pledged at the December conference had actually been committed."
"The burden of reconstruction money has not been shared out as fairly as originally intended."
"The EU is still responsible for more than its fair share."
"That is why I call in my report for other donors, particularly the United States, Japan and the Islamic countries, to make a greater commitment."
"Donors have mainly put money into specific projects or given assistance in kind."
"Too little money has gone into other areas."
"Funding for recurrent expenditure is desperately needed."
"Rebuilt schools and hospitals are of little use if there is nobody to pay the salaries of teachers and doctors."
"Money needs to be channelled into the social sector, both to provide shortterm employment and to fund a basic social security safety net."
"Another essential area being underfunded is land-mine clearance."
"There are more land-mines in Bosnia than people."
"Economic life cannot return to normal if people literally cannot walk in their back garden for fear of landmines."
"But only 2 % of the money committed in the first donor conference has gone on land-mine clearance."
"Finally, we must constantly emphasize the importance of housing reconstruction."
"Without that normality cannot return."
"When I was in Bosnia, criticisms were made that the Commission was releasing money too slowly."
"Given the difficult circumstances the Commission operates under and the need to ensure financial probity and full transparency, these criticisms are largely unfair."
"There is a desperate need, however, for small sums of money to be rapidly disbursed."
"I hope we can do something in that respect in the future."
"It is also essential to make it clear that there is no weakening of our determination to make our assistance conditional on respect for the Dayton agreement and particularly respect for human rights."
"We must also ensure that there is effective coordination of the international aid effort."
"We have heard a number of stories of failed coordination which has hampered the effectiveness of that aid."
"Finally, the international community has done much, but has actually talked a lot more."
"If we are to build a real and lasting peace in Bosnia, then the international community must put its money where its mouth is."
"Mr President, following the signing of the Dayton agreements, peace at last seemed possible in the wartorn territories of former Yugoslavia."
"However, peace is not won; only wars are won."
"Peace is built. It is built by restoring dignity to those from whom it has been wrested by force of arms, by sowing the seeds of harmony where the warmongers wished only hatred to grow, by covering with a mantle of renewed hope the traces of the long dark night of suffering and death."
"Hence the urgency of carrying out the moral reconstruction of former Yugoslavia and the need for measures which help to establish a just order, based on respect for democracy and human rights."
"This is not an easy task."
"The pain and humiliation of those who suffered the indignity of ethnic cleansing is too great."
"The scars left by the violence and hatred are too deep: 200 000 dead, more than four million refugees and displaced persons, cities reduced to rubble, and a traumatized civilian population."
"Consequently the REX Committee, like the rapporteur on humanitarian aid, believes that for peace to be genuinely possible, over and above the Commission's own emergency measures and the priorities it has established in its communication on the prospects and guidelines for humanitarian aid, there is a need for such aid to be reoriented towards measures which facilitate the return and social reintegration of the refugees and displaced persons."
"It is therefore not only a question of ensuring a continuum between the emergency stage and the rehabilitation stage, important as that may be, but of encouraging the social and political conditions which will make possible if not the dream of the restoration of a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-linguistic society, as Mr Mendiluce said yesterday, then at least the achievement of peaceful coexistence."
"It is a question of healing the wounds in the hearts and minds of those who have been the innocent victims of this war, and providing peace education aimed at promoting tolerance and respect for diversity."
"To this end, there is a need to increase substantially the financial resources being made available, to coordinate the efforts of the donor countries and NGOs, to support the UNHCR in carrying out its guiding role, and to introduce the principles of greater flexibility and decentralization into the technical assistance initiatives under the PHARE programme."
"In this way, peace will start to become a reality in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"The European Union, which was incapable of stopping the war, now has it in its hands to make peace possible."
"This is the European Union's great responsibility, and indeed our responsibility."
"Mr President, in the debate on former Yugoslavia I should like, as joint draftsman, to focus on Mr Alvanos's report on humanitarian aid to this war-torn region."
"Very few people are aware that the European Union is far and away the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to the countries of former Yugoslavia."
"Since 1992 the Union has provided 1.6 billion ECU, and this region thus takes more out of the ECHO aid fund than all other regions put together."
"Aid is channelled through the Red Cross, the UNHCR, Médecins sans Frontières and dozens of NGOs operating in the field in order to help the 3.5 million or so refugees within the region to survive."
"I must stress here the respect I feel for all those working with the NGOs, who often have to operate under difficult conditions and sometimes at considerable risk to their own lives."
"Against that background, Mr President, I have a few comments which you will also find in my opinion and which have been very largely adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"We believe a clear distinction needs to be made between humanitarian aid and aid to reconstruction."
"Aid to reconstruction is not emergency aid."
"Humanitarian aid is given without political strings attached and aid for reconstruction does have political strings."
"We think these two flows of aid must be kept separate because otherwise humanitarian aid, which is in any case all too meagre, will be misused for projects which are really part of the reconstruction effort."
"We have put down a number of amendments on this and are glad that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has endorsed them."
"Secondly, the levels of aid for food, clothing and services such as housing are more or less adequate, but the NGOs report that not enough psychological and social help is being given, for example to the families of people who are missing, to women and children who have been the victims of assault and rape."
"Perhaps a little more can be done here under ECHO."
"Thirdly, help is also needed in the social and cultural field, because multicultural organizations need to be able to regenerate themselves."
"It must also be possible to counter the segregation which increasingly threatens to become established in schools and hospitals, but help is needed for that."
"And we believe such help has to be given."
"And then there are the soldiers being demobilized, Mr President."
"There are some 300 000 of them and we hear that they are increasingly forming gangs and thus creating a new danger."
"It is said that there are 3 to 4 million mines in the region."
"We think humanitarian aid money can be used here if there is no other way of paying for mines clearance."
"A couple of remarks to close with, Mr President."
"We think it is most important for the return of refugees to be properly coordinated."
"We are genuinely concerned that too many of them will be forcibly repatriated."
"We urge the Commission to be particularly alert to this possibility."
"Finally, Mr President, one political question: what is actually going to happen when the United States withdraws from the entire region?"
"Can we then expect the European Union to fill the gap?"
"Is there any truth in the rumour that Mr Bildt too will be resigning at the end of the year?"
"Can the Commissioner give specific answers to these questions?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, what the European Union is doing at the moment regarding reconstruction in BosniaHerzegovina - and that is the only thing I want to speak about - is a scandal."
"Haven't we repeatedly emphasized in recent months just how important the civil reconstruction of the country is, so as to raise people's hopes for peace in good time before the elections in September?"
"With a great show of strength, we made over ECU 200 million available, and we insisted on unbureaucratic and rapid aid."
"And what happened?"
"Six months later, most of the emergency relief that was made available has still not arrived."
"It has become tangled up in the Commission's bureaucratic jungle and in its bickering over who is responsible for what."
"Right from the beginning, Parliament indicated that the PHARE Programme was not suitable for BosniaHerzegovina."
"I was able to verify at first hand the fact that long deadlines for tendering, and central planning via the government, are not at all appropriate for this particular situation."
"So it is hardly surprising that the first mine detectors were not due to be delivered until May, despite the fact that we all know that in actual fact reconstruction is totally impossible without a comprehensive mine clearance programme."
"And what about the ECU 92 million of emergency relief that Parliament made available under separate budget headings?"
"We called it, ""Europe for Sarajevo' ."
"But unfortunately Sarajevo has received almost nothing from Europe, with the exception of constantly changing faces."
"The Commission has put these funds on ice, saying that there is no legal basis for them."
"At the end of May it submitted the draft to the Council and Parliament for advice."
"If we are lucky, implementation may start in August, in other words a month before the elections."
"But we have always insisted that the budget headings should be used in accordance with the budget decision, and that we should not fight out our battles over a legal basis on the backs of the people of Sarajevo, Tuzla and Banja Luka."
"The political repercussions, for which you, Commissioner van den Broek, share the responsibility, are most unfortunate."
"People will not see any recognizable sign of hope if they cannot repair their houses."
"The return of refugees will not be possible, because there are no houses or jobs in sight."
"The demobilized soldiers cannot find anything to do and, thanks to the Commission's failure to act. the opposition, which would like to be based on peace and European values such as tolerance and freedom, is being robbed of its argument that Europe can be relied on."
"Mr van den Broek, the former Yugoslavia is not going to do us a favour by organizing itself neatly and tidily on the basis of PHARE and humanitarian aid."
"This is a country that has largely been destroyed, and its people are without hope."
"Instead of facing up to these challenges, you have fallen back on traditional ways and means, and on top of that you have not even organized them properly. And the price of all this is being paid by the people there, who so far have seen hardly anything of our aid."
"One glance at Mostar could have shown you what needed to be done, in other words, to organize decentralized assistance using qualified staff."
"In Mostar, reconstruction is proceeding hand in hand with the creation of new infrastructures, and 90 % of all projects are being carried out by local firms."
"This approach also makes it possible, to some extent, to walk the difficult political tightrope between aid and conditionality."
"But what should be done now?"
"Commissioner, it is high time you took on full responsibility for this matter!"
"Set up a proper team in Brussels, made up of people who will work together and not against one another!"
"Link the PHARE Programme aid to the emergency aid!"
"Don't create two mutually independent procurement structures!"
"Learn from the experience gained in Mostar!"
"Develop decentralized programmes, place more reliance on the local mayor rather than on a deposed government in Sarajevo, and get your priorities right!"
"Encourage the formation of local infrastructures instead of looking for orders for EU companies and jobs for EU advisers!"
"Send qualified personnel to the most important towns, and above all make use of the time leading up to the elections!"
"Support the independent media, and help the opposition to make its voice heard!"
"In other words, finally get round to doing what Parliament instructed you to do at the end of last year, when it took the relevant budget decision!"
"And now for a reaction to the Council."
"It seems to me, Mr Fassino, that there is considerable uncertainty within the Council as to how it can be made possible for refugees to return to their homes."
"Mr Schäfer, for example, a minister who was in Bosnia at the same time as the delegation from this House, stated on his return that basically there was nothing to stop the operation to return the refugees to their homes from starting on 1 July as planned, provided that when they got there they would find conditions - and especially accommodation - fit for human habitation."
"However, as we know, this is something that cannot be achieved quite so quickly."
"However right it is to insist on the refugees' right to return to their homeland, it is equally true to say that no refugee ought to be compelled to go back to an area from which he was driven by force, and where he would now have to live as part of a minority, with no guarantee of his safety."
"However right it may be to say that every refugee is entitled to get his home back, it is equally true to say that many of those homes that are still intact have long ago been taken over by other refugees."
"It is therefore essential to ensure that the rehoming of refugees does not itself give rise to further misery."
"We should therefore follow the recommendation of the mayor of Tuzla, who is insisting that first of all the one million or so refugees that were uprooted within Bosnia should be given the chance of relocating."
"Only then should a full-scale start be made on rehoming the one million or so refugees who have found shelter abroad."
"This gradual process would also make it possible to resolve many of the outstanding property disputes dating from the days of Socialism."
"It is precisely because the refugee issue is so closely linked to rapid reconstruction that our delay in getting the emergency aid scheme off the ground is particularly unfortunate."
"In this context it seems to me that the Regulation adopted by the Council is highly disturbing, in that it succeeds in turning the emergency aid into a creeping subsidy programme for Spanish and other suppliers."
"Mr President, we have held countless debates in this House and adopted numerous resolutions on the tragedy of the war in former Yugoslavia."
"We have condemned the atrocities committed, and drawn attention to the inaction and dissent of certain members of the international community, as well as to the efforts carried out on the ground, with great personal commitment, by those who have sought to defend the victims by monitoring both the ceasefire and the situation of civilians."
"The point should also be made, however, that some people have done very good business in this war, because we are not so naive as to be unaware that wars always provide opportunities for shady commercial dealings at the expense of the victims."
"Little has been left standing; the destruction is continuing, and time is short for peace to be secured."
"In this debate today, we are determined to establish reasonable criteria for reconstruction of the areas which have suffered the severest damage as a result of the conflict."
"Former Yugoslavia is on our borders, and this means that the Union must make a great effort, even if critical voices are raised - and they will be heard."
"It is worth committing ourselves to the establishment of a plan for peace, harmony and cultural tolerance."
"Intolerance and hatred are scourges which must be combatted with solidarity."
"And solidarity, let us not forget, is a duty which cannot be replaced by goodwill or charity."
"In other words, success will depend on a number of factors, but above all on a distinct financial effort."
"It can never be stressed enough that the peace is fragile."
"The region - above all Bosnia-Herzegovina - is shattered, its industrial fabric destroyed and its productive capacity reduced to nil."
"So it is essential to lay the foundations for reconstruction without delay, thinking in both the medium and long term."
"And achieving peace will depend on the process of democratization as well as on the economic effort."
"In the view of the REX Committee, the financial instruments available must first be directed towards restoring the productive fabric and infrastructure, with a view to making progress in two directions: regional integration, and preparation for future association with the Union, which can be achieved by adapting our contractual relations as the situation develops."
"Unfortunately, the transition to a market economy - a precondition for this contractual development - will be taking place in the worst possible conditions."
"As a result, the Union's financial instruments must be well defined and match the realities."
"Two questions which the REX Committee has been asking itself in the course of its lengthy discussions are, firstly, whether in the present budgetary framework the Union will be able to respond rapidly and effectively to the challenge; and, secondly, whether the virtual insolvency of the former Yugoslav republics will be another obstacle to gaining access to international credit."
"The REX Committee considers it essential that, with the exception of humanitarian aid, the Union's technical, financial and macro-economic assistance should be made subject to the criteria of political and economic conditionality laid down by the General Affairs Council at its meeting in October last year."
"The nature of the consequences of the war in former Yugoslavia will not allow total normality to be restored for a long time, and it should be stressed, finally, that abuses will continue to be committed, but that these abuses will be far more serious if the international community - and, more particularly, the European Union - fails to assume its responsibilities."
"Mr President, six months ago the peace negotiations in Bosnia-Herzegovina ended with the signing of the Dayton Accord."
"Since then, the international community has made great efforts to achieve longterm peace in this devastated country, by means of reconstruction."
"The European Union and its Member States have fulfilled their responsibilities with regard to a substantial part of these efforts, in terms of both reconstruction and peacekeeping by the IFOR troops."
"However, we have not yet succeeded in ensuring peace."
"After a certain amount of initial difficulty, the first results of the reconstruction effort are now visible, and even the restoration of infrastructural facilities is slowly but surely progressing."
"Thanks to the presence of the international troops, however, the most important objective has been achieved. The war has ended."
"This does not mean that all the wounds in the relationships between the individual ethnic groups have already been healed, and that peace is guaranteed in the long term."
"But thanks to IFOR the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina can now venture to make a new start in relative safety."
"Unfortunately the situation is still not such as to make this possible without the presence of the IFOR troops."
"Enormous efforts will still have to be made if there is to be reconciliation between the different ethnic groups, because if there is one thing we have learned from Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is that it is more difficult to make peace than to make war."
"The planned withdrawal of IFOR forces at the end of this year is therefore likely, in my opinion, to constitute the greatest threat to maintaining both the peace and the reconstruction process."
"My group has therefore taken the initiative and, by means of a European Parliament recommendation, has asked the Council of Ministers to prolong the presence of at least the European contingent of the IFOR troops so that it continues into next year."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen has spoken about this problem."
"I take exactly the same view as she does."
"The matter must be discussed."
"A decision of this kind is essential, because without IFOR we cannot expect the peace process to be successful."
"All those who have said so here today are right, because although progress is being made on reconstruction, there is still a lot of work to be done."
"As was shown by last week's follow-up conference in Florence, on the implementation of the peace accord, there are some areas in which a lot of work still has to be done."
"This is particularly true with regard to the return of refugees and those who have been driven out of their homes, the measures needed to guarantee freedom of domicile for people throughout the whole of the sovereign territory, and the building up of joint democratic institutions at national, regional and local level."
"The implementation of free and democratic elections could make an important contribution here, if - and I emphasize the word ""if' - the basic conditions for those elections can be provided."
"Of absolutely vital importance is the existence of free and independent media, so that it is possible for all candidates and all parties to have free and equal access."
"Even more important, however, is the existence of multi-ethnic political parties, which will make it possible, after the elections, to continue the process of rapprochement between the various ethnic groups, and to prevent ethnic separation from becoming strengthened and legitimized by the elections."
"The European Union now faces an important task. It must do everything it can to ensure that the hope of a peaceful future in Bosnia-Herzegovina can survive."
"I hope that we shall all be in a position to do so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now almost seven months since Dayton or Paris, and we have to ask ourselves whether anything has really changed."
"The only thing that has changed is that there is no longer a war going on, but the changes have not been as great as we should have liked."
"On the civilian side, things are not yet progressing as we had thought they might."
"We are coming up against a lot of obstacles, including the fact that in this instance war has paid off, since the aggressor has gained 49 %."
"It is also true to say that ethnic cleansing is still going on everywhere in Bosnia. Over the last four years we have learned that ethnic cleansing still goes unpunished."
"It is now continuing in all regions, and we cannot prevent it, despite the many organizations that are there on the spot."
"We are forced to admit that local politicians and police officers are still compliantly doing the dirty work for their criminal bosses."
"Of course there are decent politicians everywhere, and those who would like to make these things public, but who dare not, because if they did they would very soon lose their heads."
"So the civilian implementation is not working, but the reason it is not working is that it is mainly Europeans who are involved."
"At the end of the day, everybody agreed to this civilian implementation, and everybody is responsible for it, just as we are also all responsible for the positive results of the military implementation."
"As far as humanitarian aid and reconstruction aid are concerned, we are faced with the question of how to give our aid, whom to give it to and on what conditions."
"If we were to follow our own ideas, then we would be able to give aid to hardly any projects at all, because hardly anywhere are the provisions of the Dayton Accord being observed."
"The extradition of the war criminals is being boycotted."
"Freedom of movement has not been established."
"Only a tiny number of refugees have returned from the Serbian sector of Bosnia into the Croatian-Moslem sector."
"The authorities in the Serbian sector have absolutely no interest in having their fellow Serbian citizens coming back to Sarajevo, for example, which in many cases they went away from as a result of Serbian pressure."
"Nor have they any interest - although they maintain that the opposite is true - in seeing them go back into Krajina, thereby forcing the Croatian authorities to show their true colours."
"They would much rather keep them almost like hostages, so that they can then say that they have so many Serbian refugees that they are unable to allow any Croatian or Muslim refugees, who have lived there for hundreds of years, to come back."
"The reciprocity scheme is working wonderfully well, except that the Serbs are to some extent preventing their own fellow citizens, who would very much like to return to their original homes, from doing so."
"The politicians in the Serbian sector of Bosnia do not regard their sector as a constitutive part of Bosnia, and yet that is what is set down in the accord, and that is what they signed up to!"
"In other words, not much is happening."
"Yet the people of the country want peace!"
"They need, at long last, to have leaders who want the same thing, and the new elections could bring this about, at least in part."
"But the prerequisite for any elections whose results will not be a foregone conclusion is to have media that will stop inciting the people and start informing them, and will finally follow this motto: this land of Bosnia is the land of Muslims, Croatians and Serbs!"
"This message must be got across, every day, morning, noon and night, by television and radio, so that the people - and in particular their politicians - finally understand it."
"Our aid must be concerned with the media projects."
"It is a matter of the utmost urgency that we should rebuild houses and that we should rebuild multi-ethnic schools."
"But it is also necessary to provide aid to build up the SMEs, thereby providing the possibility of help by self-help."
"Jobs are absolutely essential in order to give people prospects and in order to make them immune to the inflammatory speeches of their leaders, some of whom are criminals."
"Mr President, previous speakers have rightly expressed our fears in respect of war and peace."
"The mid-term review of the Dayton Agreement conducted in Florence expressed those same fears for the peace process."
"In view of the time I shall confine myself to a few brief points."
"The setting of a date for elections is interesting but it is not enough unless the international community is prepared to give its backing and help ensure that the elections are truly democratic."
"IFOR must help to secure the arrest of Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic and the return of the refugees."
"The Union and other donors must help with the development of independent media, and I would echo here a call which a number of people have already made to the Commissioner in other contexts."
"We are already hearing that some people, namely foreign journalists, are experiencing problems, are being harassed and hampered in their work."
"In the context of the elections which we hope will take place in September I hope it may be possible to set up a sort of hotline between journalists and Mr Bildt's office or the other authorities so that proper and timely warning can be given if journalists are prevented from doing their job freely."
"Free media, in the context of the elections, will go a long way towards fostering the democratic perception that one's voice is heard and can be heard."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to compliment Mr Alavanos and the other rapporteurs on their reports."
"Mr President, I do not want to go into detail about what has happened in the blood-soaked former Yugoslavia over all these years."
"I just wish to say that on numerous occasions there has been no shortage of hypocrisy in the European Union, and no shortage of it here, too, in the European Parliament."
"I also believe that the European Union bears a huge responsibility for the tragedy that the peoples of the former Yugoslavia have had to live through, and still are living through."
"And therefore its responsibility to assist in the repair of the damage, in so far as it can be repaired, and to show solidarity with the people of the region in their struggle for survival is equally huge."
"The main foci of the aid must be:"
"the reconstruction of infrastructure destroyed in the war; -the return of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes; the creation, that is, of conditions which will encourage them to return, because fine words alone will not get these people back to their homes, to the places where they lived peacefully in earlier years; -clearance of the minefields which are endangering the lives of many thousands of people in Bosnia; -the placing of priority on the social rehabilitation of the people, with emphasis on ensuring that the appropriations are not frittered away by businessmen and the various opportunists who will be looking for the main chance; -fair distribution of the appropriations among all of the peoples - Serbs, Croats, Muslims - without special conditions and requirements.We would view any attempt to link this aid to political conditions, to a demand for the establishment of any particular social organization model, as a new manifestation of inhumanity on the part of the Union and its institutions."
"The Dayton peace was imposed by weapons, by force."
"So, of course, it is not real peace."
"The crisis and the hatred created by the war have not been overcome. Any attempt to impose conditions, or any unfair treatment in the management of the aid, could re-ignite the flames of war."
"Posterity will judge whether the European Union shouldered its responsibility and implemented a good policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the peace process in former Yugoslavia and more particularly in Bosnia-Hercegovina does indeed continue to be very hard going."
"To my mind there are two factors which might have a very negative effect in the short and medium term."
"The first is the lifting of the arms embargo yesterday and the second is the possibility - I hope it will be no more than that - that the elections planned for the autumn will fail."
"The Dayton Agreement stipulated that the state of Bosnia-Hercegovina should not initially have its own army and its own police force, which would of course normally be an essential part of the state apparatus."
"There were obvious reasons for this but it remains a fact that the presence of two armies within a supposed state, which are still hostile to one another, continues to be a factor of divisiveness."
"On top of that the Security Council decided yesterday to lift the arms embargo, thereby placing the Americans on the ground in IFOR in a very ambiguous position, as peace-keepers in IFOR on the one hand and, on the other hand, as the biggest supplier of arms to the Federation of Bosnia-Hercegovina."
"Everyone know this and it is also visible on the ground."
"Hence my question to the Commissioner as to how the Union will seek to monitor the agreements which have been reached and to ensure that IFOR's credibility is not damaged, because in my view it is practicable to say that IFOR should stay rather longer than originally envisaged but it is a contradiction in terms to link that to rearmament."
"As for the second problem, the elections, it is clear here that many groups on the spot and concerned principally with human rights are warning that in the short term those who will wield the greatest influence are those who advocated and fought for ethnic cleansing."
"On the other hand all the parties, including the opposition, think that it is better to hold the elections than not to."
"I am willing to give this the benefit of the doubt but it will be most important for us to monitor this process in the next few weeks and months, otherwise we shall fail over this too."
"Mr President, peace has returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"At least the guns are silent."
"Two hundred thousand soldiers, or a few more, have returned to barracks, with ordered arms."
"Today, the worry is that everything, or nearly everything, remains to be done."
"We must, at least for the time being, go into mourning - but mourning is by its very nature temporary - for a dream long kept alive of a multiethnic, multicultural and multireligious society."
"Make no mistake, the rapists and murderers have won the game."
"I am not saying they have won the war, but they have won an important battle."
"Each of the now peaceful zones is controlled by an exclusive, or at the very least a largely dominant, ethnic group."
"Try to go from one town to another in Bosnia."
"It is practically impossible."
"Try to telephone from Tuzla to Banja Luka, it is also virtually impossible."
"These minimum freedoms of movement and communication are still non-existent."
"The people in control of these adjacent enclaves care little for their citizens' freedoms, including freedom of expression and freedom of the press."
"But the European Union does have enough weight to induce these authorities to respect, however minimally, the freedom of the citizens living in the zones they control."
"We have the means, you have the means, to set clear conditions for establishing cooperation, particularly of a financial nature."
"In this respect, the naming, prosecution, judgement and sentencing of the criminals and the quality of the help given to the court by the local authorities - Serbs, Croats and Bosnians - will have to be regarded as a decisive criterion for the allocation of European aid."
"For the violence to continue to be held in check, it is also essential that IFOR, in its present form or in a form still to be determined, should be present, that it should be well armed and determined to protect the populations which, when it suited it, the international community left in the hands of butchers."
"Such a military presence, which is supposed to prevent any resumption of the armed conflict, should also enable these populations to regain confidence and to start rebuilding their own future."
"Mr President, on reading these four outstanding reports one is impressed once again by the enormity of the human suffering and material damage caused by more than four years of war in former Yugoslavia."
"Whilst the Dayton Agreement offers a basis for peace, given the continuation of divisions along ethnic lines the question remains whether Bosnia can ever become a multiethnic unified state."
"We cannot see an enforced balance of power and peace agreement achieving this."
"Nevertheless the international aid we are discussing today is the appropriate instrument for encouraging a return to normal society in former Yugoslavia."
"In addition to humanitarian aid in the form of food supplies and medical care amongst other things, the focus must switch in future to reconstruction aid, with a view to selfsufficiency."
"It is primarily important that tangible results should be achieved ahead of this autumn's elections."
"It is not easy to pick out priorities from the wide range of projects."
"But we would give precedence to those projects likely to encourage cooperation between the different population groups in former Yugoslavia."
"High priority should also be given to demobilizing the 300 000 or so troops and finding these people employment."
"One question which does not receive sufficient attention is how far the Union can help to reduce the number of weapons in the region."
"I fear that peace will not be helped merely by stabilizing existing arms levels."
"I would be glad to hear the Commissioner's views on this."
"Lastly, in giving aid for reconstruction the point is not so much that the Union should prove its credibility in terms of its foreign and security policy, as we read in one of the reports."
"The point is primarily that the Union and the international community should, in providing aid, fulfil their moral obligations towards the citizens of war-torn former Yugoslavia in the hope of establishing a lasting peace here."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Alavanos, Mendiluce and Titley reports submitted to us on humanitarian aid and reconstruction in the countries of the former Yugoslavia are unsatisfactory."
"Only that of our colleague, Mr Giansily, has the strict budgetary qualities that we are pleased to acknowledge."
"As for that of Mr Alavanos, the Greek communist, it repeats the intentions of the Council and Commission concerning humanitarian aid, but accompanies them with unacceptable conditions connected with his ideological views."
"In 1991, Mr Alavanos, like Mr Delors, opposed the independence of the Slovenian and Croatian peoples, who were unanimous in their wish to recover their freedom and sovereignty."
"This attitude is known to have been regarded as significant support by the rulers of the communist regime of the Communist-Serb army."
"It is hard to understand why Mr Alavanos, who praises a unitary, multinational, multicultural Yugoslavia, does not extend his argument to his own country."
"Why should he not advocate a Greco-Turkish or Turko-Greek society, which would end the age-old conflict between two neighbouring nations?"
"The two other reports are also marred by such ideological attitudes."
"In this way, it is forgotten that Croatia, a third of whose territory was occupied and laid waste for more than four years, has made an immense effort to welcome into its liberated area not only its own nationals but also tens of thousands of Bosnians, both Christian and Muslim."
"The war has resulted in partition, as always unsatisfactory, but because each people has now, somehow or other, been allocated a territory, why is it necessary to force the return of refugees at all costs to their former place of residence?"
"What madness that is, when the same causes produce the same effects!"
"The important thing is to prevent for the Muslim population of Bosnia the Palestinization that threatens them."
"May these refugees therefore leave their camps in a foreign land as quickly as possible and return to their homes, or to somewhere near their homes, in Bosnia, for only amongst their own will they find the surest guarantee of peace!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, Europe failed to prevent the conflict in former Yugoslavia, has failed to end the conflict in former Yugoslavia."
"It must now be a point of honour for Europe to take the lead in providing fast, efficient and generous assistance to do as much as it can to rebuild former Yugoslavia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina in particular."
"There are, of course, a number of strings attached."
"Firstly, the Dayton Agreement must be implemented in full."
"I think the frame of this debate is clear."
"Everyone understands that structurally important problems remain given the lack of a true desire for peace on the part of all the parties concerned."
"So there is by no means any de facto implementation of the Dayton Agreement."
"The elections have already been postponed and questions remain as to whether the autumn elections will be a success."
"The mid-term review of 13 and 14 June in Florence confirmed that sizeable problems remain over freedom of movement and media freedom."
"That war criminals are far from being handed over, that Karadzic and Mladic are still at liberty."
"Something which I think is often overlooked is the close link between the situation in Bosnia and the situation in Eastern Slavonia."
"Because any worsening of the situation in Eastern Slavonia, due to new mass movements of refugees, may seriously affect the fragile situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina."
"I thus believe special concern should be shown for Eastern Slavonia."
"A second proviso which we, and primarily the Committee on Budgets, would impose is that there should be maximum transparency in respect of monies earmarked and strict monitoring of the way in which financial resources are spent."
"In concrete terms that means that the European Parliament wishes to be and to remain fully involved in the specific reconstruction effort."
"It is important here that our Committee on Budgets and Committee on Budgetary Control should play a major part."
"Urgency, regular urgent procedures of the kind we have seen for the transfers of appropriations we have already approved, are no longer democratically acceptable to this Parliament."
"Today we have yet another financial regulation."
"Yet again urgency is requested."
"We need to think carefully about how, through the budget, we can make sure that on the one hand aid is given efficiently and quickly enough but on the other hand that it is transparent enough."
"In concluding, may I say that I was impressed by Mrs Müller's report on the slow pace at which funds are released."
"We have to cut through this red tape, at least as far as the future deployment of aid is concerned."
"Mr President, at the beginning of this debate we heard once again about the ineptitude and failure of the outside world and the European Union to deal with the problems of former Yugoslavia."
"I think we should stop talking of the European Union in those terms, because we know that foreign policy is directed by an intergovernmental band of ministers equipped with vetos, whose moral calibre can thus by definition never be higher than that of the member with the lowest moral calibre, and that consequently this whole business is the result or the fault of an amoral foreign policy regarded by its proponents as a sign of competence."
"I think we should make no bones about the fact that the blame for events in former Yugoslavia lies with the intergovernmental Council and we should stop talking about ineptitude or failure, because this is not the way it was."
"We are now living with the reality of the Dayton Agreement, child of the Vance-Owen agreement and grandchild of the plans of Karadzic which he demonstrated to me neatly on a wall chart early on in his country's sufferings."
"We are not totally happy with it."
"We are happy that it has a military component, carried out by NATO in cooperation with other troops, with IFOR, which separated the troops, unfortunately at a time when Mladic's troops were losing out."
"Nevertheless, they are separated."
"And there is a civilian component which is really a joke, since the maintenance of order and, for example, organization of the return of refugees and elections needs a pretty firm hand when you have a situation of violence."
"My first question to the Council is whether there is still any prospect of an international police force, which would also have to be well equipped."
"We cannot plonk London bobbies down in Banja Luka and environs, or in Sarajevo and environs."
"That is just not feasible."
"You need troops there who are more akin to riot police or our Dutch military police, a force which can if necessary call on armoured vehicles."
"In Bosnia we are regularly dealing with armed gangs."
"Is there any prospect of this police force becoming a reality and of operating effectively?"
"Concerning elections, I must also ask the Commissioner how things stand with regard to our help for a free media."
"We know that the conflict in Yugoslavia just as in Rwanda and Burundi, for example, is very largely the result of misuse and manipulation of the media."
"We have been talking about this for years and there is still no prospect of effective opinion-forming by truly free media supported by us."
"I think that is needed as a start to the healing process."
"Mr President, I particularly welcome the acceptance today in another report of the need for an international public inquiry into the political events surrounding the fall of Srebrenica."
"I think that certain countries are not so keen on this, any more than they want to see the arrest of Karadzic and Mladic, perhaps because too many awkward facts may come to light."
"I think it is important that Parliament, as the elected voice of Europe, should have asked for this."
"Mr President, it is good to hear from colleagues who have visited the former Yugoslavia that the situation there has improved."
"This underlines the value of our support both for IFOR and for the reconstruction which is being managed so well by Carl Bildt."
"Both inside and outside the EU there are many who regard developments in the former Yugoslavia as a test of the European Union's foreign policy strength."
"This makes positive results all the more important."
"To achieve them money is needed; the aid conference was successful but more is needed."
"In this connection I should just like to emphasise that the PHARE programme, which is regarded as a milch cow, is not inexhaustible and has many, many calves to satisfy."
"EU support should primarily go to power supplies, communications and homes and to revive the industry which has been destroyed."
"For liberals it is especially important that no EU aid should be given to those who refuse to respect human rights."
"Allow me, Mr President, to take this opportunity to express my estimation of the great efforts being made by our colleague Elisabeth Rehn."
"Nor should aid money be given to those who do not show by their deeds that they have understood the necessity of suspected war criminals being brought to trial."
"Those responsible for ethnic cleansing must be removed, refugees must return home, independent media must be established once again and free elections must be held."
"We must construct a solid post-96 structure for Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Mr President, now that it has been decided to have the elections in Bosnia held on schedule it is important to look at how the rest of the peace process is going."
"Without lasting guarantees of security in Bosnia and without visible success in reconstruction, the elections will be taking place in a kind of social vacuum."
"They will then at best confirm the existing political balance in Bosnia, which is not as good as it might be and will only improve once the peace process brings very clear benefits, at least there."
"So it is also necessary to establish very quickly whether the international presence in Bosnia, so fundamental to any reconstruction effort, is to continue."
"One can doubt whether the date chosen for the elections is the right one."
"Is there anything for people to vote on?"
"Will the conditions be right in September?"
"But given that the international community has decided that the Dayton plan must be adhered to, we must now concentrate primarily on conditions in Bosnia itself and the Union can help to ensure that the parties all have a fair chance of putting their views across in the election campaign."
"A number of previous speakers have emphasized the importance of creating good, free and fair conditions during the campaign and the elections themselves and in that context it is also important to pay more attention to the role of a free media."
"We also believe that the Union should seek together with other donors to speed up the visible reconstruction of Bosnia."
"A lot of talking goes on, a lot of planning goes on, but people see very little by way of concrete results."
"More money must be freed up, procedures must be less complicated, more local people must be involved and materials and equipment must be delivered faster."
"People in Bosnia must be shown that things are changing and that they themselves can do something to further the process."
"I think the European Commission should also ensure that its offices in Bosnia are adequately equipped and suitably staffed to carry out their work efficiently and fast."
"In this context I would also emphasize the need for better coordination between the international organizations on the ground."
"When I was there recently I had the impression that the aid providers are sometimes tripping over each other; the whole of Sarajevo is full of well equipped Land Rovers - and that many of these organizations are often working alongside each other rather than with each other."
"Rapporteur Titley rightly points to the slow pace at which aid funds pledged are released."
"That point too merits attention."
"If the international community wants the political process to continue according to plan it will at least need to be quicker than it is now to invest in creating a material basis for political progress."
"In that respect the elections are important."
"IFOR's role in the peace process is important but visible renewal, visible results of reconstruction are equally important to the success of the huge operation which the international community has set in train in Bosnia."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now discussed the question of how extremely difficult it is to implement this much-needed aid in such a way as to ensure that within a short time these people, who have suffered all the atrocities of the war, can be given new confidence, confidence in the knowledge that they are not without protection and that they will succeed in getting the economy going again."
"At the same time, as Mrs Pack has pointed out in great detail, injustice and ethnic cleansing continue, to a large extent without the authorities taking any notice, and we, the European Union, are the only ones who have fulfilled the obligations that were agreed on at the Donor Conference."
"But we must be careful!"
"Accusations will not help those people out there who are now waiting for help. They need economic aid, but they also need psychological help."
"We must not leave them alone now, but must try, together, to open up a large number of sources of aid and to show the people - not only those who stayed there, but also the refugees who still hesitate to go back - that the reconstruction of the country depends on everyone lending a hand."
"Nor can we divide the population into those who were able to flee in time and are now waiting for reconstruction to get underway so that they can then go back, and those who stayed there and suffered. We cannot say to the latter, ""Start building, ' so that the others will see that it's safe to come back."
"I can see the dilemma, but we also know what the results would be."
"There is only one thing that we can say with any certainty, and that is that the road to peace is a long one."
"We must not get impatient, and we the European Parliament must help the Commission and the Council, not by heaping accusations upon them, but by means of mutual understanding in a difficult situation."
"Money is needed everywhere, but at the moment it is needed most urgently there."
"We must therefore fulfil our obligations in difficult times as well, and we must not fail."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I have asked to speak for just one simple reason, not to repeat what many of my colleagues have said about our position, the difficulties, the outlook and so forth, but to raise an issue I have already raised once in the Committee on External Economic Affairs with Commissioner van den Broek present, and which is fleetingly covered in the Mendiluce report."
"I am convinced we cannot wait for the revision of the financial perspectives to work out an ad hoc programme for the reconstruction of former Yugoslavia."
"I believe that even the most consistent aid - and as a European Union we are certainly deeply committed to that - will be inadequate without the framework of a new programme."
"We cannot regard what we are doing as adequate, not so much from the quantitative point of view, because we introduced TACIS and PHARE after the upheavals, the end of the cold war, etcetera. But after a war which has lasted four years, our reconstruction aid must be organized through an ad hoc programme."
"That is fundamental to the credibility of the European Union and to strengthening our right to intervene."
"In other words we need to participate in the election campaign not as observers or guarantors, but as an intrinsic component in the election campaign in Bosnia, basically saying two things, and of course there should be different spokespersons, not just for the Commission and the Council, but for all the institutions as a whole."
"The first question is this: are we going to commit ourselves as soon as possible to drawing up a full reconstruction programme, a multiannual and renewable ad hoc programme?"
"The second question concerns the fact that our international presence will certainly not be limited to 1996."
"In this respect the voices of the countries and the institutions that unite them should be clearer and more distinct."
"If there is uncertainty about what will happen after the end of 1996 as regards the presence of IFOR in former Yugoslavia, in Bosnia, everything becomes more hazardous and even the commitments to peace with justice, rightly recalled by Mr Oostlander and so many others, become less certain, less sure and perhaps a bit hypocritical, without real impact."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to make it clear that the European Union was the first and last to give help to the countries of the former Yugoslavia in their time of need."
"We are on the spot, and we are also active, and that is certainly all to the good."
"So what really is the problem?"
"Right from the beginning the Members of the European Parliament have pointed out that the reconstruction of these countries cannot be assisted by the traditional methods and strategies of the European Commission."
"The Giansily report highlights the fact that the current aid comes out of ten different budget headings, and this means that different Commission services are trying to coordinate this aid, using different procedures."
"We must also look at this question in the context of the other donors and of coordination with their aid."
"I fear that in many cases aid is coordinated without taking other aid coordination measures into account."
"So what, in my opinion, needs to be done?"
"We need to tighten up the financial aid by means of a legal basis which has yet to be created. That point has already been mentioned."
"The Commission must organize efficient aid, and the process must be speeded up. That point has also been mentioned already."
"Because the current procedure, and the current PHARE process - and we have pointed this out on many occasions - is totally unsuitable."
"Just imagine: with this complicated process of inviting tenders, the time that passes between deciding on a project and implementing it is at least six months, and usually a whole year - and that cannot be regarded as emergency aid for the former Yugoslavia."
"PHARE is negotiated by means of interaction together with the recipient country, with the recipient governments, and individual projects are negotiated with the governments."
"In Bosnia-Herzegovina, elections are imminent."
"The PHARE Programme can therefore be used as an election campaign tool by the present government, and that applies both to choice of project and to the possible delaying of a project."
"Europe has already looked to us once, when there was war in this region."
"Now the tender little shoots of peace have started to grow, and Europe is looking to us again."
"Let us therefore see to it that we take care of those shoots by watering them, by watering them with money, so that they can thrive!"
"Madam President, I have only a minute to tell you how happy I am with these reports, and that I congratulate the rapporteurs, particularly the most political of them, Mr Mendiluce Pereiro."
"Then, a few quick and blunt remarks: elections yes, because that is better than no elections, as long as they are well prepared."
"To postpone them once again would be a setback."
"We must see these elections as a beginning, not as giving up; elections must be held to increase solidarity."
"As for the refugees, it is of course necessary to ensure their return, but not to get rid of them nor to force them; they must be left the choice of aid, but humanitarian aid must be separated from contributions towards reconstruction, which can be conditional, particularly on the arrest of criminals; in other words, we should help the permanent International War Crimes Tribunal whose resources are limited."
"We can do this."
"We should make this aid conditional."
"And then, let us not do everything in a hurry and let us not disappear after the elections."
"We must prepare the European relief force, even when we know that the American troops will leave."
"This is the time to say to ourselves that, after the departure of the American troops, we shall still be needed for a long time."
"Let us show ourselves, we the Europeans, to be capable of making up for what could be interpreted, perhaps even for electoral reasons, as giving up."
"Madam President, I must say that it is always a pleasure to hear the different views expressed."
"I may not entirely agree with some of them, as in this debate when some Members have said how the resources which have been allocated for emergency aid in Yugoslavia should be used for other purposes."
"I will not deny that there are many good ways of using money, and as always it is a question of priorities."
"But when you have visited the area yourself and seen with your own eyes the human suffering which is taking place there every day, then as a human being you have no choice but to hold out a helping hand to those who are asking for it."
"Personally, I think we should be doing much more, but what we are seeing now is at least a beginning."
"The reconstruction of former Yugoslavia is a task which we should start as soon as possible."
"The country is one great pile of bricks."
"In most places, there is no water or electricity and, worst of all, landmines have been laid over large areas - mines which make no distinction between soldiers' boots and children's games."
"The refugees now living in other countries naturally have no wish to go back to a country where people die from going for a walk in the woods and where you have to walk several kilometres to fetch water."
"It must be possible to live in these areas before the refugees can return."
"They must have a future to go back to."
"We need to help make a whole country habitable once again and create a decent life for millions of people."
"We must not make them dependent on our emergency aid: our task is to enable these people to become self-sufficient and to stand on their own feet."
"As vice-chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am concerned about the final management of the resources."
"There is such a great need for this support that it is a crime whenever a single ECU disappears on unnecessary administration and shoddy work, not to mention outright fraud."
"So we must do all we can to check that the aid is reaching those for whom it is intended."
"Madam President, I shall start my contribution to this debate from the conclusion of the mid-term conference held in Florence last week, which had three significant results: in the first place, Florence was the first occasion when all the parties in the conflict agreed to sit down and talk together in the same room and thus mutually recognize each other as essential spokespersons in the peace process."
"That may seem obvious, but it is so far from obvious that Florence was the first time it happened."
"I believe that will be recorded as a significant political fact because recognition is the prerequisite of any peace process."
"No agreement can be stable and followed through if the contracting parties do not actually recognize each other and put mutual trust in each other's good faith and determination to seek peace."
"The second significant result obtained in Florence was to set 14 September as the date for elections preceded by a very important step, the Mostar elections of 30 June."
"Now it is true that setting the date is not in itself a certain guarantee that the elections will take place, but the fact that the date has been set is a spur to all, especially the parties involved in the fighting during these past years, to field all the measures - political, legislative and normative, or operational - necessary to ensure that the election date of 14 September can be kept to."
"In any case, the fact that a date has been set puts pressure on the international community, especially the European Union, to do everything possible to ensure that the people can vote in the autumn and that these elections are an essential factor in strengthening the roots of the peace process."
"The third result, as certain Members have already mentioned, was the signing of the arms and arms control agreement for the region. As we know, it was not possible to sign this agreement just a few days earlier in Oslo and it was only signed in Florence after difficult and lengthy negotiations, but the outcome has been positive."
"I believe this may be another essential and decisive step towards ensuring that the peace process puts down roots."
"Many Members have made the point that the peace process will be long and difficult and it was well-expressed in the introductory report. Of course that is true."
"No peace process is straightforward. Any peace process, all the more so when it comes after four years of war, ethnic cleansing and hatreds that have consumed themselves and often turned into an insuperable inability to communicate, is clearly exposed to obstacles, holdups and risks of reversal."
"And yet, frankly, I do not believe that highlighting problems, difficulties and contradictions which have not occurred means we just take note of them or draw fatalistic conclusions, when we do not know whether this peace process will reach port and succeed."
"The many difficulties should multiply the initiatives, interventions and actions to ensure that these obstacles can be overcome."
"The main difficulties to be faced have already been mentioned."
"There is certainly a problem over the war criminals, who must be brought to justice, and I believe that the international community should make a greater effort and show more determination to do so, because this will create calmer conditions for carrying out the stages already planned, including the elections of 14 September."
"The return of the refugees to their place of origin, their own villages, or, in the beautiful but rather emphatic terms of the Dayton Treaty, their own hearths, is definitely an unresolved problem."
"The return of the refugees is complicated because four years of ethnic cleansing have broken down any mutual trust and destroyed the psychological and cultural assumptions that would ease that return."
"However there must be no surrender to this situation and action must be taken, as gradually and patiently as need be, which is capable of returning the refugees to their original hearths, because this will be the concrete demonstration that the time of ethnic cleansing is finally over and belongs to a past we never wish to see again."
"There is no doubt that it is fundamental - and many Members concentrated on this point - to accelerate reconstruction activity."
"To tell the truth, as some said, it is not really a problem of financial resources: the financial resources are there and they are considerable."
"What is lacking or slow in coming is the capacity to spend them, the operational capacity, the operational instruments capable of using these resources to maximum effect in terms of reconstruction."
"So I think the European Union must provide the impetus to overcome the delays and put in place all the instruments necessary for the funds earmarked to be allocated to their destinations with maximum effectiveness."
"Naturally - and this is a very important political point - when we speak of reconstruction I think we have to recognize that reconstruction is not just a technical matter, it is not just a matter of earmarking a certain amount of money to be spent and setting up projects to reconstruct what the war has destroyed."
"Reconstruction means reconstructing the reasons for living together, the reasons for mutual recognition, the reasons for mutual trust which are not there today and which need to be reconstructed, reconstructing the reasons for cooperation and growing interdependency."
"There is no nostalgia for Yugoslavia involved in emphasizing this."
"Yugoslavia no longer exists and any attempt to re-establish it would be doomed to failure."
"But saying this does not mean thinking peace can be stable and durable without reconstructing a framework of cooperation and interdependence between the states born of the dissolution of former Yugoslavia."
"So in this respect I emphasize the importance of the reconstruction and the European Union's whole strategy for former Yugoslavia and the states born of its dissolution, being characterized by a regional approach, an approach capable of making available to all the states in the region the financial, political and operational instruments necessary to allow reciprocal cooperation to grow. This regional approach aims to build stability founded on growth and development for all the states in the region and on the affirmation of the principles of law, the principles of democracy, and the values of free societies and the market throughout the Balkans."
"From this angle, I regard the decision taken by the General Affairs Council of the European Union, at the last meeting in Luxembourg a few weeks ago, as very important, and I believe this is the clearest and most effective proof of the European Union's determination to act firmly to give the peace process roots and work together to ensure that day by day it becomes a more irreversible process."
"In other words, it seems to me that today Europe, the European Union, has a great opportunity to demonstrate, as it has begun to do, that the European Union can, if it wants to, implement a strategy which will extricate it from the mute powerlessness in which it passively watched the Balkan conflagration when this tragedy first broke."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Assistance to the NIS and Mongolia"
"The next item is the report (A4-0202/96) by Mr Pex, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the outcome of the conciliation procedure provided for in the joint declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 4 March 1975 concerning the joint guideline approved by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Regulation (EURATOM, EC) concerning the provision of assistance to economic reform and recovery in the New Independent States and Mongolia (COM(95)0012 - C4-0242/95-4546/96 - C4-0090/96 - COM(96)213-95/0056(CNS))."
"Madam President, this is the third time I have spoken as rapporteur for TACIS in the Chamber, this time in the presence of the Council of Ministers."
"Before I start I should like to ask the Council to reply to the questions and remarks arising from the debate."
"Because that has never yet happened, at least in the case of TACIS."
"If the Council fails to respond here, as it has done in the past, I shall take that as a clear insult to Parliament."
"The old TACIS regulation lapsed six months ago and there is still no new one."
"The Council could not take a decision at the time it was needed."
"By postponing its decision the Council has got bogged down in the furore over mad cow disease."
"A British veto is now blocking TACIS, a scandalous form of blackmail which hurts the Russians and the other peoples of the CIS, and this just a few days before the elections in Russia."
"So TACIS is now in trouble."
"All the Member States of the European Union repeatedly say that ties between the European Union and the CIS are extremely important and that the CIS must be supported."
"When it comes to the crunch, to continuing TACIS projects, for example, the Council backs out."
"Twice already the European Parliament has responded promptly: to the European Commission proposal on 16 November 1995 and the Council proposal on 19 April 1996."
"In the fifteen months since the European Commission's proposal the Council has not once contacted the European Parliament or its rapporteur to discuss the TACIS regulation."
"On 14 May 1996 the Council requested conciliation, as a matter of urgency, please note."
"It took the Council more than a month to ask for conciliation."
"The Council then had the nerve to request a debate for 6 June, when the normal procedure is three months."
"What does the word conciliation mean in our various languages?"
"What does the word conciliation mean in Italian, Mr President-in-Office?"
"I thought that conciliation meant talking together to see if we can reach agreement on certain points."
"Was it worth seeking agreement between the Council and the EP?"
"The European Parliament put down 36 amendments, of which the European Commission accepted 27, in numerical terms alone an indication that the European Commission regarded Parliament's amendments as not unimportant."
"Perhaps the Commissioner would care to comment?"
"What are these amendments about?"
"First of all there is a set of amendments wanting greater accountability to Parliament on spending."
"Parliament has budgetary powers here, so it is logical that the European Parliament should wish to exercise effective scrutiny over this huge sum of money."
"Why is the Council unwilling to accept any of the amendments dealing with this?"
"Why will the Council not even discuss it?"
"A second series of amendments concern management and specifically the management exercised by the Council through the management committees."
"This is the main bone of contention between Council and Parliament."
"I believe that the work of the Council's management committees is responsible for the poor state of affairs surrounding the TACIS programme."
"Of course, the Council may feel differently about this, but surely, Mr President-in-Office, it is worth talking about it to Parliament."
"If the Council refuses to accept these amendments it will bear full responsibility in future years if the TACIS procedure fails."
"A third series of amendments concerned the improvement of tendering procedures, one of the main factors which hold projects up."
"The manner in which the Council treats Parliament is utterly indefensible."
"The TACIS programme, Mr President-in-Office, includes courses in democracy for the Russians."
"We, as the supposed wise men of the European Union, think the Russians need to learn how to be good democrats."
"Perhaps the members of the Council of Ministers could take a training course in how to apply the principles of parliamentary democracy properly."
"In a way, Madam President, the blackmail perpetrated by the United Kingdom is a blessing in disguise."
"The Council has now won some time, time to hold the conciliation procedure with the European Parliament again."
"I suggest the Council should make use of this chance and make good its earlier omissions."
"Madam President, my report is short and I hope to the point."
"We consider that the conciliation procedure has not really taken place and thus has certainly not been completed."
"The agreements of 4 March 1975 between the Council, Commission and Parliament, pursuant to the Treaty, have not been complied with."
"I note that there is still time to restart the conciliation process."
"I am available to take part in it."
"We need to ensure that we have a TACIS regulation by 1 July so that the TACIS projects which we consider so important do not stagnate."
"Mr President-in-Office, we are currently living in historic times."
"Russia has gone through the first round of its first democratic election and we await the second round."
"Since we are hoping that the development of democracy in Russia and other CIS countries will progress, the approval of this regulation is of the utmost importance."
"It is also important because as a consequence we can enjoy further stability in our neighbouring areas and ensure that this stability remains."
"As a practical tool for this work we have the TACIS programme, the development and improved practical applicability of which is the subject of the regulation amendment now being discussed."
"The Council's consideration of the amendment of the TACIS programme has been inexcusably slow."
"The validity of the old regulation terminated early this year, and a new regulation has still not been enforced."
"Parliament on the other hand has worked within the schedule given, and drawn up a report of its own, the content of which is very good. The Council has however ignored the proposals in the report."
"It is difficult to understand why such an attitude has been adopted, since the amendments proposed by Parliament would have solved the very problems which have come to light on the implementation of the TACIS programme, that is lack of candour and efficiency."
"A speedy acceptance of the TACIS programme is however essential, which should also be the aim of Parliament's efforts."
"I would like to thank Mr Pex for his contribution here today and also for his report."
"The funds reserved for the TACIS programme in the budget should also be used effectively on programmes to ensure an increase in democracy, stability and social equality. Nor should it be forgotten that these programmes should be implemented in co-operation with regional authorities in Russia and other CIS countries."
"The present central position of Moscow in these programmes should be abandoned, and the planning and implementation of the programmes should be transferred to the regions which are in practice carrying out the programmes."
"I would also like to emphasize the importance of ensuring, with this regulation, that the TACIS and Interreg programmes are linked together in border areas."
"In this regard I would like to put a question to the Commissioner."
"In this year's budget an amount equivalent to 30 million ecu was approved by Parliament to be used for furthering cross border co-operation in border areas."
"Why has this money still not been made available?"
"Mr President-in-Office, I must express the deep displeasure of the parliamentary delegation and of the committee responsible, the REX Committee."
"This displeasure is due to two clear things."
"Firstly, the procedure followed by the Council and, secondly, the Council's attitude during this so-called conciliation procedure."
"In my view the Council's approach is totally unacceptable."
"Only a small number of Member States were represented."
"Those Member State representatives who were present were not sufficiently senior to be either willing or able to defend a politically binding position."
"Without the slightest justification the Council imposed a very short time limit on Parliament, this same Council which allows weeks and months to pass before it consults Parliament."
"The worst thing has been and remains the Council's attitude during the conciliation procedure."
"Even before this took place it was rumoured that the Council would in any case not accept or even discuss a single one of the amendments approved by Parliament or any of those approved by the Commission."
"This rumour was confirmed at the start of the conciliation procedure by the acting President-in-Office of the Council, ambassador Cavacini."
"After difficult and protracted deliberations the Council had reached a compromise whereby nothing further could or should be amended."
"This attitude negates the very spirit and letter of the conciliation procedure."
"What is the sense of such a procedure?"
"The Council has made a real joke out of it, a farce, in effect it has insulted Parliament."
"We cannot tolerate that."
"Especially since this kind of attitude on the Council's part places Parliament before a kind of moral dilemma given the understandable and urgent concern which we all have to feel for the countries concerned and their peoples."
"The Council is clearly trading on this and insulting us."
"In those circumstances, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, the conciliation procedure is pointless!"
"If the Council will not or cannot work seriously with Parliament, if it is not prepared to take the slightest account of the views of this popularly elected body, the whole conciliation procedure will have to be revised."
"The criticism that this report levels at the Council, which did not make use of opportunities of reaching agreement with Parliament, has been sufficiently well interpreted, and I fully agree with this criticism."
"However, rather than quarrelling about procedures it seems to me more important to say that the support being given to the New Independent States will only be effective if it is concentrated on the restructuring of public administration so that it can provide efficient services, if the banking systems in the countries concerned start to function, and above all if small and medium-sized structures are strengthened."
"It is therefore sensible, if these objectives are to be achieved, for the Member States to be involved in implementing the measures, because the countries that are being supported have very different requirements as far as support programmes are concerned, and therefore all the Member States will be able to put their own experiences to good use."
"Not only Parliament, but also, and above all, the Council, must be aware that it is not only the TACIS Programme that is needed, but also the strengthening of control over the implementation of the support measures."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, previous speakers have pointed out various important points."
"I should just like to emphasize certain aspects once again."
"If we introduce a process such as the conciliation process, then there must be a reason for that process."
"We are an institution within the European Union, which consists of three conglomerations, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"But if we institutionalize such a process, regardless of what form it takes or how flexible it is, then that process must have sensible and reasonable legitimacy."
"Mr De Clercq has already pointed this out. It is shameful to see how you treat us and how we all, indirectly, treat one another."
"Please, allow this procedure to be taken seriously, as it should be in principle, and allow us to conduct reasonable negotiations!"
"We have made 36 proposals, and 27 of them have been accepted by the Commission."
"Perhaps you accept only six of these proposals, but then at least allow us to talk about these six, or five, or ten, or however many you like."
"And do not come to the conciliation process, like the one we have had, and present us with those proposals that you are not prepared to accept."
"We want to hear about those that you are willing to accept, because those are the ones that we can talk about."
"Only then - and I would ask you to really give this some thought - can the work of the institutions, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, serve the public better."
"We must present our work as serious cooperation, even if, among ourselves, this is purely symbolic."
"Even symbols, as we know, have their serious side."
"Please, let us enter into negotiations once more."
"Let us know which proposals you are able to accept, and you will find that Parliament is willing to listen, and the committees too, as you know, are always willing to listen."
"Please allow us to come up with some serious results."
"Madam President, despite all the aggravation I at least would like to thank Parliament for the fact that it has twice now given an opinion on the draft regulation under extreme pressure of time."
"And as you know, the Commission thinks that your proposals have significantly improved the draft regulation and, as intimated earlier, the Commission is happy to accept 27 out of the 36 amendments approved by the European Parliament."
"For this reason the Commission too is sorry that the Council saw fit to reject all the amendments proposed by the European Parliament and we regret too that the conciliation procedure did not deliver the desired result."
"On top of that, unfortunately, the United Kingdom blocked the approval of the regulation by the General Affairs Council on 10 June for reasons well known to us."
"This sends an extremely negative political signal to the new independent states, especially Russia, which is currently experiencing a politically difficult period."
"And all this may seriously delay implementation of the TACIS programme for 1996."
"It is thus most important that this legal vacuum should be filled and the new regulation approved as quickly as possible."
"The European Parliament and especially its rapporteur, Mr Pex, had the same objectives as the Commission throughout this lengthy process as regards both the substance of the amendments and the timing of the two opinions."
"I repeat, I am very grateful to the Commission and to Parliament for this."
"So I can only hope that the right conditions will shortly be created to enable the new regulation to be implemented."
"Lastly, I think it was Mrs Myller who asked why the money to be spent on cross-border cooperation has not yet been used."
"This is entirely due to the fact that the new regulation has not come into force."
"As you know, that sum is set aside under the new programme of TACIS 1996; nevertheless preparations for its disbursement are already in hand."
"I can tell you that a few weeks ago I myself visited the Russo-Finnish border where a crossborder project of this kind is envisaged to improve significantly communications across the frontier between Finland and Russia."
"It will also clearly serve to promote stability and facilitate considerably the resumption of contacts between the peoples to the east and west of that border."
"Once the regulation has come into effect a start can be made on actually carrying out these projects."
"I recognize that Parliament feels dissatisfaction and indeed irritation towards the Council."
"All I can do is start my speech by repeating Bernadotte's famous remark: I realize everything is against me except your personal kindness."
"In fact, the situation with the TACIS regulation was complex and troubled and it was difficult to establish complete compatibility between a fully transparent procedure and full involvement of all the institutional levels in the decision on the regulation, and the definition of the regulation within a sufficiently short time."
"I would mention that the proof of what I have said lies in the fact that the TACIS regulation was discussed from April 1995 onwards and its definition has already engaged three successive Presidencies of the Council."
"This in itself is indicative of the complexity of the decisions to be taken."
"Of course, it is also clear to honourable Members that adoption of this regulation is extraordinarily important to consolidate the democratic transition in Russia which we all consider essential to stability and security, not only for that country but for the whole of Europe and the whole planet."
"As you will remember, a situation of deadlock had already developed by the end of 1995, because the Council on the one hand and Parliament on the other had gradually developed a series of proposals which appeared to be difficult to reconcile."
"We worked towards a compromise text and the last draft, dating from 29 January, received Council assent, but while taking account of the opinions and suggestions of the Council, it barely takes account of Parliament's proposals because there seemed little room for compromise and consensus."
"You are more familiar than I am with the various points of dissent."
"There was and is dissent as to whether the TACIS funds should be used only for technical assistance or also geared to a policy of investment and financing of infrastructure projects."
"There was discussion as to whether or not to include the environment in the aims of the TACIS regulation."
"Compromises were sought on the principles which regulate the criteria for application of the regulation in relation to actual market conditions."
"An effort was made to identify an acceptable compromise by concentrating TACIS funding finally on strengthening institutions, legislation and training."
"In short, we worked to find a compromise, but undoubtedly that compromise was not such as to include all of Parliament's suggestions."
"Faced with the difficulties which gradually emerged and the new amendments, the Council decided to consult Parliament again and last March, as you know, we asked Parliament to agree to urgent procedure."
"On 19 April, Parliament proposed 36 new amendments, which would have significantly altered the text agreed by the Council the previous January."
"As accepting these amendments would have meant looking at the regulation all over again, re-opening the debate about structure and approach, entering into another lengthy consultation and decision procedure, and this would have further delayed the possibility of implementing the TACIS regulation, the Council did not think it was in a position to accept these amendments."
"I should say that it came to this decision with regret, and in awareness of sacrificing Parliament's absolute right to contribute to the amendment of this regulation, but bowed to the political priority of finally completing all the investigative procedures for this regulation to enter into force as soon as possible. It was also aware that the equilibrium reached with the January compromise was already very fragile and bringing any of it back into discussion would probably have meant difficulty finding another point of equilibrium and another point of consensus."
"That is why we confirmed the text resulting from the January 1996 compromise in the full knowledge that this decision derives primarily from an urgent vote with the aim of putting us in a position to ensure that the TACIS regulation becomes operational and produces the benefits we are all hoping for."
"Naturally this does not alter the fact that, in this case, relations between the Council and Parliament have been difficult and complex, and legitimate proposals and well-founded arguments have been sacrificed."
"But a political judgement had to be made about priorities and a premium was put on urgency."
"Also the progress of the political process in Russia in the last few months and weeks, and the delicacy of the current electoral process, which we naturally all hope will have the same positive outcome as last time, based on the recent first round, require the European Union to complete discussion and procedural preparation of this instrument and move on to making it fully operational."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fassino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Council (B4-566/96)."
"Mr President, I have asked for the floor because I seek guidance from the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Parliament will recall and the record shows that during the last Question Time to the Council I asked a series of questions regarding the Turkish financial cooperation agreement with the European Community."
"I will not summarize these just now because that would take up time from other people's questions."
"The President-in-Office said then that he would return this Question Time and give me the answers which I sought last session but which he was unable to provide at that time."
"Could he please advise me when he will be giving the answers?"
"Will it be before, during or at the end of Question Time?"
"I think I am in a position to reply to Mr Falconer at the end of Question Time."
"Question No 1 by Mr Tillich (H-0443/96)"
"Subject: European voluntary service for young people"
"What fiscal, financial and residence permit arrangements has the Council adopted to enable the pilot project for a European voluntary service year which is endowed with a budget of ECU 15 million under budgetary heading B3-1011 actually to be implemented in 1996?"
"According to the information available to me, no arrangements have yet been made to allow young people to spend a period of more than three months abroad."
"Is this one of a number of problems which have led to the postponement of the action until next year?"
"In reply to the honourable Member I want to make it clear that as of today no proposal for a pilot project for a voluntary youth service has reached the Council."
"I would remind you that the sum of ECU 15 million to which the honourable Member refers was entered into the 1996 budget by the European Parliament under budgetary powers conferred on it by the Treaty, but I repeat, as yet the Council has received no formal proposal on the matter so the accompanying procedures for the project have never been discussed."
"I share the honourable Member's view that an initiative to promote the European Voluntary Service is very important and as soon as the Commission has presented a proposal, the Council will be most ready to examine it."
"As I understand it, the idea for the European voluntary service year for young people arose during the German presidency."
"During the last six months, the Commission has succeeded in drawing up a proposal for this pilot project, naturally with the support of the European Parliament, which has made the necessary financial resources available."
"I am therefore astounded to hear the Council's representative reply that he is not aware of any proposal by the Commission, because I, on the other hand, know of a document stating the Commission's position, in which the latter deplores the fact that certain problems with the Council have not yet been ironed out."
"In my opinion there is a need for clarification here."
"In case the point is not clear, let me explain that the honourable Member is referring to the presumed decision of the German presidency."
"Since then there has been a Spanish presidency. A lot of time has gone by."
"I say presumed because it is one thing to announce a political intention - as the German presidency did at the time - to introduce measures to encourage and promote a form of civil voluntary service, and quite another to prepare concrete proposals of a formal and procedural nature."
"I confirm to you again that the Commission has never put forward proposals on the matter, and the Council does not have its own power of decision but decides on the basis of proposals put forward by the Commission."
"I repeat, it may be useful to ask the Commission to put forward proposals on this matter, and when they are presented the presidency of the Council will examine them."
"Question No 2 by Mr Watson (H-0445/96)"
"Subject: Uniform electoral procedure for elections to the European Parliament"
"What action does the presidency intend to take to ensure that the original commitment of the Treaty of Rome to the establishment of a uniform electoral procedure is honoured before the Treaty of Maastricht is updated?"
"Will the presidency take action to fulfil its Treaty obligation to this Parliament and put an end once and for all to the ridiculous situation whereby Parliament could be elected by 16 different electoral systems in 1999?"
"This is a matter which, as you know, has been the subject of political discussions amongst Europhiles and those concerned about Europe for many years."
"The adoption of a uniform electoral procedure to upgrade the current situation by which each country elects its own representatives to the European Parliament by its own procedure is a recurrent issue."
"And there is no doubt that Article 138, paragraph 3, provides that the Council shall decide unanimously to lay down appropriate provisions to permit the election of Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage in accordance with a uniform procedure in all Member States, on condition, naturally, that this is done by agreement and with the prior assent of the European Parliament and subject to the subsequent adoption of those provisions by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements."
"As I said, this is a recurrent theme which has been discussed many times over the years and was considered at the last General Affairs Council of the French presidency on 10 April 1995 when it had to be recognized that the unanimity amongst Council members that was needed to secure progress on this dossier did not exist."
"The reflection group which carried out the preparatory work for the Intergovernmental Conference included it amongst the institutional reform issues on which the Intergovernmental Conference could and should intervene, without going any further."
"In establishing the programme for the Intergovernmental Conference, the Turin European Council included in the agenda the examination of the composition of the European Parliament and the uniform procedure for electing it."
"At this point it seems to me that the matter is now the prerogative of the Intergovernmental Conference, like many other institutional reform issues."
"The presidency of the Council can only hope that progress will be made in that forum in the direction of a uniform procedure for the election of the European Parliament."
"Does the presidency recognize that this House has a socialist majority purely because of the operation of the United Kingdom's electoral system?"
"The United Kingdom Labour Party took only 45 % of the vote but has 75 % of the United Kingdom's seats here."
"Now a common electoral system as specified in the Treaty of Rome, under proportional representation, would not only end this disgraceful state of affairs, it would also add to pressure for reform of the United Kingdom's domestic voting system so that Europe would no longer have to suffer British governments elected by only 40 % of those who vote in UK national elections and which are so clearly unrepresentative of Britain when it comes to matters European."
"Would the presidency not therefore ensure that this item stays on the agenda of the IGC until we get a resolution?"
"I can only emphasize that the presidency of the Council hopes a solution will be found at the Intergovernmental Conference, not because it is particularly interested in the type of government that rules the destinies of Great Britain, but for an institutional reason which affects the European Union and its future."
"I wonder if the Italian presidency will recognize from the form of this question that this is blatantly a matter of domestic rather than European concern."
"I think the presidency would agree that we have made much progress towards a common system."
"We have Members elected on the basis of a similar electorate, we have elections in all the countries at the same time, and so on."
"What is really being pressed, it seems here, is that the precise method of election should be the same."
"Does not the presidency feel that this would be an intrusion because it would force countries to adopt for one kind of election a system they find quite inappropriate in all the other elections they have?"
"I would like to see every Member elected here on the basis of the commitment and accountability of representing an individual geographical constituency, but I am not so ambitious as to suggest that everybody else should adopt the system I like."
"I am perfectly prepared for each country to continue with the system it prefers."
"While this debate is, of course, very interesting, I must say it is taking a rather questionable turn. But perhaps I may be allowed a personal comment, because one has some discretion when answering questions, not being able to consult the other fifteen members in real time."
"I think the whole constitutional debate that has been going on for years, the debate about the European institutions and the institutional and constitutional debate in progress in many countries on the subject of electoral law, confirm the need for any electoral law to be defined in relation to the type of assembly to be elected. So it seems to me that in considering which electoral law would be best for the European Parliament and how a uniform procedure can be achieved, the essential concern should be the criterion of coherence and compatibility between the electoral system chosen and the assembly elected."
"I doubt whether it would be useful to seek to bend the electoral law of the European Parliament to the internal equilibrium of this or that country, because we are already fifteen, before the end of the century we may well be twenty, and it will be difficult to find an electoral law that works well for the progressives to the detriment of the conservatives or vice versa in every country."
"Furthermore I doubt that it would be useful to establish any correlation between electoral systems with a specific political and institutional history, applying to elections to regional parliaments, regional authorities, or local councils, and the system to be adopted for election to the European Parliament."
"If we want to have a useful and profitable debate rather than a mechanistic one when we discuss the European Parliament and how to elect it, I think it would be wise to deal essentially with the issue of the coherence between the type of assembly the European Parliament represents, with its specific powers and prerogatives, more familiar to you than to me, and the electoral system which best corresponds to such powers and prerogatives."
"I had my hand up for some considerable time before Mr Elliott."
"Therefore I wonder why he was chosen."
"I appreciate the President-in-Office of the Council's answers and particularly the reply to Mr Elliott."
"It shows that he is not accepting this imposition of Stalinist/Liberal views across the whole of Europe."
"I appreciate that entirely."
"It is a queer view for Liberals to adopt in these circumstances."
"But turning to the question of 'ridiculous systems' ."
"Can he advise us of what he regards as 'ridiculous systems' ?"
"Does he think, for example, the PR system which operates in Germany and has produced over one million spoilt ballot papers thus defranchising one million people is ridiculous?"
"Does he think that the PR system in France which has resulted in two million spoilt ballot papers is a bit ridiculous?"
"Or does he think that the system in his own country, Italy, which has produced over seven million spoilt ballot papers - almost the population of London - is a bit ridiculous?"
"That is what Mr Watson and his ilk are trying to impose upon the rest of us."
"The United Kingdom has a clear record of the lowest number of spoilt ballot papers when people go to vote."
"They understand the system."
"They know what they are voting for."
"(Mr von Habsburg spoke without a microphone)"
"Anything is possible, but we do have a strict rule which only allows two other speeches, two supplementary questions, after the Council's reply."
"As there are a great many questions, we can only succeed in dealing with some of them, so if we dwell on just one question we deprive many Members of the chance of a reply from the Council."
"I therefore ask everyone to show a little tolerance and indeed fairness towards other Members."
"Mr President, I simply wish to remind you that an agreement exists whereby supplementary questions should be put by Members belonging to different political groups. That has not been the case here."
"I am grateful to Mr von Habsburg, but I should explain that I had called Mr Imaz, who represents a different party from the previous speaker, but then he withdrew at the last minute."
"As no-one else wanted to speak I gave Mr Falconer the floor."
"Mr von Habsburg's objection is correct, however."
"Question No 3 by Mr Papakyriazis (H-0509/96)."
"Subject: Blocking of EU business by the UK"
"During the past month the UK Government has blocked a series of decisions (on European Year against Racism, equal participation of men and women in decision-taking, the simplification of Community legislation, the protection of the economic interests of the Community, etc.) by invoking national interests to an unwarranted degree."
"Will the Council say whether it will allow a Member State virtually to paralyse EU business by preventing all decision-taking and jeopardizing by its behaviour the attainment of Treaty objectives?"
"What developments does it foresee?"
"How will it address this situation and what measures does it intend to take?"
"This matter has been widely discussed this week in all Community settings and has been debated in the European Parliament on several occasions, including this morning with the communications from President Santer and President Dini."
"Clearly the crisis over BSE goes far beyond the disease itself, and there is a delicate balance to be established between the general interests of the Union and the specific legitimate interests of one of its Members."
"Obviously such balance and compatibility was relatively easy to find when there were only six Members of the European Community. But gradually the European Union has enlarged from six to nine, from nine to twelve, from twelve to fifteen, and before the end of the century we will be twenty or twenty-four."
"As the number of parties to decisions that must be taken increases, it becomes increasingly complicated to achieve compatibility and convergence around a general interest of all the players. It becomes increasingly probable that someone will express interests and sustain positions, quite legitimate from a national point of view, which make decisions very difficult."
"It seems to me, then, that this is the real issue raised by the mad cow crisis."
"It is no accident that one of the main items on the agenda at the Intergovernmental Conference is the reform of the decision-making mechanisms, and in particular how to move from unanimous decisions to majority decisions, recognizing that it will still be necessary to secure compatibility between the capacity of the Union to make its actions by majority decision effective, and preventing this from becoming an imposition on those supporting a different position."
"Having stated the problem - and I do so because I do not want to minimize it or take a one-sided attitude - the presidency of the Council also believes, as the question suggests, that the British attitude is frankly rather incomprehensible."
"In fact, while it may be legitimate to stand up for national interests which Great Britain regards as overwhelmingly important, it is less legitimate to convert this into a strategy of general noncooperation and paralyse Union decision-making across a wide range of areas totally unrelated to the issue of BSE."
"British non-cooperation blocked the EUROPOL Convention when it might have gone through, and the adoption of the TACIS regulation we were talking about just now."
"Perhaps the position is changing, as in the last few hours the British government appears to have dropped its opposition to signing the cooperation agreements with Chile and Uzbekistan, due to take place in Florence."
"This is definitely a positive move, but it comes at the last minute and only a few days ago it looked as if this would be blocked as well."
"European Year against Racism and Xenophobia and the commission that would consequently have been set up has in any case been blocked, along with a thousand other dossiers."
"Naturally such an attitude is dangerous and worrying and a growing embarrassment to Europe."
"That is why the Italian presidency made an oral statement in the Council, and in view of the delicacy of the issue I will give you the full details."
"First the presidency expresses regret at the continuation of the British government's attitude of non-cooperation inasmuch as it affects the adoption of initiatives necessary to ensure the ordinary progress of Community business, and urgent initiatives of the highest importance."
"Secondly, the presidency considers this attitude harmful to the interests of the countries of the Union and also likely to be counterproductive for the United Kingdom itself, in that it could cause irritation in Member States and impair the maintenance of that climate of confidence and cooperation necessary to achieving agreement between the various delegations in all the main sectors of Community business."
"Thirdly, in addition to appealing once again to the British government's spirit of reasonableness and cooperation, the presidency calls on all the Member States to respect the wording of Article 5 of the Treaty, by which Member States shall abstain from any measure which could jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty."
"We can only hope, and we are encouraged by the partial progress, mentioned this morning, in the search for an agreement on the mad cow crisis, that the British government will gradually adopt a more flexible attitude, which will lead to an end to the deadlock of the last few weeks."
"I am very grateful to the President -in-Office for his detailed and extensive answer, and I consider it satisfactory."
"However, in the light of the high-level debate this morning and the decision taken by such an overwhelming - some might say, crushing - majority, I just want to say that when I tabled this question on 5 June I could not have imagined, no matter how great my powers of forecasting, that the issue would have reached its present pass."
"All of this goes to show, Mr President-in-Office, that, yes, there really is an institutional issue."
"I respect absolutely and agree with your academic and general political appraisal. But that is not the issue here."
"The issue is that things specific and things general, for example, the Florence Summit and the intergovernmental conference, are going on under the shadow of the problem created by the government of Mr Major."
"It is not just a general political matter any more, nor, certainly, an academic institutional issue. It is, rather, a question of options and decisions."
"Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I am concerned for my fellow-Europeans in the British Isles."
"I am concerned for my fellow-Europeans across the whole of the European Union, and for the people of the whole world."
"Permit me to say, as a professor of medicine, that I understand the problems stemming from mad cow disease."
"But that is not the issue."
"The issue facing us is what to do about this dangerous paralysis of our general functioning."
"I would appreciate a further comment from you, Mr President-in-Office, beyond the resolution that you read to us at the end and about which I am glad; a further statement from you as to whether specific decisions have been taken, such as on exploring the possibility, with the Commission, of taking the matter to the European Court."
"Because from time to time certain countries have, in fact, been habitually, and unjustifiably, depicted as the black sheep of the European Union."
"But anyway, I, for my part, do not want to view the government of Mr Major as the black cow of the European Union."
"I refer to what President Dini said here this morning."
"We hope the way forward to solving the BSE problem will be determined in the next few hours, ending the current state of paralysis and deadlock and allowing the United Kingdom to replace non-cooperation with a more flexible attitude. If this does not happen, we believe that Florence, only forty-eight hours away, and with all the Heads of State and of Government present, will provide an authoritative political setting for examining the problem and deciding on any subsequent steps."
"I raised the matter this morning with President Dini, then with President Santer."
"Of course, neither has replied."
"I now make a third attempt: why, faced with such an attitude, one that you yourself have just described as totally contrary to the spirit of the Treaty, do we not recognize that we find ourselves confronted by a position that can be likened to abstention?"
"In the present very specific case, the British position is a non position, and therefore an abstention, which legitimately authorizes you to take decisions that are completely valid."
"It is up to Great Britain to go before the Court of Justice to have these decisions ruled to be invalid."
"We wish them good luck."
"Why do you not do this?"
"And what arguments have your lawyers so far advanced against this proposal?"
"In principle there are no legal obstacles to using the instrument Parliament is calling for."
"But political judgement is what is needed."
"The British attitude of non-cooperation has aroused great tension in the Union."
"We want this state of tension ended and perhaps this can be done through an agreement based on political logic."
"I think what you are asking for should be a last resort, and before we reach that point we are trying to resolve the matter through persuasion."
"That is the view of the presidency of the Council."
"I do not think recourse to the Court of Justice would calm the situation down, it would just make everything more complicated and tense."
"Politics is the art of negotiation!"
"Mr President, I believe that Mr Herman has presented the issue in its proper terms."
"I welcomed the statement this morning by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Dini, and I welcome Mr Fassino's interpretation of the issue."
"I think that Mr Fassino is right when he says that this is a political matter, but that it also has a legal aspect."
"And there is some truth in what Mr Herman has just said."
"If the government of the United Kingdom is violating Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, there are two possibilities: either the Council - or the Commission, since this also seems to be the Commission's viewpoint - can appeal to the Court of Justice to declare the British Government's action illegal; or the Council can simply declare that the British delegation has voted against a given decision."
"There are two possibilities, therefore, but I believe that the President-in-Office is also right when he says that this is above all a political matter for the moment, but that the legal aspect also has to be taken into account."
"In any event, I believe that this issue is beginning to be addressed in its proper legal terms."
"I can only reiterate what I have said."
"I am not saying this idea is not based on a legitimate legal approach. I recognize that it is and we may even get to the point where we have to use that instrument."
"But I repeat that I feel it should be the last resort and, above all, follow evaluation the immediate contingencies."
"Mediation is in progress to reach an agreement, and the European Council meets in forty-eight hours. In view of these two considerations, I think we should assess, in Florence, whether the deadlock is over, and if it is not, everyone best able to take the most appropriate decision will be there, so that is the place to consider what to do next."
"Question No 4 by Mr Newens (H-0404/96)"
"Subject: Freedom of the press"
"In view of the threats to freedom of the press which are implicit in the policy increasingly adopted by large media distribution companies of refusing to handle publications with limited circulation, what action can the Council take to prevent discrimination against such publications?"
"This is an issue of enormous significance."
"As we all know, information and full freedom of expression through information channels of every kind is of the utmost importance in today's modern society."
"Obviously we all agree that plurality of information is and must remain a fundamental principle of the state of law and democracy in our countries and in every country."
"It is implicit in the concept of plurality of information that every effort should be made to prevent cultural decline or any impoverishment in the range of information media either through simple market forces or worse, through inadequate or faulty legislation."
"In Europe we are witnessing an apparently contradictory phenomenon - I emphasize apparently, because the range of cultural information media has never grown so fast as in recent years. One need only think of the quantity of newspaper titles and of publishing houses of every type and quality which have flourished lately."
"But on the other hand there is recognition in all the countries of the inadequacy of legislation and financial support effectively ensuring pluralism in information, above all that provided by small and medium-sized newspapers."
"I think it goes without saying that it is in the interests of the European Union and all its bodies, including the presidency of the Council, to do their utmost to take all necessary and useful steps to ensure full pluralism of information."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"I should really like to have it in English so it would be available for outside information."
"However it really does not deal with the problem because what we are asking is what action can the Council take to prevent discrimination against such publications."
"At present too few publications with limited circulation are handled by large media distribution companies and if we allow those that are available to vanish from the shelves it will be a sad state of affairs."
"Therefore, I share the President-in-Office's views on these matters."
"The reality is that mergers and acquisitions are putting enormous power in the hands of distributors and newspaper publishers which means that these two cartels working together can shift magazines and newspapers off the shelves at a whim."
"They will place other magazines, for example pornographic magazines and other obscene literature - and I mean obscene political literature as well as obscenity in the human decency sense - but they will prevent the distribution of political magazines considered reasonable in any civilized society."
"So we are asking what action can the Council take in these matters?"
"I have no difficulty in agreeing with the honourable Member on the need he raises, but I would like to emphasize that under Article 155 of the Treaty it is up to the Commission to monitor the application of the Treaty provisions and the measures taken by the institutions pursuant thereto."
"So it is the responsibility of the Commission, not the Council, to monitor existing regulations, including regulations relating to information, and it is the Commission which should bring forward proposals."
"The Council can only agree with the need raised by the honourable Member and hope to receive proposals from the Commission."

"Question No 6 by Mr Theonas (H-0407/96)"
"Subject: Tension in Kosovo"
"The recent bomb attacks carried out in the suburbs of Pristina by Albanian-speaking groups and the clashes in north-eastern Bosnia between Muslims and Bosnian Serbs are reviving sources of tension and giving justifiable cause for concern that the region is once more about to erupt."
"The heightened tension in Kosovo is giving rise again to the disquiet engendered by the Dayton Accord, which is so vague in many respects and fails to address significant territorial and constitutional issues that it is unsure whether it will be observed and doubtful whether it can contribute to a genuine and stable peace in the region."
"Will the Council take steps to secure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the region so that the local communities can resolve their differences by peaceful means and on just terms, on a genuinely equal footing and without foreign intervention, in order to prevent the rekindling of hostilities and the creation of further flash points?"
"This is a very delicate issue and of course a very important one."
"We all know that for years there has been an unresolved problem about protecting the rights of the majority Albanian population living in the Kosovo region."
"Now I do not want to enter into a general discussion and will naturally restrict myself to the terms of the question."
"The honourable Member makes explicit reference to the Dayton agreement."
"Well, I want to emphasize - I do not know whether it is right or not, but I will start from this point - that the Dayton agreement covers the re-establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the situation in Kosovo and in other possible flashpoints in the region is not directly governed by the Dayton and Paris agreements."
"It is clear, however - it escapes no-one, it did not escape those who signed the peace in Dayton, nor does it escape anyone in this Chamber - that stability and peace in the Balkans depends not only on full respect for what was said and signed up to in Dayton but also on a policy to guarantee the rights of all the ethnic, religious and national communities throughout the Balkan region."
"Kosovo has long been a flashpoint."
"This Parliament and the presidency of the Council, in the various presidencies that have followed each other, have frequently expressed concern about the situation in Kosovo, through many periods of tension, if not open repression of the Albanian population."
"I confirm what has been confirmed on many previous occasions by the Council and what has been said in numerous statements of the European Parliament, which is that the request to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to conform to the principles of international law established by the Paris Charter and by the international conventions on the rights of minority communities to full protection and respect for the rights of the Albanians in Kosovo."
"I would further mention that the situation in Kosovo is being formally monitored by the working group on minorities in former Yugoslavia, chaired by Mr Lutz within the peace mission which is currently managed by the High Representative of the European Union, Carl Bildt."
"I would mention that it was formally established that the condition of a progressive improvement in relations between the European Union and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is full respect for human rights, minority rights and the right to return of all refugees and displaced persons, as well as granting a large degree of autonomy to Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"During the visit that President Santer and President Dini made to the capitals of the principal states of the region on 7 and 8 June last, they once again impressed on the Belgrade government the delicacy of the problem and the need for Belgrade to comply with that criterion if relations with the European Union are to progress."
"This was also discussed a few days ago at the Florence International Conference, and it is the task of the presidency of the Council to act, in agreement and in concert with the other bodies of the Union, so that the rights of the Kosovo Albanians can be respected and a solution found to the problem which guarantees respect for the rights of minorities and protection of the individual and collective rights of those who live in that region."
"I am grateful to the President-in-Office, at least for the length of his answer."
"However, I would like to point out that while the Dayton Accord has no applicability to the problem in Kosovo, its general spirit may, I believe, be influencing the situation that is developing there, if one takes account of recent events in Albania itself, the approach of the Albanian Government to the situation in the region and the general climate of hostility towards the Serbs."
"I think it ought to be stressed that the rights of minorities also include the rights of the Serb population of Kosovo, and we cannot accept that those people should have to suffer acts of terrorism, without so much, furthermore, as a word of sympathy from us for the victims of such acts."
"So I think that we should be careful and that the European Union should be doing whatever it can, on the basis of the spirit of the Dayton Accord, to prevent the creation of a source of tension in Kosovo which could take the war further south in the Balkans."
"I agree with the points that have been made. It is true, of course - and I said so myself - that even if the Kosovo case is not specifically mentioned in the Dayton agreements, the application of these agreements requires a wider framework of stability which also means working for a solution in Kosovo."
"I agree with that evaluation and I confirm the commitment of the presidency of the Council to take action in all settings to encourage a solution."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first of all I should like to thank you for your clear answers."
"However, in connection with Kosovo I should like to make one comment."
"You have read out to us some very fine-sounding statements, containing demands that human rights should finally be respected."
"But we have a credibility problem here, because we have threatened all manner of things, but have not really taken any serious action."
"Do you not think, Mr President-in-Office, that it is high time to set a real example in Kosovo, in other words to stand up, credibly, for the right of self-determination, or at least for the protection of the Albanian majority, so that the European Union will at least be standing up for something in earnest?"
"On the one hand we issue statements, but on the other hand the sanctions are increasingly being relaxed, and the Serbs continue their provocative behaviour."
"They are just laughing at us!"
"Mr President-in-Office, it is vital that we should regain our credibility."
"Do you not think that this would be a good opportunity?"
"I agree with you, I think you are right. The challenge is, of course, to do it more effectively."
"There is no doubt that determined and clear action must be taken against Belgrade to make explicit the disquiet and dissatisfaction of the international community about the current position of the Albanians living in Kosovo, nor is there any doubt that we must go further than words because those words must be followed up with political deeds which change the situation."
"It is a matter of achieving maximum effectiveness."
"I am not going to pretend that it is not complicated and difficult to protect the Kosovo Albanians, especially after these four years of war in Bosnia and throughout former Yugoslavia."
"Obviously the tension, conflict and open warfare in the area has made everything more complex and difficult and has certainly not made things any easier for Kosovo and the Albanians who live there either."
"In any case I agree with you, and the presidency of the Council is determined to deal with this problem in a credible way."
"Mr President, the collapse of Yugoslavia was triggered in Kosovo by the major deployment there of a million Serbs in 1989, and by the abolition of autonomy."
"So why has Kosovo retreated into the background?"
"Because the Albanians of Kosovo, who are not a minority, but rather the majority in Kosovo, did not use force, but deliberately chose non-violent means."
"I see a very dangerous development here."
"If this majority, the Albanian majority, is punished because it chose non-violent methods, then this will send the message that violence is necessary in this region."
"I therefore take the view that we should have a Kosovo Conference of our own, since Kosovo was omitted by mistake from the list of conditions for the recognition of what remains of Yugoslavia."
"In addition, I believe that elections should be held there in the presence of international observers."
"I think there is an urgent need for action here, before catastrophe strikes."
"So far, this has only been done in one case, that of Macedonia, and in that case it was helpful."
"We really ought to take preventive measures, because otherwise violence will flare up again there, and will spread like wildfire."
"It is absolutely true that one of the initial flashpoints of this Balkan crisis was Kosovo: the repression of Kosovo and the abolition of Vojvodina's autonomy originated the crisis in former Yugoslavia."
"It is by no means a marginal flashpoint and obviously not just a consequence of the events of the last few years."
"In fact it has been a flashpoint for a long time."
"We are all well aware of Twentieth Century history: the problems of the Albanians and Kosovo have repeatedly sparked conflict and tension."
"It seems to me that all this should increase our determination to work towards a political solution to the problem."
"As the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses."
"Question No 8 by Mr Lomas (H-0410/96)"
"Subject: Death of Mr HUSEYIN KOKU"
"Will the Council please press the appropriate Turkish authorities for information regarding the death of Mr Huseyin Koku, who was arrested in Elbiston on 20 October 1994?"
"Nothing further was heard of the prisoner until 27 April 1995 when the police advised his wife that his body had been found."
"No details have ever been given to his wife and family."
"I will reply to this question in two parts."
"While certain rather inadequate information has come to the attention of the Council about the specific case raised, this event and the difficulties the presidency of the Council has encountered in obtaining any details, in my opinion confirm the delicacy of the situation in Turkey and the need for the presidency of the Council and the European Union more generally to put all possible pressure on the Turkish government to guarantee the respect for human rights, fundamental democratic rights and principles of the rule of law that governs the life of the Union. These are prior conditions for a country to become part of the Union or, as in the case of Turkey, have a special relationship with it, and of course Turkey and the European Union have signed a customs union agreement."
"I would also mention that the criterion of full respect for the principles of the rule of law by all those who are either members of the European Union or have established relationships of cooperation or association with the European Union, was confirmed at the Barcelona Conference and in the final declaration of the Ravello Mediterranean Forum, and has frequently been confirmed during contacts and at meetings between the European Union and the Turkish government."
"But while pressure from the European Union and the international community has achieved some results, such as the partial modification of the constitution in the direction of greater respect for fundamental democratic rights and principles, we do not think we can lower our guard yet, and the presidency of the Council remains faithful to its commitment to maintain vigilance and pressure on Turkey and every other country which violates human rights."
"I am sure the Council will appreciate the anguish of the family of this murdered man."
"I do not think they would use the term 'delicacy' , as the Council did."
"The last time they saw him alive he was in police custody."
"Now, of course, we know, regrettably, that it is all too common in Turkey for the police and the military to murder its citizens."
"But just general condemnation - while that has to be made - is really not sufficient."
"I ask the Council to ask the Turkish Government - particularly in view of the fact that we now have this customs union which, we were told, would improve human rights in Turkey - whether it would institute a proper inquiry into how a man can die while in police custody and then his body be produced six months later, told it was found in some wood somewhere and the police had nothing to do with it."
"It is just so blatantly unlikely."
"I ask Council to press this specific case, rather than just make generalized condemnations."
"I do accept the request to press for a specific enquiry into this case, and I agree with the honourable Member that signing the customs union treaty with Turkey not only does not exempt Europe from vigilance, but if anything requires it to be even more vigilant."
"I have already spoken on the subject, but I will spend a few more moments confirming my conviction that when the European Union signed the agreement on a customs union with Turkey, after a very complex and lengthy debate to which this Parliament made a wide-ranging contribution, it did not do so because certain problems of law and democracy in Turkey had been overcome, but for quite the opposite reason. Aware of the existence of problems of law and democracy in Turkey, the European Union considered that a strong European anchorage would be the best way of influencing that country to resolve these problems positively and overcome the limits and contradictions relating to democracy and rights that still exist."
"To put it more clearly, when there are unresolved problems of democracy and law in a country, there is a choice between two opposite strategies, both legitimate, both well-founded: one accentuates political, economic and all forms of isolation; the other creates a kind of democratic contamination and anchorage which forces that country to change."
"The European Union has not chosen a policy of isolation towards Turkey, which might not have been effective, but taken the line of democratic contamination and anchorage, in the hope that the more Turkey is integrated into Europe, the closer it will become to Europe and the more it will be induced to adopt European standards as regards democratic rights."
"Naturally this is not just a hope, it is a goal the European Union is working towards by bringing pressure to bear in every necessary way."
"Mr President, this is just one example that the questioner has raised concerning the situation in Turkey."
"A habitat conference was held very recently in Turkey which also demonstrated police methods of dealing with their Kurdish and Turkish fellow citizens."
"I would like to ask whether the Council does not draw any conclusions from the judgement which Mr Fassino says the Council made in connection with the customs union agreement with Turkey."
"The judgement was, after all, as you say, that it was better to allow Turkey to conclude an agreement and to exert influence in that way."
"Several months have now elapsed."
"Have any of us and have you in the Council seen any improvement in conditions as regards human rights, democracy and freedom of expression?"
"I have not seen any such thing."
"Finally, I should like to ask the following question: if there is no improvement - and this was a requirement set by Parliament and the EU in connection with the customs union agreement with Turkey - is the Council prepared to tear up the customs union agreement with Turkey?"
"No, I do not think that interpretation can be put on my position and I do not believe that is the intention of the European Union."
"The argument is not of a purely legal nature and there are no suspensive conditions to be interpreted in legal terms. We have to make a political judgement."
"When Europe chose to sign the customs union agreement with Turkey - after a very difficult debate, I repeat - it did so in the conviction that involving Turkey in the life of the European Union and providing a stronger European anchorage would lead that country to adopt European standards especially on democracy and human rights."
"Now that the judgement has been made, the European Union feels committed to apply all forms of pressure and persuasion to ensure that the Turkish government does adopt policies better geared to full democracy."
"Naturally, if we then find ourselves greeted with a deaf ear, the fears honourable Members have expressed will be proved right, but at this stage I think we should continue to act positively to obtain from the Turkish government those guarantees which have been lacking up to now."
"Mr President, I understand that you are refusing me the right to ask a supplementary question to the Council on the basis of the question tabled by Mr Lomas because I previously asked a supplementary question to another question to the Council."
"There is nothing in the Rules which prohibits this."
"This decision is based on an interpretation of what is written there by the staff sitting on your left-hand side."
"Mr President, that is wrong."
"Therefore, I ask you to refer this matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, because what you are saying is that it is acceptable for Members to come here and ask their own particular questions and then leave whilst the rest of us - who have an interest in a variety of subjects - are denied the right to ask a supplementary question which is of interest to the Member who asked the question in the first place."
"The Rules of Procedure are very rigid on this point."
"I welcome Mr Falconer's suggestion that it be referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities for amendment."
"But that relates to the general right to ask questions."
"You have already asked one and I am therefore constrained not only by the Rules but by the many questions tabled by colleagues long ago which will unfortunately not be answered because those present are taking up their time and refusing them the floor."
"But I will put the question to the Committee on the Rules, Mr Falconer."
"Now we must move on to the next question."
"Question No 9 by Mr Kranidiotis (H-0415/96)"
"Subject: The Di Roberto report on Cyprus"
"In January the Italian presidency appointed Ambassador Di Roberto as its special representative on Cyprus."
"Mr Di Roberto visited the parties concerned, heard their points of view and in April submitted his report to the Council."
"Can the Council provide more information on the Di Roberto report, the response of the parties concerned, his recent contacts and activities and proposals to continue and upgrade his mission in view of the forthcoming assumption by Ireland of the presidency of the Council?"
"This is another particularly delicate political issue."
"We all know that the Cyprus question has dragged on for years and successive presidencies of the European Union have attempted mediation to reach a solution, but so have the United Nations and various governments, in particular the government of the United States."
"Ambassador Di Roberto has made numerous missions to Cyprus and the principal capitals of the European Union on behalf of the Italian presidency, and has also kept in touch with the principal governments interested in resolving this crisis, including the United States government."
"I have been asked for a report on the situation, so I want to mention, if only in summary, all the work Ambassador Di Roberto has done so far. It will be continued in the next term, no longer by Ambassador Di Roberto but by a special representative of the Irish presidency who has already been named."
"Ambassador Di Roberto has made progress in several areas. On security, which is regarded as an essential priority by both sides, the Turkish Cypriots have confirmed their position on the validity of the treaty of guarantee signed some time ago, while President Cleribes has on occasion been open to and interested in the hypothesis of demilitarization, coupled with the presence of a multinational force."
"As regards the institutions, the United Nations resolution calls for the establishment of a federation with single citizenship based on the principles of bizonality, bicommunality and political equality between the two parties, and these points are maintained."
"But although that is accepted in principle by both parties, the efforts to achieve it have not yet produced tangible results, in fact there are fears on one side that it would result in some kind of recognition of Turkish Cypriot identity and on the other that a unified island would not give the Turkish Cypriots proper guarantees."
"President Cleribes has mentioned a transition period for implementing freedom of movement for all Cypriot citizens on the reunified island, and another proposal put forward by the Turkish Cypriots, for a cantonal structure for the island, should also be looked at carefully."
"As regards the renewal of the dialogue between the two communities, despite many difficulties the Turkish Cypriot leadership recently confirmed again that it was ready to renew interinstitutional dialogue without preconditions."
"Traditionally Turkey is not in favour of a European Union role in Cyprus, but there is a hint that Ankara might recognize a role of facilitator to the Union. Coordination between the European Union and the United States remains crucial to any solution."
"As I said just now, we understand that the Irish presidency intends to take Ambassador Di Roberto's work forward, and an Irish diplomat has already been identified as its personal representative with mediation functions."
"Obviously the Irish presidency will need to continue the action carried out in these six months by the Italian presidency and operate in close contact with the troika to monitor every possibility of a solution."
"I would also mention that while positive, if only indirect, cooperation towards a solution to the situation still does not strike me as imminent, this could develop out of implementation of the activities planned by the EuroMediterranean Partenariat as agreed at Barcelona."
"I am grateful to the President-in-Office for his answer."
"However, I am sorry to have to say that the results of the Di Roberto mission fall short of our expectations."
"I appreciate the difficulties faced by the Italian presidency and by Mr Di Roberto himself. Despite their good intentions, they were unable to achieve any progress because of the opposition of certain other Member States which had embarked on initiatives of their own which, in the final analysis, served to undermine the Italian presidency's initiative."
"Nevertheless, I am glad that the Irish presidency intends to continue with this initiative."
"I want to say something else, however, and to ask about the following. As you know, the European Parliament believes, and has stated in a resolution, that the European Union should undertake a comprehensive initiative to find a solution to the Cyprus problem; an initiative in the form of a joint action, as opposed to a mission by a representative of the presidency simply to monitor the Cyprus situation."
"We believe that the time is now right for the European Union to assume its responsibilities and to embark on a joint action, which should include appointing a coordinator for Cyprus and developing ideas for a number of cooperation programmes to involve Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and also - why not - formulating a proposal for a solution to the Cyprus problem based on the resolutions of the United Nations and, in view of the fact that Cyprus is due to move towards accession to the European Union, on the Community legal order."
"It has been agreed that Cyprus will be included in the next enlargement and that negotiations with it will begin six months after the end of the intergovernmental conference."
"Naturally I can only concur with the demand for a wider and more effective initiative, and it will obviously be up to the Irish presidency to see how practicable this is and implement it."
"If I may make a point, which is as valid for this situation as for any other conflict situation, at least in this case, at least at this stage, we are not dealing with a bloody conflict but with a political conflict, even if it has a bloody past."
"It has to be said that mediation can only be effective when the parties to the conflict are reasonably ready for it. Peace can never be imposed from outside, it has to come from within."
"Until those who are making war become convinced that it is better to make peace, the war will not end."
"That is true of any type of conflict. So the international community must try to find a method of mediation and intervention and cannot be a passive witness or play a waiting game."
"I certainly welcome the request from the honourable Member because it would mean a leap forward in the European Union's initiative, but I emphasize that in Cyprus, as in so many other situations, mediation has been hampered by persistent and obstinate refusal to listen and be receptive to the points put forward by any mediator."
"We hope things will improve in the future."
"I, too, wish to thank the President-in-Office."
"I would like to say first of all that we in this Parliament viewed Mr Di Roberto's appointment as mediator, as the representative of the presidency in the search for a solution to the Cyprus problem, as a very positive step."
"I regard the intention of the Irish presidency to continue with the initiative as equally positive."
"I would, however, like to ask the President-in-Office whether Mr Di Roberto's mission brought any actual gain which can further the work of the new, Irish presidency, mediator."
"And something else: during the period of Mr Di Roberto's mission, we had the statements from Denktash, of which you will be aware, about the fate of the missing Greek Cypriots in Cyprus."
"Did Mr Di Roberto himself deal with that question, and what does his report say, if, in fact, he has submitted a report?"
"Ambassador Di Roberto has naturally accumulated a vast amount of information which is summarized in a report presented to the General Affairs Council, and in an updated version to COREPER."
"The fifteen countries of the Union therefore have all the information they need to assess the situation and this provides the acquis which will be the starting point for the Irish presidency to pursue mediation and also deal with the problem of those who have disappeared."
"I just wish the House to know that I will remain here for this particular purpose."
"By your absurd ruling based on the absurd advice you received from the staff next to you - nice persons though they are - you have denied representatives of this House the opportunity to ask a second supplementary question."
"I hope that has been entered in the record."
"Question No 10 by Mr Vieira (H-0418/96)"
"Subject: Poseima"
"Poseima is a wide-ranging programme for the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores."
"It includes various measures which have quite rightly been of benefit to agriculture, fisheries, handicrafts, energy, consumers, the environment, taxation, etc."
"I imagine that the Commission will seek to ensure that this programme is continued, if only because the text establishing it makes no general reference to expiry dates."
"However, in some cases, the periods for the granting of aid are stipulated, e.g. in the case of the extra cost of the maritime transport of petroleum products."
"Poseima should also cover other products with a major impact on the economy of these outermost regions, e.g. agricultural fertilizers, building materials (cement, timber, roofing materials, glass, etc.) and components of livestock feedingstuffs, which have so far not been covered."
"Does the Council plan to improve the effectiveness of Poseima by continuing to support the extra cost of the transport of petroleum products, extending the expiry dates for other products and including additional products essential to the economy such as those mentioned above?"
"The Council naturally concurs with the analysis the honourable Member has set out in the question as to the usefulness of the Poseima programme, launched in 1991 to overcome the distance and insular nature of Madeira and the Azores."
"But we must point out, as we have already said in other cases, that it is up to the Commission to present proposals to us on the subject and so far the Commission has not submitted any proposal to the Council designed to extend the deadlines or widen the existing measures to other products not already governed by the existing rules."
"So while in general nothing prevents the points in Mr Vieira's question being taken up, it is up to the Commission to draw up a proposal covering them and submit it to the Council, and that has not happened yet."
"Mr President, I thank the Council for its explanations but I think it strange that the Commission should not have referred yet to the Council, for example, for financial support for the extra cost of petrol products up to 1994."
"I should also like the Council to tell me whether the feeling is that this programme will continue beyond 1999 or whether there might be an objection to continuing this programme which, I repeat, has been very useful indeed for the peripheral regions of the Azores and Madeira."
"It may well be strange that the Commission has not put forward proposals, but that is the case. What else can I say?"
"The Commission has not put forward proposals on the issues raised in your question."
"If the Commission will put them forward, and also give the reasons for them, then in principle nothing prevents the Council examining and welcoming them positively."
"But it is not up to the Council to present the proposals or justify them, it is up to the Commission, so I agree with you on the need to ask the Commission."
"There is something else I should say: when situations like this occur - and we have already had others - the European Parliament has many more ways of putting pressure on the Commission than the Council to progress certain proposals."
"I say this because the inadequacy of the European Parliament's powers is a recurrent issue. There is no question that the European Parliament has insufficient powers and everyone knows that the Italian presidency has fought and is fighting in the Intergovernmental Conference for greater powers for Parliament, but there is no doubt that Parliament and individual Members have the power to put political pressure on the Commission, especially about progressing specific proposals, so it might be worth using it with more determination."
"I will stop the questions now."
"But there remains Mr Fassino's commitment to reply to Mr Falconer on a question left open from the previous Question Time."
"The departments have worked hard to get me all the details I need to give Mr Falconer an answer as promised."
"We have a written answer for Mr Falconer which is probably more precise and comprehensive than anything I could say here off the cuff."
"I think it contains all the desired information. If Mr Falconer is not satisfied then we can return to the discussion at the next Question Time."
"So we have even satisfied Mr Falconer."
"I want to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the cooperation and availability he has shown us in the past few months."
"Questions not taken will be answered in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Nordic Passport Union, EEA, Schengen - Visby Summit"
"Ladies and gentlemen, with your permission, the sitting will now commence."
"As you know, we have unfair competition from a football match - so I greet even more warmly the President-in-Office of the Council - and we also have a Provençal party, but we also have some very serious work to do here."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"by Mr Rehn and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, to the Council (B4-0442/96-0-0056/96) and to the Commission (B4-0443/96-0-0057/96), on free movement of persons in the Nordic Passport Union, the European Economic Area and the Schengen countries; -by Mrs Cederschiöld and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to the Council (B40449/96-0-0123/96) and to the Commission (B4-0450/96-0-0124/96), on the EU, the Schengen Convention and the Nordic Passport Union; -by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Commission (B40562/96-0-0128/96) and to the Council (B4-0563/96-0-0129/96), on free movement of persons within the European Economic Area, the Nordic Passport Union and the Schengen countries; -by Mrs Hautala and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, to the Council (B40564/96-0-0131/96) and to the Commission (B4-0565/96-0-0132/96), on the compatibility of the Nordic Passport Union, the Schengen Convention and Article 7a of the EC Treaty; -by Mr Caccavale and Mrs Schaffner, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, to the Council (B4-0568/96-0-0137/96) and to the Commission (B4-0569/96-0-0138/96), on freedom of movement, the Schengen Convention and the Nordic Passport Union; -by Mr Pradier, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, to the Council (B4-0570/96-0-00139/96) and to the Commission (B4-0664/96-0-0140/96), on freedom of movement in the context of the European Union, the passport union of the Nordic countries, the European Economic Area and the Schengen countries; -by Mr Krarup, on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group, to the Council (B4-0667/96-0-0144/96) and to the Commission (B4-0668/96-0-0145/96), on the Nordic Passport Union and the Schengen Convention; -by Mr Sjöstedt, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, to the Council (B4-0669/96-0-0146/96), on the Schengen Convention and the Nordic Passport Union; -by Mr Burenstam Linder and Mr Martens, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to the Council (B4-0447/96-0-0121/96) and to the Commission (B4-0448/96-0-0122/86), on the Baltic Sea States summit meeting on 3-4 May 1996 in Visby, Sweden; -by Mrs Roth and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, to the Council (B4-0665/96-0-0141/96) and to the Commission (B4-0666/96-0-0142/96), on the conclusions of the summit of the Baltic Sea States; -by Mr Krarup, on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group, to the Commission (B4-0670/96-0-0148/96), on the Visby summit of 3-4 May in Gotland, Sweden."
"Madam President, I am sorry that this is taking place at the same time as a very important European event between Germany and Italy."
"I myself am also reluctantly present."
"I assume that the discussions tonight will be very brief."
"Behind the oral question under discussion this evening there is concern that the idea of free movement of people already included in the Treaty of Rome has not been genuinely enforced within the European Union."
"The Liberal Group and the whole Parliament would therefore like an answer from the Council and the Commission, firstly, as to what measures will be taken in order to bring the regulations of the Schengen Agreement in line with the European Union's fundamental treaties and Community decision-making, and secondly, as to what measures will be taken in order to secure the continuation of the Nordic Passport Union when Denmark, Sweden and Finland, current members of the passport union, join the Schengen Agreement at a later date."
"The question should be resolved over two separate time spans."
"The future of the Nordic Passport Union has to be safeguarded within the next few months of negotiations between the Schengen countries and the Nordic countries."
"The Nordic countries, which besides Denmark, Sweden and Finland, all Member States of the EU, also consists of Iceland and Norway, both non-member states, have since 1954 had a passport exemption clause covering the borders between their countries."
"A pragmatic and realistic solution to the problem is about to be reached."
"The governments of Iceland and Norway have stated that they are prepared to abide by the terms of the present Schengen Agreement."
"These countries have the right to give their opinion on any future decisions made within the Schengen Agreement."
"Similar rights for Iceland and Norway to veto decisions is of course not on the agenda. The alternative for these countries is either to accept future decisions made by the Schengen countries or to withdraw from the Schengen Agreement."
"Citizens of the five Nordic countries wish to be part of a wider European territory, where there are no border formalities."
"On the other hand it is not acceptable to give up the passport exemption clause which has worked for decades."
"The introduction of border controls between the Nordic countries, which have had a passport exemption clause on a par with that mentioned in the Treaty of Rome since the 1950's, would be a big step backwards for the European integration."
"That is something we simply cannot afford to do."
"As a long-term objective the Schengen Agreement should be made part of the fundamental agreements of the EU."
"This is the only way to ensure democratic decision-making and a judicial monitoring by the European Court."
"The Liberal Group considers this to be one of the most important objectives of the present IGC."
"The Council and the Commission should set a schedule for achieving the objective, for example by the end of year 2000."
"The answer will show how serious the Council and the Commission are about creating a people's Europe, which essentially is what this discussion is about."
"Madam President, free movement of persons is one of the Union's most important objectives."
"It should not be forgotten that it is an objective which is laid down in the Treaty, one to which all Member States have committed themselves, including those which are now saying they are against free movement and working against it."
"Schengen cooperation is a special solution which should in due course be integrated in the EU and be governed by Community legislation, in order for it to operate properly, exactly as we in Parliament and the Commission want."
"The same is true of more or less all other conventions which come under the third pillar."
"Everyone knows that completely new legal solutions are required, new legal mechanisms to deal with many of the issues which are today taken care of through conventions which, moreover, are often not ratified and so fail to have the desired effect."
"As a result, we have no success with the compensatory measures which in themselves constitute the conditions for freedom of movement."
"We must in fact at least deal with the most necessary of these: the external borders and the fight against drugs."
"Deadlocks in the Council often result from Member States' mistrust of other states' ability to take sensible political decisions."
"Quite simply, there is no sense of trust and this must be established."
"Here we have Nordic cooperation, which represents practical progress."
"Nordic police, customs and drugs cooperation is on an everyday basis."
"We trust one another, in fact."
"It ought to be possible to transfer this to EU level."
"Even if the methods are different, the objectives are the same, for example that drug traffickers and terrorists should not be allowed to move freely across European borders."
"In the Nordic countries we do not close the borders because the other country is pursuing some policy which we perhaps do not entirely approve of."
"We exercise trust rather than mistrust."
"We have had a passport union for over 40 years - it must be retained."
"The Nordic countries have been a forerunner of and an example to the EU in this regard."
"We have achieved the goals which the EU is pursuing in this area and therefore it is only logical that the Nordic countries should be involved in continuing developments."
"It is important to bind Europe together, not to split it, and so the links must become stronger."
"The Union should be enlarged not only to the East but also to the North and the South."
"This means stronger links with the democratic, market-oriented countries around us."
"The Union must not contract."
"Our values must be disseminated."
"There are some technical and practical problems, concerning such things as air travel and baggage."
"I believe that Sweden would be able to help in this connection."
"Perhaps some of the travellers could travel via Sweden, as we have in fact solved this problem."
"It is not the technical resolution of each little detail which is important and upon which we should concentrate, even though the information Parliament receives on how solutions are found needs to be clearer."
"The important thing is to incorporate these new countries in a properly functioning legal system, where the Court and Parliament have a supervisory role."
"To put it simply: Iceland and Norway must be part of things."
"I do not doubt for a second that the Commission will be able to take the initiative in this area."
"However, will the Council manage to live up to European, democratic values?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the European Parliament has not let slip any opportunity of complaining that the free movement of individuals, a Treaty requirement which should have become reality on 1 January 1993, remains a dead letter."
"Because of obstruction on the part of a number of countries, capital can move freely within the Union, but not people."
"All manner of specious arguments are frequently deployed to hide the lack of the political will to make freedom of movement a reality."
"Of course we know that international cooperation is needed for matters of internal security and to combat fraud and crime."
"In today's world security cannot, of course, be guaranteed by Member States, national Member States."
"But internal borders are no obstacle to the criminal, ladies and gentlemen."
"And my Group is very much opposed to the linking of internal security and the movement of individuals."
"Parliament has also repeatedly criticized the ad hoc way in which structures have been put in place at varying speeds under the Schengen agreements."
"In a democratic constitutional state, ladies and gentlemen, the principle is that the police have to be answerable to the state."
"That means the safeguarding of the citizen's rights, judicial and parliamentary scrutiny, and Schengen in no way guarantees that."
"Even the national parliaments are barely able to exercise scrutiny."
"So Schengen has to be replaced by European legislation."
"Meantime the parliaments have made a start by coordinating parliamentary scrutiny within the Schengen area."
"So I think it is crucial that the European Parliament should be associated with this coordination, because Schengen is very much a European thing."
"It is also crucial that the European Commission, as an observer in Schengen and a guardian of the Treaties, should regularly and fully report to Parliament on what is happening in Schengen and the consequences for Community legislation."
"But Schengen is clearly proving successful, perhaps more so than we would like."
"Take the agreement currently being negotiated on the accession of the Nordic Passport Union to Schengen."
"Two of these Nordic countries are not members of the European Union, though this was a requirement for signatories of the Schengen agreements."
"In itself, enlargement of the area in which there is free movement of individuals is naturally a very good thing, but in this particular case I have two observations to make."
"Firstly, it is inconceivable to us that new borders should be created within the Nordic Passport Union, which has existed since 1954, just because of Schengen."
"But secondly, and equally certainly, it is unacceptable that Norwegian and Icelandic membership of Schengen should, by virtue of various legal complexities, be in a position to influence European Union structures in the future, the free movement of individuals and measures of internal security, and that Norway and Iceland should have the ability to obstruct the European Union."
"Schengen, ladies and gentlemen, provides for its own abolition once the Union assumes its duties. And there must be no threat to that."
"So I ask the Council and Commission what they will be doing, bearing in mind the accession of all the Nordic states, to have the subject matter covered by the Schengen Agreement gradually incorporated into Community law."
"Because that is what we all want."
"Madam President, I agree with my fellow representative Mr Olli Rehn that there is no reason to fear that Iceland and Norway would start to sabotage Schengen decisions, if they were to join in the way presently being discussed."
"Instead there is reason for concern that membership in the European Union alone and also Sweden's and Finland's membership in Schengen will create other new borders in northern Europe, such as between the Baltic countries and Russia on the one hand and the Nordic countries on the other hand, where movement already is clearly becoming more restricted."
"People are not able to move within northern Europe as they used to."
"It should also be pointed out that Finland joined the Schengen Agreement rather passively, in fact without any extensive public debate, and as far as I know even the Finnish parliament has had its doubts as to whether Finland even needs an arrangement like the present Schengen Agreement."
"The Green Group feels that the fact that the Data Protection legislation is rather questionable presents a major problem for the Schengen Agreement."
"It has to be said that parliamentary monitoring is not enough, but the Green Group would not like to think that the right solution would be to integrate the Schengen Agreement as such into the European Union, since there are fundamental problems related to this agreement from the citizens' point of view, not dissimilar to those relating to the Europol co-operation. It is clear that there is no reason to create a European security state which controls and puts every citizen under suspicion."
"There is also a problem regarding what would happen if Norway were to decide to stay outside the Schengen Agreement. Being Finnish myself, I feel that Finland, and possibly also Sweden and Denmark, should give careful consideration to their Schengen membership in this situation, since it would mean in effect that the Nordic Passport Union would cease."
"Free movement should be developed by means other than the Schengen Agreement within the European Union, and such issues as those concerning data protection and the position of the individual are absolutely vital."
"Mr President, in today's oral questions, the passport freedom which exists in Scandinavia is referred to as the Nordic Passport Union, but that is not its proper name."
"There is no Nordic Union, not even for the smoothly functioning cooperation between the Scandinavian countries."
"There is a protocol on passport freedom which was adopted by the Scandinavian governments in Copenhagen in 1954, and an agreement on passport controls concluded in 1957."
"This freedom of movement in Scandinavia, which has worked perfectly well for 40 years, forms an interesting contrast to the Schengen Convention."
"The Nordic protocol is a singlepage document."
"The Schengen Convention is a bureaucratic pile-up, a tragi-comic hotchpotch of monitoring and control of both the countries' own citizens and foreign subjects."
"And this contrast can be explained."
"The cooperation in Scandinavia is organic; it has grown out of legal and cultural communities which are hundreds of years old."
"It has not been imposed on the Scandinavian people as a reflection of a pressure from the demands of the market economy for open frontiers."
"The cooperation in Scandinavia is not centrally dictated."
"It has no links with the greedy capitalism being pursued through the EU's so-called four freedoms, which are creating far more problems than they solve."
"The cooperation in Scandinavia is well balanced and works without the police accompaniment and sophisticated monitoring which are the hallmark of the Schengen Convention."
"Schengen, on the other hand, is not organic."
"Schengen is structured, and what a structure it is!"
"In an interminable legal document consisting of 143 articles, with subparagraphs and indents to subparagraphs, the authors have designed a system of monitoring and control which beats any police mechanism seen before."
"It is legitimized as compensation for the removal of controls at internal frontiers referred to in Article 7a of the Treaty on European Union."
"One might venture to say that the means are overshadowing the ends."
"Schengen is a police state in embryo, with sensitive personal data held in information systems - which is at odds with many Member States' traditions of protection of the individual and legal safety - and extensive and ill-defined police powers."
"Note the conspiratorial way in which the Schengen structure came into existence."
"The first agreement between the five governments which began the initiative was carefully kept secret for many years."
"Only several years after the original agreements did the top-secret documents gradually become accessible."
"It is not a system which came about as a result of a free debate."
"Schengen has the kind of totalitarian features which would shock any democrat."
"It is a way of establishing a fortress Europe at the same time as tightening internal controls."
"There was every reason to keep the Schengen plan secret: it would not have received a great deal of popular support."
"Among the many strange obsessions which are currently driving the European Union, at the expense of national self-determination, democracy and legal safety, the most inexplicable is that European politicians apparently lack any understanding of the fact that greater police powers and more controls are a failure of democracy."
"We are losing the constant struggle of our peoples for democracy and legal safety when we arm ourselves with monitoring and control mechanisms and increased police powers."
"Yes, but surely Schengen is a system which has been set up independently from the Union?"
"Strictly speaking, that is correct, as the Norwegian Justice Minister told his country's parliament."
"According to the minister, the Schengen Convention is a separate, independent agreement under international law."
"Matters can be explained in such a way, but to do so one has to choose to ignore reality and interpret the Schengen agreement in a convenient political context."
"The realities behind the formal jurisprudence show that Schengen is functionally integrated into the Union."
"One need only read in the Italian Government's report to the Florence summit that one of the elements in the expansion of justice and police cooperation is the integration of the Schengen arrangement into the institutional system of the Treaty on European Union, as referred to by several speakers here today."
"And the EU's list of countries whose citizens require a visa is identical to the list adopted under the Schengen system."
"For Scandinavia, this means that we shall suddenly be introducing a visa requirement for countries whose citizens have been able to travel freely to us for years."
"And there is more."
"Schengen is the structure, the gateway for dealing on a supranational basis with refugee and immigration policy and international crime, a system which the Danish people have rejected once, and which the people in the rest of the EU would certainly not accept either, if they were asked."
"But they will not in fact be asked, it would appear from the vote today."
"We have the automatic mechanism which has frequently been mentioned: one step brings another with it."
"I would present Scandinavia's compliments and say that if our peoples had to choose between Schengen and the Nordic model of free movement, they would choose the latter, but the governments have decided on behalf of their peoples to force them off the path which has been followed up to now."
"For Norway, membership of the EEA and Schengen means belonging to two thirds of the EU, without having any influence."
"For the other peoples of Scandinavia, joining Schengen is a tragedy in terms of democracy and their legal policy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, another event of European significance is responsible for my lateness or at least gives me an excuse."
"I want to associate myself with the demands and questions put by honourable Members and, taking advantage of Commissioner Monti's presence, I am standing in for Mr Pradier to ask, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, the questions we all have, faced with the drift by which the system has in fact overturned one of the cornerstones of the internal market, one of the great strides of the 1985 European Single Act, which opened up the horizon to free movement not only of goods but also of people, thus establishing a great area of freedom and rights."
"I consider this very dangerous and Commissioner Monti has inherited a very delicate dossier, but we know how effective he is and since he took office he has in fact been attempting to make this right a reality and honour this neglected Article of the Treaty."
"But the situation now seems to be becoming particularly grave, when decision-making bodies do not even have the shame to refer to it. I am not speaking of Community bodies as such, but of the third pillar and particularly the Schengen executive committee, the body empowered to deal with issues relating to free movement, both internally and in third countries."
"Obviously I am referring to the question of the countries of northern Europe, but it is a general question."
"So it is reasonable to ask what can be done and how we can help the Commission to ensure that the citizens of Europe receive a message of integration and not one of liquefaction, especially in this area, from mere intergovernmental cooperation which is anyway bankrupt."
"Madam President, the Nordic countries' passport union has been in operation for more than forty years."
"Unlike the Schengen Agreement, it has operated well."
"But then it is completely different from the Schengen Agreement."
"It means that one has the right to travel freely without a passport, though border controls are still carried out."
"It is a model which has considerable popular support."
"The Nordic passport union must be retained."
"The Swedish government has made it clear that it would not be appropriate for Sweden to become a party to Schengen unless all the Nordic countries do."
"It is impossible not only politically but also in practical terms to have a Schengen border between Sweden and Norway."
"The Nordic countries have now been offered an agreement by the Schengen countries which would mean all the Nordic countries adopting the Schengen model."
"For Norway and Iceland this would mean that they would have to comply but without being able to exert any influence."
"They would not have voting rights on the Schengen executive committee but would on the other hand have to approve all future decisions, on pain of having to leave the entire Schengen system - immediately."
"I believe that in democratic terms such a model is totally unacceptable."
"It is moreover an extraordinarily unstable model; all it needs is for Norway to say no once and a Schengen border would have to be erected between Sweden and Norway."
"Never before has the Nordic passport union been so threatened as it is today by this arrangement."
"My next question is this: what will happen when the Schengen Agreement becomes part of EU law?"
"We know that that day is relatively close."
"At the Intergovernmental Conference highly technical and highly concrete discussions are currently taking place on how Schengen should become part of EU law."
"If that happens the Court of Justice will have jurisdiction and then the Norwegian constitution would have to be amended."
"If such an amendment were moved, it would be sufficient for every fourth member of the Norwegian parliament to vote against for Norway not to be able to become a party to Schengen."
"At present more than every fourth member of the Norwegian parliament is opposed to the Schengen Agreement."
"This means that the Nordic passport union is at direct risk from the arrangements being made now and the current haste is completely incomprehensible, when we do not yet know how the Intergovernmental Conference will turn out."
"It puts Nordic passport freedom at risk."
"In the debate on the Schengen Agreement passport freedom is used as a bait but Schengen is so much more than that: it comprises a harmonised refugee policy with clearly inhumane characteristics, it means large registers of persons subject to weak democratic control."
"In actual fact it is a central part of the European Union's development of a common policy on justice."
"This is what Iceland and Norway are to subject themselves to, without having any influence, despite having taken the democratic decision not to become members of the European Union with all its regulations."
"Furthermore, the promised passport freedom may turn out to be something other than expected."
"With regard to other parts of the world, such as Third World countries, it means stricter controls."
"It may also mean that we are forced to carry identity documents."
"Sweden has already received reminders from France and the Netherlands that Swedish citizens should have special ID cards when they travel abroad."
"I therefore wonder what kind of freedom it is when a passport is simply replaced by an ID card."
"As I see it, it is no freedom at all."
"There is really only one solution to this for the Nordic countries, only one solution which will safeguard the Nordic passport union and only one solution which is capable of securing genuine popular support and which will allow us to determine for ourselves the future of the passport union."
"It is that all five Nordic countries should decide not to accede to the Schengen Agreement."
"Madam President, the Council of Baltic Sea States' summit meeting in Visby, at which the EU was represented at the highest level, was a success and that is very important."
"The Baltic region represents a compact European problem."
"The former Soviet system has left much behind it and now there is direct contact between the new Russia, the new countries seeking membership of the EU and the new Western Europe, geared to the fulfilment of its historic mission."
"The Baltic region has great promise but also entails considerable risks."
"As one can see from the presidency declaration made by the president of the Visby summit, the Swedish prime minister, the issues discussed included economic development and economic integration, environmental problems and the fight against international crime."
"Mr Santer presented what is known as the EU's Baltic initiative, which lays a basis for further efforts on the part of the Union."
"Together with the documents which the country holding the presidency of the Council of Baltic Sea States has been asked to draw up, we have here the principles for the follow-up work which will be started on 2 and 3 July at a meeting of foreign ministers in Kalmar, a town on the Swedish Baltic coast."
"Security issues are not on the actual agenda for the Council of Baltic Sea States but in this respect too the Council has an important role to play."
"The summit provided the first opportunity for informal discussions at the highest level between the Russian prime minister and leaders of the three Baltic states."
"There will be opportunities for such contacts at subsequent meetings at ministerial level."
"The security situation will also be furthered by networks of contacts at all levels involving civil servants, industrialists and academics."
"The EU and the Council of Baltic Sea States can facilitate an intensification of all these networks."
"The motion for a resolution to be adopted by Parliament states that the EU and the Council of Baltic Sea States should take the initiative in gathering together all the Member States of the Union, in cooperation with the European Parliament and the national parliaments for a conference of the kind which was held last year in Barcelona on Mediterranean issues."
"Such an initiative would bring peoples closer."
"Within a growing EU, Madam President, special measures are needed to foster contacts between Members and applicant countries, since geographical distance and differences in history and culture can make it more difficult to create a real community."
"As part of the preparations for the Visby summit a group of prominent business leaders held a business summit at which they adopted an agenda of measures to stimulate increased economic activity, investment and trade."
"The chair of the business leaders group was invited to give an account of this agenda at the Visby summit."
"It is important that this industrial cooperation is facilitated and fostered and that industry recognises and makes the most of the opportunities."
"In this way the resource flows arising from the European Union aid effort and bilateral programmes can be enlarged and vitalised."
"The motion for a resolution also stresses the importance of creating better legal structures in the countries which are now undergoing political and economic transformation."
"A country should be built on the basis of law."
"Law faculties at universities were seriously neglected during the Soviet era."
"There is an important task for the EU here, namely to support national efforts to develop legal competence."
"Madam President, the Schengen Agreement was signed as long ago as 1985 but it was ten years before it came into force."
"Most Schengen countries and their citizens are today extremely critical of the Agreement."
"In many other countries there is also a great deal of mistrust."
"In order to achieve something positive - free movement - it was felt that a great many negative measures had to be taken and this has led to the idea of Fortress Europe."
"Is it not time to recognise that the Schengen Agreement which is so subject to criticism is neither the best nor the only way of achieving free movement of persons?"
"The Nordic passport union is another way; it has been in operation for over forty years and really does allow people free movement, without creating walls against the world outside, and it must be preserved."
"What does free movement mean from an EU perspective?"
"High walls against the outside world and advanced systems of control, replacing fixed internal border control points with peripatetic controls on the inside, exchanging passports for an obligatory Schengen ID card, and so on."
"Everything being monitored by a police office we call Europol."
"The Green Group wishes to express its total opposition to the integration of the Schengen model in the Union and regards it as regrettable that the Council's working documents show that work is already being done on this."
"Madam President, I just want to mention what the citizens of Europe have been waiting for since January 1993: economic growth, especially free movement and cooperation between national governments on security and the fight against crime, but I would say primarily a Europe that is a leading world player, and it seems to me that we are very far from achieving these objectives."
"We cannot calculate the negative effects of the fact that these objectives are not being achieved in the Union."
"I think we are all, or almost all, in favour of the Nordic countries joining the Schengen Agreement, but our criticism is about a two-speed Europe, more than two speeds, and in open order, with some Member States going ahead on free movement and security and the fight against crime in their own ways."
"That is why we are so critical."
"Not of the aims of Schengen which are perfectly correct, but of the fact that this agreement might discourage or slow down bringing the third pillar into the Community sphere, which is what we all want."
"Great commitment is required of us all on this subject and I wonder if the importance of the objective of free movement of persons is comparable to the territorial issue of Gibraltar or the powers of the Court of Justice, which is also of absolute importance."
"Now the convention is blocked and it is also blocking other important acts, for instance the Dublin Convention on the right of asylum."
"So I would like us all to give this our attention and I hope that the Commission and the Council take positions on this."
"As regards accelerating the implementation of free movement of persons in the European Union, the Council's organizations are working on three proposals presented last year by Commissioner Monti on the right of citizens of third countries to travel inside the Community, the abolition of controls on persons at internal frontiers and the adaptation of the derived right of free movement of workers, self-employed workers and beneficiaries of services."
"Furthermore, the Council is devoting attention to the draft convention on the crossing by persons of the external frontiers of the Member States of the European Union."
"However there are still unresolved problems on this text including in particular the area of territorial application and the possible attribution to the Court of Justice of powers to make preliminary judgements on the interpretation of the provisions of the convention and to rule on controversies relating to its application."
"The opinion expressed by Parliament on this draft convention in April 1994 has naturally received the Council's attention, and successive Presidencies of the Council have not failed to inform Parliament step by step of the progress made on this issue."
"The Council is also looking at the relationship between the Nordic Passport Union and the draft convention on the crossing by persons of the external frontiers of Member States."
"It is not up to the Council to take a position on the implications of the Nordic Passport Union and the extension of the provisions of the Schengen agreement."
"Any communitization of such sectors, envisaged by the Schengen agreement, can only be achieved in accordance with the procedures laid down by Article K.9 or Article M of the Treaty on European Union."
"Article K.9 provides that the Council, acting unanimously on the initiative of the Commission or a Member State, may decide to apply Article 100c of the Treaty to certain areas covered by cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs determining the relevant voting conditions."
"These decisions should later be adopted by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements."
"The Commission has already announced that it does not intend to present an initiative along these lines in a communication to Parliament and the Council of November 1995, as it believes the objective of the communitization of the sector in question is more likely to be achieved under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Conference for the revision of the treaties rather than through an initiative based on Article K.9."
"So it is clear that as the Intergovernmental Conference has started its work, it is up to that forum convened under Article N of the Treaty on European Union, to examine the possibility of incorporating the provisions of the Schengen agreements into the Treaty on European Union, bringing them under the control of the European Parliament and the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Community."
"I would now like to dwell briefly on the Baltic Sea States Summit of 3 and 4 May at Visby."
"I want to emphasize that the Council naturally sets great store by strengthening the stability and the economic development of the Baltic region and, in line with the conclusions of the Essen European Council, it confirms the importance of regional cooperation initiatives in Europe."
"As regards cooperation, in particular with the Baltic Sea region, on 29 May 1995 the Council drew up conclusions on European Union policy towards this region based on guidelines in a Commission communication."
"Before coming to the contents of these conclusions, I would like to record that the presidency of the Council has actually spoken on the Visby summit in Parliament already, in a debate here on 17 April."
"The Union's interest in the whole area bordering on the Baltic was stressed at Visby. I am thinking in particular of the European association agreements with four countries in the area - Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - and of the intense political dialogue that has now developed on the basis of the Italian-British initiative of 1993."
"Indeed, the European Parliament contributes significantly to this political dialogue."
"At the Warsaw meeting of the joint parliamentary committees of the European Parliament and the Polish Parliament on 22 January, and the analogous meeting held with Estonia in Brussels on 26 March, where the Italian presidency intervened at the political level."
"There was also the information mission made by the Italian presidency at the beginning of April to Riga, Vilnius, Tallinn and Warsaw to explain the priorities of our term to those countries."
"There was also the participation of Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the WEU as associated partners, a qualitative leap achieved by moving forward from the old consultative forum with the countries of central and eastern Europe and granting associated partner States participation with a reasonable degree of involvement in many WEU activities."
"What I have mentioned so far is part of the general framework of Union support to the various forms of regional cooperation discussed and approved at Essen, intended to promote the pre-membership strategy and bring groups of States closer to the Union, in particular the States in the area concerned."
"I have already mentioned the Nordic Council; I would also like to mention the Central European initiative which also specifically targets the Baltic because Poland has been involved from the start."
"At the ministerial meeting in Vienna a few weeks ago, the INCE decided to enlarge its organization to fifteen members, making it the strongest and largest example of regional cooperation in Europe."
"The Council and the Commission has entered into relations with the INCE, and this will be reflected in the final document from the Florence European Council."
"I have mentioned all this to remind you that the 29 May Cooperation Council with the Baltic Sea States was not an isolated event but part of a strategy on relations between the European Union and the countries of the Baltic Sea, which is already well advanced."
"In particular, the Council stresses the importance of integrating the region into the European and world economy through the possibility of trade and investment, and this integration is in the interests of the Union."
"The European Union already contributes through existing instruments, in particular the PHARE, TACIS and cross-border cooperation programmes, to economic growth and freer trade, encouraging new investment possibilities."
"It has also concluded agreements with coastal third countries to reduce port barriers in particular ways."
"Many of the plans that emerged from the Visby Conference are already under way with the assistance of the European Union and with bilateral assistance from Member States."
"There is, for example, assistance in the administrative and customs sectors, support to coastal third countries to join the World Trade Organization, support for establishing a free trade area between Baltic countries and Poland, assistance in cross-border cooperation."
"In conclusion, the Commission will report to the Florence European Council on the results of the Visby Conference, where it presented its initiative for the Baltic Sea region."
"The framework guidelines of this initiative must now be converted into action and the Council will of course make a statement on that, in the light of the conclusions of the European Council and with a view to the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Baltic Sea Council, which will take place in Kalmar on 2 and 3 July 1996."
"Madam President, the European Parliament has always strongly supported the abolition of internal frontier controls on persons, an aim written into the Treaty under Article 7a. So I find it logical that honourable Members are interested in the development of Schengen, especially the relationship between the Schengen Agreement and the achievement of this objective throughout the Union."
"The oral questions tabled demonstrate this interest, and seem to me to revolve around three essential issues. First, how the Commission now intends to achieve the objective of abolishing internal frontier checks on persons in the Union; second, whether the acquis of the Nordic Union will be maintained, hence including Norway and Iceland when this objective is achieved at Union level; third, the role the Intergovernmental Conference could and should play in achieving the objective of integrating Schengen into the Treaty on European Union."
"On the first point, while the Commission welcomes the Schengen Agreement as the Union's precursor to achieving abolition of controls on persons, it recognizes that Schengen is only a partial implementation of the objective of Article 7a of the Treaty on European Union."
"This is in fact a Community objective, to be achieved throughout the European Union using European Union instruments and drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the treaties and in full respect of the role of the various institutions."
"From this viewpoint, Schengen currently suffers from an institutional deficit."
"Personally I have to say I find it particularly unacceptable that, of the four great freedoms of movement on which the European single market is based, it is actually free movement of persons which remains most in arrears."
"So it is hardly surprising if the citizens do not have a real and positive perception of European integration."
"That is why the Commission put forward three proposals last July to complement the legislative instruments which will allow us to abolish internal frontier controls throughout the European Union, and Parliament's opinion on those proposals is expected shortly."
"Mr Dell'Alba, whom I thank for his appreciation of these proposals, wonders how the European Parliament can help the Commission."
"First of all, I would say, by giving the requested opinion on the Commission's three proposals for directives which is scheduled for the July session, and then, with the specific proposals on the table, by exercising all that welcome and timely pressure which the European Parliament has historically brought to bear on this issue."
"On the second point - cooperation between Schengen and Norway and Iceland - I recognize that, at the appropriate time, the Union will have to deal with the same problem already encountered by the Schengen group."
"The Schengen Member States and the countries of the Nordic Union are of the opinion that Denmark, Finland and Sweden being party to the agreement must not compromise the acquis of the Nordic Union."
"Their involvement must therefore be accompanied by cooperation between Schengen on the one hand, and Norway and Iceland on the other, which cannot join Schengen because the convention is restricted to Member States of the European Union, in twinning the two areas without frontiers, Schengen and the Nordic Union."
"When we are close to achieving abolition of internal frontier controls on persons in the European Union, that clearly should not become a reason for eliminating the acquis of the Nordic Union, which dates back forty years."
"So we must find appropriate solutions for this."
"I believe Schengen may, and indeed should, also function as precursor in terms of twinning the areas without frontiers of the Nordic Union and the European Union."
"Political agreement on the cooperation to be established for this purpose exists, but the negotiations on technical solutions between the Schengen States and Norway and Iceland have only just begun."
"The Commission is involved in these negotiations, and I guarantee that it will ensure that any cooperation agreements between Schengen and Norway and Iceland do not compromise existing Community law or constitute an obstacle of any kind to its future development."
"Madam President, I come to the third issue raised in the various questions: the role that the Intergovernmental Conference could or should play in the context of the achievement of this fundamental objective."
"The European Parliament is kept informed of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference so honourable Members know about the three hypotheses under consideration. One is about bringing into the Community sphere a number of policy areas which currently appear in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, so that they can benefit from Community mechanisms and all the institutions can fulfil their traditional roles, which is the aim the Commission supports."
"Then the mechanisms established in Title VI need to be strengthened for the matters it continues to cover, and in particular the institutions should be assigned a more important role."
"Finally there is the possibility of integrating the content of Schengen into the Treaty on European Union, some of it in the first and some in the third pillar as appropriate."
"These options are not mutually exclusive: for example possible integration of the content of Schengen into the Treaty on European Union should in no way interfere with increasing the effectiveness of the decision-making procedures set out in Title VI at the same time."
"However, and this concludes my reply to the first group of questions, in the Commission's view, the Intergovernmental Conference - let me stress this - cannot serve as an alibi or pretext for holding up work in progress."
"The objective of abolishing internal frontier controls on persons is already in the Treaty on European Union and together we must do our utmost to achieve it on the basis of the Commission proposals currently under examination."
"We cannot yet foresee the content of the new Treaty, it will take time for it to be ratified by all the countries, and if we wait for that we will inevitably get even further away from the date initially set for the completion of the single market and free movement of persons constitutes an essential factor in that."
"I come now, much more briefly, to the questions on the Baltic Sea States Summit held in Visby."
"On 17 April Commissioner Van den Broek explained to Parliament the objective of the Visby meeting and the role the Commission would play there."
"It is superfluous to stress the political importance of cooperation between all the countries of the Baltic Sea."
"The informal and open dialogue between the Heads of Government of the Baltic Sea States, in which the Presidents of the European Council and Commission took part, has contributed to strengthening cooperation and, I would say, trust in the region."
"The meeting supported the efforts made by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland to join the European Union."
"On the specific questions by Mr Burenstam Linder and Mr Martens, I have pleasure in confirming that the Commission's document 'Initiative' has been favourably received, both as regards the support of the Community to priority cooperation sectors defined by the Baltic Sea States, and as regards the efforts made by the Commission to strengthen coordination."
"On the questions by Mr Roth and others, I want to confirm that nuclear safety is one of the Commission's priorities."
"We are trying to strengthen international collaboration in this field but we must not forget that this is primarily a matter for national governments."
"As to the future of reactors which do not meet current safety criteria, the Commission believes that they must be brought up to standard or deactivated as soon as possible."
"Finally, on protection of the identity of the Nordic countries, the subject of a question by Mr Krarup, I can only say that the Visby meeting looked at cooperation in the whole Baltic region, including strengthening democracy and the security of citizens."
"I thank Commissioner Monti for his very detailed replies and I give the floor to Mrs Iivari, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Madam President, I am going to talk about the summit in Visby, and I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Council's and the Commission's representatives for their contributions here today."
"The development in the Baltic and the Mediterranean areas is important for the stability and prosperity of the whole of Europe."
"The European Union's active involvement in creating democracy, strengthening economies and overcoming environmental problems is essential both in the south and in the north."
"It is essential that the political results reached regarding the Baltic area at the summit held in Visby are put into practice without delay."
"It was of great value that all states in the Baltic area, including Russia, participated in the summit, in addition to the European Union."
"Let that be a start to a strengthening of the Nordic dimension within the Union."
"The Council and the Commission should now draw up a programme as soon as possible for the initiatives required to implement the decisions made at the summit."
"In the Baltic area widespread co-operation is required in order to counteract international crime and resolve severe environmental problems, amongst other things."
"An energy network comprising the whole of Europe, linking Norway's and Russia's gas resources, should be extended to this area."
"The PHARE and Interreg programmes should also be integrated and implemented in such a way that they offer real benefits in creating democracy and public well-being in the Baltic countries."
"The European Union's Baltic policy should be based on existing Europe agreements as well as a full implementation of co-operation and partnership agreements."
"The Baltic area, which in many respects is in a very delicately balanced, requires a framework for co-operation which respects the independence of all countries and guarantees human rights for citizens in the whole area."
"This co-operation cannot be left to words alone."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I have listened with pleasure to the comments made concerning Baltic cooperation."
"I was visited today by some television people who work a great deal on media cooperation in the East."
"We talked about the cultural aspects too, and I would recommend that those aspects should also be addressed in all the discussions on the economy."
"I think that on this Scandinavian evening, a welcoming voice should be heard from Denmark among the chorus of speeches which have been made."
"I myself live near the Danish-German border."
"This is not only the border between Denmark and Germany, but also the border between Germany and the other countries of Scandinavia."
"The Nordic Passport Union, which my fellow countryman Mr Krarup says must not be called that, but referred to as a Nordic passport-free area, is not just a practical question, but in fact a political one as well, which says something about the Nordic context and also about Nordic solidarity."
"As a Dane, I think it is important to draw attention to this, in these days of Europe and Schengen."
"I hope - and I welcome what the Commissioner said in this respect - that Norway and Iceland can be brought into this cooperation, so that the Nordic Passport Union is preserved intact."
"The delegation from Parliament will be going to Norway and Iceland shortly."
"It would be very good to be able to say in Oslo and Reykjavik from the European Parliament - and this is what I understood from the Commissioner - that there is every chance of the Nordic Passport Union surviving intact within the system in Europe."
"Madam President, it is undoubtedly necessary both to widen the Schengen area to cover as many countries as possible and to improve the free movement of persons between the Nordic Union and the European Union, provided that minimum guarantees are demanded from Iceland and Norway."
"But haste is one thing and speed another."
"In the first place, to accept the complete 'communitization' of the third pillar today, as the resolution of 13 March 1996 would wish, while negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference are still going on, seems to me premature."
"Although harmonization with the Community sphere, particularly for points 1 to 6 of Article 1, is desirable, we should nevertheless consider it point by point and take the necessary precautions."
"We must always hold fast to the idea that the European citizen should be at the heart of European integration."
"The Union has an unconditional obligation to look at its citizens' needs in practical terms, but also at their concerns."
"Similarly, there can be no question of creating a European space with no frontiers without the accompanying measures needed to deal with internal security."
"Measures relating to free movement and those relating to the security of external frontiers should be applied simultaneously."
"Ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of the well-being and freedom of all citizens of the Union, let us avoid (in the words of a well-known saying) 'putting the cart before the horse' ."
"Besides, these same citizens would accept the idea of freedom linked to free movement more enthusiastically if the European decision-maker framed this plan with due allowance for aspects essential to the security of the external frontiers."
"Let us never forget that security for us all is as much a right as freedom of movement."
"Madam President, I should also like to thank the Council and the Commission for the interesting answers."
"I should like to begin with Baltic cooperation."
"It is good that the Council supports Baltic cooperation so actively."
"It is important that this cooperation should become a matter for the whole of the EU; it is quite likely that the subject will also be discussed further in Florence."
"It is good, however, that we have already been able to confirm that active Baltic cooperation is a matter for the whole of the EU and that it is not simply a question of cooperation with the Baltic states and Poland but can also become an important bridge to Russia."
"As regards the free movement of persons, I believe it is worth stressing that this is something that the single market stands for and is intended to achieve."
"This was completely clear both to those who created the single market and to those of us who joined the Community later."
"I am also one of those who complains that free movement has not been achieved and that it is quite possible to criticise the often highly technical and convoluted solutions, or detours, which it has been necessary to adopt via Schengen."
"However, I also believe that everyone who is in favour of such free movement understands us in the Nordic countries, that we are afraid for the community which we have in the form of the passport union and a free and common labour market."
"This can of course, as has already been pointed out, serve as a good example of how free movement can operate at its best."
"I am quite convinced that if the Member States of the EU and the Nordic countries which are not part of the EU can only find the will it will be possible to resolve the difficulties associated with the achievement of free movement throughout the Nordic countries and the EU."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions raised this evening show that the only realistic Europe, which is at last being built, will necessarily be one that is sometimes scornfully called an 'à la carte' Europe."
"Because there is both dogma and reality."
"The dogma, of course, is expressed in Article 7a of the EU Treaty, for example."
"The reality is the setting up of specific systems like that established for the Schengen agreement."
"The reality is also the existence of autonomous machinery for regionalized spaces for free movement of persons like that of the Nordic Passport Union."
"But it is by no means certain that it is possible or even desirable to harmonize these different systems and, from this point of view, plurality, originating from a previous historical development, should not necessarily be automatically criticized."
"Moreover, we have here a unilateral idea."
"Freedom of movement is always favoured at the expense of security, and it is in the face of this situation that some States found themselves prey to a kind of anxiety which led them to set up the Schengen agreements."
"I do not think this situation will disappear overnight."
"Thirdly, the Visby conference proved that frameworks for cooperation much wider than those of the European Union alone had to be found."
"All this clearly shows that it is unreal to pretend that Europe should be organized only in the rigid framework of the European Union."
"I should like to emphasize in passing that Europe will always be mutilated as long as it excludes Russia, and for the very simple reason that the present Europe is increasingly becoming a privileged space for economic and cultural colonization by the United States."
"Faced with this transatlantic world superpower, it will be absolutely essential to find a counterweight some day."
"Of course, I do not think that Russia and the CIS can be included in the rigid framework of the European Union, but this means that that framework cannot take priority."
"Other, more flexible, forms of cooperation will have to be set up: this is what is happening gradually under the pressure of necessity."
"Consequently, for all these reasons, I truly think that the Europe of the future will be an 'à la carte' Europe, which may or may not please those who, on doctrinal grounds, are opposed to it."
"Madam President, it is perfectly understandable of course that the countries of Denmark, Sweden and Finland should be seeking to join the Schengen group."
"It is equally understandable that they will want to preserve the existing Nordic free movement arrangements and that their membership of Schengen will be contingent upon the willingness to accept that Norway and Iceland should be included in that as well, expanding Schengen to some 13 members."
"Indeed, in the negotiations on accession by Norway, which came to naught because of the referendum decision, this was an important consideration."
"Some speakers here have dwelt, quite understandably, on the problems that would arise from the fact that Iceland and Norway, through not being Member States of the European Union, will be excluded from discussions on the future development of the free movement area if it were to be incorporated into the Union treaties."
"I would like to add another angle to that, namely the question of the three or four Member States which at the moment do not seek to join the Schengen arrangement and which are insisting on retaining the right to exercise border controls because they do not accept that non-citizens of the Union have the right of free movement."
"They would be in a peculiar position because they would find that non-Member States were involved in a free movement arrangement which as Member States they were not part of."
"It is all a very unhappy situation."
"I hope that it will not be a permanent difficulty, that one day it may be possible for all the Member States of the Union to be part of the free movement area."
"But it is a reality at the moment that Britain and one or two others certainly do not see that happening in the immediate future."
"And that must be recognized."
"In conclusion, some of us may have to abstain on this common text."
"There are certain points in paragraphs 1, 2, 6 and 10 which we cannot at the moment fully accept, although I must say that there is an enormous amount in this resolution with which we could all agree."
"First let me emphasize once more that the Visby meeting promoted regional cooperation and also identified, as an example of such regional cooperation, the Baltic way - the road corridor between Helsinki and Warsaw-Tallinn-Riga-Kaunas - which is one of the trans-European network priorities."
"Then there are two groups of questions which I will briefly follow up."
"As regards the Nordic Union countries, I believe it is very important for the European Union to keep in mind the experience on passports acquired over a long period by the Nordic Union and I think it is appropriate to mention the question of compatibility between the Nordic Union arrangements and the Treaty on European Union."
"The Commission is not aware of any provisions in the Nordic Union agreement which might be incompatible with existing Community law or existing European Union arrangements."
"Everything naturally needs to be explored in the new situation which we hope will shortly be created when the abolition of the controls on persons enters into force for the whole of the European Union."
"Some people have stressed the issue of security."
"I want to dispel any doubt immediately: the three proposals formulated by the Commission in July 1995 are all inspired by full recognition that security is just as important as freedom of movement, which is why a link has been planned between the accompanying measures and the abolition of controls at the internal frontiers of the European Union."
"So I would not want anyone to think the Commission is so preoccupied with achieving the objective of freedom of movement that it would neglect security."
"That is certainly not the case."
"Finally, on Mr Elliott's speech, some Member States, probably very few, which are not interested in taking part in Schengen and have certain reservations of principle about the interpretation of freedom of movement of persons in the European Union, may indeed find themselves in a peculiar situation, when other states which are not members of the European Union are participating, through Schengen, in this great area of freedom of movement in security."
"I have received 11 motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Economic and social reform in the Mediterranean"
