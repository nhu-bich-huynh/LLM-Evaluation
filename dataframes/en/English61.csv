"I should like to respond as follows."
"First, it should urgently be emphasised that poverty is not just a question of debt relief."
"The real issue is appropriate levels of development financing."
"Second, it is important to distinguish between different countries, in particular between the least developed countries and other developing countries."
"Third, the figures on debt relief were not presented to you with the aim of cutting back on aid, but rather the opposite: to use this criteria in order to alleviate the debt burden for those countries that really need it most."
"Fourth, the UN and the Commission will coordinate their efforts with other international organisations on the HIPC and other initiatives."
"Fifth, a new World Bank-IMF sustainability framework recognises the inadequacy of existing debt relief efforts."
"The new framework will: first, set indicative debt burden thresholds that are country-specific; second, take account of external shocks; third, ensure greater transparency and dialogue in assessing that sustainability."
"That is what the new sustainability framework is all about."
"Lastly, relief for Iraq should not be at the expense of the poorest countries, and a debt moratorium for countries hit by the tsunami would be appropriate."
"The Commission will closely follow the issue of the external debt of developing countries, in particular the least-developed ones."
"There also remains much to do as regards considering debt relief for the countries of Southeast Asia hit by the earthquake and tsunami."
"The Commission will maintain a continuous dialogue with the European Parliament in all the above fields of action."
"We all agree that for some developing countries external indebtedness is a major obstacle to growth and development."
"Debt relief can indeed be a useful tool in that quest, but by no means can it offer a full response."
"Aid, socio-economic policies, trade policies, etc. that ensure the sustainability of these countries in the long run are crucial."
"That is what they would want and what they deserve."
"That concludes the debate. Six motions for resolutions have been tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is Question Time, with questions to the Council (B6-0001/2005)."
"Two African immigrants were drowned and another 14 lost without trace in a tragic patera sinking off the coast of Fuerteventura (Spain) on 28 November 2004."
"Yet again, the European coastline is the stage for the fatal tragedy of individuals using illegal networks to escape from intolerable situations in the hope of starting afresh, both humanly and professionally, in Europe."
"Is the Council aware that we are facing a huge humanitarian problem here, one which European society – let alone the institutions of the EU – cannot simply ignore, and for which an urgent solution has to be found?"
"What political and humanitarian measures and initiatives is the Council adopting to prevent these tragic deaths, in the face of which we cannot remain impassive bystanders?"
"The honourable Member will remember that the Council has on several occasions already expressed how it has felt following the human dramas in which a number of attempts at illegal entry into the European Union have ended."
"The Hague programme, adopted by the European Council on 4 and 5 November 2004, also tackles this problem and calls for cooperation between the Member States to be stepped up."
"In this connection, the Council would like to refer to the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Bordersof the Member States of the European Union."
"On 26 October 2004, the Council adopted a regulation creating this agency, which will begin its activities on 1 May 2005."
"The agency will facilitate the application of both the existing and future Community provisions for external border management while ensuring that the Member States coordinate their actions when implementing these provisions."
"In 2002, the Council also adopted an overall plan for combating illegal immigration and human trafficking in the European Union, as well as a plan for integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union."
"Implementation of these plans is a priority for the Council and the Member States, the latter having stepped up their operational cooperation by means of a series of joint operations and pilot projects."
"A fundamental role was allocated to the External Border Practitioners Common Unit, which coordinated the implementation of the operations provided for in the plans."
"Within the framework of this common unit, two centres were set up to coordinate the joint measures and operations to be implemented at sea and in the ports."
"These are the western and eastern Maritime Border Centres, situated in, respectively, Spain and Greece."
"These two centres have conducted operations aimed at combating illegal immigration by sea."
"The Council would also like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the programme of measures, adopted on 27 November 2003, designed to combat illegal immigration by sea in the Member States of the European Union."
"This programme comprises a series of measures designed to perfect coordinated and effective maritime border management as quickly as possible."
"It also pointed out how important it was to strengthen international relations with third countries of origin or transit of illegal flows of immigrants."
"I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that the informal meeting of the JHA Council will basically be concerned with those issues."
"On 2 December 2004, the Council adopted conclusions evaluating the progress made with regard to the implementation of the programme of measures to combat illegal immigration by sea in the EU Member States."
"Although the Council noted that progress had been made in implementing this programme, it also concluded that there was a need for further progress in terms of the operational and legislative measures."
"What is more, the Council confirmed that it was necessary to strengthen cooperation with third countries by drawing upon the experience acquired by the different Member States."
"The Council suggested that such cooperation cover all aspects of illegal immigration, such as return and readmission, the fight against trafficking in human beings and the networks associated with such trafficking, all forms of illegal immigration, management of borders and the strengthening of capacities in the sphere of immigration control."
"I would like to begin by thanking the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Schmit, for the extensive information he has given us in his reply and also for his sensitivity, because, as a representative of an inland country, he has given us a great deal of information with regard to the European Union's maritime borders."
"In this respect, I would like to stress that Europe has an enormous sea border and point out that, on the seas bordering Europe, hundreds and thousands of people die tragically every year."
"We in the European Parliament have frequently called for the creation of a European coastguard service, which, as well as dealing with the needs of those people whose precarious situation obliges them to try to enter Europe by crossing our seas with difficulty, could also help to control the sea pollution affecting our coasts."
"Has the Council dealt with this issue?"
"What is its view of the European coastguard service?"
"I note the suggestion made by the honourable Member."
"I believe we must pursue the perhaps slightly more distant objective of setting up European coastguards."
"It was, moreover, with this in mind that the Border Control Agency was created."
"I would also, however, draw attention to the fact that, even if the coastguards were very efficient, the problem would remain."
"I think it is necessary to adopt a broader approach entailing, in particular, vigorous dialogue and close cooperation with third countries, as well as better and more effective control in the countries of transit and origin."
"As, moreover, was pointed out in the context of development aid and debt relief, the attempt must above all be made to tackle the causes of the acts of desperation to which you have referred."
"I am from a country near the sea, on the border of the European Union – Malta – and I understand that what you are saying is a step in the right direction in the medium and long term, however we need to understand that we are facing a crisis."
"The people in my country, as from April onwards, will be seeing people crossing over continuously, day after day."
"And many countries, like many countries on the border, do not have adequate resources to welcome these people in a decent manner, let alone to repatriate them or some other thing."
"This is a European problem, it is not a problem for the countries on the border."
"I would like the Council to tell us what it is doing to allocate funds in a concrete way so that our country and other countries on the border will be able to face this problem in a decent way."
"I fully understand the particular situation of a country like Malta which must indeed confront serious illegal immigration problems due to the arrival of people going there to seek asylum."
"I believe that this problem must be tackled through solidarity."
"In this connection, several measures must be taken: eventual improvement in the control of our maritime borders; the possible setting up of a European coastguard service; and the immediate creation of financial resources for the repatriation of people arriving in a country such as Malta."
"It is also, in my opinion, necessary, within the framework of the financial perspectives, to provide for the financial resources necessary for implementing a policy along these lines with a view to bringing European solidarity into play at this level."
"I repeat that this is one of the key topics of the next informal meeting of the ministers responsible for immigration, which will take place at the end of this month in Luxembourg."
"Currently the European Union's 25 members spend about £120 billion a year investing in research and development."
"Compared with more than £210 billion spent by the United States, this makes EU investment seem minimal."
"This imbalance is one of the factors contributing to a 'brain drain' of scientific talent from Europe to the US."
"The Kok report noted that nearly three-quarters of the world's leading IT companies were from the US."
"What action is the Council prepared to take to improve Europe's knowledge economy?"
"Madam President, we would draw the honourable Member’s attention to the recent conclusions, adopted within the framework of the Council, concerning the future of research policy: on the one hand, the Council conclusions of 24 September 2004 concerning European research policy and, on the other hand, the Presidency’s conclusions concerning future European policy on support for research – prepared at the Competitiveness Council on 25 and 26 November – which the large majority of delegations supported."
"The two documents describe in detail the Council’s opinion on the possible future development of European research policy."
"In its September conclusions, the Council also expressed its point of view regarding the Commission’s reply to the high level group of experts chaired by Professor Marimon, responsible for assessing the effectiveness of the instruments used to implement the Sixth Framework Programme."
"In these same conclusions, the Council emphasises that it is important to strengthen technological research and development at European level as an indispensable complement to the efforts made at national level, and it draws particular attention to the need to exercise a powerful leverage effect on private investment in research – an action the responsibility for which falls in large part to the Member States."
"The Council also emphasises the important role played by SMEs in terms of increasing the EU’s capacity for innovation and research and, in this context, recommends that simpler and less bureaucratic methods be applied for implementing the next framework programme."
"As the honourable Member no doubt knows, Europe’s lack of sufficient investment in scientific and technological development compared with the United States goes back many years, but the gap has widened since the middle of the 1990s."
"It is only since the adoption of the Lisbon Strategy, in 2000, and of the 3% investment objective, set in Barcelona in 2002, that sustained efforts, commensurate with the challenge to be faced, have been made."
"It should also be remembered that the European Union is beginning to take important measures to develop TRD activities in the fields of security policy and space policy."
"European research and development policy is a crucial element of the Lisbon Strategy, the importance of which has been emphasised, in particular, by the former Dutch Prime Minister, Wim Kok, in his report entitled ‘Facing the Challenge’, and which was also emphasised very explicitly this morning by the President of the European Council and by the President of the Commission."
"Within the framework of preparing for the spring European Council, the Council broadly concurs with the analysis made in the Kok report."
"Account will undoubtedly have to be taken of this in the Seventh TRD Framework Programme, which will probably be adopted during the first half of 2006 in codecision with the European Parliament."
"The form and scope of the next framework programme will, however, also depend upon the available funds which, as the honourable Member will appreciate, will depend in the first place upon the results of the discussions under way concerning the financial perspectives."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for an extremely comprehensive reply to my question."
"He referred to the Kok report, as I do in my question, but the report further recommended – as he will probably be aware – establishing a European research council, rather on the lines of the National Science Foundation in America."
"This would be an independent body, run by scientists and academics and providing grants for science, engineering and social sciences."
"It is something which might need funding of about EUR 2 billion a year."
"Will the Council be considering this at the meeting to which he referred in March?"
"Does he personally think it is a good idea?"
"And, if so, will he put his personal commitment behind it to persuade his colleagues in the 24 other countries that this is an idea worth pursuing."
"Madam President, I shall reply on a personal basis, since you are addressing me directly."
"I think that it is a good idea."
"In my view, more needs to be done to evaluate the research programmes implemented."
"This factor must be taken into account when discussing the preparation of the Seventh Framework Plan for research and the increase in funds, which I hope will be substantial, within the framework of the next financial perspectives."
"I believe that this idea deserves to be looked at more closely and submitted to the Council’s decision-making bodies."
"On the occasion of an invitation to a reception in which the Patriarch of Constantinople was referred to as 'ecumenical', the Turkish Government issued a circular requesting that no State official should attend and stated that 'we consider it an error for one of our citizens to issue invitations, using titles which he does not possess and which are conferred on him from abroad'."
"Furthermore, information was made public recently that the new national security doctrine in Turkey will state that 'efforts to overcome the existing regime of the Patriarchate and re-open the Chalki Theological School must be resisted'."
"Attacks of this kind against the Ecumenical Patriarchate are becoming increasingly frequent and demonstrate that Turkey's position on the above matters is inflexible, despite the fact that for the European Union they constitute an important criterion for democratisation in Turkey."
"How does the Council intend to intervene directly to protect the Ecumenical Patriarchate, given that statements of this kind have, even very recently, triggered acts of terrorism and 'spontaneous' demonstrations by extremist elements against the Ecumenical Patriarchate?"
"The Council points out that, within the framework of the Accession Partnership revised and adopted in May 2003, one of the things that Turkey must do is to create the conditions in which non-Muslim religious communities are able to operate properly, and this in accordance with the practice in force in the Member States of the European Union."
"Although religious freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, as indicated by the European Commission in its 2004 Regular Report, non-Muslim religious communities, including the Ecumenical Patriarchate, continue, however, to encounter obstacles and are subject to a bureaucratic regime."
"In spite of the progress achieved in this area, the problems of the legal status of non-Muslim communities, of the registration of property ownership and of the training of the clergy remain unresolved at the present stage."
"The new overall legislation needed to remedy these problems is being prepared."
"In this connection, a government bill on foundations is at present being examined by the Turkish Government."
"The Turkish authorities have recently indicated that they would invite the Commission to formulate its observations on this bill, something which constitutes a very positive development."
"The honourable Member is aware that the European Council decided on 17 December that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria for accession negotiations to be opened on condition that it brought into force the six legislative texts designated by the Commission."
"The European Council invited the Commission to present the Council with a proposal relating to a framework for negotiations with Turkey on the basis of the factors listed in the Presidency’s conclusions adopted at the end of its meeting."
"The Council was then invited to reach an agreement on this framework with a view to opening the negotiations on 3 October 2005 in accordance with the procedures indicated in the European Council’s conclusions."
"The effective and overall implementation of the process of political reforms will continue to be carefully monitored by the Commission."
"All the contentious issues listed in the Commission’s Periodic Report and recommendation, including that of freedom of religion, will be tackled in the reports to be submitted periodically by the Commission to the Council."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my heartfelt thanks for your detailed reply."
"However, given that, as you noted in your reply, the status of non-Muslim communities, the registration of property and the question of the training of clerics have yet to be addressed, I should like to ask you this: do you consider the progress made in this sector to be satisfactory or inadequate?"
"If the Council does not consider it to be satisfactory, what do you intend to do so that we have better results in future?"
"Madam President, I think that the exercise of religious freedom should be guaranteed by all the Member States and by all the candidate countries."
"As I said to you, the Council will follow very closely the implementation of the legislation that has not yet been definitively adopted in Turkey."
"When the time comes, the Commission will have to report to the Council on any failure in this area."
"If Turkey remains in default, vigorous dialogue with that state will, of course, be necessary in order that it comply with this criterion, such compliance being crucial to a country’s being admitted to the European Union."
"How does the Council intend to proceed with regard to the adoption of the common position on the proposal for a directive on computer-implemented inventions, in the light of the fact that the Polish Government has stated that it is unable to support the current proposal, the new weighting of votes introduced by the Treaty of Nice is now in force and therefore without Poland's agreement the necessary majority in favour of adoption of the common position on the basis of the political agreement reached by the Council on 18 May is no longer in place, and in the light of the fact that the Netherlands Parliament is calling for the approval given for the common position to be withdrawn and of the fact that all four political groups in the German Bundestag are calling, in an inter-party motion for a resolution, for a number of amendments to be made to the text of the directive."
"Is the Council aware that this fragile agreement also completely ignores the position of the European Parliament?"
"Madam President, the Council wishes to emphasise that, contrary to the opinion of the honourable Member according to which the Council’s draft common position totally ignores the position of the European Parliament, the Council proceeded, when preparing its draft common position, carefully to examine the amendments proposed by the European Parliament at first reading and retained several of these."
"Regarding the adoption of its common position, the Council would inform the honourable Member that this has been postponed to a later date at the request of a Member State, and this in order to give the latter more time to prepare a statement that will appear in the minutes of one of the forthcoming sittings of the Council."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in reply to your comments I would merely like to say that the proposal we currently have on the table does not take sufficient account of Parliament’s resolution."
"This is also becoming apparent within the Council, as if it did we would not have seen increasing criticism over the past few weeks, for example in the Dutch and German parliaments and in Poland, of the political agreement reached within the Council."
"I should therefore like to ask whether the present proposal you are drafting will differ in any way from what we have already seen."
"I should also like to ask which rules will be used as a basis for voting within the Council, or in other words whether or not the Nice rules will be used."
"Madam President, I believe there are still contacts between the Council and the European Parliament."
"A number of questions – informal ones, admittedly – were put to me on this subject this morning, scarcely a few hours ago."
"I think you are putting a very precise question to me."
"I believe that it is qualified majority voting that will apply."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should also like to return to the comments you made which suggested that the directive currently being decided on and debated within the Council is in line with Parliament’s wishes."
"This is far from being the case."
"If the majority voting rules are taken into account it is no longer even in line with the Council’s wishes, as there is no longer a majority in favour of the proposal."
"Could you please explain how you propose to deal with this state of affairs within the Council, which is far from satisfactory in terms of the directive’s content and which has negative implications for the entire IT sector?"
"I told you just now that the Council or the Presidency is not opposed to the idea of negotiations with the European Parliament, on the understanding however – and I emphasise this – that if this country can make its statement – and it can do so at one of the next Council sittings – the Council should, in theory, come to a decision on a qualified majority basis."
"Within the European Union there are languages with a centuries-old history which are neither national nor official EU languages but which nonetheless often have many speakers living in different regions in a variety of Member States."
"In those regions, such languages sometimes enjoy official status and in certain cases they have a number of speakers, a literary tradition and a vitality comparable to those of national languages which enjoy official EU status, even though the latter may actually have only a similar or even a smaller number of speakers."
"In view of the fact that respect for linguistic diversity is one of the EU's democratic and cultural foundations (as acknowledged in Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights: 'The Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity') and since – in accordance with the EU's values – it would therefore be wrong to discriminate against a language merely on the grounds that it is not spoken throughout a Member State, does the Council not think that the EU should take greater account of the realities of such languages?"
"The Spanish Government has already submitted a Memorandum calling for the language arrangements within the EU institutions to be amended in order to accommodate Spain's co-official languages."
"What attitude is the Council likely to adopt in response to such a request?"
"In accordance with Article 53 of the Treaty on European Union, Article 314 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 225 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, there are at present 21 official source languages in which the founding treaties are written, each of these languages being deemed equally authentic."
"In accordance with Article 290 of the EC Treaty, the Council, acting unanimously, determines the rules governing the languages of the Community, without prejudice to the provisions contained in the Statute of the Court of Justice."
"In application of these rules, there are at present 20 official languages and working languages of the EU institutions."
"The Official Journal of the European Union is published in all 20 official languages."
"In theory, the linguistic rules are adapted within the framework of the enlargement negotiations."
"There is no legal obstacle to the accession of a new Member State’s entailing the addition of more than one new official language."
"On 23 November 2004, Ireland presented the Council with a proposal aimed at modifying Regulation No 1/58 with a view to adding the Irish language, which is one of the 21 languages referred to in paragraph 1, to the 20 official languages referred to in paragraph 2."
"On 13 December 2004, the Spanish Government presented the Council with a request aimed at granting official recognition in the EU to the following languages:"
"‘Basque, Galician and the language known as Catalan in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia and in the Balearic Islands and known as Valencian in the Valencian Community’."
"Please excuse my poor pronunciation."
"To this end, the Spanish Government proposed making certain changes to Regulation No 1/58."
". Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have listened carefully to what you have said."
"Including the part of your speech in Spanish, with a pronunciation that I appreciated and that was very correct."
"This, however, is the question put by my colleague to the Presidency and to which, in her absence – she is, in fact, ill – I shall again draw the House’s attention: what will be your attitude regarding the request presented by the Spanish Government?"
"...in other words, do you believe there is any possibility of reaching a consensus amongst the representatives of the Council in relation to something which may represent a step forward on this issue."
"The Council has not yet touched on this issue."
"I think a pragmatic approach is necessary."
"These proposals – Ireland’s and the Spanish Government’s – certainly need to be examined."
"I cannot judge in advance the result to be arrived at by the Council."
"I refer to the statement annexed to the text of the Constitution, which offers, in a way, a pragmatic approach to the problem."
"It is my hope and desire that, if this route is embarked upon, a solution acceptable to everyone will be arrived at."
"Clearly there is a danger, now that Spain and Ireland have made their requests, that other Member States will follow through."
"In my own country of Scotland we have Gaelic as a minority language, and in Wales there is a different version of Gaelic as a minority language."
"In the interim, subject to the final settlement of this at Community level, I wonder whether the presidency would encourage Member States collectively to print key Community documents, such as the Constitution, and key legislative texts in all the minority languages of their Member State."
"Then it would not be a Community burden; it would be a burden on the Member States."
"That would be a pragmatic way of getting round this difficulty."
"Honourable Member, first of all, I am in the peculiar situation of being, myself, a speaker of a minority language that is neither a working language nor, moreover, a language in which the Treaties are written."
"I therefore understand, to a certain extent, the problem raised."
"I must add that it will in fact be possible to publish the basic legal texts, the Treaties and – one day, I hope – the Constitution in all the languages of the European Union."
"I believe it is necessary to continue down that road."
"This is, moreover, something of that pragmatic approach I suggested to the honourable Member from Spain."
"What action does the Council propose taking so as to ensure that the EU Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflict are properly implemented?"
"Madam President, the Council is actively following the implementation of the European Union Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflict and has also recently published a document providing an update on the situation, as well as an action plan."
"This document offers a general survey of the actions carried out in 2004 by the European Union and its Member States, particularly in the areas of technical assistance, political instruments for crisis management, and cooperation with the UN, NGOs and other international organisations."
"It also contains an action plan aimed at translating the general objectives of the Guidelines into more specific political and practical undertakings on the part of the European Union."
"Its objective is to reconcile technical assistance and political action by revealing deficiencies and the opportunities for increased cooperation regarding this issue."
"For the time being, such action is intended for a number of countries in which children are particularly affected by armed conflicts: Burundi, Colombia, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Burma and Nepal."
"I thank the President-in-Office for the clarity of his answer in listing the countries concerned."
"It is precisely those countries that are the subject of many representations received by Members."
"We now believe that the problem of child soldiers is not a marginal problem."
"We now know that this is a commonplace phenomenon in countries other than those he has actually mentioned, for example in the Middle East."
"We expect the Luxembourg presidency, and indeed the UK presidency, to maintain this issue at the top of the agenda."
"Any country currently experiencing difficulties, such as Sri Lanka, has this problem."
"We can see that on our television screens."
"I urge the Council not to treat this as a marginal issue, but to maintain it at the top of development issues, as well as foreign affairs issues, during the Luxembourg presidency."
"I thank him again for giving such a clear answer."
"I can assure the honourable Member that the Luxembourg Presidency attaches very great importance to this issue and that it will keep it on the agenda."
"Madam President, on a point of order, this is not a criticism of you or the Luxembourg presidency, but of the way we organise the business in this House."
"Too often we see Question Time as an expendable part of our activities."
"For humble backbenchers, it is sometimes the only opportunity that we get to put questions to the Commission and the Council and to get direct responses."
"It is a shame if we continue to allow this process of squeezing Question Time out of our business. I would ask you to raise this with the Bureau."
"You are entirely right, Mr Martin, and I share your views on the matter."
"After your many years of experience in this House, however, you will of course be aware that other items were delayed considerably. This resulted once again in an extremely short Question Time, as the President-in-Office of the Council must now hurry straight off to his next meeting."
"I will, however, take a note of your comments, and raise the matter with the Bureau as requested."
"I should like to give the floor to Mr Ryan, who also wishes to speak on this issue."
"This is the second time this has happened to me and the third time it has happened to my colleague Mr Aylward."
"If Question Time starts late, then it should continue for a certain specific amount of time."
"This is not happening, and it is not good enough."
"It is frequently the case that the Council or Commission representatives who are present are more than willing to remain in the Chamber a little longer, and to run over the allotted time."
"There is, however, nothing I can do about the fact that they have to go to another meeting, and hence do not have any extra time."
"I should like to thank you once again for your comments."
"We will take this very seriously, and will request that all Members keep to their speaking times and do not allow debates to overrun."
"Mrs Figueiredo, you arrived too late and were not present when the question was called, and therefore I cannot put your question now."
"– Madam President, I apologise for intervening, but the session did not start at the appointed time – I was here at that time – and given that I had another debate in the meantime, only now I am able to request that you agree to debate the crucially important textiles issue and that I can speak, albeit briefly, on this issue."
"If I were to allow this now, merely because the President-in-Office of the Council is nodding, I would violate the rules, as the Member must be present when a question is called."
"It is a long time since Question No 5 should have been called, and we started a great deal too late, not too early."
"It should therefore have been possible for you to arrive here in time."
"Questions Nos 8 to 25 will be answered in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The sitting is closed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, good morning."
"Yesterday an event occurred which caused something of a sensation."
"At around 3.00 p.m., Mr Batten made a statement about an incident in which members of our security staff were alleged to have been involved, and this provoked discussion which became very heated."
"The President has, within the 24 hours stipulated by Rule 166, come to a decision, which I will now communicate to you."
"The Quaestors have already been informed of yesterday’s incident, and it will be investigated by them."
"They will be interviewing all the persons involved in it, and will then submit a report on it to the President."
"I therefore take it as read that this incident can, for today, be regarded as closed, since there will be an investigation."
"We can therefore proceed with the agenda as normal."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the results of the Ukraine elections."
". Mr President, it is an honour and pleasure for me to present the Commission's view on the presidential elections in Ukraine."
"More than seven weeks have now passed since what is commonly described as Ukraine's Orange Revolution."
"The events during that period have shown that the people of Ukraine are committed to democracy and also that the EU Member States, by acting together, can play an important role."
"Let me turn now to three questions."
"First, how far has Ukraine come since the first running of the second round of the elections on 21 November 2004, and what does this mean for the country in the future?"
"Second, what role has the EU played to assist Ukraine to find a peaceful solution to the crisis?"
"Third, what are the challenges now in European Union-Ukraine relations?"
"I shall begin with the developments in Ukraine and what they mean for the future."
"Most importantly, Ukraine has succeeded in finding a peaceful solution to the crisis it faced after the serious shortcomings in the conduct of the presidential elections and, notably, the first run of the second round on 21 November."
"The situation posed a threat to the country's legal framework and its territorial integrity, but both of these were preserved."
"The International Election Observation Mission, led by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, found that the re-run of the second round of the presidential elections on 26 December brought Ukraine closer to international standards. That is a positive sign."
"The political compromise reached on 8 December 2004 was important in that it paved the way for a new second round of the presidential elections."
"It is our firm hope that the compromise will also help promote further democratisation in Ukraine."
"Important constitutional changes were agreed, establishing the framework for the country's internal development in the years ahead, and the role of Ukraine's parliament has been strengthened."
"Recent events have demonstrated the Ukrainian people's strong attachment to democracy."
"We very much welcome this development."
"Further efforts will be needed to build on this and to take the democratisation process forward in the years ahead."
"We very much hope that the conduct of the parliamentary elections next year will reflect further progress towards democratisation."
"Now the second question: how has the EU helped Ukraine to find a peaceful solution?"
"The EU has given sustained political support to help the people of Ukraine find a peaceful outcome to the crisis."
"It spoke with one voice, urging the Ukrainian authorities to show restraint and all parties to express themselves exclusively by non-violent means."
"The EU also helped to prepare the ground for the political compromise of 8 December 2004, with European mediators, including High Representative Mr Solana, Polish President, Mr Kwasniewski, and the Lithuanian President, Mr Adamkus, playing a very useful facilitating role."
"The European Union also made a major contribution, together with the broader international community, to help ensure that the re-run of the second round of the elections would be fair and free."
"In concrete terms, the EU sent 587 short-term election observers from the EU Member States for the elections on 26 December."
"The participation in the election observation of a team of nine Members of the European Parliament, led by Mr Siwiec, was an important contribution."
"The European Commission financed the participation of a further 150 short-term observers from the non-EU OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Member States, as well as voter education activities."
"Overall, the EU played a highly significant role in helping secure correct conduct of the elections on 26 December."
"Finally, what are the challenges ahead in European Union-Ukraine relations?"
"Clearly, now is the time to take a fresh look at our relationship with Ukraine as a key neighbour and partner of the European Union."
"Through the developments of the past weeks the people of Ukraine have already clearly demonstrated their commitment to the development of Ukraine into a society that fully respects democracy and fundamental freedoms."
"However, this is only the beginning of a long process which will require our continued support."
"The question of Ukraine entering the European Union is not on the agenda."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy is distinct from membership."
"It will allow us to shift to a higher gear in cooperation with Ukraine."
"Within the framework of the European Union-Ukraine Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, it opens new partnership and economic integration and cooperation perspectives and offers significant upgrading in our relationships."
"The key tool for putting this into practice is the action plan."
"Last December, the Council endorsed the EU-Ukraine ENP Action Plan and agreed to forward it to the European Union-Ukraine Cooperation Council 'as soon as developments in Ukraine allowed'."
"We all believe that the time has come to move ahead with this action plan."
"It identifies key priorities such as further strengthening the stability and effectiveness of the institutions, guaranteeing democracy and the rule of law, ensuring the democratic conduct of elections in Ukraine in accordance with OSCE standards, and ensuring respect for the freedom of the media and freedom of expression."
"It also provides a comprehensive programme for our work with Ukraine in all areas of cooperation, with actions identified in the fields of political dialogue, justice and home affairs, economic and trade relations, people-to-people contacts, cross-border activities and shared responsibility in conflict prevention and conflict resolution."
"We hope that the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council meeting on 21 February will endorse this action plan, thereby paving the way for Ukraine and us to begin work on its implementation."
"At the Council's request, the High Representative and the Commissioner are working on concrete proposals to strengthen cooperation with Ukraine making full use of the action plan, thus enhancing Ukraine's relationship with the European Union."
"From the Commission's point of view, this proposal should, as far as possible, also take into account Ukraine's requests."
"The Commission is convinced that the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan is a sufficiently comprehensive and flexible tool to allow us to respond to the new situation."
"The offer the EU makes in the action plan can be modulated to reflect the progress made by the partner."
"The further a partner is ready to go in taking practical steps to implement common values, the further the EU will be ready to go in strengthening our mutual links."
"The pace of progress in the ENP will thus depend on the pace of progress made by the new Ukrainian administration."
"There is therefore no need to renegotiate the action plan with that administration."
"The EU has repeatedly acknowledged Ukraine's European aspirations and welcomed Ukraine's European choice."
"Recent dramatic events in Ukraine have reconfirmed the country's place on the European map."
"We have no doubt that these events will enter into history as a milestone, not only for Ukraine but also for the EU's relations with that country."
"The European Union and Ukraine have a common interest in further reinforcing their political, economic and cultural ties."
"If Ukraine fully respects its commitments, as expressed in the action plan, the Commission is willing to help ensure that the European Neighbourhood Policy results in significantly enhanced relations between the European Union and Ukraine."
"We trust that the European Parliament will support us in all these efforts."
"Mr President, after a little less than two months Ukraine has again become a topic of debate in this House."
"This is an important sign, which reflects our interest in the changes and our positive attitude towards them."
"It also reflects the special role played by the European Parliament, which was one of the first to react to the victory of democracy in Ukraine."
"The time for words is past, and it is now time for action."
"The empty chair of the Luxembourg Presidency, which has chosen to be absent during this debate, is telling."
"During a debate held in this House yesterday, I highlighted the fact that there is no mention whatsoever of Ukraine in the Luxembourg Presidency’s list of priorities."
"I am also deeply disappointed at the extremely conservative, modest and static position adopted by the European Commission on this issue."
"Given the changes that have taken place, it would be wholly inadequate to offer Ukraine the old Action Plan."
"Democracy and values that are also shared by us have triumphed in Ukraine, and this calls for a change in the European Union’s approach to the country."
"We must offer Ukraine a new strategy and a new quality of relations, which means that we need new instruments, not instruments negotiated with President Yanukovych’s government in a previous era."
"The numerous expressions of sympathy and support should be transformed into decisive and rapid action, and it should not be forgotten that time is a key factor."
"We cannot afford to wait, and we must move beyond mere rhetoric."
"We therefore expect both the Council and the Commission to undertake immediate measures."
"The old Action Plan drawn up in a previous era is no longer appropriate to the new conditions in the country, and therefore needs to be revised and extended beyond the scope of the neighbourhood policy."
"We should support Ukraine in its attempt to achieve market economy status, and ensure that a free-trade zone is created between the European Union and Ukraine."
"The latter should be helped to gain membership of the World Trade Organisation and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), and to approximate its legislation to that of the European Union."
"Political dialogue should be initiated on structural issues and, as part of this dialogue, talks opened with Ukraine on energy security and the fight against terrorism."
"A simplified visa regime should be considered for the country, and an Association Agreement with Ukraine should replace the Action Plan."
"Work on such an Association Agreement should begin now, so that it will be possible to replace the Action Plan after three years."
"Finally, we should offer Ukraine the prospect of membership."
"These measures should act as a strong incentive for continuing and far-reaching political and economic reforms in Ukraine."
"This is in our clear interest, and in the interest of the victory of democracy across Eastern Europe."
"I thank you."
". Mr President, it is with satisfaction that we in this Parliament can today welcome the outcome of the third round of the presidential elections in Ukraine."
"What has come out of the crisis in Ukraine is a major victory for democracy and freedom in a country which has, over the past decade, always been on the brink of becoming an autocratic state."
"Moreover, it is a pleasant surprise for the European Union and not least for this House, both of which have played a major role in the positive outcome of the events in Ukraine."
"At long last, democracy has done what it is meant to do in Ukraine."
"Since the Ukrainians were able to speak out freely about the direction their country was going in, the outcome reflects the will of the people."
"What has happened in Ukraine over the past few months is a fundamental departure, a sort of democratic uprising which has not culminated in violence, as is often the case elsewhere, and for that we should be grateful to all those involved."
"This is the beginning of a new chapter in the development of Ukraine."
"The new president’s government should, as its first task, entrench democracy and the rule of law, as well as develop the economy."
"I believe we are all agreed that the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, implement the action plan which the European Commission has tabled in the framework of the neighbourhood policy in order to strengthen our ties with Ukraine as much as we can in this context."
"It follows that the maximum use must be made of the scope offered by this action plan."
"It was, though, not only Ukraine to which these events posed a major challenge."
"The European Union will need to reconsider its approach to Ukraine."
"It is no longer sufficient for the EU simply to intensify the limited dialogue which has always been maintained, despite the outgoing President Kuchma’s policies, with the former regime."
"Europe is now facing the task of changing political relations with Ukraine, for the country has elected a president who has never concealed his European orientation and aspirations."
"Those who marched in favour of democracy, marched in favour of Brussels rather than Moscow, and I think that we should give due consideration to this in our policy."
"I share the view expressed by Mr Saryusz-Wolski of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we should really ask ourselves whether the Commission’s policy, as described by Commissioner Potočnik, is ambitious enough."
"In any event, the resolution which Parliament is discussing today goes quite a bit further than what the Commission and Council have been prepared to do so far."
"What also matters at the moment is that we give active support to those in Ukraine who really want to carry out reforms."
"They will need to take a number of difficult decisions, and support from the European Union, clear signals from the European Union, can certainly help them to do that."
"We have taken much of the responsibility for a good outcome of the elections."
"We are now also responsible for the further consolidation of democracy in that country."
"I should like to add that what has happened in Ukraine comes at a time when we need to revisit the EU’s policy with regard to all countries in that region, and gives us cause to do so."
"It is also important to formulate responses, and to anticipate questions that Ukraine, and also the other countries in that region, will certainly be raising."
". Mr President, Commissioner, 26 December was a great day for Ukraine, a great day for the EU and naturally also a great day for democracy."
"It was a great day for Ukraine, because following weeks of peaceful protests, and despite especially foul weather conditions, it was decided to hold a third round of presidential elections."
"Eventually, all those involved agreed to this with great maturity."
"It was an important moment for the European Union, because its unanimous action made it possible to achieve a positive outcome, and also because the European Union made most of the efforts in the field of electoral observation, to which my group has, of course, also contributed."
"Finally, the correct manner in which the elections were conducted made it an especially great day for democracy."
"I should like to underline that 300 000 Ukrainians were also involved in this electoral observation, which is quite a gigantic effort."
"The run-up to the elections as a whole made Ukraine a stronger society."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise that there will also be a great need for free and independent media, and that the new president and the government that is to be formed will need to set to building and strengthening the market economy and the constitutional state."
"I am not sure if I understood you correctly, Commissioner, when you said that the action plan offers plenty of scope for intensifying relations between the European Union and Ukraine."
"I should like to have this confirmed by you, because, should that not be the case, let it be clear that we too would call for the action plan to be renegotiated."
"I would like to finish off by reminding you of Article 49 of the Treaty of the European Union, which stipulates that a European country, provided it meets the conditions, can apply for membership of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you have replied to the question I was asking myself."
"What, now, are we to do with our Ukrainian friends who have turned towards Europe?"
"The fact is that, in the streets and in the icy cold, the Ukrainian people have, in the course of a month, chosen the camp in which they are to build their future: the camp of democracy, non-violence and Europe."
"I believe that Mr Yushchenko’s victory is a victory for our European values."
"I myself was one of the 1 200 OSCE observers who oversaw the poll on 26 December, not in Kiev but in Belgrade, in the Odessa region situated close to the border with Romania and Moldova, where certain villages are neither Russian nor Ukrainian-speaking."
"Thanks to the new law that has been put in place, the way in which it had been possible to prepare for the second round of the presidential elections was remarkable."
"We noted how smoothly matters went at the polling stations when the votes were being counted, and we were able to keep track of the ballot papers until they were finally recorded by the Regional Committees."
"Ukraine’s unshakeable desire to join the ranks of democracy will cause a shake-up in our policies, Commissioner."
"One has only to read the plan of the new team I was able to meet at the conclusion of our mission."
"I can inform you of their proposals."
"Of the two objectives that emerge very clearly, the first is integration into the European Union, an issue already being examined by working parties."
"The second is decentralisation, which should prevent the country from splitting."
"Nor must the massive trauma of Chernobyl be forgotten."
"I am therefore surprised, Commissioner, at your speech removing this prospect from Ukraine."
"With their orange revolution, the Ukrainian people have raised, and are raising now, the issue of our capacity to respond to the aspirations created by ourselves."
"Just recently, and with more than 70% of the vote, we again gave a huge endorsement to Article 1 of the Constitution, stating that ‘[t]he Union shall be open to all European States which respect its values and are committed to promoting them together’."
"We need now to reflect upon the relevance of the New Neighbourhood Policy for countries such as Ukraine if they have no prospects of accession."
"I think it would be a mistake to send them this message."
"For us, Ukraine definitely has its place as an EU Member State."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament played a political role in Ukraine."
"Whether we can be proud of our involvement will become apparent from future events, yet what does the future hold?"
"First and foremost, Ukrainians are aware that the European Union lent its support to Mr Yushchenko."
"The handshakes with Mr Yushchenko before cameras on Independence Square and the orange orgy in this House, to which the media devoted much space, made it quite plain to Ukrainians that we were not neutral."
"If it were merely democracy that had been at stake, MEPs would not have got dressed up in orange."
"Once Mr Yushchenko takes office as the new president, any criticism of him will also be directed at the European Union as the force that helped him to victory."
"Questions will also soon start to be asked, and in fact have already been asked, pertaining to the sources of funding for the Orange Revolution."
"Thirty-three thousand of Mr Yushchenko’s representatives in district electoral committees were provided with satellite phones, yet who paid for them?"
"Tents and food were supplied to the demonstrators in Kiev, yet who paid for them?"
"We have been told that President Yanukovych brought his supporters in from Donbas on buses, almost certainly paid for with state funds, but who paid for Mr Yushchenko’s supporters to get to Kiev, and on what form of transport?"
"Ukraine is a poor country, and all this must have been funded by someone."
"Russia, the USA and the European Union are all accusing each other of interfering in the affairs of others."
"As it becomes increasingly apparent that Mr Yushchenko is unable to fulfil all the expectations held of him, more and more criticism will be directed at the European Parliament, as it was the most visible external force that became involved on Mr Yushchenko’s behalf."
"Questions will also be asked regarding the external bodies that profited most from Mr Yushchenko’s election."
"Ukraine is currently a poor country, but it has the potential to become a rich one."
"Who will try to get their hands on this wealth?"
"Who will exploit it, and how much will the Ukrainian people profit from this?"
"It is time for us to realise that there is still a long way to go until the political situation in Ukraine is stabilised, and the use of force is still a possibility."
"It is to be hoped that the methods of dialogue and mediation will become established as standard features of political life."
"Yet are we in a position to guarantee this?"
"If the situation were to culminate in the use of force, what would we do then?"
"I hope the people of Ukraine will find answers to their problems in a peaceful fashion, and I hope the changes that have taken place there will yield positive results."
"If they do not, the European Parliament will share in the blame."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament played an extremely significant role in the set of events now known as the Orange Revolution."
"Our donning of the colour orange and the visits made by many of us to Ukraine were not expressions of support for one of the candidates, and this is something that should be stated very clearly."
"Irrespective of political differences within this House, as I see it, we did not stand up for one specific political candidate or participate in political debates within Ukraine."
"What we did do, however, was to support democracy and the process of democracy."
"If we had been sure that President Yanukovych had been victorious in a fair and democratic election, we would have respected the choice made by Ukraine."
"By becoming involved and helping the Ukrainian people, we supported democracy and freedom ..."
"and demonstrated our respect for Ukrainians, who showed enormous courage and determination in defending the values which are shared by people from Ukraine to Portugal and throughout our entire continent."
"I should like to make it very clear that the courage shown by Ukrainians during the weeks of the Orange Revolution should now be shown by the European institutions."
"Unfortunately, after the Commissioner’s speech today I can only conclude that, to put it mildly, we still lack this courage."
"The people of Ukraine made it very obvious that their choice related to matters of geopolitics and civilisation, and that they wish to be part of our Community, whilst being aware that this is not a political act that can take place rapidly and painlessly."
"Realistically, this House must admit that it is a process that will necessarily last some time."
"Yet Ukrainians, and many of the European Union’s citizens, now expect the EU institutions to offer Ukraine the prospect of membership in the European Union."
"I thank you."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I too have been able to assist with monitoring the elections in Ukraine and I can now report, as an observer, that the elections were free and democratic."
"I should like to point out that I know what I am talking about."
"As a member of the Council of Europe, I have for ten years had the opportunity to monitor various elections and this has been a critical period for some countries, I might mention the elections in Croatia, Albania or even the last parliamentary elections in Ukraine."
"In comparison with all these elections, it can be said that the elections were well prepared, the atmosphere was calm, they were transparent and monitored by observers for both candidates."
"The majority achieved in the results of the election show that the president was indeed elected."
"This does not mean a victory for the west or a defeat for the east."
"It can be said that the Ukrainians were victorious."
"Ukraine now has the feeling for the first time that it has achieved independence, that it has come of age as a state."
"The saying goes: ‘Glory to the victor, honour to the vanquished!’"
"It is important now for the Ukrainian president to unite the nation in an effort to revive the historical importance which Ukraine has always enjoyed in Europe, to make it an important bridge between the European Union and Russia."
"And of course, I also support the proposal made here for Ukraine to become a future member of the European Union, but only if its citizens so wish, of course."
"I support the proposal made by the president of our delegation, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, that a committee should be formed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I regret that we are unable to welcome a representative of Mr Solana, whose work in Ukraine has met with success."
"There, a people has stirred itself into action and, using peaceful means, forced the holding of free elections."
"Those who have seen the young people in Kiev’s tent camps cannot deny that this was accomplished – and was exemplary in showing what can be accomplished – with the persuasive power that peaceful democrats possess, and that this was comparable to the situation in which many of our peoples found themselves in 1989, 1990 and 1991."
"Let us be in no doubt that we in this House helped to bring this about, as did the other institutions, which we had to win over in order that they might join in. Moreover, it has to be clear to us that this happened in order to set in motion a democratic process and, at the same time, to enable Ukraine to decide where it belongs."
"The fact is that, ever since the Helsinki Final Act, the vitally important thing about Europe is that every country possesses the right of self-determination – but its people have to fight for it."
"Where it goes once it has it is for the people themselves to decide."
"We should no longer be thinking in terms of spheres of influence."
"In this Europe of ours, of course, balances have to be struck and bridges built in order to prevent new tensions from arising, including with our great neighbours in the East."
"If this is to work, we have to support the democratically elected President in such a way that it becomes apparent to his own people that deciding for democracy is worth it, and that there are rewards to be found in looking westwards."
"For that, the action plan is inadequate, and we have to do a lot more thinking."
"It must surely involve Ukraine having the prospect of joining the EU, and whether or not to do so it will have to decide for itself."
"That means, though, that the European Union must create the conditions under which that can happen – and this is where I urge this House to help."
"Today, a remarkably large number of those who supported the idea of Ukraine joining the European Union were the same people who, yesterday, did not vote in favour of the Constitution."
"We must put ourselves in a position to welcome other countries as members; today, we are not, and we have to wait until things are really up and running in the ten new Member States."
"That is why we need to add to full membership the development of other options, such as Article 47 and a sensible neighbourhood policy including the possibility of participation in the European Economic Area."
"If this is done in the right way, Moldova too will soon be moving towards democracy, as well as – I hope in the next few years – Belarus."
"We will end up with what happened in the Balkans happening on a wider scale, and to these countries we must offer something; not just membership in 20 years’ time, but something that is meaningful today."
"I also ask the Commission and the Council to address this issue with less reticence and more imagination."
"Mr President, the proposals put forward by the Commissioner in his introductory speech could lead one to believe that relations between the European Union and Ukraine are following a timetable drawn up for a train journey in the days of steam."
"Today, Mr Potočnik, trains are powered by modern electric motors."
"If we cannot offer Ukraine a modern electric locomotive, we should at least offer it a decent diesel one."
"We need a new Action Plan, with a new timetable where the terminus station is membership."
"There may well be other stations along the way, but membership should be the terminus."
"The Delegation to the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, which I have the honour of chairing and which is appointed by the European Parliament, will work to achieve such a timetable."
"We have been presented with an opportunity to fan the flames of the people’s revolution in yet another European country."
"It is a revolution that did not begin in 1989, but in 1980 in Poland."
"In order to support this process, the Ukrainian people and their new government need to make clear declarations and demonstrate their determination and willingness to undergo sacrifices."
"We will listen carefully to what Mr Yushchenko says as president, not on Independence Square, but when he is sworn in."
"Renewed institutional support is needed for market and democratic reforms, and this is a task for Europe and the international financial institutions."
"We must hold realistic talks and cooperate with the United States, and we must also hold realistic talks with Russia in order to ensure that it views the developing situation in Ukraine as an opportunity and not merely a threat."
"Courage and caution are needed."
"The revolution in Ukraine has come to an end."
"We should not forget that the divisions it brought to light cannot be described in simple terms, with the ‘goodies’ on one side of the barricades and the ‘baddies’ on the other."
"In the end, both sides took part in round-table talks and resolved the problem peacefully, with the Supreme Court, the President and other institutions being involved in this process."
"New elections were held, and a new President was elected, whom we recognise as such."
"Work is now getting underway to put the revolutionary slogans into practice, and the consent of both the opposing camps is needed."
"A better Ukraine cannot be built without the 44% of voters who supported Mr Yanukovych."
"Finally, a large country is always a source of uncertainty and a threat to cowards, but a source of interest and opportunity to adventurers."
"We should take our place amongst the adventurers."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, yesterday the President of the Commission said that none of us want to have to speak of Europe as being timid and apprehensive."
"I would ask this House to regard Mr Barroso’s statements yesterday as also relating to Ukraine, as this is another instance in which we should not be timid and apprehensive."
"We do not all fully appreciate what happened in Ukraine."
"I am aware that Ukraine is a long way away, and that it is a country with which we are unfamiliar."
"We know a great deal about Cuba or Iraq, and almost nothing about Ukraine."
"Yet Ukraine is a powerful country in Eastern Europe, and recent events in this country can easily be compared to another fall of the Berlin Wall, albeit the Berlin Wall in the East."
"Up until the Orange Revolution, democratic principles were unheard of to the east of the European Union, with the exception of the tiny country of Georgia."
"They remain unheard of today in Russia and Belarus, as well as in the other former Soviet republics."
"Apart from the tiny country of Georgia, which dared to make a stand for democracy a year ago, the only other place where such principles are currently adhered to is a powerful country of 50 million inhabitants."
"This country covers an area greater than that of France, and its people vigorously and resolutely called for democratic principles to be applied in practice and not just on paper."
"This is a major revolution, and our actions should be equal to these events."
"Up until now, the European Union’s actions have indeed been equal to events in Ukraine."
"I will be honest and admit that I was amazed to see the European Union react so rapidly, and to see that it was mediators from the European Union, and not from the United States, who played a leading role in the resolution of conflict in Ukraine."
"I was proud of that, but I certainly did not feel proud as I listened to Mr Potočnik’s statements today."
"It would appear that the Commissioner, the European Commission and the European Council are regretting their involvement after 21 November, and now wish to withdraw."
"We cannot give our consent to this."
"We became involved, we acted as mediators, and we ensured matters were resolved peacefully."
"Our duty is to continue providing assistance to the Orange Revolution and to democracy in Ukraine, and to open the European Union’s doors to a country that lies entirely within Europe’s geographical boundaries."
"– Mr President, it is very appropriate to quote the Bible in this debate, for there were glad Christmas tidings from Kiev, announcing the birth of democracy and freedom."
"Were it not for the presidential elections in Ukraine being overshadowed by the disastrous floods in Asia, that would have been for me the second-best Christmas in political terms since Prague in 1989."
"I was with Parliament’s delegation in the electoral districts to the south of Kiev and can confirm that the election not only ran peacefully, but also in a very correct manner."
"We congratulate the democracy movement, and Mr Viktor Yushchenko on winning the election."
"His victory is an outstanding one, gained under difficult economic circumstances and in a region still suffering the effects of the Chernobyl disaster, and, most of all, of the Soviet regime."
"We support the democracy movement and the renewal of an ancient European country, Ukraine, as it moves towards the rule of law, human rights and democracy."
"This tremendous movement will extend its influence into Russia and Belarus, but I wish to refute Commissioner Potočnik’s claim that accession to the EU is not on the agenda."
"I believe that Ukraine is part of Europe, and, if that is the case, Ukraine also belongs in the EU, provided that it fulfils the conditions."
"We should do everything necessary to ensure that it does."
"Mr President, first of all, it is a pleasure for me to hear the positive references being made to the Bible in this plenary. That is something that I, as a convinced Calvinist, should like to mention."
"On Monday evening, 10 January, Ukraine’s central election committee officially declared Viktor Yushchenko to be winner of the presidential elections and with this, a stunning fact became reality for the West and East alike."
"In a large former Soviet republic, the opposition managed, by democratic and peaceful means, to beat the post-Communist ."
"It stands to reason that the democratic forces in neighbouring Belarus, in particular, draw courage from this."
"It looks as if they will need a great deal of patience, though, to repeat the political masterstroke achieved by Mr Yushchenko and his supporters."
"At the same time, I expect the Council and Commission to give their support to the reformist citizens of Belarus to the best of their abilities."
"Incidentally, the Yushchenko camp cannot manage without the same level of European backing either."
"In very practical terms, Mr Klich has illustrated this backing in two useful amendments."
"Europe helped promote Ukraine’s accession to the World Trade Organisation and its speedy recognition as a market economy, Europe’s support is just as much needed in combating the widespread evil of corruption and strengthening the legal system."
"Meanwhile, the new Ukrainian President and Government are faced with two sensitive tasks."
"Domestically, they will need to deal with the supporters of the bad loser, Mr Yanukovych, with much tact and reconciliatory skill."
"Externally, the most important thing is to be self-assured in striking up the necessary good relationship with Moscow."
"So we see Ukraine, 15 years after 1991, being given a second chance in the form of a new start."
"Under President Yanukovych, this would certainly not have been possible."
"Striking in this respect is the historical parallel which Ukraine specialist, Professor Gerhard Simon, recently drew in a presentation at the University of Eichstätt."
"Ukraine’s so-called Orange Revolution is as politically significant as the fall of the Berlin Wall or the end of the Soviet Union."
"Mr President, Commissioners, the events that have taken place in Ukraine over the last few months have clearly shown the democratic world that the Ukrainian people do not want to accept a fate similar to that of other former Soviet States, presided over by authoritarian and semi-authoritarian regimes."
"Ukraine will never be the same again."
"There have been public demands for the right to mobilise the people not only in action against fraud in the presidential elections, but also demands for democracy and the rule of law."
"Wide-spread public participation has helped Ukraine to achieve tasks for which revolutions have in the past been necessary."
"Significant changes in the move towards democratisation have already had an impact on the Supreme Court, security services and media."
"Several risks, however, remain, which may hinder the Ukrainian people from implementing their choice."
"The dangers of a divided country may well be exaggerated, but they do exist."
"There is no reason to doubt that the mass media, which is loyal to the Russian president and retains significant influence in the eastern part of Ukraine, will continue to call into question the choice made by the majority of the Ukrainian people."
"Other risks include Ukraine's dependence on Russia for energy."
"The Russian market is also Ukraine's most important destination for exports."
"Quite recently, at the end of the 1990s, the Baltic States, in particular Latvia, still felt the impact of Russia's wish to make use of similar dependency."
"The weakness of previous reforms, particularly in the court system, may threaten the quality of future reforms in Ukraine."
"The European Union must help Ukraine to overcome these risks, we cannot lose this opportunity for historic change: economic assistance, investments, but above all trading opportunities."
"The European Union must provide Ukraine with the opportunity of entering its internal market, in particular Ukraine's few competitive steel and food enterprises."
"Ukraine's entry into the World Trade Organisation must be encouraged."
"The rapid preparation of a plan of action between the European Union and Ukraine is also important and a clear signal must be given at the earliest opportunity to western and eastern Ukraine, the general public and politicians that, if it meets the stringent entry requirements, the road to membership of the European Union will be open to Ukraine."
"The world has focused its attention on Ukraine; the European Union must now do so."
"Ukraine should be given the opportunity to join the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fine thing to celebrate the triumph of democracy, all the more so because it has triumphed in part thanks to us, the European Parliament, and not to the ever-conservative European Commission."
"Yet it is now time for the celebrations to end and the hard work to begin."
"There is work to be done in Ukraine, in order to ensure that Mr Yushchenko’s victory is not wasted and becomes a Pyrrhic victory, but we also have our own homework to do here in the EU."
"Ukraine needs to set itself two objectives."
"Firstly, it must put democracy on a firm footing, and secondly, it must implement essential and far-reaching economic reforms. Our tasks are as follows."
"Firstly, Ukraine, as Poland’s closest neighbour and thus a neighbour of the European Union, must be offered a privileged status and an easy-to-understand ‘road map’ of its journey to membership, even if this road will take many years to travel."
"Secondly, support should be given to reforms of the Ukrainian administration and judiciary, as well as to a genuine reform of the local government system."
"The Ukrainian authorities should be expected to have a clear vision of these changes."
"President Yushchenko’s first visit will be to Moscow, but I believe Kiev will import standards of democracy and the free market from the West, not the East, as otherwise its road to Brussels will become even longer."
"There is a long and rocky road ahead of Ukraine, but it is the right road."
"We should provide assistance and accompany the country on its journey, even when Western television cameras disappear from Ukraine, as they undoubtedly will soon."
"Ukrainians must carry out the main bulk of the work for themselves, yet they need to know that we are waiting for them and that we do not want to wait too long."
"– Mr President, the Ukrainian people’s greatest victory may be considered to be their decision to no longer tolerate the pseudo-democracy that is rife in so many areas formerly ruled by communist dictatorships, and which had almost become an internationally accepted reality."
"This was an essentially corrupt alliance between the former communist hierarchy, economic oligarchs, and state bureaucrats."
"This alliance developed its own ‘guided democracy’ model, originally patented by the Indonesian dictator Sukarno."
"Therefore, Ukraine’s new course towards real democracy is a choice, a choice in favour of fundamentally different values."
"In the words of Russian political analyst Piontovski, it is a choice between the past and the future, between Soviet Ukraine and European Ukraine."
"A choice which, according to him, the Russian people will also have to make sooner or later."
"Europe must be bold in welcoming those choices, and must not be dismayed or disoriented by possible changes in the present balance of power."
"It would be the greatest of tragedies if the people of Ukraine were to become disillusioned in their faith in freedom and justice."
"It is therefore the duty of the EU to make a long-term commitment to support the reforms in Ukraine and to give the Ukrainian people a European perspective."
"It is important that the resolution calls for a change in the Neighbourhood Policy action plan in the light of the recent events."
"We also propose additional measures, such as the convening of a donors’ conference for Ukraine."
"At the same time, in addition to the European Neighbourhood Policy, we have to offer Ukraine other forms of association that will open the door to closer cooperation."
"This is in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Ukrainian people, and could eventually culminate in Ukraine’s accession to the EU."
"I support my colleague Mr Saryusz-Wolski when he says: ‘It is time for deeds, not words!’"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I was one of the observers who spent Christmas in Kiev, and I am sure I speak for everyone who was there when I say that this political event made it easier for us to spend the festive season in a different way for a change."
"The elections were perfectly in line with OSCE standards, and the few irregularities, such as the sudden decision by the Constitutional Court, were handled relatively well."
"What did, of course, help the elections to be properly conducted was the public interest in Europe and throughout the world, but that public interest and that attention must not flag now, for the democratic process is not yet complete."
"We observers were impressed by the commitment and determination showed by the citizens – as demonstrated by the high turnout – and not just by experts and elites."
"We saw a vast number of people walking great distances – as they were obliged to – in order to reach the polling stations."
"What I found impressive and heartening was that the interest and involvement of women in this democratisation process and at the polling stations went without saying."
"I cannot produce a quotation from the Bible to illustrate that, but these are signs of a society composed of citizens who do not wait for their government’s decisions."
"I hope that this democratic process will also prove an incentive to Ukraine’s neighbouring states, specifically to Belarus."
"What is Europe to do now?"
"For a start, the country has been divided and polarised during the election and we must not make these divisions any deeper."
"Secondly, we must consider what help and what prospects we can give Ukraine."
"The existing concept of neighbourhood aid will have to be radically rethought if we do not offer the prospect of membership within the next two or three years."
"Mr President, fourteen years after having won its independence, Ukraine has become a democracy."
"As we must go on pointing out, we owe this victory for democracy to, above all, the Ukrainian people themselves."
"Day after day and evening after evening, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians gathered and mobilised to demand quite simply that they be able freely to exercise their right to vote."
"It is thanks to their courage and determination that Ukraine has been able to attain democracy."
"We also owe this victory to Ukraine’s institutions."
"I am thinking in particular of Parliament and the Supreme Court which, despite the very many pressures exercised upon them, acted with respect for the law and with a great sense of their responsibilities."
"This is also a victory for Europe."
"For once, Europe said ‘no’ by rejecting rigged elections and fraud on a huge scale."
"When, moreover, we were in Kiev at the beginning of December, we were proud to be Members of the European Parliament."
"For once, Europe was able to speak with a single voice and, when Europe decides to bring its weight to bear, it comes into its own and is able to change the course of events."
"Today, the challenges, like the expectations – of reforms and democracy – are huge. Europe has been equal to a tremendous and significant historic event."
"The Ukrainian people must continue to be able to count on us both now and in the future."
"We have a responsibility for their being able to do so."
"We must not, indeed cannot, disappoint them."
"Mr President, Commissioner Rehn stated recently in a article that the EU cannot close its doors to future enlargement, which is extended to all European countries with a European vocation and common democratic values."
"Then, for unexplained reasons, Ukraine is labelled a 'neighbour of Europe' with no prospects for EU membership, only closer integration with the EU."
"The Orange Revolution, which heralded a remarkable change in democratic thinking in Ukraine, occurred without any EU carrots being held out to change its system of government."
"That contrasts markedly with Turkey and the western Balkans, which are offered full membership – clearly, in my view, a morally unsustainable position in the long run."
"I always supported Ukraine's EU-membership aspirations."
"The denial of EU prospects to Ukraine reflects the unfounded fears in the Council, on the part of the French in particular, of serious agricultural competition, and, on the part of the Germans, of serious industrial competition, notwithstanding the fact that the common agricultural policy will be obsolete by the time Ukraine is ready to join in 10 to 15 years' time, and that industrial relocation is much more likely for a Ukraine in the WTO but outside the EU than it is for a Ukraine as a Member State of the EU with all the onerous single market requirements."
"I would also recommend the OECD to Ukraine, but full OECD membership requires WTO membership first, one of the new government's pressing goals."
"Curiously, the Commission continues to deny Ukraine – unlike Russia – market economy status."
"Given the expectations now raised with Ukraine's people, unless the EU accepts that Ukraine can have some kind of long-term aspiration of EU membership, it will be difficult for President Yushchenko to implement the much-needed political and economic reforms and win the parliamentary elections of 2006."
"One major policy change that the new government of Ukraine could make and which would demonstrate Kiev's independence from Russia is to help solve the Transnistria problem."
"That breakaway territory of Moldova is a haven for criminal activity, including money laundering and arms smuggling, and poses a serious security problem for the EU after 2007, when our borders will extend to Moldova."
"This could be a useful way of showing Brussels that Ukraine really is now independent from Moscow and seriously wants to do business in the international arena."
"– Now that the initially grotesque Soviet-style election farce in Ukraine has been resolved, primarily due to the efforts of the EU, it is time to ask: ‘what next?’"
"Let us leave aside for the moment the question of whether Ukraine will or will not become a member of the EU."
"It will, as long as it does what is necessary, and as long as we do what is necessary."
"First, we have to go much further than President Kuchma’s stagnation-period action plan."
"We need to concentrate on the essential reforms with which the EU can assist Ukraine, since Ukraine’s achievements during the following two-year-long window of opportunity will largely determine whether Ukraine is cut out for Europe or not."
"The EU must focus on the practical questions holding Ukraine back: corruption, low administrative capacity, crony capitalism, freedom of the press."
"Solutions do not just require money, but also thousands of experts from the new EU Member States, which have faced the same problems and have resolved them successfully; their membership of the EU is proof of that."
"I call on the Commission to considerably extend their development plan for reforms, primarily using citizens and officials from the countries that have successfully implemented the same reforms."
"We should be pragmatic and use the EU’s human potential to help Ukraine, and we should do so now."
"Secondly, Russia’s behaviour throughout the Ukrainian election saga indicates that it is time for the EU to end its ostrich-like policy on Russia."
"In addition to a significant backslide in democracy and freedom, which according to Freedom House has taken Russia into the category, we must not ignore Russia’s foreign policy actions."
"Just recently, Russia announced that it would not honour the commitment it made at the 1999 OSCE summit in Istanbul to withdraw its troops from Georgia and Moldavia."
"Russia’s blatant interference in the Ukrainian elections, the growing hostility towards EU institutions, and the unacceptable declaration regarding the EU leaders and officials who resolved the Ukrainian crisis demonstrate that the EU must rethink its policies in this direction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it can safely be said that the European Parliament proved its worth during the Ukrainian crisis."
"We reacted appropriately and rapidly, and we can be pleased with our efforts."
"It was not for our own satisfaction that we undertook these efforts, however, but in the clear interest of the European Union, because a stable and democratic Ukraine, with a market economy, is in the interest of the European Union."
"What can be done to ensure that this is achieved in the long term?"
"The Ukrainians themselves must of course undertake major efforts, and election pledges must be met."
"We are entitled to expect this of Ukraine, and we can also make the EU’s readiness to open its doors to Ukraine conditional upon it, but we must then ensure that these doors are flung wide open."
"In all honesty, I am astounded by the Commissioner’s speech."
"It proves that the European Commission has completely failed to grasp the significance of what has happened in Ukraine."
"How can it be possible to extol the Action Plan’s virtues today, when it was drawn up for a Ukraine that was a completely different country?"
"Ukraine should be offered the prospect of membership, as well as a road map for achieving such membership."
"This road map should include the following. Firstly, the rapid adoption and implementation of a much-amended and greatly extended Action Plan."
"Secondly, the urgent organisation of a donors’ conference, along the lines of the one organised by the European Commission and the World Bank for Georgia in April of last year."
"If EUR 861 million could be raised for Georgia, then it should be possible to raise an amount many times greater for Ukraine, a country of 48 million inhabitants."
"This project should be negotiated with US partners and the World Bank."
"Finally, preparations must be made for talks on an Association Agreement, as the recent enlargement taught us that this is the right instrument to use in order to achieve stabilisation and open the doors to future membership."
"Mr President, I had the privilege of being part of the European Parliament's election observation mission to Ukraine on polling day."
"I was deployed in a rural area about 80 kilometres from Kiev and saw, as any individual observer does, only a microcosm of the story across the whole country."
"However, I also saw the overall picture as reported by the OSCE election observation mission."
"It is clear that there was an essential integrity to this election that was lacking in the earlier one."
"The margin of victory was of an order of magnitude greater than any possible margin of fraud."
"It was clear that the majority of Ukrainians had chosen Mr Yushchenko and not Mr Yanukovych as their President."
"It was essentially a victory for the urban intelligentsia and the rural population over the urban working class."
"Yet at the same time it was also victory for cleaner politics over deeply soiled politics."
"The celebrations in Independence Square in Kiev on Boxing Day evening, welcoming the rebirth of democracy in Ukraine, were an inspiration."
"I welcome the election result as an affirmation of democracy, even if doubts remain over all aspects of the social and economic programme espoused by President Yushchenko."
"The EU will need to look again at its engagement with Ukraine, at least in terms of quality, if not in terms of quantity."
"At the same time, if Ukraine is not to be torn apart between east and west, rural and urban, President Yushchenko must seek to build bridges, not with the deeply flawed politicians that preceded him, but with the constituencies that they represent."
". Mr President, I have taken careful note of all the statements made and will now address some of the key points mentioned."
"I have also carefully considered the criticisms."
"First, I will say a few words about what the European Neighbourhood Policy entails and, after that, I will provide clarification on the action plan, that is to say, I will look at its substance and how to proceed with it."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy is a major step forward for the countries concerned, in the relations between these countries and the European Union."
"It is a very ambitious policy which entails a substantive upgrading of our relationship with partners through deeper political cooperation and a significant degree of economic integration, bringing partners closer to the internal market."
"Implementing this policy with Ukraine – the EU-Ukraine Action Plan – would send a strong message that the EU places great importance on the relationship and acknowledges Kiev's European orientation."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy is truly distinct from the issue of possible further enlargement of the EU but does not close any doors."
"With regard to the action plan, let me stress the importance of making full use of the action plan, thus enhancing the EU's relationship with Ukraine."
"It would be difficult to say that an action plan is an outdated instrument before we have actually used it and implemented it in any countries."
"It is truly a new instrument which should be implemented as soon as possible."
"What are the main characteristics of an action plan?"
"It is true that, in principle, its approach is the same for all countries."
"However, it is highly flexible, always tailor-made for the country concerned and, with the concrete proposals on which the Commission and the Council are already working, we can go as far as the country concerned wants and can afford."
"I can assure you that, in the case of Ukraine, the Commission is ready to go far."
"I conclude by saying again – because it is an important message – that the EU has repeatedly acknowledged and welcomed Ukraine's European aspirations."
"The recent dramatic events in Ukraine have reconfirmed that country's place on the European map."
"We have no doubt that these events will go down in history as a milestone not only for Ukraine but also for the EU's relations with that country."
"The debate on Ukraine is closed."
"I have received, at the close of this debate, six motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item isthe oral question to the Commission (O-0082/2004 - B6-0137/2004) by Stephen Hughes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the dismissal of Commission language teachers."
"Mr President, on 9 June 2004 the College of the Commission decided to dismiss 43 language teachers with almost immediate effect."
"Nine days later the officials responsible reported this decision to the teachers themselves at a general assembly in Brussels."
"I should like to quote directly from what two of the teachers said on that occasion:"
"'We denounce the flagrant lack of openness on the part of the Commission, who waited until today to announce the breaking of the teachers' contracts."
"In a Europe which claims to be social, we also denounce the cynicism of the Commission, which has plunged these workers into great difficulties - workers, some of whom are main bread-winners with children, many of whom are women."
"Most of these teachers are of an age at which it would be extremely difficult to find suitable employment."
"In the March 1997 trialogue agreement the teachers showed their willingness to collaborate in return for a promise by the Commission to maintain their contracts until retirement."
"Not so long ago Miss Morelli, in charge of training in the Council, in the presence of Commission representatives, reaffirmed on several occasions that the jobs of the teachers were guaranteed until they retired."
"We wish to record formally the breaking of these promises by the Commission.'"
"I believe that lengthy quote sums up a sad story very well."
"I have met with the dismissed teachers many times in recent months and have read a great deal of documentation from the time leading up to their dismissal."
"From that a number of things stand out."
"First, that for the teachers this decision came like a bolt from the blue."
"They were given absolutely no prior information about the plans for their dismissal."
"They were not consulted at all about those plans."
"Documents from throughout 2003 and the first half of 2004 show that at a whole series of meetings the teachers were given the impression that everything was fine, it was business as usual."
"One set of papers from mid-2003 actually dismisses rumours of planned restructuring."
"Other papers show the perfectly normal forward-planning of language training for the 2004-05 period but suddenly, in June 2004, the teachers learned of their abrupt dismissal."
"Secondly, it stands out that the Commission clearly feels that it is above and beyond the law."
"Any private entity behaving in the way that the Commission has would find itself in breach of EU laws on information and consultation, collective redundancies and transfer of undertakings."
"No doubt we will be told today that the Belgian laws giving effect to these EU directives do not apply to the Commission as a public administration, and yet these teachers were employed on Belgian employment contracts that are subject to Belgian employment law."
"This is the same institution that asks the corporate world to act in a socially responsible way and yet the way in which it has handled this matter so far has been totally socially irresponsible."
"Thirdly, the Commission has shown a total lack of regard for the plight of these people."
"Over 60% of them are aged over 55."
"Six months after the Commission decision their worst fears about not finding work at their age have proved only too real."
"Worse still, because of the restricted hours they were allowed under the contracts the Commission agreed with them it appears, according to a document I have received, that: 'the teachers may not be entitled to unemployment benefits, early retirement and social security cover'."
"That would leave them without cover until the age of 65, when their entitlement would become about EUR 500 per month."
"Clearly a number of the families dependent on these teachers face the real prospect of poverty."
"Finally, in relation to the trialogue agreement of 1997, the teachers and their representatives had the clearest understanding that they would be employed until retirement in exchange for agreeing new work practices and to work being put out to outside firms as teachers left."
"This was widely published at the time – in trade union newsletters, for example – and no-one from the Commission seemed to have contradicted that."
"A Commission official said something telling to us when we questioned her on this in committee."
"She said that sometime after the trialogue agreement the Commission's legal service was asked to give an opinion on whether such a guarantee was possible."
"The service said that it was not possible."
"An important question arises from that."
"Why was the legal service asked to give an opinion if such a guarantee had not been given at the trialogue?"
"It seems clear that, whether committed to writing or not, such a guarantee was indeed given and that the Commission, having sat silent at the many meetings at which that guarantee has been mentioned since, was quite content to allow everyone to continue with that understanding until it became opportune to go back to that legal opinion."
"The Commission has behaved in a disgraceful manner."
"However, it is never too late."
"I understand that a meeting will take place tomorrow between the Commission and the unions in Brussels."
"I hope that will be the first step towards reinstatement of these teachers."
". Mr President, on 9 June 2004 the previous Commission took the decision to terminate the contracts of 43 language teachers."
"This decision has been perceived by certain parties as 'untransparent' and 'unjustified'."
"In this respect the questions put by the chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs reflect the concerns expressed by the teachers themselves."
"Before I reply in detail to the questions put by the honourable Member, I would like to make four introductory points."
"First, the decision was taken in order to conform to the principle of sound financial management."
"Since 1997, Commission language courses have been delivered either by internal teachers with direct contracts with the Commission or by language schools selected via an open tender procedure."
"Each formula accounts for approximately 50% of the courses."
"Quality-wise, surveys have shown there to be no difference between the courses given by internal trainers and those given by language schools."
"On the other hand, there is a significant difference in budgetary terms: one hour's training delivered by an internal trainer costs four times as much as an hour delivered by a language school."
"On a yearly basis, taking 2003 as the reference year, the costs are approximately EUR 3.5 million as opposed to EUR 900 000."
"Second, the language teachers have been granted generous compensation."
"The Commission offered compensation payments that went well beyond the minimum legal requirement."
"Minimum compensation would have been three months' salary per five years of service."
"That would have resulted in compensation equivalent to between 12 and 19 months' salary."
"The Commission opted, however, to calculate the compensation on the basis of the maximum amount ever granted by Belgian courts."
"This resulted in compensation of between 14 and 24 months' salary."
"This means gross amounts of between approximately EUR 19 000 and EUR 152 000."
"Furthermore, the Commission opted to pay this compensation without requiring the teachers to serve out their period of notice."
"Third, the decision to terminate the contracts in question is not a unilateral initiative by the Commission, but rather the outcome of moves initiated by the budgetary authority in the mid-1990s."
"In order to understand the decision of 9 June 2004 one must go back to the origins of this matter."
"The whole process started in the early 1990s, when Parliament externalised its language training in Luxembourg."
"At this time, the language courses at the Commission and the Council were delivered by internal trainers who were granted private law contracts, without any call for tender or selection procedure."
"In the mid 1990s, the Committee on Budgets criticised both the Commission and the Council for the costs associated with this practice."
"After lengthy discussions, the trialogue – the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, the Secretary-General of the Council and the Commissioner in charge of personnel – concluded that gradual full externalisation was desirable."
"As a first step the parties agreed to launch a call for tenders for the supply of language courses, and also, by way of derogation from this principle, to allow existing internal teachers to continue their activities within their existing contract framework."
"Fourth, the trialogue agreement did not constitute a commitment on teachers benefiting from lifelong employment."
"In detail, the trialogue agreed to allow the language teachers to continue working under contracts of indefinite duration without having to participate in the call for tender."
"This point was made explicit to the unions at the time, as the minutes of meetings show."
"At the same time, the possibility of terminating a contract of indefinite duration is governed by Belgian law and cannot be waived."
"Any agreement between parties not to apply the law is null and void."
"After that basic introduction, I will now turn to the specific questions asked."
"The first is: did the Commission inform and consult the Council and Parliament before unilaterally breaching the trialogue agreement?"
"There are three elements that need to be considered here."
"Firstly, the Commission did not breach the trialogue agreement because this agreement did not constitute a commitment on teachers benefiting from lifelong employment."
"Secondly, the Commission accepts that it could have informed the trialogue co-signatories – the Committee on Budgets and the Council – of its intention to proceed with the second phase of externalisation."
"Nevertheless, the Commission considers that its decision was broadly in line with the stated orientations of the trialogue and the budgetary authority."
"The second question is: when did the Commission inform the teachers' representatives, the union representatives and the Local Personnel Committee?"
"The Commission informed the teachers' representatives, together with the teachers concerned, at the general assembly held on 18 June 2004, before the decision was notified."
"Under the social dialogue agreement, staff representatives and the Local Personnel Committee represent persons employed under the Staff Regulations."
"Since language teachers do not fall into this category, no staff representatives were involved in the case in point."
"The third question is: what kind of information was communicated to the teachers' representatives?"
"The Commission informed the teachers and their representatives of the decision taken on 9 June 2004, giving the reasons for this and explaining the practical consequences and arrangements, which included the Commission's plans for compensation payments."
"The fourth question is: does the Commission consider that its handling of this matter stands as a good example of best practice in terms of prior consultation and the provision of information in good time?"
"Looked at from a legal point of view, then I would reply in the affirmative: the Commission complied in full with all the relevant obligations, even if, as already stated, the Commission could have informed the co-signatories of the trialogue agreement before adopting the decision."
"The fifth question is: does the Commission feel it has fully faced up to its social responsibility to the teachers concerned?"
"The Commission has not only fulfilled all its legal obligations but has also interpreted its obligations in the most favourable way for the persons concerned."
"The sixth and last question is: can the Commission comment on and provide copies of any opinions given by the Commission's Legal Service on the dismissal of the teachers requested by DG ADMIN?"
"The opinions given by the Commission's Legal Service are governed by the rules applicable to relations between lawyers and their clients."
"Therefore, the Commission will not release the opinions or comments of its Legal Service."
"In conclusion, the Commission's position can be summarised as follows."
"Firstly, as regards the substance of the matter, the Commission considers that the decision to terminate the contracts concerned was sound."
"It was no longer tenable to continue a dual system where half of the courses were provided by internal teachers at a cost approximately four times greater than the courses provided by language schools, with no difference in quality."
"Secondly, the Commission implemented this decision in full compliance with its legal obligations."
"Thirdly, the Commission accepts that it could have informed the co-signatories of the trialogue agreement before adopting the decision."
"However, the Commission considers that its decision was broadly in line with the orientations of the trialogue and the budgetary authority."
"Finally, the Commission has no intention of reducing the number of courses."
"It reaffirms its commitment to multilingualism and to continuing to provide its staff with opportunities for a high standard of language learning without compromising on quality."
"Obtaining better value for money without any loss of quality is obviously a means of attaining this goal."
"– Mr President, it was 4 p.m. on a Friday afternoon in June 2004, and 43 language teachers were having a meeting to plan the next year’s curriculum."
"It was then that the bombshell was dropped and they were summarily dismissed."
"These specialised staff had been working for the Commission for decades, and over half of them were between the ages of 55 and 59."
"The Commission, over which, at the time, Mr Prodi presided, acted without prior warning and without consulting and informing the employees in due time, something that was in flagrant contravention of the 1997 trialogue agreements, which I have here in my hand."
"This was an agreement between the institutions, signed by Mr Samland for the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, Mr Trumpf on behalf of the Council, and Commissioner Liikanen on behalf of the Commission, which assured the teachers that their contracts would run until they reached pensionable age."
"The language teachers have, by the way, told me that, as a contribution to the sound financial management that you have just mentioned, they made the savings demanded of them by working four extra hours a week unpaid."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and following discussions with the persons concerned, I will ask, as I have done before, what alternative employment there actually was for these teachers in view of the fact that the deadlines for appointments to other institutions had already expired at the end of June."
"Your intervention has done little to dispel my misgivings as to whether Belgian law, according to which redundancies without agreed financial provision are legally void, has been complied with."
"The employer did nothing to discharge its obligations."
"Was the teachers’ lawyer consulted in due time, for example?"
"I doubt it."
"How does your conduct square with the principle of good and responsible governance, and with the accountability of public authorities?"
"Is the Commission even acquainted with the precise terms of its own communication on corporate social responsibility?"
"Commissioner, the guardian of the Treaties is meant to set an example; it is meant to set standards rather than undermine them."
"Something urgently needs to be done about this."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what the Commissioner has said has not, in fact, persuaded me;"
"I still have the impression that the Commission, by the decision it took last June, really was in breach of the agreement arising out of the 1997 trialogue."
"As far as I am aware, this House was given no advance information about this either, and it is pretty dubious that the decision to dismiss the teachers was taken at the last meeting of the Commission before the European elections, as if it had been assumed that we would then hear nothing more about it."
"The second thing I want to say is that I do not think it acceptable that the Commission, which is, after all, engaged alongside us in the fight for a social Europe, should ditch its social responsibility and its obligations as an employer when it comes to safeguarding its own interests."
"How else is one to explain the fact, to which reference has already been made in this debate, that the teachers were not informed in advance of their dismissals, not to mention the way in which, for years on end, returns to the Belgian authorities described them only as part-time employees, so that their actual working time could not be taken into account?"
"We are told, thirdly, that teaching is, in future, to be provided only by language schools."
"The first tenders have already been invited, and it is reported that the first contracts have already been awarded."
"We can now therefore reckon with the possibility of some of the Commission’s language teaching being provided by the British Council, and, as that body has, as we know, a new head, it is interesting to consider the implications of this."
"I would ask the Commission to have an independent inquiry into this whole affair, in order, if possible, to conclusively refute the accusations that have been made."
"– I want to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his answers to the questions put by Mr Hughes on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The matter has been discussed several times in that committee, but it has in actual fact also been discussed in the Committee on Budgets in which we perhaps had to approach it at a rather more difficult angle, given that we also, of course, wanted to see administration that was as efficient and inexpensive as possible."
"When, as justification for this dismissal of the 43 teachers, the Commission refers to considerations of sound financial management and the need to ensure both that the costs do not get badly out of hand and that the language courses are obtainable at a third or fourth of the former price, it is difficult for people involved with the budget not to say that the decision is apparently a sensible one."
"That is why we in the Committee on Budgets have paid attention first and foremost to the way in which matters have proceeded."
"The administration must of course be efficient and inexpensive and, in recent years, we in Parliament have exerted considerable pressure to ensure that the Commission implements reforms and that, through these reforms, a more open and transparent system is obtained, which also means a system that is perhaps better in tune with the world around us."
"There is of course a general prejudice among our electorate that Commission employees are very cosseted, privileged and highly paid, and we must therefore do our best to ensure that remuneration is reasonable and that things are not bought at a higher price than they need to be."
"That is an important point of departure."
"That being said, I would point out that the Commission should also be an attractive place of work and should also comply with the current ground rules designed to protect employees."
"We have been assured that the Belgian rules have been complied with."
"I presume that this fact is reflected in the compensation that has been given to the teachers and which, according to the Commissioner, is apparently by far the most generous ever seen."
"That no doubt also reflects the fact that matters have not proceeded properly in this case."
"As Mr Hughes has pointed out, the Commission must also comply with some of the requirements we make of employers outside the confines of the Commission."
"The Commission too must demonstrate social responsibility and sound management."
"I would therefore recommend that an amicable solution be found regarding this matter, thus ensuring that it is properly resolved."
"Ways should also, however, be looked into of ensuring, in the future, proper administration that complies with the requirements of the law, is inexpensive and is suitably in keeping with the organisation’s social responsibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we find neither the form nor the content of what has happened acceptable."
"We have heard the Commission’s reply. It is the usual reply of employers to laid-off employees, to the effect that all the conventions have been respected."
"In fact, that is not the case."
"Rather, this is a genuine labour dispute."
"These language teachers have worked for the Commission for decades. They have trained various Commissioners in the languages of the various countries, and yet they are being kicked out."
"That is not acceptable."
"I cannot believe for one single moment that the Commission might be compared to what are known pejoratively in France as the bosses."
"That is not possible."
"This is a labour dispute, so there need to be more negotiations and further discussion."
"I can well believe that there are unavoidable issues of progressive externalisation, but a few years might have been allowed to elapse before progressive externalisation led to language teachers within the Commission being dismissed."
"Where most of them were concerned, a delay of five, six or ten years would have been in order."
"There have, therefore, to be discussions in a dispute such as this."
"For my part, I believe that, if the Commission wants attention to be paid to its views on the social dimension, which is defended by the European Parliament and by Europe as a whole, then there has to be discussion, and the Commission has, today in particular, a duty, at this level, to set an impeccable example."
". – Mr President, we are addressing a serious political and industrial relations problem that merits our vehement condemnation."
"On 30 June last year, the chairman of my group, Mr Wurtz, sent letters to the Presidents of the Commission and Parliament, saying that the brutal decision to dismiss 43 language teachers at the Commission with open-ended contracts was in breach of the commitments undertaken by the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the trialogue of 18 March 1997."
"This agreement stipulates that ‘representatives of the three institutions agree not to damage the contractual framework in which linguistic training is organised in the Commission and the Council as regards those employees currently benefiting from open-ended contracts’."
"What, in that case, does the future hold for the credibility of this type of institutional agreement if one of the parties damages it unilaterally, using the argument that it complies with Belgian law?"
"What kind of credibility can an institution have that claims to combat social dumping when its approach to budgetary savings is to outsource services? In so doing, it is jeopardising the social rights of people with 10, 20 or 30 years’ service, it is treating them like a disposable product to be thrown away after use, and it is overlooking the actual budgetary savings of around 25% that these workers achieved with unpaid work."
"Ultimately, how can the Commission claim to defend social dialogue and the rights of workers, women and the family, when, without prior warning and without any careers advice or alternative employment, it dismisses people most of whom have family responsibilities and are at an age when it is difficult to find a new job."
"Is this the management model and the model of social Europe that the Commission claims to defend, when it rides roughshod over the right to work and its social responsibilities?"
"Is this the example that it wishes to set of a responsible public body, committed to linguistic training and to culture, when it dismisses people of great learning and of acknowledged professional and cultural ability and seeks to hire others at rates so low that it actually runs the risk of exploiting teachers?"
"Is this because the new executive Commission hopes to reemploy those workers who were unfairly dismissed by the previous executive?"
"Our group will go straight to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, to find out how he will …"
"Mr President, losing one’s job is one of the most traumatic events a person can experience in a lifetime, and I should like to tell the teachers concerned that I understand their position."
"The way in which these people were dismissed is reprehensible, and the Commission should apologise for the manner of their dismissal."
"I repeat, the Commission should apologise for the manner of their dismissal."
"From a legal point of view, however, the Commission had every right to dismiss them, and it did so not for its own satisfaction or to attract our criticism."
"The money saved will make it possible to create more jobs, as it cannot be denied that the EU is an over-generous employer."
"Outside the confines of the European institutions in Belgium an average of EUR 30 per hour would be paid for the same work, or in other words four times less than the figures quoted here."
"We wronged these people by dismissing them in such a tactless fashion, and they deserved compensation for this."
"It would be fair to ask, however, whether feeling guilty is sufficient reason to overturn a Commission decision."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, I too was dissatisfied with the Commission’s reply."
"The Commission maintains that it has fulfilled its legal obligations and acted in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, requiring high-quality courses at a reasonable price."
"I personally wonder about the procedure used to calculate the cost of externalising or privatising this service, compared with the cost of the previous contracts."
"I would also point out that we miss no opportunity in this House to denounce the externalisation or privatisation of services that is undertaken by national or international companies in our Member States."
"Our institutions too engage in privatisation and externalisation, but without putting in place the social plans such as we – at least in my own country – impose upon our companies following negotiation with the unions."
"I therefore believe that it is necessary to devise a social plan for the interested parties in order to put an end to the veritable impoverishment to which the families concerned have been exposed."
"My fellow MEPs have talked at length about this."
"For my part, I have a very specific question."
"How has the restricted invitation to tender been organised for the purpose of selecting the firms invited to replace the former teachers no later than February 2005?"
"Is it true that the bidders in response to this invitation to tender of 30 June include the British Council,where one of the posts of responsibility is at present occupied by the former Commissioner responsible for administration who arranged for these sudden redundancies?"
"In my capacity as Quaestor responsible for language courses in Parliament, I should also like to add that, there too, we are confronted with a similar problem."
"I hope that we shall resolve it in a much more socially-responsible manner, respecting the elementary rules of employment law as applied in all our Member States."
"I shall not waste the small amount of time available to me repeating the arguments expressed by other Members with which I fully agree."
"Apart from expressing my disappointment and dissatisfaction with your reply, I shall simply take this opportunity to say to you, Commissioner, that I believe you have had the opportunity to listen to what is being said here this morning in order to reflect and not simply read the documents from the previous Commission or analyses by your officials."
"Please take account of the fact, Commissioner, that you have only talked to us about the budgetary elements of the issue, and you have completely forgotten the social elements relating to this problem, and consider as well, Commissioner and this is my contribution the cultural elements."
"This complete externalisation of services is being carried out and justified on the basis of budgetary arguments, and those arguments alone are being taken into account."
"In this Parliament there is also a Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and a Committee on Culture and Education which you must listen to."
"With regard to the Committee on Culture and Education, Commissioner, there is a real risk that multilingualism, and quality multilingualism, may be affected by this decision."
"It is not possible to continue taking decisions of this calibre solely on the basis of monetary considerations."
"Multilingualism is a jewel which must be maintained, and it is not the case nor has it been proven that all needs can be covered by means of external sources; and it is not the case, Commissioner, that quality is equivalent, because all the analyses have been carried out on the basis of differing elements, comparing situations and languages which are not equal."
"Commissioner, we shall be watching very carefully to ensure that, in the future, this Commission does not continue in the same way as the previous Commission, thinking solely in budgetary terms and always dealing with budgetary issues rather than quality, jobs and the weakest categories of workers in this Union."
"So listen to the social arguments and the cultural arguments, Commissioner, and take another look at those documents which have been written for you by your high-level officials."
"Mr President, in an effort to respond to the substantiated accusations and to the questions of parliamentarians and workers, the Commission has put forward as a first argument that it did not breach any agreement on the dismissal of 43 teachers, because the agreement did not contain a clause stating that it would employ the teachers for life."
"This response by the Commission truly illustrates that there are no arguments and exposes it irreparably vis-à-vis the employees."
"In other words, it has announced, before plenary in the European Parliament, that the jobs of all the employees in the European Union services are insecure."
"The dismissal of 43 language teachers after 15 to 30 years' service constitutes an unacceptable action by the Commission."
"It is an example of the social insensitivity which characterises its more general anti-grass roots policy."
"Dismissal from work, for whatever reason, always has an effect on people and their lifestyle, and usually affects their families' lifestyles too."
"For this reason we must not remain indifferent, irrespective of the reasons that led to this decision."
"In the case of the dismissal of the language teachers by the Commission, I have received widely differing information, so I have found it difficult to decide who, in fact, is in the right."
"In spite of this I think that the status of the dismissed teachers has to be regulated, especially since they had contracts for permanent employment and also in view of their past work and the fact that some of them had worked for the Commission for more than 20 years."
"In the European Union we strive for the equal treatment of all institutions, and so the Commission and the European Parliament must be examples of such treatment."
"In addition, the new Constitution, which the majority of us support, states in Article 90: ‘Every employee shall have the right to protection from unfair dismissal in accordance with the legislation of the Union and national laws.’"
"In any event, I propose that the case of the 43 teachers be re-examined and that, in view of their past work, an appropriate solution be found for them."
"Enlargement has brought about an increase in the number of Member States, so I cannot believe that there is suddenly no need for these teachers."
"I also recognise that the Commission has to act in a thrifty and economical manner, but this should not be at the expense of breaking the law."
"In view of the fact that the contracts were drawn up on the basis of the trilateral agreement, it would seem appropriate to find a solution within such a framework."
"Mr President, I have some good advice to give to our new Commissioner, Mr Potočnik, and that is not to read out everything that your officials write down for you. That way, you will fare much better."
"The second thing I have to say is that what the Commission has done here is inexcusable."
"Commissioner Potočnik, we have been in politics long enough to know what it means when, four days before the European elections, you present your partner in the trialogue with a ."
"The intention, to put it bluntly, was to take us for a ride."
"Commissioner, we will be examining what savings you have actually made with your ‘sound management’."
"Let me call my principal witness, Vice-President Loyola de Palacio, and quote what she wrote to her fellow Vice-President Neil Kinnock on 29 June 2004:"
"‘First of all, I have the impression that the figures you provided do not fully reflect the facts’;"
"‘On this basis, the total savings that the Commission could obtain will be much lower than the EUR 20 million mentioned in the communication.’"
"Commissioner, we will be examining your measure to see how much cheaper it really is."
"For you to say that Parliament wanted us to take these steps is somewhat impertinent."
"If we look at the trialogue, signed – and not fortuitously – by the then chairman of the Committee on Budgets, item 7 of which clearly states that there is no intention to cancel the present language teachers’ contracts, I think it is a bit rich of you to now want to avoid taking the blame!"
"I would ask you to sort this matter out, or else we will have an interinstitutional problem on our hands."
"– Mr President, a series of appalling problems, of a professional, human and legal nature, were announced to this House this morning."
"I endorse what other Members of this House have said and, for the sake of brevity, shall move on to mention other potentially unwelcome political consequences of the situation."
"Multilingualism will suffer if we dispense with the work performed by skilled and experienced professionals in their difficult and complex job and outsource that work to people with dubious profile, experience and competence."
"After all, nobody can guarantee that the work will be done to the necessary standard expected and when it comes to the recruitment procedure and to guarantees of competence, there does not appear to be any accurate information available."
"This matter should concern all of us and not only with regard to the teachers, but also to what might be happening here in Parliament."
"It might be useful for us to pay a little attention to what is happening with the interpreters, in particular the freelancers, who are highly qualified, have been providing professional services for many years, and the turnover of whom is lower and lower."
"This is no way to solve financial problems that may arise in any of these situations. The construction of Europe, as we wish to see it, will be no more than a fantasy compared to the one that the Commission is offering us now, given the way in which it does not deem the trialogue as binding for the parties to it."
"Quite apart from the multilingualism issue, this is also a very serious problem."
"– Mr President, one minute is not enough for me to tell Mr Potočnik about the concerns that his report to Parliament raises."
"We are not in court here, Mr Potočnik; we are in the European Parliament."
"I will make just two comments about the culture that your report expresses."
"First, if your arguments prevailed in every country in Europe, we would have neither the Lisbon Charter nor even probably the Human Rights Charter."
"We would have a return to an industrial relations system based on rules that are unacceptable to all the political groups in Parliament, as I have heard."
"The second remark I would like to make to you is this: you should realise that a decision like the one you insist on making sends a terrible message to Parliament, namely that a rule is coming into force in Europe, in Parliament and in the European institutions that was typical of peoples’ democracies during the Soviet era throughout the twentieth century, that is to say: ‘give little and expect little’."
"The signs are there already in the structures and relations concerning translations, and these are the results."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at today’s sitting, not a pleasant sitting, I should first of all like to salute all employees in Member States of the Union who have been affected by injustice at work because they belong to minorities, whether ethnic or other."
"We know of examples where employees have been unjustly thrown out of work."
"But they have not been lucky enough to have their cases taken up by a plenary session of the European Parliament."
"We should be grateful that the European Commission language teachers have brought their case to us."
"It gives us the chance to consider how to prevent wrongs within the European institutions."
"We are not just talking about some company or other which fires some employees in order to increase its profits."
"We are talking about the guardian of the treaties, charged with monitoring the proper application of the ."
"The problem with the language teachers is just one sad example of administrative mistakes in the European Commission."
"Let us not forget that other problems persist."
"Remember the case of Mrs Andersen and Mr van Buitenen, the Eurostat, OLAF and Blue Dragon affairs."
"If we, as Members of the European Parliament, are charged with overseeing the European Commission, then we must act in these matters."
"First of all, I call upon the parliamentary Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to give priority attention to this matter at the highest level, to look at all cases similar to this one and to take the necessary steps."
"We must ensure that employment law is applied and that public servants and employees of the institutions are protected."
"Secondly, it would be desirable to invite all public servants, whatever their rank, to contact Members of the European Parliament they have elected and give them clear information about administrative shortcomings within the European institutions."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I think the discrimination apparent in these dismissals deserves special attention in Parliament today, particularly after yesterday’s vote on the Constitutional Treaty, Title II of which includes the Charter detailing the rights of us all, of all European citizens."
"Therefore, and also in the context of the information that we should be providing over the coming months, I believe that the 43 language teachers who had worked for us for many years should not have been dismissed in such a discriminatory manner, without any justification."
"The trialogue was ignored. Not the slightest interest was shown, nor were the simplest steps taken to intervene in those people’s favour."
"The discrimination happened right here in Parliament."
"I fully agree with what my fellow Members have already said, that we should, right now, devote special attention to the meaning of democracy and to the rights of us all, starting with the rights of those teachers."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I have been listening carefully to what you have been saying and I shall comment briefly on the four things you mentioned."
"First of all, there are a few reasons why we cannot rehire the teachers, the first of which is financial: such hiring would be incompatible with the Financial Regulation in two aspects, the first of which is procurement and the second is the principle of sound financial management."
"The second reason is legal."
"If the teachers were rehired, language courses would continue to be delivered by internal teachers and teachers employed at the language schools."
"This coexistence has always constituted a legal risk."
"The difference in salary and other conditions was significant."
"In this respect, there is a risk that such a difference of treatment between employees who essentially carried out the same duties would be considered by the Belgian courts as an illegal contractual construction."
"The third reason concerns assessing whether rehiring the teachers would mean having to negotiate new conditions."
"Experience shows that internal teachers were not particularly flexible vis-à-vis the Commission, despite the advantageous conditions it offered."
"Secondly, there was the question about procurement restrictions."
"This was not a restrictive procedure."
"The Financial Regulation obliges the Commission to issue an open call for tenders where the four-year amount is in excess of around EUR 155 000."
"In fact, the call for candidates was opened and published in the Official Journal."
"The selection procedure was conducted on the basis of financial and technical criteria."
"The successful candidates were then allowed to compete and, finally, contractors for different lots were then chosen on the basis of cost and quantity."
"I will very briefly address the issue of total savings."
"They were calculated in terms of the difference between what it would cost to maintain the teachers' contracts and the cost of severance payments."
"The savings were calculated on the basis of the costs for 2003."
"The total savings also took into account the total cost of the language-training programme, each teacher being replaced at retirement age by a contractor employee, and the total cost of the same language-training programme executed exclusively by contractors as from September 2004."
"Finally, account was taken of the sum of annual savings over the 2004-2031 period, when the fewest teachers would, theoretically, retire."
"At the beginning there would be many such teachers, but the number would decrease towards the end of that period."
"The final calculation under this scheme showed that the savings would come to EUR 23.8 million."
"A remark was made about the exaggerated figure."
"On the contrary, the EUR 23.8 million – cited in the documents prepared for the Commission decision – to which I referred corresponds to the cost of continuing teachers' contracts, and that was reduced to EUR 20 million."
"The decision was taken on that basis."
"The real amount also depends on individual decisions by teachers to take early retirement or to leave on personal grounds of invalidity and sickness, and, lastly, on the salary and contract cost evaluation."
"In this context we wanted to err on the side of caution."
"The final point raised concerns the British Council and its work."
"According to information provided by the contractors, I can assure you that no previous or present Commissioner is a member of the management board of any of the previous or current contractors."
"In 2004 the British Council tendered for English courses, but the contracts were awarded to CLL and Lerian Communications."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, I have a point of order under Rule 9 and Annex 1 of our Rules of Procedure on a code of conduct for Members."
"One of our so-called colleagues in this House, Jean-Marie Le Pen, is reported in an interview in the neo-fascist paper as having stated that the Nazi occupation of France was not particularly inhumane."
"He has clearly forgotten the deaths of 73,000 French Jews, the concentration camp in nearby Natzweiler-Struthof and the massacre of Jews, Roma and resistance fighters in France during that period, of whom he, at one time, claimed to be one."
"The code of conduct does not allow us to comment on such outrageous statements, but I would like you, Mr President, to disavow those statements on behalf of this House."
"Of course I disagree with these practices."
"There can be no doubt."
"In all events, it is a good idea for all of these incidents to be examined and for us to see exactly what happened and if decisions need to be taken from the point of view of the operation of Parliament."
"This will happen, have no doubt."
"Mr President, with your permission and having discussed this with Mrs Hassi, who tabled this amendment, and indeed my colleague Mrs Corbey of the PSE Group, I would like colleagues to consider a very brief oral amendment."
"After 'believes that', I would like to insert 'for industrialised countries' and then continue with 'medium term reductions of the order' and so on. I would appreciate colleagues' support for that brief oral amendment, which focuses the amendment on industrialised countries and not the entire world."
"– Mr President, I wish to announce that we are withdrawing our signature from this proposal because the European Parliament has once again been used to attack the Italian Government."
"We therefore withdraw our signature and, even though we agree with the text, we shall be voting against it."
"(1)"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I am pleased to inform you and Members of Parliament that as far as financial matters are concerned, we are ahead of the resolution on which we are now voting."
"What needs to be done to mobilise EUR 100 million of emergency aid to Asia has already been done in cooperation with Council."
"Therefore, I am asking for a technical adjustment – an optimistic and positive one – to paragraph 16, to reflect the progress made."
"Thank you very much."
"This will be done."
"Mr President, we wish to present an oral amendment, clarifying the amendment presented by the Members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"We propose adding what I am about to read in English at the end."
"'Calls on the EU and the Member States to fully deliver their pledges of at least EUR 1.5 billion announced by Commissioner Barroso in Jakarta and to do so in full in the form of a donation.'"
"– Mr President, I refer to the resolution on the tsunami disaster that has just been adopted."
"In item 5, we decided to call on all Members of the European Parliament to donate a day’s pay to the tsunami victims."
"I call on the Bureau to set up a current account to collect our voluntary donations, because otherwise everything will happen in a disorganised fashion."
"I think Parliament should have the courage to make a decision and give an account number, or we will have to act individually."

"We have voted in favour of today’s resolution on climate change."
"We share the concern it expresses for effects on the environment."
"That does not, however, mean that we are sure the Kyoto Agreement is the solution to all the problems."
"Climate change and its causes are complex, and it therefore follows that the measures should also be brought into question and constantly be subject to more critical examination than that of which the resolution is an expression."
"There has been a spate of warnings throughout the world about climate change, for which responsibility undeniably rests with an economic system that does not respect the balance in the relationship between human beings and nature and in the activity that arises from that system. This is especially the case in the most developed countries, of which the United States stands out alone, responsible for 25% of gas emissions causing the greenhouse effect."
"Climate change is a consequence and an illustration of the unsustainable nature of the capitalist system of production, with its unchecked plundering of natural resources and its complete subservience to short-term gain, instead of investment in long-term planning that encompasses the preservation of the conditions needed for the human race to survive."
"The required response should not be guided by the laws of the system that gave rise to the problem."
"Setting up an emissions trading scheme enables the countries with the greatest financial power to continue to be the biggest polluters, thereby straitjacketing countries with weaker economies."
"More public investment is needed, into researching new and more efficient sources of non-polluting energy and into support for implementing those that already exist."
"Global climate change constitutes a major problem we believe there are good reasons for dealing with at international level."
"The Kyoto Protocol is an important step in this process."
"We do however take a critical view of quite a few of the wordings in the resolution."
"We do not believe that the European Parliament should call upon those countries that have still not ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so."
"We are of the view that individual countries should decide their positions on this protocol at national level."
"We are also opposed to the Commission’s and the Member States’ having to emphasise the need for climate protection by engaging in dialogue with other countries."
"We believe that individual Member States should have the right to determine their national positions themselves and to put these forward in international negotiations."
"The national right of initiative would thus be protected."
". The effects of human activity on the environment, and in this case on the climate, must be researched, understood and, accordingly, minimised when those effects are adverse."
"The large gap between cost and benefit involved in such study must always be borne in mind, however."
"Against this backdrop, the role that the EU has been playing in international efforts to combat climate change is cause for satisfaction and should be duly acknowledged."
"It is not enough, however, to have good intentions or to sign protocols if they are not complied with in reality, and particularly if there is no means of penalising non-compliance."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, because I feel that it addresses these concerns."
"The constant increase in human activity has given rise to an increase in greenhouse gases. It is believed that this will lead to further average warming of the earth’s surface and of the atmosphere and may adversely affect natural ecosystems and the human race."
"In this context, all countries must offer to cooperate as broadly as possible and to participate in an effective and appropriate international response, depending on their shared but different responsibilities, and on their individual economic and social capacities."
"Last November in my explanation of vote on the EU’s strategy for the Buenos Aires conference on climate change – COP-10 – I wrote that I felt it was important for ‘the EU delegation to the Buenos Aires Conference (…) to take a leading role in negotiations. It must seek to warn its international partners of the need to protect the climate’."
"Because I feel that the aims that I put forward were partly satisfied and because climate change and its adverse effects must be a common concern for the human race, I voted in favour."
"Mr President, I should like to express, over and above the shock we all felt confronted with the huge suffering caused in the Indian Ocean by the disastrous tidal wave experienced at the end of last year, the unease we felt at seeing the development of a diplomacy of compassion that was naturally not devoid of ulterior motives on the part of the nations concerned."
"I am consequently very pleased that, in the resolution adopted by the European Parliament, we were considering arranging for a European Civil Protection Corps to be put in place, with the task of putting together another form of aid, free from the ulterior motives described and, especially, from the competition we have witnessed in the charitable and emergency relief stakes."
"In view of this, I should like us to do more to make use of the enhanced cooperation mechanism put in place on 23 October 2001 by creating a genuine European civil protection headquarters capable of training experts and sending them out in the colours of the European Union so that the EU might physically demonstrate its commitment in periods of emergency and reconstruction."
"I should also like us to take account of this within the framework of the Financial Perspectives adopted, given that the Solidarity Fund notoriously lacks the flexibility not only for mobilising the necessary help in transporting resources but also for channelling the emergency aid that presupposes completely mobile and available funds."
"I was expressing myself along these lines as early as 1999."
"I welcome the efforts successfully made by the Commission and the Council, and I hope that Europe will very quickly have available to it helmets painted with the blue of the European flag and signalling emergency aid."
". I broadly support this Resolution."
"However, a moratorium on debt repayments is merely a breathing space which should be used to set up an international fair and independent arbitration process that would assess what debt should be written off for the affected countries."
"This process should give priority to the meeting of human needs and the fulfilment of basic human rights."
"The current situation where creditors alone decide on how to deal with unpayable debt is clearly inappropriate and to date this has failed to resolve the decades long debt crisis."
"The debt of countries affected by the tsunami clearly needs an urgent response."
"However many other poor countries are faced with a crisis of human need that is continuous and dwarfs the scale even of the tsunami."
"While dealing swiftly with the debt of countries affected by the tsunami, the international community must not lessen the priority to focus on the need to cancel the unpayable debt of poor countries to enable them to progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals."
". We welcome the adoption of this resolution, to which we contributed with our own resolution and with proposed amendments, although unfortunately not all of these were adopted."
"Among the proposals that we tabled, we should like to highlight our call for the necessary initiatives to be taken quickly to cancel the bilateral and multilateral debt of developing countries, beginning with the countries affected by the tsunami and with the poorest and most vulnerable countries, to give back to them all the resources that they need in order to develop."
"We also called on developed countries to fall quickly into line with the aims of funding development stipulated in the Monterrey Convention and to reach a level of development aid of at least 0.7% of GDP."
"We must halt the hypocrisy and cynicism of those who channel astronomical amounts of money into war in Iraq but who have difficulty in raising the necessary financial resources to support the victims of these tragedies and to build a fairer world."
". I will be supporting this resolution, as the chief election observer for the European Union Election Observation Mission to Indonesia."
"I visited Aceh and the city of Banda Aceh six months ago."
"I have still been unable to establish the fate of my interpreter and driver from Banda Aceh."
"I therefore have an appreciation of the scale of the disaster in Indonesia and the Andaman Islands."
"What worries me is that the Commission is committing a fraud on the people of Europe and the people of Indonesia and Asia."
"The so-called 'aid' in reality is the poor helping the poor, as rather than providing new money we are merely shifting money already allocated to the region from people in desperate need to the poor victims of this tragic demonstration of the narrow line mankind walks on earth."
"We do not need a tsunami warning centre in Asia."
"The information is already available at centres like the UK's Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, where all earthquake data is available in real time."
"All that has to happen is for this information, when necessary, to be immediately communicated to the governments concerned."
"We support the global community’s rapid intervention to deal with the appalling humanitarian disaster in Asia."
"Necessary resources must be prioritised, at both national and international levels, to help people in need and to support the reconstruction work."
"The EU must not take resources away from other aid efforts in order to fund the post-Tsunami aid."
"The resources must be found within the existing framework for the EU’s total budget."
"We believe that the EU Member States should guarantee their share of the one billion euro loan that the European Investment Bank is to offer to the countries affected."
"With its long experience and global reach, the UN is the organisation best placed to coordinate the humanitarian aid."
"The EU should not therefore compete with the UN by creating new institutional arrangements."
"I have voted in favour of this resolution."
"Faced with this disaster, we are thinking firstly of the pain and suffering of the victims’ families."
"The European Union has again missed an opportunity to demonstrate its capacity to react."
"It would have been nice to see - alongside Commissioner Michel – Presidents Barroso and Borell and the High Representative, Mr Solana, making Europe’s voice heard more clearly."
"The mobilisation of the European peoples has been exemplary."
"Now, our responsibility is firstly to respond to the emergency (with drinking water, food etc) and to prevent epidemics."
"Above all, the European Union will, however, when the cameras are no longer there, have to respond in the following ways, and on a long-term basis, to the requests of the populations affected."
"- Engage in reconstruction work, while respecting natural forces."
"As we have seen, it is not worth our while building along the coast."
"- Develop and coordinate efficient systems of prevention and alert."
"- Combat paedophilia."
"The European Union has a moral obligation to help these countries protect their children and, in particular, the orphans of the disaster from the paedophile networks unfortunately kept going by a category of tourists, whom we condemn, from the rich countries."
". I welcome this resolution which recalls the scale of the tragedy faced by the peoples of the Indian Ocean and our European solidarity with them."
"The resolution is nevertheless right to note that much of the money pledged by EU governments to help rebuild the shattered infrastructure and lives in the Countries hit by the Tsunami is not new money but has largely been taken from other development projects."
"We must not ask the people of Africa and other poor countries to bear the cost of our justified humanitarian response to the Tsunami victims."
"The money we give should be in addition to our normal development budget."
"The international community should also pay particular attention to the plight of children, some of whom face the real danger of being victims twice if they are not given protection from those ever willing to exploit their vulnerability"
", . – The tragic events due to natural causes that have succeeded one another without a break in recent years demonstrate the need for a more considered policy and an analysis that avoids petty party differences."
"As we have been saying for several Parliamentary terms, it is essential that we should immediately set up a European civil protection structure with the capacity to take swift action to deal with any eventuality that may affect our countries or other parts of the world."
"We have globalised the market; now we have to globalise prevention and civil protection."
"We are therefore delighted that the G7 has decided on a moratorium on debt repayments for the disaster-hit countries; we accept the decision to entrust coordination of the aid and the reconstruction of the affected areas to the United Nations, despite its poor record in the past; and we call on the European Union to equip itself with a civil protection structure that will 1. coordinate the national civil protection efforts, 2. harmonise the national regulations, and 3. establish a permanent European structure."
"We ask that the funds allocated by the Union for reconstruction should not be taken from the budget headings for the development of the poorest countries and that a Commission representative should report back to Parliament regularly on how the funds allocated by the Union have been used."
".– We stand with respect before the pain for the thousands of dead, missing and homeless."
"The unprecedented solidarity confirms that the brotherhood of nations can raise a tsunami of humanitarianism, sweeping away the hypocrisy of governments and organisations."
"The fury of the earthquake highlighted the insensitivity of the capitalism sweeping the area."
"The disaster mainly hit the grass-roots classes."
"The predatory interventions in the environment by large companies looking for excessive profits are largely to blame for turning natural disasters into humanitarian disasters."
"Capitalism is preparing to re-build the interests of the multinationals on top of the graves, to turn the human tragedy into contracts and stock exchange indicators, to turn any 'humanitarian aid' into interventions by the imperialist centres."
"A newspaper in the United States terrifyingly wrote that the rich nations are providing the aid and they will dictate the terms."
"This means funding for projects with a depressing economic philosophy so that the multinationals can reap the benefits of 'reconstruction', ignoring the needs of the people."
"The money raised as a result of grass-roots solidarity must not be embezzled."
"The peoples who ran to help must not allow it."
"The creation of a trustworthy observatory to implement and strictly control reconstruction programmes for the benefit of the peoples, the writing-off of the debts of these countries and the provision without cutbacks of the aid programmed for other third countries are just some of the measures for relieving the victims."
". I voted in favour of the resolution before us because it addresses my concerns in this area."
"Tragedies sometimes have one positive aspect: they show that human nature – and the nature of the institutions – is also capable of good deeds."
"As well as the unspeakable horror that was visited on South-East Asia, and past, present and future suffering, what also hit home were the images of world solidarity on an unprecedented scale."
"The globalisation of everything, even suffering, responds to tragic events with decency."
"Consequently, the readiness to help shown by everyone, and in our particular case by the EU as a whole and by each of the 25 Member States, is worthy of praise, but only if the promises of help correspond to effective help."
"This time, also very much due to the efforts of its citizens, Europe lived up to what its stature should be."
"Let us hope, therefore, that this will set a precedent."
"Lastly, this should also be an opportunity for the problems of the least-developed countries to be addressed from a fresh perspective, with a fresh approach and with fresh determination."
"Let us ensure that tragedy does not produce more commotion than action."
". The scale of the tragedy in Asia, with the material and human damage inflicted on the affected populations, has been terribly heart-rending."
"Whilst we are sad, however, we must also focus on the crucial need to help the people affected, not only in terms of immediate help for the countries concerned, but also in terms of ensuring that long-term mechanisms of cooperation and assistance can be set up, so that disasters of this nature can be prevented from happening again."
"Against this backdrop, I feel that it is essential to set up an EU civil rapid reaction corps, in order to enhance the effectiveness of European help in humanitarian crisis situations."
"Throughout this nightmare, we must pay particularly careful attention to the children who have been orphaned, not only because they are the ones who suffer the most but also because they are vulnerable to rape and to physical and sexual abuse."
"I therefore urge the EU to make use of all the resources at its disposal to enable prompt and rapid action to protect young victims."
"All that remains is for me to express my sincerest appreciation of all citizens and governments who have, so generously and spontaneously, contributed towards financing humanitarian actions to help the devastated peoples."
". However paradoxical it may seem, it is at moments of suffering overseas that EU Member States manage to speak with one voice on the international scene – the voice of solidarity."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because I feel that the EU and its Member States could not turn a blind eye to the human and material loss caused by the appalling and unprecedented tragedy of the terrible seaquake that hit Asia and the Indian Ocean."
"As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I welcome the interinstitutional agreement that has been reached permitting recourse to emergency funds and to flexibility instruments and enabling significant funds to be released, despite their not being initially budgeted."
"Accordingly, as well as expressing their compassion and their grief, the EU and its Member States will in the short term have more than EUR 1 billion at their disposal."
"From a logistical point of view, this tragedy reinforces the urgency of the EU’s civil reaction corps for humanitarian operations."
"In addition to emergency first aid, the EU will also play an active role in the interim phase of rehabilitation and the long-term phase of reconstruction."
"Lastly, as well as the public help, I must express my satisfaction and my pride ..."
". Following up previous Parliament resolutions, the intention of this resolution is to ‘strengthen the partnership’ between the USA and the EU, renewing and stepping up the determination of these two capitalist blocs to share influence and domination."
"In a clear sign that this is something that unites them rather than divides them, the EU is playing the supporting role to the American big brother that has historically been attributed to it."
"The hypocrisy and the cynicism on both sides of the Atlantic – which has also been demonstrated in the recent case of support for the countries affected by the tsunami in Asia, especially when one compares that support with the money spent on the war – manifests itself in the power to decide who can and cannot have arms, what type of arms they can and cannot have, and who are the democratic organisations and countries."
"It is also seen in the definition of the political domination structure of bodies such as the Security Council, a body that seeks to consolidate positions so as to ensure the legal status quo in world domination, bypassing differences of opinion as regards the attack on and invasion of Iraq, the violation of international law, the International Criminal Court and the fact that the Kyoto Protocol has not been signed, and suggesting that an ‘action community’ be created ..."
"We support quite a few of the resolution’s proposals concerning, for example, increased economic cooperation between the EU and the United States, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and support for the International Criminal Court."
"We have nonetheless chosen to abstain in the vote on the resolution as a whole because it is, in general, aimed at strengthening the EU as a global actor in relation to the United States and the rest of the world."
"The recent EU/US agreement over Airbus / Boeing should do much to improve the climate of trade talks between the two."
"Mr Mandelson deserves our warm congratulations for brokering this settlement."
"However, other serious transatlantic problems remain, such as the failure of the US to sign-up for the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto protocol."
"Progress in these issues could lead to effective joint action by the two sides of the Atlantic."
"As the resolution rightly points out, a transatlantic 'Community of action' could help resolve the Middle East crisis in Palestine, Iran and Iraq."
"It could help in the fight against international terrorism and could contribute to achieving the Millennium development goals of reducing poverty, disease and environmental degradation."
". I voted in favour of this resolution because I feel that, following the US elections, the President of the United States will be visiting Europe at a time when, objectively speaking, we have a chance to improve relations between the two sides."
"Whilst the situation in Iraq remains tense and dangerous, it has improved."
"Dozens of parties have registered to take part in the elections, abductions are increasingly a criminal matter and attacks are becoming more sporadic."
"The focus now is on building the future."
"In Ukraine, we had the same concerns, we spoke up for the same values and principles and we achieved the same result."
"In the Middle East, following the elections to the Palestinian Authority, we have the chance to be on the same side."
"As regards Iran, the United States is waiting to see how effective the agreement reached by the EU has been, given that there remain some potential difficulties in this regard."
"Lastly, both sides of the Atlantic reacted in exactly the same way and with the same degree of commitment to the recent disaster in Asia."
"Accordingly, it is crucial that we make the most of President Bush’s next visit to restore transatlantic relations in full and without any grudges."
"We are, in all senses, on two sides of the same ocean."
"We have our differences, but we are united by the same core values."
". The free world in which we live would be no more than a mirage had we not forged the close and productive relations between Europe and the United States that have freed our continent from the yoke of Nazi and Communist totalitarianism."
"More than a mere historical curiosity, this relationship is crucial and indispensable, given the challenges and opportunities facing us."
"I therefore vehemently oppose those who try to turn allies into opponents or rivals."
"I believe that the same history that today records our joint victory would take a dim view of allies who, having defeated the most visible enemy, turn their backs when the threat becomes dispersed and almost invisible."
"The fact that we do not always agree should be a catalyst for promoting dialogue and not an excuse to foment sterile and counter-productive tensions, which are of use only to those who have always wanted to see us divided."
"I am delighted that the same Parliament which, only a short time ago, let itself be taken in by anti-US rhetoric, is now sending a responsible message by declaring its will to work together to resolve problems around the world and to receive President Bush the next time he visits the Community institutions."
"Working together, we can achieve more."
"I totally support this Joint Motion."
"Cancellation of 80% of Iraqi debt is certainly something to be welcomed."
"Having visited Iran with a delegation from this Parliament I am keenly aware on the dire needs of the population there."
"However the willingness of the Paris Club to act in this case begs the question whether debt relief decisions are being made on the basis of need or that of US political imperatives?"
"It is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age that the world continues to increase military expenditure and reduce expenditure on aid."
"This leaves us as far away as ever from the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Overseas Development Aid, and not even in sight of achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals."
"Lets put an end once and for all to our disgraceful record of broken promises and half-measures."
"Lets recognise that a debt moratorium for indebted countries will not do half enough to allow them rebuild their battered communities."
"Lets go for real debt relief, that is cancellation of their debts."
"That's the only way we can offer them real pain relief instead of simply deferring and dragging out their suffering!"
". External debt is a means of exploiting developing countries and of placing them at the mercy of the countries and the international financial institutions that are their creditors and of the economic interests that represent it."
"This is wrong, it is immoral and it constitutes a major hindrance to development. It also diverts enormous amounts of money from the basic needs of the people of these countries, which more often than not earmark more money for debt repayment than for the total amount that they spent on health and education, thus preventing them from tackling diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis or problems such as illiteracy, and many others."
"Maintaining the debt is unacceptable."
"It is worth pointing out that the countries in debt have already paid seven times what they owed in 1982 and have, worse still, seen their debt rise fourfold."
"Furthermore, most of them have a history of colonial exploitation, which makes them creditors rather than debtors of the industrialised countries."
"This ongoing situation is all the more incomprehensible following the writing off of 80% of Iraq’s debt, due to the imposition of the USA military occupying power and given estimates as to the active exploitation of Iraq’s wealth and the lucrative ‘business’ of reconstruction."
"It is therefore essential that the debt of developing countries is cancelled, so that they can build a fairer world."
"We are well disposed towards different forms of international aid to developing countries."
"We do not however believe that the European Parliament has the competence to produce recommendations concerning debt relief for developing countries."
"This issue should be dealt with at national level and within the framework of already existing international structures, for example the Paris Club."
"We also note that money immediately loaned by the EU must be written off and that it must thus be entered in the accounts as an item of budgetary expenditure."
"For the above-mentioned reasons, we have chosen to vote against the motion for a resolution."
". Debt relief for developing countries is a welcome measure that demonstrates – or ought to demonstrate – a genuine desire on the part of the international bodies and of the wealthiest countries to make an active contribution to those countries’ economic growth and development, and to fairer distribution of the costs of that process."
"Furthermore, unlike those who advocate the unrestricted opening of borders to all immigration, I believe that the best, most efficient and fairest policy is to endeavour to foster development in the countries most in need, instead of promoting the draining of their most capable human resources."
"In this context, it is important to acknowledge that, in the past, this debt was often the result of objectionable policies, and that in the future the development of these countries depends to a large extent on their own decisions, their own policies and their own level of commitment."
"Accordingly, I advocate processes such as the one before us aimed at debt relief for developing countries."
"The proviso of such a process must be that the funds thus released must be spent on sustainable development policies and not on policies that cannot and must not be endorsed."
". The policy of Community cooperation must favour economic and social growth in developing countries, and the gradual integration of those countries into the world’s economy."
"One must bear in mind that the countries in need of help must be subject to close scrutiny, in terms both of enhancing the processes towards democratic consolidation, and of progress in respecting human rights."
"The economic growth of developing countries must be people-focused."
"This is the only way in which we can make sure that their economies will grow and that their external debt requirements can be reduced, and in which we can make sure that they are meeting their obligations."
"We welcome the New Partnership for Africa’s Development and the measures announced at the G8 Summit, which, quite apart from constituting considerable efforts towards economic progress in developing countries, are intended to promote and consolidate democracy, good economic management, peace and security in those countries."
"Within these constraints, I feel that the process of public debt relief must be speeded up and stepped up, thereby enabling developing countries to allocate resources to basic services and, in so doing, to achieve the millennium development goals."
"I voted against the resolution on the grounds that it does not even achieve the objectives stated by the Presidency."
"Our amendments seeking written-off debts were voted down."
".– The foreign debt of the poor, developing countries comes from loans imposed with particularly unfavourable, predatory terms by international imperialist organisations, especially the World Bank and the IMF."
"They were granted for the purpose not of strengthening the economies of these countries and combating grass-roots problems, but for the purpose of control of the markets and wealth-producing resources and fierce exploitation of the peoples, with the result that these loans exacerbate the position of these countries, increase their dependence on the international imperialist centres and strengthen the position of the large monopoly groups, the multinationals, especially the American multinationals, so that they can control the markets."
"Without deluding ourselves that the character and objectives of the international organisations may change, we are calling for the wiping out of the foreign debt of these countries, the demand for and imposition of international economic conditions based on mutual assistance and equality between countries and support for grass-roots interests against the interests of the multinationals."
"That is why the fight by the peoples of these countries cannot be confined to writing off the debt."
"It is an anti-imperialist fight."
"They are fighting for international relations to change radically. They are fighting to defeat the imperialist system."
"They are fighting so that the peoples themselves can determine their future and exploit the resources for common progress and advance."
". Two aspects of the recent electoral process in Ukraine stand out."
"The first is the capacity of the majority of the Ukrainian people to fight for democracy, for freedom and for a social model that is essentially identical to that of the EU. In the context of that struggle, the name of Viktor Yushchenko comes to the fore, but only as a first among equals."
"He has been the head of a body that is solid, determined and united behind a single idea."
"Secondly, it is abundantly clear that action by the Community institutions and the European leaders, at both Community and national level, had an important role to play in the outcome of that process, which could otherwise have led to an extremely serious situation."
"These two aspects justifiably led to expectations among the Ukrainian people as regards their future accession to the EU."
"It is now therefore up to Ukraine to follow a path that corresponds to the clear will of the people."
"Similarly, it is up to the EU to react positively to the expectations that have been generated."
"It is this approach, an integral part of the resolution before us, which led me to vote in favour."
"In the context of the election observation mission in which I took part on 26, 27 and 28 December 2004, I was able to monitor the circumstances in which the re-run of the second round of presidential elections took place. I was also able to note, I am pleased to say, that the winning candidate wishes to move closer to the EU."
"In this respect, I had the opportunity, along with other Members of this House, to write to the President of Parliament to notify him of this wish and to request that the Ukrainian President-elect address this House soon."
"I hope that power is handed over swiftly and properly, so that democratic normalisation can take place and that levels of anxiety and tension – which were, admittedly, never worse than tolerable during the electoral process – can be reduced."
"I feel that we should not overlook the fact that Ukraine is a country of strategic importance to Russia."
"I believe that the firmness shown by the EU in defence of democracy and freedom should not be misinterpreted, nor used to antagonise a neighbour of its importance."
"Ukraine’s political stabilisation must first serve to encourage the Russians to follow the path of convergence with those shared values."
"At the same time, I feel that, if that is the Ukrainians’ freely expressed desire, then we must pave the way for them to be able to come and join the EU."
"– Voting time is over."
"The sitting is resumed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I represented the President at the meeting of Ambassadors from the ASEAN countries, who attended the debate we held in this House on the tsunami."
"They asked me to express their gratitude for Parliament’s support for ensuring a rapid response to these tragic events and for the forward-looking, constructive and non-politicised debate they witnessed, in the best tradition of the European Union, with a view to providing humanitarian aid to those parts of the world desolated by tragedies such as the recent tsunami we have tragically seen in South-East Asia."
"Mr President, as you were about to say, we now come to the matters of urgency and the human rights issues."
"Today we have three topics related to Asia, but serious violations of human rights are still going on in Europe."
"I am therefore glad that we have with us two campaigners for human rights, Mr Kovalev from Russia and Mrs Estemirova from Chechnya, who are here today to receive the Robert Schuman Medal from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I am glad that these campaigners for human rights, who have thus exposed themselves to great dangers, are listening to this important debate today."
"We can assure them that we will continue to do everything possible to ensure that human rights prevail in Russia and in Chechnya."
"We take good note of what you have said and we are grateful for the information, Mr Posselt."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Tibet: the case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche(1)."
"– Mr President, 26 January will be the second anniversary of the execution of the monk Lobsang Dhondup."
"This execution called forth both protests from around the world and a resolution from this House, which Beijing ignored."
"In January 2003, we made efforts to prevent the execution of his spiritual leader, Lama Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, and did likewise in November 2004, when the two-year stay of execution expired."
"Yesterday, in a conversation here in Strasbourg, the Chinese Embassy assured me of the high probability of the death sentence being commuted to life imprisonment."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regards that statement as a triumph for the many initiatives taken by this House and others."
"We have never ceased from speaking out and winning support from parliaments and human rights organisations."
"Again and again, we have urged the Council and the Commission to press a change of course on those in power in China."
"Our demands are still on the agenda."
"A new trial is to examine charges of sabotage and involvement in bomb attacks."
"This trial must be in accordance with the rule of law and monitored by international observers."
"In essence, unfortunately, little has changed as regards human rights in China."
"Bishop Julius Jia Zhiguo, who belongs to the underground church, was recently arrested."
"It follows that the arms embargo must be maintained."
"The possibility of his being pardoned opens up a way ahead, and I hope that we will be able to go down it."
"What we are aiming for, and will continue to aim for, is the recognition of minority rights and the acknowledgement of the right to religious practice."
"One essential step in that direction would be the stepping up of dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"Mr President, just two months ago we highlighted the plight of the Tibetan monk Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche who was sentenced to death on 3 December 2002 in an unfair trial on politically motivated charges."
"We return today to his case."
"It is a reminder to us all that, even though this is 2005, some people in our world today still cannot practice their religious beliefs without the threat of violence or, in Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's case, death."
"Since we last spoke about his case in this House, there have been rumours that his death sentence has been suspended and may be commuted to a life sentence."
"I am pleased to hear Mr Mann's comments."
"I suggest that we still urge the Chinese authorities immediately to clarify the situation and urge – as our resolution says – the Chinese Government to commute the death sentence handed down to Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche."
"We should also ask the Chinese authorities further to clarify where Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche is being held and whether he is in good health."
"For the time being, no one knows his exact location."
"I also believe this House should strongly support the continuation of the EU embargo on arms sales to the People's Republic of China until such time as the human rights situation has improved and China has taken the vital step of signing the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"Further to this, we must continue to exert pressure on China to abolish the death penalty and place an immediate moratorium on capital punishment."
"We should be stressing to the Chinese authorities that Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche deserves a fair trial and not a sham trial."
"To conclude, there are many like Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche out there in our world today who deserve our support and the right to live in a country where religious freedom and human rights are respected."
"I hope this House can support this resolution."
"The Chinese authorities’ increasing interest in establishing good relations with European governments offers us a good opportunity to tackle the situation of Tibet and to state once again, as we have done before, that it is necessary to find a fair and lasting response to Tibetan demands."
"In their dealings with the Chinese authorities, European governments must take very good account of the enormous risks involved in any lifting of the European Union's arms embargo and must deal with the issue of political prisoners and the risk of their being sentenced to death, as in the case we are dealing with of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche."
"Furthermore, it is urgent that we appoint a European Union special representative for Tibet, in order to demonstrate both the importance of the Tibetan issue within the context of European Union-China negotiations and in order to facilitate the path towards a Chinese-Tibetan dialogue to put an end to the repression suffered by the Tibetan population, religion, language and culture for decades."
"Mr President, Tibet has been recognised as part of Chinese territory, against the will of its original people, for a long time."
"It is an area in the course of colonisation by the Chinese and one where many newcomers fulfil the function of official, policeman or military."
"Violent means have for many years been used to repress opposition to this humiliating state of affairs."
"The death penalty, whether to be carried out immediately or delayed, has been used by the Chinese state as a means of quashing the wishes of a large part of the population of Tibet."
"We in this Parliament, right across the political spectrum, have every reason to be indignant about the death penalty and certainly about its use as a political instrument, and we hope to prevent the execution in two weeks time of a respected and influential Buddhist lama."
"Present day China is akin to South Korea of recent years."
"In that model, economic growth is paramount, over and above man and the environment."
"If, on the basis of short-sighted European self-interest, we were to reason in the short term, there would be a considerable temptation to withdraw the criticism we have levelled at China."
"Indeed, China is the country with the largest population and the faster growing economy."
"For a century, that country stagnated on account of domestic wars, foreign occupations and idealistic, but ill-considered experiments, and has, internationally speaking, been placed off-side."
"It now looks as if it will be playing a vital role in the future."
"Do we resign ourselves to the fact that such an authoritative country applies the death penalty, treats its minorities badly, neglects its environment, pays its workers badly, tolerates unsafe living and working conditions and is not a democracy?"
"Or do we in Europe want to promote over there our views about a democratic constitutional state, diversity of political and religious opinions, freedom of association and democratic majority decisions?"
"That is why Europe must explicitly dare take sides with threatened minorities and movements, which, in future too, must be able to continue to play their role."
"In their relations with China, the Commission and Council must not work from the assumption that this is a big country with a fast-growing economy, but that this is a country which refuses to release colonised peoples, puts economic growth above anything else and for the rest also violates human rights."
"Only then can we expect results."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of the European Union’s new Member States are well aware of what is meant by human rights violations, as such violations are still fresh in our memories."
"The situation in Europe today has improved tremendously, although the fact that Mrs Estimirova and Mr Kovalev are present in this Chamber now indicates that much still remains for us to do in Europe in this respect."
"It is worth mentioning once again that Tibet has always been an independent state, which, being naturally cut off from the world, has never had any ambition to conduct any kind of foreign policy."
"This cannot be taken to mean, however, that China is entitled to declare Tibet part of China, as Tibet is most certainly not part of China."
"In spite of this, the Tibetan authorities and the Dalai Lama are prepared to hold a dialogue and would be satisfied with mere autonomy."
"Yet this is the bare minimum due to them, which we must call for on their behalf."
"This House is to adopt a position on this issue today, and we must call on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to enter into an ongoing dialogue with the Tibetan people and to respect the rights of minorities."
"We must call, and indeed we are calling, for the death sentence imposed on Tenzin Delek Rinpoche to be lifted, and for him to be released from prison."
"We are also calling on our institutions to maintain the arms trade embargo against the People’s Republic of China, and not to lift it."
"The free world has an instrument available to it to prevent tyrants from abusing those subject to such tyrants’ power against their will, and this instrument is appropriate economic sanctions."
"We must therefore call for our institutions to apply these sanctions, as well as for dialogue to take place between China and the whole of Chinese society, above all the Tibetan people and their representative, the Dalai Lama."
"We would like the President of Parliament to forward this resolution to the European Council, the European Commission, the UN Secretary-General and all those who can bring any influence to bear on China to encourage the country to start respecting human rights."
"We should not only feel pangs of conscience when a disaster such as the tsunami strikes."
"Instead, we must always be alert to the poverty and misfortune of people the world over."
"– Mr President, the Chinese have a proverb to the effect that one should throw away one’s watch before beginning to negotiate."
"This wise saying must not be misunderstood; it counsels stubborn determination rather than inactivity, and it is when, as sometimes happens, we begin to become resigned to the persistence with which the same human rights issues resurface over and over again, that we must continue to speak out with tenacity and a clear voice; we must be unrelenting in the defence of human rights, whether this be in the face of the Chinese Government or of other regimes that trample these rights underfoot."
"We must not, though, misinterpret this saying to mean that we should do nothing."
"We must be impatient when we protest against the large-scale violations of human rights that occur in a country like China, which is such an important partner."
"Our specific concern today is with the fate of a senior Tibetan monk and of a bishop of the Chinese underground church, the brutal persecution of both of whom violates the universally accepted principle of freedom of religion."
"Let me make it plain to our Chinese partners that it is unworthy of an ancient and highly-developed culture like their own to suppress another – that of Tibet, which is equally ancient and venerable."
"It ill becomes such an advanced culture to oppress and persecute faith communities such as the Buddhist community and the Catholic Church."
"China has no need of such a thing, and by doing this it does massive damage to itself."
"We Europeans must back up our words with deeds and try to exert pressure to enforce the observance of human rights, even when the state violating them is a large one and an important trading partner, such as Russia in its dealings with Chechnya, and China where Tibet and freedom of religion are concerned."
"In these matters, we must apply the same standards, rather than condemning the small states while grovelling to the big ones."
"Only if we do will Europe’s human rights policy remain credible in the future."
"– Mr President, speaking on behalf of my group, I would like again to make it clear that, at the beginning of this twenty-first century, our Constitution is an unequivocal expression of the importance to us of the rule of law and of the rights of citizens."
"These two things – as well as human rights – are important to us, and not to us alone."
"They matter to everyone throughout the world, and so our group emphatically reiterates its demand for the rule of law, and our demand that the Chinese Government promptly commute the death sentence passed on Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, and not only the sentence passed on him, but also the sentences passed on all those others in China upon whom the death penalty has been imposed."
"On behalf of my group, I also demand that capital punishment be done away with, including in China, for it is unworthy of a civilised people."
"– Mr President, despite the sign of hope we have been given today in the case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, we must continue to demand that the case against him be reopened and conducted according to the principles of the rule of law."
"If we do not, we will forever more be stalling, and we will always have cases of this kind on our hands."
"Not just in this case but in many others, a fair trial is what is needed."
"Now that we have passed our resolution on the Constitution, we in this House must continue to defend human rights and endangered minorities throughout the world, supporting their efforts and protecting them against arbitrary repression."
"We have to demand of our own governments that they do not allow themselves to be dazzled by the prospect of good business contacts, so that human rights fade out of the picture."
"We have to make use of developing relations with China to help human rights to prevail there too and to return autonomy to the people of Tibet at last."
"Mr President, in the framework of its political dialogue with China, and more recently on the occasion of the 7th bilateral EU-China summit held in The Hague on 8 December 2004, the EU has constantly addressed the issue of the safeguard of the rights of minorities, especially as regards Tibet."
"It has, in particular, urged the Chinese authorities to preserve the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people."
"These issues have also been systematically dealt with in the context of the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights."
"During this dialogue, the EU has regularly brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities, at every session, and most recently in Beijing on 24 September 2004, the situation of individuals who have been sentenced for having expressed their opinion or their beliefs."
"The case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche is one such case."
"At the beginning of 2004, the EU made an official démarche in Beijing to request information on his whereabouts and state of health, expressed the hope that the death sentence would not be upheld and asked for judicial review of the case."
"More recently, on 15 November, the EU Troika made a new ad hoc démarche in Beijing, during which the case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche was again highlighted."
"The EU is fully committed to urging China not to carry out the sentence and is prepared to contribute, in this respect, to finding an acceptable solution to the case under examination."
"It takes the view that the application of the death penalty to Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche would send out a very negative signal and would have an adverse impact on relations with China."
"We have just learned that the Luxembourg presidency - and the Commission immediately contacted it - is currently preparing a démarche that would also associate the Commission."
"The démarche will be sent to China asking it not to administer the death penalty and to re-examine the case."
"On a more general level, the EU has called for years, and will continue to call, as part of its overall policies vis-à-vis Tibet, for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities as the only realistic way of finding a lasting solution to the question of Tibet."
"In this context, we consider the recent third visit to China of the Dalai Lama’s special envoys to be an encouraging sign of progress."
"In the dialogue with China, the EU has regularly expressed concern over the extensive use of the death penalty."
"While reaffirming our longstanding position in favour of abolition, we have continued to press hard for at least the introduction of a moratorium."
"We have also stressed the need to comply, in the fight against terrorism, with the basic principles governing international relations and safeguarding human rights."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon, following the debates."
". – The next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on torture in Iran(2)."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, politics in general and bilateral relations in particular often make compromise necessary."
"This is particularly the case if one wants to make progress with partners with whom one has little in common. I therefore accept the fact that, in some way, and even though the parties do not admit it, a deal has been done, one that involves, on the one hand, Iran’s compliance with the IAEA’s (International Atomic Energy Agency) demands on nuclear matters and, on the other, the resumption of negotiations on the partnership and cooperation agreement with the EU, as happened in January."
"There is, however, one area in which no deals can be done, and that is in the field of human rights."
"Iran may well behave itself where nuclear energy is concerned, but this House, at any rate, will not reward it by turning a blind eye to what goes on there in the area of human rights, and I would also like to remind the Commission and the Council that any agreement has to be approved by this House."
"If the human rights situation continues to develop as it has done so far, I have grave doubts as to whether it will be."
"Even the UN General Assembly, when it met on 20 December last year, denounced the deteriorating situation in Iran as regards the freedoms of speech, opinion and the media, as well as the arbitrary arrests without charges or court proceedings."
"It is journalists and those who write for the Internet who are on the receiving end of this sort of treatment, and I have learned from the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders that the Nobel Peace Prize holder Shirin Ebadi was yesterday summoned to the public prosecutor’s office in Teheran."
"The reason for this is not yet known, but my hunch is that this is another case of good old-fashioned intimidation."
"Quite apart from that, it is unacceptable that death sentences should still be being carried out, particularly on juveniles and the mentally handicapped, and there is still no confirmation that execution by stoning is now a thing of the past and will not be revived."
"Let us then send out a clear message that we will not allow Iran to continue with such a policy."
"– Mr President, not only internally is the EU in a process of constant development, but its cooperation and contacts in matters of foreign policy are also becoming ever more extensive."
"That is not only important in terms of defending our economic interests, but also and primarily in terms of building up networks whereby human rights, peacekeeping, respect for nature, and much else, can be demanded and put into practice."
"This is an area in which many delegations from this House are active, and these contacts have enabled us to achieve a great deal."
"Parliament’s desire to establish and build up inter-parliamentary delegations with Iran in order to enter into dialogue with that country is something to be welcomed."
"During its preparatory stages, many sensitive issues will have to be addressed and stipulations made."
"As we have just heard, the Iranian Government has, in recent years, acceded to a number of UN Conventions, including that on the rights of the child, and signed up to the Declaration of Human Rights."
"Changes have also been made to its penal code, and execution by stoning prohibited, although this ban has been inadequately implemented."
"I regret to say that this list does not include the Declaration on the Rights of Women."
"In this resolution, we highlight the very large gaps in many areas and the inadequate respect for human rights, with particular reference to the imprisonment of women and to arbitrary arrests."
"The treatment of journalists also leaves much to be desired, and the situation must be improved as a matter of urgency."
"What is going on in Iran must be carefully investigated and examined, and so there are two points on which I cannot endorse this resolution, and in respect of which I will be moving an oral amendment."
"We must clearly express what we think joint cooperation means and stick to our principles, whilst also accepting that Iran has its own structures and must itself decide in what way it is to change, difficult though this may often be for us to understand."
"The only way for us to change anything is not to pass up the chance of a new start."
"– Mr President, even though Iran is one of the largest countries on earth, it still has a government whose actions we view with concern."
"I am delighted to learn of the efforts being made to foster dialogue with it, and of the pressure that the European Union is exerting in connection with the state of human rights there."
"During the fourth dialogue on human rights between the EU and Iran, held on 14 and 15 June 2004 in Teheran, Iran undertook to improve human rights, and that is a good thing, but we can also see that there is an urgent need that something be done about this, for international organisations estimate that every year still sees between 300 and 400 executions carried out, with some 80 people being flogged and an unknown number stoned to death – all this despite, as you have heard, these things no longer, officially, being in the Iranian penal code."
"What shows how much contempt a government can have for its own people is the relevant article – no."
"119 – from the former Iranian penal code, according to which the stones used at a stoning must not be so large that the condemned person dies from the impact of one or two of them, nor so small that they cannot be described as stones."
"Such a thing is torture, legitimised by the state with the intention of causing death, and it has yet to be demonstrated that it is no longer carried out today, at this stage in the twenty-first century."
"Reference has also been made to the human rights of juveniles; although death sentences are pronounced on them, the sentence is not carried out until they are 18."
"That means that minors aged 14 and over can spend up to four years in what are called ‘education camps’, waiting to be executed, instead of being able to have a proper education and a future to look forward to."
"We have just heard what the UN has had to say on the situation in Iran."
"I am very glad that the letter sent by the President of this Parliament, Josep Borrell, to the Iranian ambassador has helped to get a stoning, due to be carried out at the end of last year, delayed and the sentence commuted."
"Let us continue to exert this sort of pressure, for only in that way will we, in the eyes of the world, do justice to our own objectives."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since this House’s last debate on this subject, in October of last year, there has been some discernible progress, but also a number of reverses."
"I am relieved to learn that the United Kingdom, Germany and France have managed to press on with the negotiations on the atomic energy programme."
"Above all, I am glad that – as we have just heard – there have been positive responses when we have raised individual cases of grave violations of human rights in Iran."
"We are evidently being listened to after all, and can hope that our intervention in the human rights sphere can meet with success."
"In this process the European Commission is a partner in negotiation and dialogue, and so it is to them, in the first instance, that I appeal that human rights should not be treated as a secondary issue, but put centre stage in exactly the same way as economic relations with Iran or the issue of how to prevent it acquiring nuclear weapons."
"I also want to make it clear to our Iranian friends that dialogue and negotiation mean critical dialogue;"
"Iran must listen when we criticise some of the things that go on there and that we cannot accept and never will, such as the maltreatment and oppression of women, the stonings and the executions."
"I do not see last December’s United Nations resolution as an interruption to this dialogue, but rather as a component of our policy and an admonition to us."
"It is also, unfortunately, evidence that our concerns about the human rights situation, the restrictions on the freedom of the press and the persecution of journalists are more than justified."
"Let me once again appeal, as a matter of urgency, to the Iranian authorities to do something more than make announcements and instead cancel the stonings, give women real rights in practice, and offer more than lip-service to what this dialogue is about."
"We are also very concerned about the accusations levelled at the Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi."
"I believe that not only all Members of this House, but also the Commission’s and Council’s representatives, are making it plain that we expect her good work not to be hampered in any way."
"Although my group will be voting in favour of the resolution, we will be asking for item 9 to be deleted, as this debate is not the place for it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union and Iran have returned to the negotiating table in order to resume talks on a joint trade and cooperation agreement."
"The reason for this, or so we are told, is that Iran has now agreed to allow monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency and has put a stop, for the time being, to the enrichment of uranium."
"I ask myself how it is that Iran’s stance in the so-called ‘nuclear controversy’ can be the only criterion that the Commission considers when deciding to restart the negotiations."
"There are still serious problems where human rights are concerned, and every one of the European Union’s trade and cooperation agreements contains unequivocal statements on the human rights chapters on which cooperation depends."
"The Commission’s attitude gives the impression that human rights have, overnight, ceased to be a problem in Iran."
"This resolution presses home the point that there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in Iran."
"Sharia law continues to be imposed with its full rigour; executions, stonings, torture and arbitrary arrests continue day by day."
"The work of human rights activists and journalists has become even more difficult and even more hazardous; the Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi has again been summoned before a court."
"These facts lead me to regard the European Union as acting utterly deceitfully in resuming negotiations with the Iranian Government at this stage."
"I appeal both to the Commission and to the Council to take their own demands seriously and not to allow themselves to be bought – in the truest sense of the word."
"Rather than negotiating with Iran on cooperation in economic policy matters, the European Union should be sitting down with those forces that are actually doing something for democracy, to change Iran, to make it democratic."
"I think that what Mr Gahler came out with was another attempt at coupling one thing with another, so let me ask him, in plain language, to name one country that behaves in the way Iran does."
"If we are not to suspend trade relations with Iran, with what country does he want us to suspend them?"
". Mr President, I have to say that I agree with Mr Markov and we should be calling on some of our colleagues here to wake up, because the EU policy of appeasing the cruel, fundamentalist dictatorship in Tehran has simply encouraged the mullahs to introduce increasingly repressive measures and carry out more sickening displays of barbarity."
"Public hangings are now an almost daily spectacle, often involving the execution of children, the mentally handicapped and even pregnant women."
"Six pregnant women have been executed this year alone."
"Stoning to death, amputation of limbs, floggings and torture are commonplace."
"This is a fascist regime that has made a farce of democracy and has consigned human rights to the dustbin."
"Only today the Nobel Peace Prize winner has been summoned to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, which is an outrage."
"I hope you will write to the Iranian Ambassador and object to that."
"Last month, Maryam Rajavi, the charismatic leader of the Iranian opposition movement, came here to the European Parliament in Strasbourg and told us that the solution in confronting this challenge is neither appeasement nor a military invasion."
"The Iranian people themselves, through their courageous resistance movement, have the capacity to bring about change."
"But we have to offer them encouragement."
"So it is vitally important that we support Article 9 of this resolution which would enable us to look again at the EU terror list which, at the insistence of the mullahs, includes the name of the Iranian resistance, the People's Mujahedin."
"As a major US intelligence investigation recently disclosed, there is no justification for keeping the name of the Mujahedin on the EU terror list."
"Indeed, by agreeing to this demand from the mullahs, we have given them a further reason to impose the death penalty on supporters of the resistance movement."
"Right now, three men are awaiting execution in Iran simply because they support the People's Mujahedin."
"They have been accused of no other crimes but, according to the mullahs' website, the death penalty is justified because the Mujahedin appears on the EU terror list."
"This is the result of our squalid attempts at appeasement and we must do something to stop it."
". – Mr President, I wish to add my voice to that of the previous speaker and to the voices of all those who have made every effort to express our indignation at the continuing, and worsening, violation of human rights in Iran."
"It is only three months since October, but we have been forced to return to this House due to the deteriorating situation."
"I should like to call on those Members who wish to backtrack on this resolution so as to withdraw these oral amendments and to withdraw this proposal thus making the text less contentious. This is because the question before us is whether or not we are sending a sufficiently clear message to the Iranian regime, and whether we are addressing the regime’s latest action, which was to summon the Nobel Peace Prize winner to the police."
"This kind of appeasement will bring us the worst possible results."
"I therefore call for the withdrawal of these proposals and for a unanimous vote in favour of the text as it is."
". Mr President, last month, Mrs Maryam Rajavi, leader of the main opposition party in Iran, visited the European Parliament and addressed 150 MEPs."
"She drew attention to the injustice that is still being done to the Iranian people because the Mujaheddin, who fight for a democratic constitutional state on European lines, still feature on our list of terrorist organisations."
"It is from that European list that the regime of fundamentalist religious fanatics derives the right to execute political prisoners who can be linked with it."
"The regime has devoted much negative attention to Mrs Rajavi’s visit."
"Those who wish to continue to kill and torture opponents unhindered, have every reason to demonise and isolate the democratic opposition that has been driven into exile."
"It is high time for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs to reconsider the list of terrorist organisations and in doing so, help to end the violation of human rights in Iran."
"I consider the full acceptance of the proposed resolution, including Paragraph 9, as an appeal to that effect."
"That is vital in order to achieve a democratic constitutional state in Iran."
"Mr President, the Iranian regime is responsible for many violations of human rights in Iran, and we believe that the soft policy adopted by some EU governments has been a great failure."
"When we maintain diplomatic relations with this regime, and especially when the Council labels the main opposition as terrorists, we are encouraging the regime to carry on its violations of human rights more than before."
"The most serious message that we could send to Tehran is to remove the name of the Iranian Mujahideen from the list of terrorists."
"In reality, the criminal mullahs are the real terrorists."
"They hang their own people, including children, and also send terrorists to neighbouring Iraq."
"This is, frankly, a very soft resolution. However, we support it and, in particular, the paragraph on a review of the terrorist list by the Public Affairs Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"Mr President, our debate today coincides with resumption in Brussels of negotiations between the European Union and Iran on the conclusion of a trading and cooperation agreement, alongside talks about political dialogue and combating terrorism."
"This is a particularly positive development in the continuing Paris agreement of November 2004 between France, Germany and Great Britain, on behalf of the European Union, and Iran on the moratorium on uranium enrichment and control of Iranian activities in the nuclear sector."
"These developments confirm the international credibility and the huge political potential of the European Union when it acts as one to resolve important international problems through dialogue and political means."
"Bearing in mind the negative experience in Iraq and in the face of the unilateral philosophy of the United States, the European Union is in a position to formulate its own alternative proposal on international problems, in close cooperation with the UN and its competent agencies."
"The ΕU is Iran's first trading partner, a fact which proves the importance of reinforcing Euro-Iranian relations as a tool in the European strategy for the democratisation of Iran, for respect of its international obligations and for reversing its internalisation and isolation."
"A balanced policy of, on the one hand, pressure and checks on Iran for the respect of democratic freedoms and human rights and, on the other hand, of incentives to develop relations, is the only effective way of establishing a climate of mutual trust and reversing confrontational outbidding and the unilateral strategic approach to the resolution of regional problems."
"We must continue to be constant supporters of human rights in Iran, of cooperation with civil society and of dialogue at all levels."
"Within this framework, the European Parliament must take specific initiatives."
"– Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"One of the European Union’s main roles is to act as spokesperson for the needs of people in difficulty and to promote human rights, freedom, democracy and tolerance."
"We therefore all agree on pressing the Iranian authorities to comply with international conventions on the freedom of the press, on the outlawing of torture, and on respect for the rights of children, women and minorities."
"The ringing of many alarm bells tells us that the situation on political and social reform is in fact deteriorating rather than making progress."
"The United Nations, too, expressed growing concern about the situation in its resolution of 21 December 2004."
"We all hope that Iran, a country with plenty of potential and in great cultural turmoil, can become a fully operative economic and political partner as soon as possible."
"All future trade, however, must be closely matched by careful monitoring of the true social situation in the country and must be made conditional upon the establishment of the required reforms and their effective and unequivocal application."
"The recommendations that the European Council made in December, which are in line with this approach, therefore need to be put into practice very soon."
"Mr President, as the last person to speak in this debate and before giving way to the Commissioner, I would like to say that my views coincide with those of many speakers, in particular those of the spokesman for my group, Mr Casaca."
"And as a member of the delegation for relations with Iran, I have seen very many diverse cases of human rights violations in that country and hence the need for this Parliament to maintain a firm position on this issue."
"If there is any purpose to Europe and to the European Parliament, it is our approach to human rights; it is the main source of our identity."
"I would like to say, in the few seconds left to me, that it is not just the new Member States such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia who have suffered dictatorships; unfortunately, other members of our generations have also suffered dictatorships: in my case, the Franco dictatorship, one of the cruellest and most lasting of the twentieth century."
"We are all, therefore, very sensitive to this issue."
"Mr President, The European Commission shares Parliament’s concern at the human rights situation in Iran and the recent testimonies of torture."
"Like the Council, which adopted conclusions on this issue at the end of 2004, the Commission is of the opinion that little progress has been made in the past two years, despite the commitment made by the Government of Iran to strengthen respect for human rights and promote the rule of law."
"That is why the European Union has decided unanimously to co-sponsor the resolution on the situation of human rights in Iran adopted at the United Nations General Assembly of November 2004."
"This resolution expresses serious concern in relation to a number of human rights issues, including the use of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, such as amputation and flogging."
"At the same time, the resolution recalls the announcement of a ban on torture by the head of the Iranian judiciary in April 2004 and the subsequent passing of related legislation by the Iranian Parliament in May 2004."
"Those are interesting developments and issues which, together with the recent allegations of torture, warrant being raised directly with our Iranian partners."
"The European Union is committed to pursuing the human rights dialogue initiated in December 2002, which remains an important channel for dialogue, not only with influential representatives of the judiciary, but also with Iranian civil society."
"I would also like to highlight the visits undertaken by a number of United Nations special rapporteurs to Iran since our human rights dialogue opened."
"That is quite remarkable in a country which previously had remained closed to United Nations visits for 16 years."
"Finally, I would like to recall that following the positive developments on the nuclear front, the European Union is currently in the process of resuming talks with the Iranian Government on trade, investment and economic issues."
"These talks will provide an opportunity to highlight once again to our Iranian partners that all the relevant issues – political, nuclear, trade and human rights – are mutually inter-linked."
"The Commission is in favour of constructive engagement with Iran, but that engagement is not synonymous with acting irresponsibly as regards areas of concern that matter so much to Parliament, the European Union and the world at large."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon, following the debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the trafficking of women and children in Cambodia(3)."
"Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"In Cambodia, women are the first to become victims of internal political instability."
"It is a problem which certainly cannot be solved by a discussion on a Thursday afternoon in the Chamber of the European Parliament, but I should nevertheless like to draw your attention to a broader phenomenon in this part of the world - sex tourism."
"When we talk about the abuse of children and women, we must have the courage also to talk about men, for it is men who bear special responsibility for this."
"Tourism is of course a legitimate activity with its own cultural and educational values."
"But when tourism is abused, it can destroy the morals and culture of many Asian countries, including Cambodia."
"This is a moral tsunami, resulting mainly in the abuse of young women and even small children through prostitution and people trafficking."
"We must continue to address those who are responsible."
"We must act with resolution."
"We should persist in confronting all media which are not fighting against the sex industry."
"The protection of women and children in Cambodia against abuse begins here, with us, in our Member States."
"The persistence of poverty and the exploitation of people give rise to extreme disquiet."
"Asian women are well aware of their dignity."
"They wish to support their fundamental cultural values."
"This awakening is one of the most important signals of our times."
"But, despite this, poverty and the exploitation of women remain a serious problem throughout Asia."
"Illiteracy among women is far more widespread than among men and the right to life for female children is subject to far greater risks."
"The actions of our Member States must above all have regard for the values held by these women and ensure that their cultures are respected."
"Mr President, through this resolution we are condemning the crime of people trafficking and the sexual exploitation of minors, and also the fact that the people responsible for these crimes so often go unpunished."
"In the Chai Hour hotel in Phnom Penh, prostitution was taking place and women and girls were forced to take part in it."
"On the initiative of the AFESIP organisation, 84 of them were freed and were transferred to that organisation’s refuge."
"The pimps were arrested in the same operation."
"According to our information, the next day the criminals were freed without charge and the same type of activity continued to operate in the hotel."
"In the mean time, a violent group broke into the refuge, took away the women and girls and, undoubtedly, put them back to work as prostitutes."
"So the organisations dedicated to protecting sexually-exploited women and girls, such as AFESIP, are seeing the girls they rescue and try to rehabilitate socially being sold back into prostitution."
"This process involves threats and often violence against the activists who carry out this work."
"In this particular case, I would like to state that the Socialist Group supports, and calls on Parliament to support, the President of AFESIP, Mrs Somaly Mam, who is in great danger and has had to flee her country, having had her life threatened by the mafias who control this criminal business."
"It should be noted that Mrs Mam has received significant recognition in Spain, France and Italy."
"This impunity is the result of the corruption that is generated as a result of the huge financial profits created by sexual exploitation and people trafficking, and what makes this worse for us is that a large proportion of these profits come from sexual tourism by Europeans."
"The Socialist Group’s appeal is addressed to the governments of our countries, to tackle sexual tourism and strengthen the fight against the mafias operating within it."
"We are also addressing our appeal to the Commission and the authorities of the countries in which child and forced prostitution is an everyday reality, such as Cambodia."
"We should urge them, in their relations with those countries, to become involved in combating this type of activity, amongst other things by supporting the organisations involved in rescuing and rehabilitating the victims."
"Mr President, trafficking and sexual exploitation is, in effect, modern-day slavery."
"In Cambodia alone, it is estimated that a staggering 8 000 to 100 000 women and children could be caught up in the sex trafficking industry. That is according to a Cambodian Government report."
"Those figures have increased dramatically since the 1990s."
"It is also estimated that the judiciary fails to convict in 94% of the cases brought to court."
"Prosecutions need to be increased, but must also result in convictions, meaning that corruption has to be stamped out."
"Often it is the poor who are convicted – a mother selling her daughter, for instance, to put food on the table."
"According to one Cambodia NGO, the police, military police, army and other state personnel are involved in this trade, and are running or protecting trafficking rings and brothels."
"Traffickers quite often receive assistance from immigration officials."
"The EU must work with governments and local and international NGOs to put an end to this trade."
"Cooperation between Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, is absolutely imperative in order to stop the flow of sex workers across borders."
"We also need education and training for border police."
"Sex workers should have access to affordable legal advice so as to increase the conviction rate."
"Regarding HIV and Aids, prevention is also a priority."
"NGOs need increased funding and assistance, not only for these areas, but also to rehabilitate victims."
"The EU must continue targeting development aid to the poverty-stricken areas of Cambodia so that young women who escape have an actual alternative and are not lured back into the trade through desperation."
"Mr President, we are all agreed that trafficking in women and children is a crime; this case in Cambodia is, alas, but one among many, and there are a great many such cases around the world that are not known about."
"Over recent weeks, public opinion around the world has been disturbed by reports in the media according to which child victims of the tsunami are being trafficked."
"What makes this case in Cambodia all the more disconcerting is the fact that it is only by chance that it has reached the public – us in this House – and is, unfortunately, not unsettling people around the world."
"Nonetheless, where the worldwide trade in women and children is concerned, it is but the tip of the iceberg."
"I believe that it shows how prevalent corruption is in Cambodia, that the country’s justice system has not been reformed, and that, no matter what the sex industry is up to, the Cambodian Government should have ensured that the pimps were not, within a matter of days, set at liberty to again be a menace to their victims."
"We must also, though, ask ourselves questions about what lies behind this trade."
"The constant increase in the number of landless people in Cambodia is contributing to an ever-worsening situation, in that these people have no prospects unless they sell their sons and daughters."
"This is something we have to denounce; this is where we really have to point out where the problem lies and at last bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Cambodian Government, so that nothing like what has happened there can ever happen again."
"We also have to voice our concern that the committee that has been appointed may well be a mere formality, a sort of sedative pill to calm down the public and us as well."
"We therefore hope that the debate in this House will prompt others to bring these crimes more to light and to the attention of the world, and to combat them."
"Mr President, the fact that the Cambodian Government, or any other government for that matter, takes inadequate action against the trafficking and abuse of women and children is wholly unacceptable."
"Women’s and children’s rights should not be treated as second-class issues."
"It is the EU’s moral duty to deploy all the leverage at its disposal in order to change this situation."
"This sort of modern slavery must be banned, and this will need to be one of the priorities of the EU’s external policy."
"In addition, it is of the utmost importance for support to be given to those NGOs and people who are involved in the fight against the abuse of women and children."
"That is a task for both the EU and the Member States."
"As such, I would like to warmly thank those who have worked on this resolution."
"– Mr President, hardly any country has suffered as much as Cambodia over the past 60 to 70 years: first there was the Second World War, which raged there with the same brutality as elsewhere; then came the two wars in Indo-China, the Khmer Rouge with their stone age communism, and the Communism imposed by the Vietnamese, who claimed to come as liberators, while, today, the state is falling apart and there is organised crime on an unimaginable scale."
"Nevertheless, it has rightly been said that none of this can be a reason to tolerate or accept what is currently happening there, and before our very eyes."
"What we see going on is a particularly unpleasant form of contemporary – I refuse to call it modern – slavery, in the shape of the sexual exploitation of this country’s women and underaged children."
"It is, of course, in the first instance, organised crime in Cambodia that bears responsibility for this to a massive degree, but that responsibility is shared by two other bodies, and so I see items 12 and 13 of our resolution as very important."
"There is, on the one hand, the Cambodian Government itself, which must, at long last, ratify and implement the relevant UN Convention and the relevant agreement on the combating, firstly of trafficking in human beings, and secondly of organised crime."
"It is we, though, in the European Union, who share responsibility to an equal degree."
"This trade in slaves could not exist in the absence of a market for them; the demand for them comes not exclusively or principally from Asia, but, to a massive degree and not least, from Europe."
"For that reason, our responsibility is not only to use our foreign policy, security policy and development policy as a means to the end of doing away with this form of slavery; we must also be unrelenting in using all the means with which we, in Europe, combat cross-border crime and fight for our internal security, to hunt down the operators and organisers of this sort of sex tourism, for if we do not, we will have not the least right to point the finger at others."
"We must start by discharging our own responsibilities in Europe and then press home the point to our Cambodian partners that this is a fundamental human rights issue and one on which we will yield not an inch, and we must be willing not only to give them massive support in building up their justice system, but also, within the EU, to clean our own house."
"Mr President, in this world that has been numbed by materialism it is unfortunately only major disasters, such as the tsunami or the terrorist attack in Beslan, which can still trigger pangs of conscience and act as a catalyst for aid and reflection."
"Dramatic events that can only be described as the unleashing of the elements have however been happening on a day-to-day basis for many years, with such events being primarily a source of physical evil."
"By way of contrast, a person without a conscience or moral principles may cause much greater harm by insulting the dignity of human beings and making it impossible to live in the fullness of humanity."
"We have witnessed both moral and spiritual destruction for many years in the countries of Southern Asia and in Cambodia, the country we are debating today."
"This destruction can be seen particularly clearly in the treatment of women and young children, who are forced into prostitution, taken away to work in warehouses, factories or on rubber plantations or sold for profit."
"Such treatment is plainly an insult to human dignity."
"According to overall estimates, over 2 million people are sold in this region every year, and trade in children ranks third in terms of profitability for the criminal world, after drugs trafficking and arms trading."
"According to such estimates and the UN’s reports, in Cambodia it is particularly difficult to combat the trade in women and children or their sexual exploitation, as both the police and the authorities are corrupt and accept large bribes from rich and depraved tourists."
"Exploitation of this kind is a barbaric form of modern slavery."
"Over 60% of women and young girls are forced into prostitution, and the majority of them are either infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS."
"The most obvious cause for this is poverty, or rather destitution, as in this region almost one quarter of the population, a population which amounts for one third of the world’s inhabitants, live on less than one dollar a day."
"In circumstances such as these, millions of women and children are forced into life-threatening work and tricked with promises of legal employment."
"This results in their sale and export abroad as slaves."
"There, they are exploited not only for work, but also for various deviant practices, including sexual practices, paedophilia and child pornography."
"Another cause is illiteracy and the Communist ideology of the Khmer Rouge, who attempted to build a new society by means of terror, threats and lies, claiming over a million victims in the process."
"After years under Pol Pot’s rule, both the country and its health service and medical care infrastructures were left entirely destroyed, and millions of children who had lost their parents were left without anything to live on."
"Unfortunately, over the past few years the state has also moved towards economic liberalism."
"It is not insignificant that liberal destruction of the family and the much-lauded utilitarian and hedonistic model of life are characteristic even of those who help humanitarian non-governmental organisations, some of whom accept a shameful form of payment in kind for this help by exploiting women and children sexually."
"It is for this reason that this House’s resolutions and debates will do little to improve the situation, as even educated people in high-ranking positions mock the sanctity of the human being and the family."
"It is not only financial aid and the much-praised market economy that are needed, but above all moral renewal and ethical principles."
"I thank you."
". Mr President, the Commission resolutely condemns all forms of trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation, especially of children."
"The Commission fully shares the concerns of the Members of the European Parliament about the existence and the extent of human trafficking in Cambodian citizens."
"It is particularly revolting that the perpetrators of this evil crime focus their attention on the poorest of the poor in one of the least-developed countries of south-east Asia, where the high level of poverty and the limited capacity of the national agencies, as well as local corruption and collusion, make it easier for them to operate."
"These conditions have facilitated the development of trafficking of migrant workers for economic exploitation, the trafficking of women - both inside Cambodia and across its borders - for prostitution, and the trafficking of children for prostitution, begging and illegal adoption."
"The Commission’s cooperation activities in Cambodia are directed ultimately at reducing poverty but are also designed to reflect the EU’s commitment to human rights and democracy, including equal treatment for men and women and the protection of children."
"More specifically, under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, the Commission has already committed almost EUR 1.9 million to UNICEF and Action by Churches Together/DanChurchAid in support of two large programmes to secure legal protection for children in Cambodia, as well as funds to support the development of local human rights NGOs."
"Furthermore, in the Commission’s programming document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for 2005 and 2006 for Campaign 2, called 'Fostering a culture of human rights', for which Cambodia is eligible, it is planned to address the issue of trafficking in children and women."
"The campaign will also promote the rights of human rights defenders."
"It will improve the protection of, and raise awareness about, the situation of those who work, at personal risk, to advance human rights through non-violent means, taking into account the recommendations of paragraph 13 of the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders."
"The Royal Government of Cambodia has recently taken a number of positive initiatives to address the problem, including the signature of memoranda of understanding with Thailand on trafficking in women and children and on the management of migrant labour between the two countries, participation in the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking and the establishment of a Department of Anti-Human Trafficking in the Ministry of Interior in 2002."
"I very much welcome these important initiatives and I have no doubt that these initiatives will also be welcomed by the Members of this Parliament."
"But the practical realities and the evident difficulty of implementing these measures have been drawn to the attention of all of us by the recent events involving the NGO AFESIP, which has received support from Spain, the UK and the Commission."
"These events have rightly given renewed concern to all of us."
"The Member State embassies in Phnom Penh and the EC Delegation reacted immediately with a statement, calling for a full investigation and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice."
"On 12 December, the government announced the establishment of an inter-Departmental Commission to inquire into the events."
"The Member State embassies in Phnom Penh and the EC Delegation joined other donors in a further statement to welcome this announcement and to express the hope that the conclusions of the inquiry would be credible and transparent."
"I can assure you that the EC Delegation to the Kingdom of Cambodia, in collaboration with the Member States' missions in the country, will follow closely the progress of the government inquiry and will continue to report on developments."
"Mr President, please accept my apologies, but I had already said at the beginning of this debate on human rights that two prominent human rights activists, Mr Kovalev from Russia and Mrs Estemirova from Chechnya were here today to receive our group’s Robert Schuman Medal."
"Although you had extended a warm welcome to them, they were not actually here yet."
"They have now arrived, and I would like to assure our two guests that we will not cease from the fight for human rights in Russia, Chechnya and throughout the world."
"Commissioner, I can still recall how, one Thursday afternoon, this House declared its support for human rights in Slovenia and for that country’s freedom."
"Today, we have a Slovene Commissioner, and I hope that we in this House will live to see, one day, freedom, human rights and independence for Chechnya and Russia."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place next."
"The next item is the vote on the following motions for resolutions."
"Mr President, the end of paragraph 7 should be amended to read 'insists that adult consensual sexual activity in private is covered by the concept of privacy and calls for the immediate release of all persons held for such activity'."
"Mr President, I wish to propose an oral amendment to section 8, the last third of which I move should read as follows: ‘in expecting action by Iran to address also other concerns of the EU regarding the fight against terrorism, the respect for human rights and Iran’s approach to the Middle East peace process’, and I ask you to accept this proposal."
"Mr President, I believe that what we have voted on, and regrettably has been rejected, is the paragraph amended by Mrs Prets; it is not the amendment, but the paragraph as amended."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we will have to change the agenda, because, as I expect you already know, the President of Ukraine, Mr Yuschenko, cannot be with us today as planned, due to the weather conditions seriously affecting the whole of central Europe which have prevented him from taking off this morning."
"We had planned to dedicate a statement and a minute’s silence to the memory of the Auschwitz-Birkenau tragedy today and I believe we must go ahead with that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today is a sad day of commemoration for the whole of humanity."
"On a day like today in 1945 the soldiers of the Red Army liberated the Nazi extermination camp whose name has become engraved on man's collective memory."
"It has become engraved on our collective memory as the name of absolute horror, of evil, in its most extreme form, of industrialised, planned and documented crime."
"We are still all astounded that it could have happened."
"But it did happen."
"It is unimaginable, but it was real."
"Today, a delegation from this Parliament, made up of the presidents of all the political groups, and the largest of the delegations to go to Auschwitz, will participate in the ceremony in tribute to those victims, together with former prisoners, Heads of State or Government of many countries and some of the soldiers who liberated the camp."
"In that way, we will be paying tribute to the victims, but, above all, we will be remembering that evil that led to the deaths of millions of Jews merely because they were Jews, and of ethnic minorities, homosexuals and political prisoners of various nationalities."
"It is an evil that affects all of us."
"Of course it affects the victims and their descendants, but it also affects those of us who were not there, those of us who cannot remember because we did not see it."
"Auschwitz should remind us of the battle between remembering and forgetting, the battle of memory against something we would like never to have happened, because people who forget their history are destined to repeat it."
"The Holocaust is a great problem for the whole of humanity."
"It is not just a problem for the Nazi murderers and the Jewish victims."
"Its roots are deeply embedded in some of the characteristics which have frequently shown their hideous face throughout human history."
"Today, 60 years later, we must continue to fight everything that made it possible: racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, interracial hate, the indifference of our society, which believes that it has nothing to do with it, until it finally realises that it does, that it also affects it, but by then it is too late."
"To that end, and so that we do not forget it, we shall also vote today on a resolution on the memory of the Holocaust and anti-Semitism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have the obligation to work every day, not just when the fascination of round figures, 60 years, – why 60 and not 59? – revives the memory, but every day, so that the values of our Constitution – peace, human rights, respect and tolerance – which are entirely contrary to what happened in Auschwitz, are spread and defended in schools, at work, on the stairs, in the street, in the bars, in everybody’s shared daily lives."
"Remembering Auschwitz offers us an opportunity to defend the values of our Constitution and to take this opportunity to defend human dignity, which was so horrifically violated in that place."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask that we observe a minute’s silence."
"Ladies and gentlemen, following that moment of respect in memory of the victims of Auschwitz, the sitting is suspended."
"Mr President, we have come to an agreement with different groups in order to find a compromise acceptable to the majority."
"The compromise contains two points."
"The first part of our amendment would become an addition, while the second part would be the subject of a separate vote."
"The wording that we are putting to the vote would therefore strongly encourage President Abbas to demonstrate his willingness to bring the violence to an end and would welcome the measures taken by President Abbas with this in view."
"The rest of the wording remains unchanged."
"The second part of the amendment, that is to say the phrase whereby the Israeli authorities are asked to accept and implement the roadmap and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, would be the subject of a separate vote."
"Mr President, as colleagues realise, this resolution largely deals with the results of the very happy election in Palestine on 9 January when 28 colleagues observed the elections, chaired by myself and with Mrs Napoletano as deputy chairman."
"The resolution we are voting on not only deals with the approval of the election itself, but also the follow-up we expect the various organisations and institutions to take."
"Paragraph 15 is inappropriate in this context."
"It deals with the internal procedures in the European Parliament."
"I have discussed with Mrs Napoletano and others the necessity to delete paragraph 15. My invitation to the House is to delete paragraph 15."
"This amendment would affect the text as follows."
"Firstly, there would be a specific reference to the estimated number of victims who died at Auschwitz, some one and a half million persons."
"Secondly, the amendment provides for a reference to the 15 000 Russian prisoners who died there."
"I ask you to support this amendment."
"Mr President, he is speaking on the wrong paragraph."
"He should be speaking on paragraph 5, indent 2, which is the wording in Polish of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum."
"Mr Sonik has just spoken on recital A, but he is supposed to be speaking on paragraph 5, indent 2."
"Mr Sonik, there has been some confusion."
"What you must present now is your oral amendment to paragraph 5, indent 2, but you have presented something else."
"So please now present your oral amendment to paragraph 5, indent 2."
"That is the case. I apologise for the mistake."
"The amendment does indeed concern the inclusion in the resolution of a reference to the National Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum at Oświęcim as a special Holocaust education and remembrance centre, along with the Holocaust Centre in Berlin."
"Mr President, I should like to table an oral amendment to recital A. A number of discussions have taken place over the past few days and during the past hour, and I can perhaps go some way towards ending them by briefly explaining this amendment."
"It is undoubtedly true that we are all faced with a difficult situation, in that on days like today every word must be weighed very carefully. Whichever wording is used, our primary consideration must be the victims’ dignity and the perpetrators’ guilt."
"In order to take everyone’s concerns into account, I therefore propose that we amend the second phrase of recital A, the original of which read; ‘the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Hitler’s Nazi death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau...’."
"We propose that ‘Hitler’s Nazi’ be replaced by ‘Nazi Germany’s’, with the text then reading; ‘...Nazi Germany’s death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau...’."
"As I see it, this would convey Germany’s guilt and special responsibility, whilst at the same time making it clear that it was the Nazis who placed themselves under the burden of this guilt."
"It is a fact that there were German victims too, and this wording also commemorates them."
"I therefore ask the House to vote in favour of this amendment."
"Mr President, after the many debates on this issue, I should like to confirm that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of this oral amendment."
"Mr President, could we have some clarity on this subject?"
"There are two separate amendments here."
"The first – the oral amendment from the PPE-DE Group that Mr Sonik moved – is to the change the wording, which, in English, would now read: ‘a combined total of up to 1.5 million Jews, Roma, Poles, Russians and prisoners of various other nationalities and homosexuals’."
"Could we please vote on that first, before we come to the separate issue, that Mr Schulz has just spoken on, of Amendment 1 by the UEN Group to replace, in English, the phrase ‘Hitler’s Nazi death camps’ with ‘German Nazi death camps’."
"Two separate votes are required here."
"With respect, the confusion has arisen not least owing to the services, which have put it all on the same line: recital A, oral amendment from the PPE-DE Group, and the amendment from the UEN Group, about which Mr Schulz spoke."
"Could we have two separate votes, please, first on Mr Sonik’s oral amendment, and second on the UEN-Schulz-Poettering package?"
"Yes, Mrs Ludford, we have three things: the amendment by Mr Sonik, the amendment just proposed by Mr Schulz and Amendment No 1 by the UEN Group."
"Mr President, Mr Schulz is right; all our words and all their consequences are of enormous importance."
"One thing is certain; Mr Schulz’s amendment has nothing to do with the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and should be regarded as an entirely separate issue, because the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group contains unacceptable statements that we cannot and do not wish to tolerate."
"We would therefore ask that there be no confusion over this matter."
"This was the first point I wished to make."
"The second point I should like to make is as follows; we acknowledge that the two largest groups in this House – and rightly so – wish to reach a broad consensus on this issue, and this is why we are able to join this consensus."
"We would, however, like to stress that some of the discussions that took place on this resolution during preparations for this session were – and are – unworthy."
"This is a point we must emphasise."
"Mr President, I believe that there is nothing left to add."
"If you would put Mr Sonik’s oral amendment and my own oral amendment to the vote – incidentally, the aim of my oral amendment was to supplement the original text and to ensure that the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group was rejected once and for all – we would have precisely what we want, namely a text that is in keeping with the dignity of this day."
"Mr President, Mr Schulz has said that we must weigh every word today to ensure that it does justice to the victims and to the perpetrators’ responsibility."
"It took a very long time for my country, Austria, to admit its shared responsibility for the crimes of National Socialism."
"‘Hitler’s Nazis’, which was the wording used in the first version of this resolution, makes this shared responsibility clear, as it implies that Germans were not the only ones involved."
"Yet this shared responsibility is blurred again by the wording that has now been proposed."
"I do not wish to drag out the debate on the issue, but I think it important that an Austrian should take the floor of this House today to join other Members in deploring his country’s shared responsibility."
"Mr President, I should like to voice a strong protest against what Mr Cohn-Bendit has just said."
"It seems to me that his statements were based on a misunderstanding, as he said that some of the content of our amendment, tabled by myself personally, was unacceptable."
"I cannot think what he meant, as my amendment concerned one single word."
"I proposed replacing the word ‘Hitler’s’ with the word ‘German’."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has not tabled any other amendments."
"One may or may not be in favour of the amendment, but I wish to protest against deeming it unacceptable, because I do not consider that to be the case."
"I must make it quite clear that my amendment only concerned the inclusion of the word ‘German’."
"The reason for this is that in recent days the people of Poland have been very upset by references to Polish concentration camps and Polish gas chambers in leading European newspapers."
"Such references are quite simply incorrect and deeply offensive to the Polish nation."
"That was the one and only reason for my amendment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have one amendment presented and some oral amendments."
"We are not going to go back to a debate on the main substance of the issue."
"Mr President, I can clear up Mr Cohn-Bendit’s confusion."
"As I understand it, Amendment 1, by the UEN Group, just consists of the words ‘the German’ instead of ‘Hitler’s’."
"Amendment 1/rev. was withdrawn because it was not accepted by the services."
"I think Mr Cohn-Bendit is referring to that – if I may say so, a bunch of men is creating a great deal of confusion here by the failure to attend to detail – Amendment 1/rev. was withdrawn and, therefore, the question of deleting words like ‘homosexuals’ is no longer on our agenda."
"We are dealing with the oral amendment by the PPE-DE Group and then the amendment by the UEN Group – which Mr Schulz seems to be amending again – but not the rest of the revised amendment by the UEN Group, to which I think Mr Cohn-Bendit is referring."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that everyone in this House agrees that all those who took part in this crime – whether they were German, Austrian or of other nationalities – should be condemned, and this is conveyed by the phrase ‘Nazi Germany’."
"The key point is the responsibility of all those involved, and it is to this responsibility that we must draw people’s attention."
"I therefore ask that a vote now be held and that Members consider the matter once again."
"It is not a question of whether it was Germans or non-Germans who were involved; what matters is that we refer to all those associated with the criminal regime of Nazi Germany."
"This is the gist of Mr Schulz’s amendment, to which Mr Poettering has lent his support."
"Mr President, after so much consolidation and solidarity in relation to amendments, I will ask you to accept one very small oral amendment to the last line of recital A, concerning only two words."
"After the reference to victimisation on the basis of race, ethnic origin or religion, it is to insert ‘social classification’. This is because we are insisting that Europe must not forget its own history."
"Millions were deprived of all their rights, including their lives, for social reasons, the final solution with ‘class enemies’."
"‘Social classification’ is a very soft wording and I would ask you to support those two words on the grounds of history."
"Mr President, I only wish to say that Baroness Ludford was right and that her interpretation was correct."
"However, you did not allow me to speak."
"It is obvious that there are some mental reservations and discrimination in this House."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit did not know what he was talking about, as he was referring to an amendment which had not been tabled."
"I would like our group to be respected in the same way as the other groups, otherwise the racists are the people who speak out of turn."
"Mrs Muscardini, at this point we are no longer debating the fundamental ideas."
"We are voting on amendments."
"Let us therefore continue with the procedure."
". The conclusion of this protocol, in keeping with other similar protocols since May 2004, clearly demonstrates the global impact of EU enlargement."
"Nonetheless, these protocols are clearly necessary, because there must be legal uniformity and harmony in the enlarged Union."
"I therefore voted in favour of the recommendation."
". The purpose of this proposal for a recommendation is to conclude a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and between the European Communities and the Republic of Croatia, to take account of the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, and the Slovak Republic to the European Union."
"This is also a consequence of the accession of ten more Member States."
"Indeed, the accession of those countries entails a range of legal adaptations, in order that they can be placed on an equal footing in the areas of customs, the economy and competition."
"I naturally voted in favour."
". The conclusion of this protocol, in keeping with other similar protocols since May 2004, clearly demonstrates the global impact of EU enlargement."
"Nonetheless, these protocols are clearly necessary, because there must be legal uniformity and harmony in the enlarged Union."
"I therefore voted in favour of the recommendation."
". The purpose of this recommendation is to obtain parliamentary consent to conclude a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, and the Slovak Republic to the European Union."
"This is a necessary consequence of the recent enlargement."
"The accession of those countries in fact entails a range of legal adaptations, in order that they can be placed on an equal footing in the areas of customs, the economy and competition."
"I voted in favour."
"The June List is voting against increasing the appropriations with respect to the Council’s original proposal."
"Digital content is most efficiently created and made accessible by the market or through decisions at Member State level."
". The balance struck between the sum initially sought by the Commission and the funds made available by the Council, commensurate with necessary budgetary limitations, is a reasonable one."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Most importantly, however, the eContent programme – in common with other similar initiatives – should be an effective means of enhancing the information- and knowledge-based society."
".– As well as contributing towards the Lisbon Strategy and towards reinforcing Europe’s competitiveness in the knowledge-based economy, the multiannual Community programme to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable, enables us to achieve satisfactory results in terms of economic growth, job creation, innovation and consumer choice."
"This programme is designed for end-users, whether they be ordinary citizens, students, researchers, professionals who want to improve their skills or ‘re-users’ who want to improve or exploit digital-content resources as a profitable activity."
"The purpose of the ongoing Community project, as well as to facilitate user access to information, is to transform the content distribution sector and to reinvent the way in which companies, public bodies and governments interact with each other and with the general public."
"It is therefore important for the development of Europe’s economy that funding earmarked for the programme making digital content more accessible be raised from EUR 135 million to EUR 149 million. If so, the Community action programme will have a much greater chance of being implemented successfully."
"I voted in favour."
"In welcoming the successful Palestinian election, the European Parliament should firstly emphasise the non-development of democratic structures during Arafat’s time in power."
"It would also have been desirable to highlight the absence of demands for democratic reforms from other countries, together with the tacit support for undemocratic development in Palestine permitted during Arafat’s time."
"The presidential election in Palestine was also made more difficult by large groups’ wanting to sabotage the election and, by extension, the democratic process."
"The resolution should also place clear demands on the new leadership to implement democratic reforms and should make clear the Palestinian Authority’s responsibility for preventing terrorist acts."
"At the same time, Israel’s legitimate right to enjoy security and defend its people against terrorist attacks must be recognised."
"It is important here to emphasise the difference between the Palestinian terrorists’ systematic attacks on civilian targets and the Israeli Government’s interventions against terrorists."
"What, finally, are missing are a condemnation of all terrorist acts, including suicide attacks carried out in the Gaza Strip, and an expression by the European Parliament of its deep sympathy for the victims’ families."
"The June List supports the peace process in the Middle East and hopes that the parties can soon agree on the Roadmap for Peace."
"For this to happen, the leaders of both Israel and Palestine must be able to demonstrate statesmanship and political courage."
"The June List believes that it is the United Nations that has the main responsibility for mediating between its Member States and for preventing conflicts or bringing them to an end."
"Throughout history, we have seen how neutral countries have had an important role in this work within the United Nations."
"Even if we essentially support the main thrust of the resolution, we do not believe that the EU’s role within foreign and security policy should be extended."
"We wish to protect Sweden’s freedom of action and the United Nations’ unique position as an international peace organisation."
". I welcome the reasonably fair and free elections of Palestine and commend the satisfactory manner the elections were conducted despite the circumstances due to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories."
"The results of the presidential elections should be seen as an opportunity to re-launch negotiations between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authorities."
"I urge Israel to fully respect the internationally recognised rights of Palestinians and call upon the Council and the Commission to develop another EU observatory mission in Palestine as compliance with the EU-Israeli Association Agreement needs to be enforced, notably Protocol IV of the Agreement."
"Israel’s infractions of the Fourth Geneva Convention continue to be a grave concern of the international community whereby constructive efforts of Quartet members acquiescent with Israel and Palestine is imperative for furthering the development of a final and comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"The settlement is not only crucial for the Territories themselves but also for the promotion of peace and security for the whole of the Middle East and Arab World."
". I voted in favour of this joint resolution essentially because I agree that, as things currently stand in the Middle East, in particular in Palestine, there is a unique opportunity finally to resume the peace process."
"Against this backdrop, the balance-sheet on the Palestinian electoral process is in credit."
"There are some aspects, however, from which I should like to distance myself."
"The international community, and the EU in particular – cannot treat the State of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the so-called ‘armed Palestinian groups’ as though they were equals."
"A democratic state cannot be bracketed in the same category as terrorist groups."
"Such obfuscation is unacceptable."
". The Middle East conflict has been the cause of frequent instability and tension, and the international community has been dragged into repeated attempts to alleviate the political and economic deterioration that the region has undergone for a number of years."
"Abu Mazen’s election as President of the Palestinian Authority has given fresh impetus to the relaunch of the diplomatic process in the region."
"The new Palestinian leader has the opportunity to instigate new political dialogue with Israel, based on criteria of democracy, fairness and mutual respect, in which terrorism is something to be combated and effective and lasting peace is a goal to aim for."
"In this new era that has just begun, it is also important that Israel gives signs of hope, good will and cooperation, and pursues its justified and legitimate struggle against terrorism in compliance with the principles of international law."
"I voted in favour, in the hope that peace, which goes hand in hand with democracy – long established on the Israeli side and just beginning in Palestine – can finally take root in this most troubled region of the world."
"Dare one talk in terms of a thaw?"
"There is certainly a desire to believe that relations between Israelis and Palestinians are becoming warmer."
"The signs are there: to begin with, the success of the Palestinian elections, and then the coming to power of Mahmoud Abbas."
"The man who, in 1993, orchestrated the Oslo Accords has campaigned on the subject of the demilitarisation of the Intifada."
"This amounts to more than just speeches; it is a conviction that has been constantly reaffirmed."
"We have also seen the spectacular actions taken by the Palestinian security forces against the terrorists and those forces’ deployment throughout the Gaza Strip, the Israeli moratorium on targeted executions, the re-establishment of diplomatic relations and, today, the announcement by Ariel Sharon of a meeting in two weeks’ time with Mahmoud Abbas."
"Nor must we forget the support of the United States which, with this second administration of President Bush’s that has resolved to bring the process to a conclusion before 2009, is clearer and easier to interpret."
"A window of opportunity therefore exists in which the European Union is committing itself more firmly than ever, as evidenced by this election observation mission, the largest ever delegated by the EU."
"That is what is pointed out in our resolution, which I have voted in favour of, as, at my request, the unacceptable part of paragraph 12, which condemned the indiscriminate terrorist violence from both sides, has been rejected."
"Mr President, I shall be brief."
"I have abstained from voting on this resolution, obviously not because I do not acknowledge the suffering of the Jewish and other victims of a criminal national-socialist regime, criminal like so many other socialist regimes and dictatorships."
"I did not vote for this resolution because I only feel disdain for people and politicians who use this suffering for their own party-political ends and for the fight against parties that want to continue to uphold European values and the identity of the European peoples."
"I also regret that the present resolution does not breathe a word about today’s anti-Semitic terrorism, about today’s anti-Semitic attacks, about the fact that today in our large cities, for example in Antwerp, Jewish people are being attacked by Arabs and Islamists who are today’s anti-Semites."
"Needless to say, I also regret that the appeal to curb the free expression of opinions was made, because democracy is not possible without it."
"Finally, I notice that Communists who have never distanced themselves from Communist regimes, which committed acts of terror and boasted concentration camps, were allowed to sign this resolution."
"I consider this to be a scandal."
"Mr President, we intended to vote against this resolution if reference to German responsibility was excluded from the document."
"As it happens, this amendment was adopted and we supported the resolution."
"It is, however, very important to emphasise German responsibility for the Holocaust, especially since we have reports such as that in yesterday’s , which mentioned Polish gas chambers and crematoria – gas chambers and crematoria!"
"This is what the press in Britain was writing yesterday."
"We had to insist that Germany be mentioned in the document."
"It has been mentioned, and that is why we have voted for the document; otherwise, we would have voted against it."
". As we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, we remember and condemn the horrific tragedy of the Holocaust."
"We cannot, and must not, forget this tragedy, which is one of the most shameful and painful chapters in our continent’s history."
"Let it serve as a lesson to all of us for the future, so that we can combat the extremes that lead to intolerance, discrimination and racism."
"I support the idea that the 27th should become the day on which, throughout Europe, we remember the Holocaust and pay tribute to its victims."
"I am concerned at the growing signs of anti-Semitism and racism, and at the rise of extremist and xenophobic parties."
"It is up to the EU and the international community as a whole, fully and effectively to promote and protect civil and fundamental rights in the Union and in the world."
"The EU must remain faithful to the values that form part of its shared heritage, must strive to safeguard the principles of tolerance and non-discrimination and must promote social, economic and political integration."
"It is crucial that we resume discussions on the draft framework decision on racism and xenophobia, because we will only be able to combat these phenomena effectively and consistently throughout EU territory if we adopt an integrated approach that involves both preventative and punitive measures."
"This resolution deals with extremely important issues."
"The concentration and extermination camps are among the darkest and most shameful aspects of European history."
"Racism, extremism and historical revisionism must be vigorously condemned and opposed."
"The resolution points out the need for such action in a clear and elucidatory way."
"Conferences and awareness-raising activities are positive measures that can contribute to increased tolerance and a more humane society."
"We are, nonetheless, of the view that it is, in the first place, the task of the UN and the Council of Europe, rather than of the EU, to arrange such events."
"The Council of Europe operates with respect for democracy, human rights and the principles of the rule of law."
"It also has more members than the EU and is, in that sense, more pan-European."
"The content of schools’ teaching programmes is an issue for the Member States’ respective parliaments."
". Racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are being cultivated and used as and when it suits capitalism, which is based on exploitation and suppression."
"For as long as it has existed, Communist ideology has rejected these phenomena, distinguishing solely between the exploiters and the exploited."
"Communists are fighting for the brotherhood of peoples and workers the world over, irrespective of gender, race, colour or creed."
"That is why they are the primary victims of fascism."
"We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece did not vote for the joint motion for a resolution, because it makes no mention of the tens of thousands of Communists and other anti-fascist fighters who were murdered in the Nazi concentration camps."
"That is contempt for history."
"The European Parliament is again failing to take a position on the official revival of fascism in the former Baltic States, where homage is being paid and monuments are being erected to Nazi collaborators."
"Political forces which, being in the governance of the Members States of the EU, cultivate and foment racism, are making a show of condemning it in the resolution."
"All the discussion about anti-Semitism is a bid to conceal the Zionist policy of the Israeli State, which is applying a policy of genocide to the Palestinians, like the genocide experienced by the Jews martyred in the Nazi camps."
"The peoples of Europe must honour the 27 January and 9 May as they deserve, far from the opportunistic distortions of the European Parliament."
". It is incredibly important to always accurately remember the atrocities committed at Auschwitz, liberated 60 years ago today."
"Collectively we must share the guilt across the EU for all of the suffering inflicted on the victims of The Holocaust."
"The European Union as it currently stands is the biggest safeguard we have against a recurrence of such horrors."
"However, we can always work to strengthen our joint provisions to protect human rights and individuals from discrimination."
"By remembering the grim past that the European Union has grown from it can help guide us in the most appropriate direction for the future."
"The real subject of the resolution I have voted in favour of is not only Auschwitz but also Dachau, Mathausen and those 23 concentration camps that give chilling and resounding echo to the nature of mankind, characterised as we are by oceans of darkness, as well as of light."
"Clarity and divinity were, however, what was really needed for a genuine moment of truth to emerge."
"Clarity was needed, without the verbiage that covered three pages’ worth of resolution; clarity, without the mediocrity of dismissing Christendom as just one more belief system; clarity, without the indignity of forensically listing the nationalities of martyrs or, above all, of hunting for a name to describe the executioners – a process that has seen plenary carefully weighing up oral amendments that proposed ‘Nazi’ as a designation, as if the Holocaust could be reduced to a handful of ‘B’ movie villains, with no account taken of the blame attached to the tide of descendants of the Goths, Visigoths and Ostrogoths who, under the name ‘German’, have made others experience the brutality of their thoughts and vices."
"Divinity, that of the breath and of the Spirit, was needed because what was really necessary here, as in the European Constitution, was reference to God, not as an object of belief but as a higher law independent of Man, who clearly has a dual mentality: part reptilian, making a Hitler out of one Austrian; and part divine, making a Mozart out of another."
". Today, we commemorate the atrocities of a large and powerful state that was founded upon the principle of inequality of people, and which therefore thought it was entitled to starve and subsequently slaughter peoples it considered undesirable in its own country and in other countries."
"It is important that this is now widely condemned and that virtually everyone wants to prevent a repeat of it."
"Even the parties represented in this Parliament who can be associated most with the Nazi past have not voted against the resolution but abstained, one of the arguments being that my group is also one of the parties submitting the resolution."
"My group was divided over the text, because it appears that the major role of Communists in the resistance to Nazi barbarism was concealed on purpose, and without amendments, one could be forgiven for thinking that Poland shares the responsibility with Nazi Germany for the destruction of millions of Jews."
"As a descendant of the victims who were killed in Auschwitz, I do not so much consider the precise text as I do the extent of the condemnation."
"Auschwitz should teach us that that humanity can only survive on the basis of human dignity, equality and solidarity."
". Sixty years after the liberation of the Auschwitz camp there is little more to be said, except that we must constantly remember."
"After that, all that remains is silence."
"Each image reminds us of the horror of human complicity, and the eternal risk that this might happen again, because we do not know how far evil can go."
"This is why all mechanisms to promote peace and freedom are so crucial."
"Human beings, after all, are capable of both wonderful deeds and abominable behaviour, as history has shown."
". Today we commemorate one of the most troubling dates in the history of the human race: the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp."
"It was a joyful day for the survivors, the liberators and the entire civilised world; yet it was also a day of profound pain and shock at the stark realisation of the extraordinary scale of the atrocities committed."
"Auschwitz must never be forgotten, and there can be no tolerance for attempts at rewriting our shared history in such a way that the constant, methodical and premeditated massacre of millions of innocent people goes unnoticed or is glossed over."
"I feel that there is still much to investigate with regard to the actual scale of the crimes committed during the Second World War."
"I am also concerned at the fresh outbreak of anti-Semitic attacks and incidents, perpetrated and incited mainly by extreme left-wing organisations and Islamic radicals, as well as the Nazi extreme right."
"I vehemently condemn such acts."
"Europe, which considers itself tolerant, must, in this instance, show character and be resolute in combating this kind of organisation and activity."
"If the Nazi atrocities are to serve some purpose, let it be that, in remembering this darker side of history, we can be morally armed for the struggle to ensure that barbarities such as Auschwitz are never repeated in the biography of the human race."
"There are just a few hundred of them now, in the cold and the snow of Auschwitz: the survivors of the survivors, the last sentinels."
"They are still there, still standing to tell of what was the absolute evil, indeed the quintessence of evil."
"Upon them is the gaze of the world and of the inhabitants of this century, 60 years after the Holocaust."
"My heart and spirit are in Auschwitz today, with them and all the others, those who did not return."
"As this era, that of the last witnesses, draws to an end, it is our absolute duty to consider how this memory is to be passed on without them. We owe them truth."
"To them first of all, but also to our children and to future generations, because those who would insensitively deny the Holocaust or, worse, attempt to trivialise it, have not waited for the survivors to disappear before trying to demean this most singular of memories."
"What we are requesting, and what we are fighting for, is to have the Holocaust taught in our schools, with knowledge serving as a barrier against racism."
"Auschwitz was at the heart of Europe 60 years ago."
"That past must not disappear from sight, ever."
". It is essential that children should understand the appalling and unique nature of the Holocaust, and Holocaust education should certainly be included in school curricula."
"Children also need to understand the consequences of regimes based on totalitarian ideologies – the Nazi responsibility for the Holocaust is clear; the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and China have also committed mass murder on an enormous scale."
"Parliament’s resolution includes the suggestion that ‘European citizenship’ should be a ‘standard element in school curricula throughout the EU’."
"I do not accept that the EU has any competence or responsibility to determine the content of the school curriculum in the United Kingdom and I reject the idea of any programme of education seeking to advance the false concept of ‘European citizenship’."
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, the Prime Minister of Pakistan having visited this House this week, I should like to remind everyone that the parliaments in Pakistan have repeatedly demanded that democracy be implemented, and called on President Musharraf to separate his civilian and military functions."
"He promised not to appear again in public in military uniform as of 1 January 2005, yet nothing has changed and he continues to do so."
"I believe that this House has always supported democracy and opposed dictatorships."
"We should therefore support the parliaments in Pakistan in their calls for more democracy, and, during our contacts with the Pakistani authorities, urge that President Musharraf keep the promises he has made."
"A lot of blood was shed in the battle to achieve the right to freedom of speech, which is sacred to all democrats of Europe."
"This especially applies to those European nations that have only recently fought for and gained their freedom of speech after having been freed from communist dictatorship."
"It was this right that Hungarian revolutionaries sacrificed their blood and their lives for in 1956, and a very valid and extraordinary historical and emotional political cause is needed to infringe this sacred right."
"A worthy cause, not unlike many of the recent proposals advocating a ban on the use of the much-hated Nazi symbol, the swastika, in homage to the victims of Nazi atrocities and guided by responsibility towards future generations."
"Unfortunately, the history of the reunited Europe includes another evil totalitarian dictatorship, red Communism, which, during its short 20th-century reign, was also responsible for the systematic murder of millions of innocent people."
"Therefore, if the Union wishes to propose a ban on the swastika, I suggest adding the symbols of the hated and bloody communist dictatorship as well."
"Such a ban has existed in Hungary for over ten years."
"No more Nazism in Europe, no more communism in Europe!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, communities of nations cannot be built upon lies and a false interpretation of history."
"If we dispense with historical truth, we may well heighten the threat posed to some by the new ideology of death and contempt for the individual."
"Allow me to remind Europe and the world that the Second World War was started by the Germans, who were possessed by hideous convictions on racism and death."
"Six million Poles died in that war."
"On the territories occupied by them, and notably in Poland, the Nazis created numerous death camps where torture and forced labour also took place."
"Auschwitz was the largest of these camps, and it was conceived in order to eliminate the flower of the Polish nation."
"Some four million people of different nationalities, including Jews, Poles, Roma, Russians and others, died in that place of unspeakable suffering."
"Every one of the lives lost there is of equal value."
"It would be unworthy of us to play dirty games on the graves of millions of our innocent brothers and sisters."
"We must not demean ourselves by seeking advantage from their deaths."
"Above all, we are duty bound to remember, honour and pray for the victims murdered by the Nazis."
"Let humble reflection on the tragedy of Auschwitz cleanse the guilty and be a warning to today’s world."
"We must learn from the truth about Auschwitz."
"As long as we continue to allow the innocent to be slaughtered in today’s society, we will have failed to grasp that truth."
"I am referring also to the slaughter of unborn children."
"Every individual’s life is sacred."
"We need to learn from the example of love and reconciliation shown by the holy martyrs of Auschwitz;"
"Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish monk, and Edith Stein, a Jewish nun."
"Saint Maximilian, Saint Edith, Sister Benedicta of the Cross, pray for us."
"Mr President, I am sorry that Mr Borrell is not in the Chair."
"After the Barrot affair, I know there is a great desire to stop discussing any difficulties there may be with this Commission but, given that I got that one right, I would like to think that Mr Borrell will take the letter that I hand-delivered to him a couple of weeks ago rather more seriously."
"There are very grave doubts about the hearing of Commissioner Kallas, who, as you know, is in charge of the anti-fraud drive within the European Union."
"He gave an incorrect date, there was a mistranslation of a question and, in my view, he gave some very misleading information to this Parliament."
"I have written to Mr Kallas asking for some correct answers, and Mr Borrell received a copy of that letter."
"So, through you, I am asking Mr Borrell to ensure that we get some correct answers from Commissioner Kallas, for, if Mr Borrell does not do that, then this Parliament and the whole hearings process will fall further into disrepute."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week proceedings were opened in the German Parliament concerning large-scale infringement of the law, corruption and collaboration with criminal organisations by officials at German consulates, with the consulates in question mostly located in Russia, Ukraine and Albania."
"This is not a new phenomenon, and it does not only concern Germany."
"It is actually a problem for the whole of Europe, because third-country citizens with links to organised crime can obtain travel documents illegally."
"They then pose a threat to the security of the whole European Union, as they can of course move freely over the territory of the whole of the Community."
"To date, attention has focused mainly on the new Member States, which have been criticised for corruption amongst those responsible for internal security and for a lack of transparent procedures."
"Special clauses on protection are in force, and the new Member States are being monitored to ensure they meet their commitments in connection with assessing their readiness to become part of the Schengen area."
"The controls applied to the old Member States regarding their implementation of these commitments are not at all as strict."
"Would this not be an appropriate opportunity to dispel the myth that corruption and irregularities of this kind are particularly rife in the new Member States?"
"In my view, the Commission and the Council should devise an assessment process applicable to all Member States equally."
"Such a process would also cover procedures and practices for issuing visas."
"Mr President, for 16 years now the family of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane has campaigned for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his murder."
"Clear evidence has emerged that the police, the British army and intelligence services all colluded in his murder."
"Former Canadian Supreme Court judge Peter Cory recommended a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Mr Finucane’s murder and identified the basic requirements for a public enquiry."
"One of these was that the tribunal should have full power to subpoena witnesses and documents, together with all the powers usually exercised by a commissioner in a public enquiry."
"However, the British Government has recently published a draft inquiries bill. This bill is a wholesale departure from both Irish and British Government agreements and the Cory recommendations."
"It gives a British Government minister the power to determine whether an inquiry sits in private and what material is withheld."
"These provisions attack the very independence essential to any inquiry."
"The British Government is continuing to hide the truth of Mr Finucane’s murder for its own political reasons."
"The European Parliament must make clear to the British Government that in order to comply with Article 2, any tribunal must as a minimum have the characteristics identified by Judge Cory."
"Today I raise this matter and put the British Government on notice that it cannot hide the truth from the Finucane family or the European Parliament for much longer."
"Mr President, this week has seen a very remarkable occurrence: the European Union, on one issue at least, finds itself in complete agreement with the UK Independence Party."
"How did this come about?"
"Earlier this week, Mr Michael Howard, Leader of the Conservative Party, announced policies supposed to halt the flow of uncontrolled asylum seekers into Britain."
"However, EU officials quickly informed him and the British public that this is an area of policy, like so many others, that is now under the control of the European Union and not the British Government."
"Not that Mr Howard was being honest anyway: Conservative MEPs in this place voted in favour of Turkish entry and are also in favour of Bulgarian and Romanian entry."
"The Tories pretend to be against unlimited immigration at home, but here they support giving the right of entry into Britain to an additional 94 million people."
"The only way for Britain to regain control of its immigration and asylum policy is through the UK Independence Party’s policy of Britain’s unconditional withdrawal from the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to certain statements made by Mr Buttiglione, the Minister for European Affairs in the Italian Government."
"These statements were detrimental to the image of the European Parliament, and were made in January, when Mr Buttiglione gave an address at the University of Lublin during an official visit to Poland."
"The address was subsequently printed in , the leading Polish daily, under the striking title of ‘The humiliation of a Christian’."
"Mr Buttiglione complained that the European Parliament did not endorse his candidature for Commissioner because of his views on homosexuality."
"He failed to mention his opinions on the role of women, single mothers or asylum policy."
"He levelled accusations at us, alleging that a powerful Brussels lobby wishes to impose on all Member States the recognition of same-sex marriages and the active promotion of a homosexual lifestyle by all countries."
"I shall spare you his other accusations and come to my conclusion, which is the following. Mr Buttiglione states that it is essential to reform the European Parliament so as to avoid future injustices of the kind perpetrated against him."
"There is a threatening ring to such a statement on limiting the rights granted to Parliament by the Treaties, made by someone who is a Minister for European Affairs and failed candidate for Commissioner."
"I leave you to make your own ethical and political assessment of the statement, ladies and gentlemen."
"On the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, the world, and notably Europe, chooses to forget Hitler’s words when he told his followers that their first task was to wipe Poland off the face of the earth."
"The aim was to do so by brute force, and they were to be brutal and show no mercy."
"The Nazis sent people to Auschwitz simply because they were Jews, Poles, Roma or Russians."
"The innocent were slaughtered on the streets in the name of a hideous ideology."
"Whole nations were exterminated, and sadly the atrocities continued after the end of fascism."
"People are still being killed every day."
"There are many doctors engaged in ending the lives of thousands of patients, including newborn infants."
"The killing of unborn children is widespread, and some 50 million of them die every year."
"Millions more children are starving to death, and many are the victims of sexual exploitation."
"In the course of adapting itself to the EU, Poland was transformed into a market economy."
"The economy was ruined, which led to unemployment, poverty and the collapse of health care."
"This will result in the gradual extermination of the Polish nation."
"At the same time, history is being falsified in a slanderous manner, and it is being implied that the Polish people took part in the Holocaust."
"Poland survived two totalitarian regimes, and this is why it has taken it upon itself to sound a warning against what the Holy Father has termed the civilisation of death."
"Beware of the cult of money, and of perceiving the market as the only purpose of life, as this is bound to result in the annihilation of Western civilisation."
"Mr President, a major debate on the economic future of the European Union is currently under way."
"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to make a strong protest and appeal to all upright Members of the European Parliament and of national governments in Europe who claim to long for a great and strong European Union based on the principles of honesty, social justice and solidarity."
"Moves towards a 20% cut in the current European budget will inevitably mean that future development of the Union will be at the expense of its smaller and less-developed members."
"The latter actually need considerable investment, particularly for infrastructure, so as to have equal opportunities for development."
"I therefore believe that a policy of this nature runs counter to all the ideals that are supposed to underpin the European Union."
"It creates social inequality and injustice and transfers costs to the poorest countries."
"This is unfair, and I call for a review as a mater of urgency."
"After all, we cannot have more Europe for less money, and richer countries cannot change policies following the admission of poorer ones, when they had previously promised them substantial resources."
"Mr President, euthanasia was first legalised in the Netherlands, and sick newborn babies are being killed there completely irresponsibly."
"The authorities are quite indifferent to this."
"Infanticide takes place at the Academic Hospital in Groningen, and hospital representatives have admitted that euthanasia was practised there on four children in 2003."
"According to the Dutch Ministry of Justice, some 30 children have been killed in this way since 1997."
"The Dutch authorities have failed to react."
"Practising euthanasia on sick newborn babies amounts to murder and is on a par with the actions of the Nazis, who eliminated the sick from society."
"It is an infringement of the most fundamental human right, the right to life."
"Killing sick children by administering a lethal dose of sedatives is an act of unspeakable barbarism."
"Europe has gone as far as protecting even the rights of animals, yet at the same time defenceless newborn children are being killed."
"I move that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should take up the matter, and that Parliament should hold a debate on practising euthanasia on children."
"Mr President, a few days ago in Cyprus a terrible, atrocious crime took place."
"A father, a mother and their 15-year-old daughter were abducted from their home and shot at close range just outside Nicosia in the unoccupied part of Cyprus."
"Five Turkish Cypriots are very strongly suspected of being the assailants in this case."
"The Cypriot police issued warrants for their arrest but unfortunately they have managed to cross into the occupied part of Cyprus."
"In the occupied part of Cyprus, illegal police are holding them and are protecting them against being handed over to the legal Cypriot police."
"I ask you to use your offices, Mr President, to convince the illegal regime in the occupied part of Cyprus, and perhaps also to convince the Turkish Government which is their guardian, to hand them over to the legal police to be tried."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have once again become aware of weeping and wailing in European Commission circles over the alarmingly high cost of translation into national languages within Parliament and other European Union institutions."
"The Commission’s crocodile tears really are ridiculous."
"The cost has indeed exceeded EUR one billion this year, but it must be recognised that this is also a matter of demonstrating an appreciation of the value of linguistic and national diversity."
"It is precisely that diversity, together with the respect for national identity which is largely expressed through the use of the language, that ensure acceptance of the concept of the European Communities by the citizens of the Member States."
"I would suggest that those seeking to save by reducing translation should consider cutting costs elsewhere."
"The best way to do so would be by reducing their own salaries."
"I would like to draw the Parliament’s attention to a rather unsettling development in Romania."
"Lately, Romanian authorities have been disrupting the screening of a film about the Trianon Peace Treaty by police action, as they claim it conflicts with state interest."
"The film merely expresses an opinion and thus does not violate any laws."
"This action of the Romanian authorities is incompatible with European democratic norms, which have been voluntarily accepted by the Romanian State as part of their bid for membership of the Union, and it also violates the norms of universal human rights."
"This is the message I would like to articulate: the Romanian authorities must put a stop to this action."
"Mr President, I would appreciate it if your bench would occasionally look in this direction."
"I had a very important oral amendment to the resolution on Auschwitz."
"Therefore, I wish to put on record now what I was trying to propose."
"On the 60th anniversary of Auschwitz, it is very important that we remember and honour the Jewish victims and the other national victims, like the Poles, Russians etc., who died in Auschwitz."
"However, one group has been completely forgotten – the group that Hitler first attacked and continued to attack to the very end, in every concentration camp and in universities and hospitals throughout the Reich: the disabled."
"In fact – not in Auschwitz but in other concentration camps – the ovens were made originally to eliminate disabled people."
"Disabled people of all nationalities were exterminated for the simple reason that they were disabled."
"Of all the groups, none are currently in threat of their lives simply because they belong to that grouping – except the disabled."
"The disabled remain forgotten."
"In most countries with abortion, and in those countries with euthanasia, people can now be exterminated simply because they are disabled."
"I would like to place on record that on this day we reverently honour the Jewish victims of Auschwitz and the other victims, but it should be put in very bold letters that the disabled were there from beginning to end and were killed for no other reason than that they were not perfect, which is what Hitler’s Reich was looking for."
"Mrs Sinnott, the Presidency would beg your forgiveness because we did not notice that you were asking for the floor for an oral amendment."
"Please understand that there was great confusion in the Chamber at that point and I did not see you."
"Please forgive me."
"Mr President, with a heart and a half I forgive you!"
"I am very short but would appreciate it if you would look over here occasionally!"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 27 January."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is important for the President to make two statements on two events, one that has already taken place and one that has yet to take place, which affect us directly."
"Firstly, as you know, the first of the planned referendums on the ratification of the European Constitution took place yesterday in Spain."
"As you also know, the result of this referendum was 76.7% in favour."
"I would remind you that a month ago this House approved the European Constitution by a majority of 74%; the support of the Spanish people has therefore closely reflected, and in fact exceeded, this Parliament’s support for that draft."
"We could say that the result of the vote in Spain on Sunday is very similar to the vote in Strasbourg when this Parliament debated the resolution relating to it."
"The turnout was slightly less than that for the last European elections in Spain and also very close to the average across all 25 countries of the Union."
"I believe that on the whole we can see the result of the process in Spain as being very similar to the vote of the Members of the European Parliament and, therefore, as President of Parliament and also in my capacity as a Spanish citizen, I am very pleased with the result."
"Immediately after hearing it I congratulated the President of the Spanish Government and all the political groups who had participated in this process."
"The second communication refers to the visit to Brussels of the President of the United States."
"The visit by President Bush this week is being presented as a meeting with the European institutions."
"He is coming to Europe, but he is coming, amongst other things, to meet with the European Union and that means with the Union’s institutions."
"As President of the European Parliament and supported by all of the political groups, we have taken the view that our institution (the European Parliament) could not be absent from these meetings; we believe that the strength of the Union’s institutions and the image of the European Union, in particular with regard to its relations with third countries and more especially with regard to the transatlantic relationship, is linked to the proper functioning of the institutional triangle: Council, Commission and Parliament."
"To this end, I have held talks with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, and I have kept the Conference of Presidents constantly informed about the progress of those talks, and I can tell you that following the exchange of letters that took place last week, and having heard the opinion of the political groups and also speaking by telephone with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, I can tell you that the President of the European Parliament, on behalf of this institution of course, will participate in the meeting which the 25 Heads of State or Government will hold tomorrow with Mr Bush in Brussels."
"It is not a meeting of the European Council in the real sense, but nevertheless, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, and Mr Barroso for agreeing that the Presidency of the European Parliament should be present at this meeting, and I would like to acknowledge and express my gratitude for what they have done to bring this about and thus to strengthen the European Union’s institutional triangle, which I referred to just now."
"I will not, therefore, be able to be here in Strasbourg."
"Do you wish to say anything in this regard, Mr Poettering?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were delighted to hear what Mr Borrell had to say on the American President’s visit to Brussels, and we agree entirely with his comments."
"Our group has always been very much in favour of the President of the European Parliament being present during this visit, whichever institution held the meeting."
"I would call on the European Council and the governments to ensure that a discussion of the kind we have seen over the past few days and weeks is not repeated in future."
"I should like to express my wholehearted thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, for having made it possible to achieve such an outcome, but there should be no more discussions of this kind."
"It should be self-evident that Parliament is involved whenever a president – in this case the American President – visits the European institutions."
"I hope, Mr President, that your visit to Brussels tomorrow will be successful."
"The European Parliament is the epicentre of developments in Europe, and your presence at tomorrow’s meeting is therefore to be welcomed."
"Thank you very much, Mr Poettering. In any event, all’s well that ends well."
"Regardless of the details of the process, tomorrow the three institutions will be present and I would like to make it very clear that the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission have always agreed on the need for that to be the case."
"If there has been any difficulty, in no way has it been caused by them."
"The next item is the order of business."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 17 February pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"No amendments have been proposed to the agenda for Monday or Tuesday."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has proposed including the issue of the situation in Lebanon following the assassination of former Prime Minister, Mr Hariri, in the Council and Commission statements on EU relations with the Mediterranean region."
"Mr President, I am not sure whether I have correctly understood the formal announcement you have just made."
"Our group would agree to the situation in Lebanon being included in Wednesday morning’s debate on the Mediterranean region."
"We would then be able to consider an appropriate way of discussing the issue in greater detail in March, perhaps on the basis of an oral question to the Council and the Commission."
"This would allow us to leave the agenda as it stands, and then to discuss the issue in more detail in March."
"I was somewhat surprised to have been given the floor, but I hope that I have been able to help resolve this minor problem."
"I understand then that the request has been withdrawn."
"If this is how the proposal now stands, we are also fully in agreement with this solution."
"After all, we do not want to interfere in Lebanon’s affairs; our aim is to ensure that the country is able to act entirely independently when taking decisions regarding its future."
"What I am trying to say is that we should leave the agenda as it stands, and set ourselves the task of including a separate item on the issue on the agenda for the March part-session."
"Alright, we will deal with it within the item on the agenda which has already been included on the subject."
"We are not talking about including a new and specific item on the agenda."
"The Socialist Group has also presented a request with a view to reversing the order of the oral questions, on the expiry of the WTO Agreement on textiles and clothing and on action against hunger and poverty."
"It is not a question of withdrawing either of them, but simply of reversing the order of the oral questions."
"Mr President, the proposal is as you have outlined it, and there is no need for any special explanation."
"Since nobody else wants to speak, we shall proceed to the vote."
"The political groups have agreed to establish a margin until 6.00 p.m., so that all the items on Wednesday’s agenda which should involve the Council can be dealt with before that time."
"No amendment to the Thursday sitting has been proposed."
"Mr President, I am not sure whether I have misunderstood something."
"You said that matters requiring the presence of the Council must be completed by 6.00 p.m."
"Does that also apply to Question Time?"
"Question Time with the Council is scheduled for Wednesday, and the Council will naturally need to be present then."
"The Council will be here for Question Time and for all the items for which it is required, and it will therefore also be present for Questions to the Council."
"We have received two requests for urgent procedure: a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 as regards a specific action for transfers of vessels to countries hit by the tsunami in 2004."
"In view of the urgent problems facing the fisheries sectors in the countries affected by the December tsunami, this proposal establishes an essential legislative framework allowing the Member States to authorise the transfer of small vessels to those fishing communities."
"The second request relates to the proposal for a Council regulation imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities in view of the situation in Côte d'Ivoire."
"The urgent procedure is justified since it is very important that this Regulation be approved as quickly as possible in order to prevent the transfer of funds and resources that should be frozen."
"Parliament will give its opinion on these requests for urgent procedure tomorrow, Tuesday, at the beginning of the sitting."
"I am telling you this so that you can come tomorrow duly prepared to make a decision on this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have risen to speak because I am extremely concerned about the state of democracy in the European Union."
"We are being told that it can be considered a great success if a small proportion, or just over one quarter, of the citizens entitled to do so vote ‘yes’ in a referendum, the most important public expression of collective will."
"It is also coming to light that propaganda tricks were used during the campaign, for example that Spanish citizens were told that a vote against the European Constitution would be a vote against Europe, which is a blatant lie."
"We are particularly concerned about public money being spent on the ‘yes’ campaign, and about the plans to spend even more on it."
"This amounts to cheating Europe’s citizens, and we demand equality before the law."
"The Community cereals market is in a critical state."
"At the request of Austria, backed by the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy, Poland, Hungary and France, the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries at its last session expressed its concern over the grave situation facing European cereal farmers."
"The twenty-five Member States produced fifty-two million tons of surplus in cereals this year, more than seven million tons of which were offered for Community interventions."
"Half of this, more than three million tons, was offered by Hungary."
"Three problems have arisen in the Community cereals market."
"First of all, there is the problem regarding the unfavourable changes in the Euro/Dollar exchange rate."
"Secondly, non-coastal countries, such as the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary, are at a disadvantage when it comes to competition for tendering."
"Finally, my third point: the decrease in export aid presents further problems."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Fischer Boel to take effective measures towards solving the problems of the cereals market."
"Mr President, I agree with what has been said and I would like to thank the President of this Parliament for what he has said about the referendum held in my country yesterday."
"It was a lesson in democracy."
"The day passed without incident."
"Everybody in favour of a ‘yes’ vote, everybody in favour of a ‘no’ vote and also everybody in favour of abstaining participated fully."
"Nobody can therefore give our country lessons in democracy, since everybody was free to act with total freedom."
"Furthermore, an important radio station owned by the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Catholic Church campaigned constantly for the ‘no’ camp and the results are there to see, but nobody stopped it from defending that position, which was as legitimate as any other."
"– Mr President, a few days ago, the President of the Greek Parliament, addressing the new President of the Hellenic Republic, told him that, in the light of the referendum – in the light of the endorsement of the Constitution – Greece needed to restrict its national borders and its national sovereignty."
"This is dramatic."
"The Greek people need to be told why, for the prosperity of Europe, they need to be deprived of land and sovereignty."
"That is what was heard."
"A way has to be found of at least allaying the concerns of the Greek people."
"We want Europe to prosper, but not of course at the expense of the national borders of our country, at the expense of national sovereignty."
"We need to ensure that, if the Constitution is passed, Greece will not lose land, as – I repeat – the President of the Greek Parliament said."
"As far as Spain's referendum is concerned, 33% of the Spanish people voted in favour."
"There was a very poor turnout ..."
"Mr President, every professional criminal organisation in Europe must have jumped for joy at the European Central Bank's recent decision to double its printing of 500-euro banknotes."
"This year alone, 190 million more of the highest-value banknotes in the world will hit our streets, and a suitcase full of these is worth seven times as much as a suitcase filled with 100-dollar bills."
"In today's electronic world, banks do not need large denomination notes: they are of value only to criminals."
"Why else did 10% of all the euros issued at its launch suddenly disappear into Russia?"
"Why is it still the currency of choice for the Russian mafia?"
"Why did Hussein invoice Iraq's secret oil sales in euros when he was trying to avoid sanctions?"
"Last year, the number of counterfeit 500-euro notes rose by ..."
"– Mr President, we hope that the unification of Europe, at least as far as its economic and monetary union is concerned, means the lifting of barriers, means the lifting of borders in the economic sector."
"This is the quintessence of the common market and of the single European market."
"Greek euro-scepticism is directed at exactly what the European Union is; a European Union which has not progressed with the same speed as far as its political union is concerned, as far as acquiring a genuine, authentic European defence identity is concerned."
"That is what the President of the Greek Parliament said. She stated the obvious; that the economic borders have been lifted and that there is a single, homogenous economic area."
"Mr President, ever since this Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to endorse the European Constitution a month ago, some of those who were in the minority have sought to disrupt and discredit the position taken by the European Parliament."
"They waved banners in this hall when we took our vote; they tried to disrupt the official launch of the European Parliament's information campaign; they have made the claim that it is somehow illegitimate for this Parliament to present its view and its conclusion to the outside world."
"Even when we have been invited by national parliaments to present our assessment of the Constitution, they have written to them and complained that we have accepted such invitations."
"Today, we hear them claiming that the result of the referendum in Spain was somehow illegitimate."
"Of course it had a low turnout it was not controversial and it had overwhelming and broad support."
"But the bottom line is endorsement by a huge majority, which I am sure will be repeated in other countries."
"Mr President, this House should wholeheartedly welcome the referendum held in Spain and the Spanish public’s clear ‘yes’ to the Constitution."
"I believe we should thank the Spanish Government, and everyone else involved, for having informed and engaged the public, and in particular for having involved civil society in the referendum campaign."
"I myself spent several days in Spain with other Members of this House, and was able to see how openly, democratically and peacefully the referendum passed off, providing a genuine example of European democracy."
"What Mr Pęk has said in this House is utterly absurd, and I am sure that only a small minority of Members share his views."
"At the same time, however, turnout for the referendum demonstrated the need for the public to be provided with even more information."
"Mr President, we should call on the governments and the Commission to pursue, once and for all, a policy of proactive information on what the Constitution contains."
"We have no more time to lose, as the dates for the next referendums have already been set."
"Many thanks."
"In view of the disastrous state of the health service in Poland and the hunger strikes staged by health workers, I should firstly like to ask that health services no longer be viewed in market terms, and that medical services be excluded from the services directive."
"I would also like to put forward a proposal concerning the need for public funding for health services, and in particular for hospitals, as the latter are already in debt to the tune of over PLN 6 billion in Poland."
"Following liberal amendments to the Civil Code, debt collectors have seized PLN 2 billion, with the result that employees have not received their wages."
"The seizure of these meagre wages represents a violation of moral principles and of social justice."
"It is also a violation of many items of legislation, including the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"I should like to ask whether the Commission intends to introduce a regulation making it possible for financial support ..."
"Mr President, recently the impression has been created that certain antagonisms and divisions from the past are being revived, something which we hoped would never be repeated and never burden relations between nations in the united Europe."
"By marking 10 February as a day of remembrance for the tragic events after the Second World War, the Italian Republic is commemorating the suffering of its compatriots, and it has every right to do so."
"Yet here, democratic Italy should not forget the suffering which the Fascist regime inflicted on other nations, including Slovenia."
"I would like to take this opportunity to support the appeal of democratic circles on both sides of the border that we should move beyond this trauma from our semi-distant history, by telling the whole truth."
"The truth, no matter how grievous, is the only way to prevent similar things in the future."
"It is also the only basis for coexistence and reconciliation."
"And if the conciliatory meeting of the presidents of three neighbouring countries can contribute to this, then I also welcome it."
"Moving beyond the revival of nationalist prejudices is to the essence of the European idea."
"It is also one of the foundations and reasons behind European cohesion and integration."
"Mr President, the recent tsunami disaster shocked the world and the huge loss of life it caused is almost inconceivable."
"Such disasters are not specific to South-East Asia."
"The worst European tsunami in recorded history occurred on 1 November 1755, when a powerful earthquake off Portugal's Atlantic coast sent waves crashing into Lisbon."
"Up to 30 000 lives were lost in the capital alone that day and the event signalled the decline of the city, which until then had been the fourth largest city in Europe and one of the richest."
"The waves also hit the coasts of Belgium, Britain, France, Ireland and the Netherlands."
"Twenty Member States of the EU have coastlines."
"Given that earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis have taken place in the past, would it not be prudent for the Commission to set up a benchmarking process to facilitate alert strategies to warn of natural disasters of this kind?"
"–Mr President, Parliament has consistently campaigned against illegal internment in Guantanamo Bay."
"Most of the EU nationals have now been released – certainly all nine British citizens – but around a dozen people who have legal residence in an EU country, for instance as refugees, are still there."
"There are five people from the UK whose names we know: Bisher al-Rawi, Jamil al-Banna, Jamal Abdullah, Shaker Aamer and Omar Deghayes."
"Reports tell of degrading and inhuman treatment, even torture."
"Omar Deghayes claims that he has been blinded in one eye with pepper spray."
"Twenty years ago he came as a refugee from Libya, where his father was killed by the Gaddafi regime."
"Libyan officials have visited him and threatened him with deportation to Libya and death."
"This was obviously done with the collusion of the US Government."
"In fact, it sent a plane to Tripoli to pick them up."
"It must have been done also with the collusion of the UK Government."
"It cannot be allowed to hide behind the Vienna Convention."
"It has a moral and – I contend – legal obligation to intervene and rescue these people or put them on trial."
"Otherwise the pretensions of the EU to have a human rights policy ring hollow."
"Mr President, in September 2004 the Russian Federation set limits on imports of food products from Poland."
"Polish companies exporting meat and dairy products were also obliged to undergo special inspections by Russian veterinary and plant health agencies."
"Out of a total of 74 dairy companies inspected, only two were authorised to export products to Russia."
"In spite of the fact that nearly four months have passed since the inspections were completed, Russia has still not provided Poland with a list of companies that passed the inspections and are permitted to export products."
"This is proof that Polish companies are being discriminated against on the Russian market."
"In January, Poland was assured that the European Commission would intervene to speed up procedures for allowing Polish companies into the Russian market."
"I should like to ask what measures the Commission has taken in this connection, what the outcome of those measures has been and when the discriminatory practices applied by the Russian Federation will cease."
"Mr President, referring to the proposed European Constitution President Bush has said that he is fascinated to see how the sovereignty of nations can be integrated into a larger whole."
"He can afford to be fascinated: it is not his country's freedoms, liberty and democracy that are being dismantled and abolished in that process of integration."
"What he does take seriously, however, is Article 16 of the Constitution that commits Member States to a common foreign and security policy."
"He has rightly warned that this undermines NATO – and it is NATO that has kept the peace in Europe since 1949, not the European Union."
"The British people need to know that the proposed common foreign and security policy will prevent Britain from ever again being able to act independently, militarily or politically, whether in alliance with the USA or not."
"That is one more good reason for the British people to reject the European Constitution when they have the opportunity to do so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of UEFA, the Union of European Football Associations."
"At today’s sitting, I should like to express my wholehearted support for UEFA’s latest project, the aim of which is to ensure that rich and poor clubs in both the old and the new EU, and indeed in all of Europe, enjoy the same opportunities."
"The project involves a progressive introduction of quotas for club-trained players, with a minimum of two players in one year’s time, and eventually of four players."
"This is intended to force clubs to work with young players, and to prevent rich clubs from merely buying up talented players."
"There will also be quotas for players from the country in which the club is based, which are intended to promote national football."
"In practice, these quotas will also deter attempts by the richest clubs to build up football armies of hired ‘galácticos’ or superstars."
"UEFA’s proposals comply with the principle of solidarity, upon which the European Union is founded."
"It is worth sacrificing another of the EU’s principles that is in any case frequently violated, namely the principle of free movement of workers, for the sake of this principle of solidarity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like briefly to insist on something that the President said at the beginning of this sitting."
"As you all know, tomorrow there will be an historic visit by George Bush, the President of the United States of America, to the European Commission, in the Berlaymont building in Brussels."
"We must acknowledge and thank the President of the Commission, Mr Durão Barroso, for the efforts and steps he has taken to ensure that, during this visit, Mr Bush receives the President of this European Parliament, which is you, Mr Borrell."
"We in our group naturally hope that this meeting is a success and also that it serves to improve relations between the European Parliament and the United States of America."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Barroso Commission has been doing its job for months now and has appointed all its staff, including the spokespersons, it really is hard to believe that they have not yet succeeded in finding an Italian spokesperson."
"How can that be?"
"What steps has Mr Barroso taken, even after all the parliamentary questions, the urging by Commissioner Frattini and the request made by the whole body of Italian journalists accredited with the Commission and the other European institutions?"
"Ours is not a religious battle and much less a return to sterile nationalism."
"We are proud of our language: our Dante Alighieri is the envy of all."
"That is precisely why we cannot understand the failure to appoint an Italian-speaking spokesperson."
"Mr President, last week I participated in the 'Berlinale', the 54th Berlin Film Festival."
"Most of our Member States were represented with new productions either in the competition or in other sections of the festival."
"It was amazing to see how many talented film-makers we have in Europe, but it was even more encouraging to see how many people were interested in non-Hollywood films made in Europe or elsewhere in the world."
"European films were more popular with the audience than American ones."
"The whole event showed me that there is a great interest in European cinema, in spite of the fact that our promotion of cinema production is weaker than that of American movies."
"There is a huge need to improve European media and cinema policy."
"The protection of our cinema heritage and the production of new films deserve more support, both financially and in terms of legislation."
"– The lack of rain in recent months in Portugal is causing a major crisis both in terms of autumn-winter crops and livestock feed, and in terms of the low expectations for spring-summer crops."
"At the same time, there have also been cases of what is known as ‘bluetongue’ in animals, and the necessary quarantining, seizures and bans on movement have exacerbated the problems of selling livestock. Producers and farmers have thus been forced to keep animals much longer than planned and to feed them at extra cost, which has led to financial crises that many of them cannot cope with."
"I therefore call on you, Mr President, to notify the Commission of the seriousness of the agriculture situation in Portugal and of the need to bring forward the payment of livestock and crop aid."
"The shortage of pasture due to the drought is also causing problems and it is therefore necessary to authorise grazing on land banned under Community regulations, in order to reduce livestock deaths."
"Mr President, this week sees the third anniversary of Ingrid Betancourt’s abduction by Colombia’s FARC guerrillas."
"It was 23 February 2002 when Ingrid Betancourt, mouthpiece for my Colombian sister party and a presidential candidate, was abducted while she was on the way to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict between the government and FARC."
"The Colombian Government must stop having recourse to military means."
"It must instead sign a humanitarian agreement with FARC in line with the Geneva Convention so that Ingrid and 3 000 other prisoners can be released."
"I should be very grateful if you could act on Parliament’s behalf and convey our concern about the breaches of human rights in Colombia."
"Mr President, I should have liked to have taken advantage of the presence of Commissioner Barroso, who will join us later, to question him about the recent statements to the press by the Commissioner for Regional Policy."
"Mrs Hübner stated, in fact, that, in her view, it was necessary to facilitate relocation within Europe so that European companies might reduce their costs."
"At a time when we are in the middle of debating the EU’s political priorities for 2005, can Mr Barroso tell us whether he supports this approach?"
"According to the latest figures from Eurostat, the highest rates of unemployment in the EU are in the new Member States."
"Seen in this light, of course, the strategy proposed by Mrs Hübner is perfectly understandable."
"What she said illustrates the reality of an enlargement that has taken place without any new budgetary resources."
"What the Commissioner is proposing to us is that we rob Peter to pay Paul."
"Might Mr Barroso be in favour of institutionalising social and fiscal dumping within the EU?"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"In view of the forthcoming anniversary of the end of the Second World War, I should like to alert this House to fresh attempts that have been made to falsify and manipulate history for short-term political goals."
"Evidence of this can be seen in recent statements made by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the infamous Yalta Conference."
"The latter divided the European continent into two spheres of influence, in so doing subjecting many of the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, whose representatives are sitting in this House today, to nearly half a century’s oppression under an inhuman totalitarian system."
"The root cause of this was the German-Soviet Pact of August 1939, and responsibility for starting the Second World War rests not only with Germany, but also with Russia, as the heir to the Soviet Union."
"Yet while Germany has demonstrated its desire to face up to its tragic past, Russia still lacks the courage to do so."
"I hope the European Parliament will support this motion for a resolution, which, , condemns the Yalta Agreement."
"This would be a symbolic gesture of reparation towards the nations from behind the former Iron Curtain."
"Mr President, Spain treated the referendum on the European Constitution with disdain, with the lowest turnout in our history."
"This has been the case partly because there has not been a sufficiently pluralist debate in the media."
"If we want passion, we need controversy."
"And the future does not look promising."
"The government of my country is promoting a law which will allow a friend of the Socialists, Jesús de Polanco, to control half of all radio in Spain."
"Furthermore, this gentleman already has a monopoly of satellite television and now he is seeking a further slice of the analogue advertising cake."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the left, Polanco makes Berlusconi look like a pauper."
"If we do not defend plurality in the media, we will very soon find ourselves in a situation in which the European Union’s information strategy is no longer debated in this Parliament: it will be decided on by four men in an expensive restaurant, with the capacity to impose uniform thinking on 450 million Europeans."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to the case of Mrs Aissata Bint-Karamoko and, above all, request the European Parliament’s support for her."
"Mrs Karamoko applied for refugee status in France three years ago."
"She is now seven months pregnant and suffering from hepatitis, and is at present in hospital here in this very city of Strasbourg."
"Yet the French Government is behaving unacceptably by attempting to return Mrs Karamoko to her country of origin, Mauritania, in so doing violating her fundamental right to obtain treatment within the European Union."
"In the name of respect for human rights and in accordance with our Charter of Fundamental Rights, I should like us to inform the French Government that it must respect human and fundamental rights by allowing Mrs Karamoko to obtain treatment here in France and, above all, to give birth in the best conditions."
"Mr President, I hope that this House has recovered from its infatuation with Ukraine’s ‘Orange Revolution’, and that the time has now come to look facts in the face."
"Yushchenko’s ‘Our Ukraine’ coalition has tabled a vetting bill, one of the provisions of which states that anyone who criticises the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, or the UPA for short, will be prevented from holding a public position."
"The UPA has become a symbol of patriotism, yet during the Second World War it gained notoriety for murdering Poles, Jews and Russians."
"This vetting provision is an attack against national minorities in Ukraine, the majority of whom are Poles."
"These Poles are critical of the UPA because they believe it to be a criminal organisation."
"The proposal is supported, however, by the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists and its paramilitary wing, the UNA, some of the members of which fought as mercenaries in Chechnya."
"The Nationalists have made contact with Germany’s neo-fascist National Democratic Party, invoking their brotherhood in arms during the Second World War."
"National minorities in Ukraine are in danger, they are afraid and they are calling for help."
"Mr President, when this Parliament last met it quite properly condemned the Nazi atrocities epitomised by Auschwitz."
"Sadly and shamefully, the head of state of an EU member country – President McAleese of the Republic of Ireland – chose that 60th anniversary to launch a vicious and vindictive attack on the majority community in Northern Ireland when she shamefully equated Nazi hatred of Jews to the attitude of Protestants towards Roman Catholics."
"Nothing equates to the Nazi holocaust."
"In the name of the peace-loving majority in Northern Ireland, I take this opportunity in this international forum to refute and reject that vile attack upon those I represent."
"References to the struggle against fascism fall particularly ill from the lips of a President, one of whose predecessors expressed condolences upon the death of Hitler."
"Mr President, I was surprised by the comments of Mr Herrero-Tejedor."
"He gives the impression of coming from a completely different country, since he appears to have forgotten that the People’s Party government controlled the whole of the public and private media for eight years."
"The Socialist government is currently trying to re-establish democracy, establishing plurality in the media which was not guaranteed by the last People’s Party government."
"Finally, Mr Herrero-Tejedor, does your comment imply that your colleague, Mr Berlusconi, is controlling the media in Italy?"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Together with several other Members, Mr Cashman advised in a letter to Mr Barroso, and I quote: ‘… that in Slovenia politicians are obviously publicly encouraging discrimination against minorities …’, end of quote, and proposed that the Commission should launch an investigation into this together with the Slovenian Government."
"As a liberal Member from Slovenia I wish to draw the attention of Parliament additionally to the fact that the current Slovenian government has also expressly refused to implement the decision of the Constitutional Court of Slovenia, whereby homes in Slovenia taken illegally from them in 1992 should be returned to 18 305 citizens of the former Yugoslavia."
"This is not therefore simply a case of discrimination against minorities, but also a violation of the fundamental principles of a state ruled by law."
"Mr Herrero-Tejedor has the floor for a point of order."
"For a personal statement, Mr President. A remark has been made about me and I would like to exercise my right to reply, if only for thirty seconds."
"Which Rule of Procedure are you invoking?"
"Rule 27 B."
"Did you say Rule 27 B?"
"Mr President, I appreciate that you should know the Rules of Procedure better than I. Perhaps I have suffered a lapse of memory ..."
"Mr Herrero, Rule 27 B relates to the work of delegations."
"What does that have to do with personal statements?"
"It is clearly not that Rule, Mr President, but ..."
"Which Rule are you invoking?"
"The Rule which establishes the right to respond to personal comments, Mr President, whichever Rule that is."
"I have that right and I expect you to ensure that I can exercise it, Mr President."
"I simply asked you which Rule you are invoking and you mentioned a Rule that has nothing to do with the issue we are talking about."
"Mr Herrero-Tejedor, I am not responsible for your words, you are."
"I imagine you are referring to Rule 145."
"Is that the case, Mr Tejedor?"
"It is Rule 145, Mr Borrell Fontell."
"You have thirty seconds."
"I simply wished to say to Mr Medina that, in fact, Mr Berlusconi has a control over the media in Italy which my party and myself in particular have severely criticised."
"And I would therefore ask that the same yardstick be used in relation to Spain."
"With regard to the point about the People’s Party controlling the whole of the private media, does that mean that it also controlled all of Mr Polanco’s media, Mr Medina?"
"Are you trying to make fools of the honourable Members?"
"Goodness gracious me!"
"Mr Herrero-Tejedor, I have given you the floor in order to avoid pointless arguments, but I must tell you that Rule 145 relates to accusations made against a Member on a personal level."
"That was not the case in any way, but despite that, the Presidency has given you the floor in order not to give you the impression that our interpretation of the Rules of Procedure is biased."
"Mr President, I do not have the rule book in front of me but I simply want to add a clarification to the statement on Northern Ireland made by Mr Allister who criticised President McAleese of the Irish Republic for remarks she made concerning the Protestant community in Northern Ireland."
"I want to point out that President McAleese apologised fulsomely and without reservation within hours of making the remarks."
"She had not intended the interpretation which has been made and I would appreciate it if this could be noted in the record of the House."
"Alright, Mr de Rossa, that is what we will do."
"However, in the future, all the honourable Members should generally have sufficient knowledge of the Rules of Procedure to be aware that the Rule in question allows Members to speak in response to personal accusations, not to references to a Member within the context of a debate on issues relating to third parties."
"Please take note of the fact that the Presidency will not give the floor in future unless a Member has been affected by an issue that relates to them personally."
"The next item is the debate on the Commission’s legislative and work programme (2005), a debate which began in Brussels on 26 January 2005."
"Mr Barroso has the floor."
". Mr President, eminent Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, before I address you on the Commission’s legislative and work programme for 2005, I should like briefly to express my satisfaction with the results of yesterday’s referendum on the European Constitution in Spain and I shall try to do this in Spanish."
"The Spanish people have said yes to the European Constitution, a clear and resounding yes."
"I would like to express to you the European Commission’s satisfaction with this result."
"Spain has said yes to a Europe united in its diversity."
"I would like to thank everybody who has participated in the referendum process with such commitment, in particular all the Members of this Parliament who have contributed with their voices and opinions to achieving this significant result."
"In this regard, I called the President of the Spanish Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, yesterday to congratulate him and thank him for the great commitment demonstrated by his government during the referendum campaign."
"This ‘yes’, expressed clearly and unreservedly, opens the way for the other European citizens who will also be called upon to express their opinions on the European Constitution over the coming months."
"This has been a very important step in the process of ratifying the European Constitution, which the Commission believes to be the only instrument which will allow us Europeans to consolidate our ideas of peace, prosperity, solidarity and security in Europe."
"Mr President, one month ago I presented the Commission's proposed strategic objectives, designed to guide European action until the end of the decade."
"This is a political roadmap based on three pillars: prosperity, solidarity and security."
"Being mutually reinforcing, they address the concrete and challenging concerns of European citizens."
"I also presented the first delivery of the strategic objectives: the legislative work programme for this year."
"Let me remind you of some of its most important elements."
"First of all, the programme is more focused in political terms."
"The proposed initiatives are structured around the three strategic objectives and their external dimension, and represent a first concrete translation of the balanced approach pursued by the Commission."
"This applies to new initiatives as well as areas where we propose to reinforce an existing action."
"Second, the Commission is fully committed to delivering its work programme."
"For this purpose, the Commission intends to adopt a list of just over 100 priority initiatives by the end of the year."
"Finally, we do not only want to deliver on time – we also want to deliver in a better way."
"We want to be serious about the principles of better regulation."
"This means ensuring quality of legislation; respect for the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and added value; and widespread use of impact assessments."
"In addition to this work programme, I announced that the Commission will regularly inform the Parliament about its planning agenda for legislative proposals in preparation."
"I am happy to be able to say that this information channel is now operational."
"In the meantime, the Commission has gone further in implementing its proposals."
"On 2 February, I presented to you our proposals for a mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"By focusing on growth and jobs, it aims to create the conditions for proper living standards, social justice for all and environmental sustainability."
"On 6 January and 2 February we had an initial exchange of views."
"I was pleased to hear that, broadly speaking, the Commission's proposals met many of the expectations and concerns of Members of this House."
"I welcome the detailed motions for resolutions tabled today by the political groups on the work programme."
"When we talk about partnership, dialogue and consultation, we know that we will not always agree on everything."
"As in any partnership, the important thing is to have positions on the table clearly spelt out, and to work together to achieve common objectives."
"I would like to comment briefly on some of the important issues raised in the comments and motions for resolutions."
"First, actions count more than words."
"The European Union has a responsibility to turn its aspirations into reality."
"It must promote prosperity, cohesion and social justice, both at home and beyond our borders."
"The Commission is fully committed to this task."
"We have already started to work towards this goal by implementing our work programme for 2005: we are on track."
"Second, competitiveness and social cohesion need to go hand in hand."
"We all know that striking a balance is difficult."
"I want the Commission to be helpful in this regard."
"This requires listening carefully to your opinions and contributions."
"Take the REACH initiative, for example."
"Let me assure you that we have taken due note of the concerns expressed."
"We all agree on the need to protect the safety of individuals and the environment properly."
"On the other hand, we should also address the fear that certain elements of the proposal would put a key European industry in serious difficulty without adding real value in the fields of health and the environment."
"Throughout the legislative process, we will continue to look into further possibilities to refine and improve the balance between regulation and competitiveness."
"With regard to the draft services directive, here too we are pursuing an aim which commands general support – the completion of the single market for services by 2010."
"Again I can assure you that we have taken due note of the concerns expressed."
"I am fully convinced that, via the legislative process, we will be able to settle upon an instrument which will tap the single market's hidden potential without jeopardising legitimate public interest objectives."
"Let us do this on an informed basis and dispel the myths."
"Our proposals do not call into question the responsibility of Member States when it comes to organising and financing key public services as required by their societal needs, nor do they undermine the rules on the posting of workers as laid down in the directive."
"Finally, I shall mention the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Commission is committed to helping improve the pact and ensuring it fully complies with the Treaty."
"The improvements proposed by the Commission aim to increase its economic rationale and refine its implementation."
"We want better incentives to foster 'good policies' in 'good times'."
"We want a better definition of the medium-term objectives of fiscal policy by taking into account elements such as the debt level and the up-front costs of structural reforms."
"We want to avoid undesirable fiscal restraint in a downturn, because, ultimately, we want our budgets to be in a position to enhance prosperity by focusing expenditure on growth-oriented sectors and by investing for the future."
"These are not academic issues – this is about quality of life, people's opportunities to earn a living and reap the benefits of their savings and pensions."
"This is about the chances of current and future generations to lead as full a life as they can legitimately expect to."
"As part of this balanced approach, the Commission has made progress via its recently adopted proposal on the revised social agenda for the period up to 2010."
"This shows the Commission's full commitment to modernising and developing European social systems, to tackling social exclusion and poverty, and to attaining the target of more and better jobs."
"When liberalising markets, individuals must not be forgotten."
"That is why last week we adopted two new proposals to strengthen passengers' rights."
"This brings me to a key issue: the European Union needs to be given sufficient financial means to act."
"Cohesion policy is and must remain central to the purpose of the Union."
"Without solidarity, we can never be united."
"It is an essential complement to competitiveness and the Lisbon Strategy – raising prosperity levels in the less-developed regions of the Union benefits the Union as a whole."
"We should also bear in mind that there are now 25 Member States."
"The new Member States are waiting for tangible proof of our solidarity."
"This is why our proposals for a new generation of cohesion policies for the next Financial Perspective are of critical importance for the Union, both economically and politically."
"We cannot afford to see our obligations in this area watered down."
"In addition, the Commission is currently preparing its third package of proposals for the next Financial Perspective, which are based on a careful examination of their European added value with respect to providing citizens with opportunities that complement national approaches or fill existing gaps."
"This set of instruments will include proposals on the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development; consumer protection and public health; energy – including renewable energy sources; competitiveness and innovation in respect of freedom, security and justice."
"The Commission is doing its work, but making these proposals a reality will very much depend on the terms of the agreement on the Financial Perspectives expected by June."
"As I said before, I do not see how the Commission can contribute to a Europe which aims to do more, but with less resources."
"Honourable Members, sustainable development and the issue of climate change are both firmly rooted in the Commission’s agenda."
"Although we are delighted that the Kyoto Protocol has come into force, we cannot however stop there."
"On 9 February, we adopted a communication on sustainable development and another entitled ‘Winning the battle against global climate change’."
"These proposals supplement those relating to the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy."
"Alongside the economic pillar, the sustainable development strategy and the new social agenda constitute two other supplementary pillars upon which our strategy for the next five years will be based."
"Naturally, we must also look beyond our borders."
"We shall be able this year to take stock of the progress made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"The situation is clearly disappointing."
"The European Union can and must make a larger contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"Next month, we shall publish our contribution to the current review exercise."
"We must be more dynamic and more imaginative in giving concrete expression to our Monterrey Commitments."
"In doing so, our main priority will be Africa, and we intend to propose specific new initiatives for Africa."
"Multilateralism and the reinforced Neighbourhood Policy are also priorities for the Commission."
"Renewed involvement in the peace process in the Middle East and revitalising transatlantic relations are also key objectives."
"When we meet President Bush tomorrow, we shall share with him our wish for effective multilateralism and our commitment to work for peace and provide humanitarian aid wherever required."
"We all share the belief that it is our action for the benefit of Europeans that is the source of legitimacy for our daily work."
"Increasing public involvement is a priority for the Commission and, in order to fulfil this duty, we shall propose a specific programme within the framework of the Financial Perspective."
"By providing people with simple and transparent information on the subject, they will be in a better position to understand what is at stake in Europe and to form opinions."
"All the Commissioners – including, principally, Vice-President Wallström, whose particular area this is – have undertaken to exert themselves in this area."
"Allow me, in conclusion, to explain how the Commission, of which I have the honour of being President, intends to meet these shared challenges and address these shared concerns."
"The method we will use will be partnership, particularly between the European institutions."
"I should like to repeat what I have already said on many occasions before this House, namely that I intend to develop a constructive rapport between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"I was delighted to see, during the debate of 26 January, that President Juncker and many Members of this House agree on the importance of working together on the strategic objectives proposed by the Commission."
"This would be an unprecedented step towards greater coherence in the action taken by the EU."
"Finally, the Commission wants to work very closely with Parliament in the spirit of the proposed partnership."
"Vice-President Wallström will be present tomorrow at the Conference of Committee Chairmen, and this within the framework of what the Commission wishes to be a permanent and regular dialogue concerning the issues that have priority for us, from the points of view both of programming and of establishing political priorities."
"To summarise, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want the Work Programme for 2005 to be the first achievement of the partnership I am proposing to you for the renewal of Europe."
"I shall be happy to hear now your comments and suggestions regarding its content."
"Mr President, we are very happy that President Barroso has been able to join us and that we are able to examine with him this 2005 programme, the presentation of which has been delayed, albeit for reasons of which we are aware."
"Mr Barroso, we know that you will do everything to bring about even greater effectiveness."
"Your programme is ambitious, and we have every confidence in you – confidence that we should very much like to re-affirm, as you have been an attentive listener, specifically to ourselves."
"Indeed, you took the initiative to review the Directive on Services in order to take account of our concerns."
"The same applies to REACH, as you have just explained to us."
"We must therefore concentrate on the key issues, namely growth and employment."
"Fewer laws and better lawmaking will be the main thrust of our work."
"I know that we are on the same wavelength as you on this subject."
"You also spoke to us about actions to be taken."
"Productivity in Europe is increasing half as fast as in the United States, where the average growth in investment is 5.4% per year, compared with 1.7% for European investments."
"What our fellow citizens are waiting for are, in fact, practical changes that can be described in simple terms: seeing purchasing power increase and no longer needing to fear unemployment or relocation."
"It is therefore with impatience that we await your framework programme for competitiveness and innovation, including precise objectives and pre-arranged meetings."
"Increasing growth and employment means relying upon innovation and research and, above all, reconciling environmental and industrial policies."
"These two policies are not contradictory, in fact quite the opposite is true; they are complementary."
"Environmental considerations are not constraints or obstacles. They are assets and present an opportunity for our economy."
"Europe must therefore opt for eco-innovation and cutting-edge technologies in order to meet a demand for high added value products that our competitors cannot satisfy."
"Thanks to its high environmental standards, the European Union stimulates innovation and increases the competitive ability of European industry."
"I have in mind the development of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, of biofuels and of clean forms of transport – all sectors that offer our industries a real opportunity in terms of employment and exports."
"We note your proposals in this area with interest, particularly the regulation on the measures to be taken to combat forms of air pollution."
"Viable economic development and renewed growth depend above all upon both the health of our companies and the health of the men and women who make our economy work."
"We value that part of your programme concerning health and consumer policy."
"Europe must also anticipate the possible threats from major scourges and combat the new epidemics and resistance to antibiotics."
"It is therefore with great interest that we await the proposal for a directive aimed at putting Community measures in place to combat avian influenza."
"We shall have to act quickly and effectively."
"Regarding demographic development in Europe, the Green Paper must quickly be followed up by practical measures involving, for example, lifelong learning, health systems that can be relied upon over time and research into neurodegenerative diseases."
"As far as solidarity policy is concerned, it is only right that the new Member States should benefit from these programmes, but do not forget that the funds in question also convey the image of the European Union across all the Member States."
"It is therefore vital for all the countries to have access to these forms of structural aid."
"We also call for greater efficiency in the way in which Member States follow up each other’s judicial decisions, although, on this subject, we were still awaiting the results of the codecision provided for by the Constitution."
"We know that all this should help improve Europeans’ mobility."
"In particular, we must also improve young people’s mobility by facilitating university exchanges and having people benefit from the terrific experience constituted by career routes to the professions."
"We are ambitious, and so are you."
"We wish to develop and improve working conditions with a view to putting practical measures in place and improving work-life balance."
"That is how we shall be able to fulfil the objective that the EU must pursue, so enhancing the whole of European society."
"The European Commission must be visionary in its initiating role."
"In the field of policy, we would emphasise Euro-Mediterranean relations."
"Euro-Mediterranean policy must be much stronger and be accorded priority."
"In the same way, we must turn our attention to our European borders."
"In conclusion, I should like to say to you that political will must be reflected in a Financial Perspective that is evaluated for what it really is."
"The Member States cannot ask more of Europe while giving less."
"What, therefore, we now need is political energy for kick-starting the engine that drives our efforts – efforts that are the basis of our work."
"You have that energy."
"We shall be at your side in that spirit of constructive rapport you mentioned."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the speech we have just heard was not a speech from the European People’s Party, but from the French Gaullists."
"Mrs Grossetête, given the substance of your speech, I cordially invite you to join us, and we shall quickly secure majorities for socially responsible policies in the European Union."
"I saw the profound shock in the eyes of my fellow Member, Mr Poettering, and it was a real treat to observe his reaction."
"President Barroso, I am delighted that you have managed to be with us in spite of the present demands on your time."
"I want to make that very clear."
"We are all aware of the problems you experienced in London with your flight."
"Your presence here augurs well for cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Let me emphasise that."
"But enough of these pleasantries, for I also have one or two remarks to make that I believe you will be less happy to hear."
"I do not wish to return to the issue of whether it was right or wrong for you to appear in an advert for the PSD in Portugal."
"That is in the past now."
"I would like to make a serious proposal, however, with regard to the negotiations on the framework agreement."
"We must make a decision."
"There is a provision in the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission which clearly states that Commissioners are not forbidden to engage in political activities in their home countries, provided they discuss the activity beforehand with the President of the Commission, who either gives his consent to whatever is necessary for the performance of the activity or expresses his misgivings."
"There is no rule, however, for the President, although his conduct should, of course, be exemplary."
"I personally have no problem whatsoever with the principle that the Commissioners, or you as President of the Commission, have a set of political views and can air those views in public."
"I am well aware of where your political affiliation lies."
"It goes without saying that you are not required to go around hypocritically pretending that your election to the presidency of the Commission has made you politically neutral."
"I believe it is only right that you should continue to uphold your views, but the same rule must apply to the President and the Commissioners alike, whether it authorises or forbids all of you to engage in national politics."
"Saying ‘yes’ to some and ‘no’ to others is unacceptable."
"This is why I suggest that we clarify this matter in the framework agreement."
"A second remark, Mr President; in our most recent discussion of your work programme, I said on behalf of our group that we saw the glass as half full."
"I said this because we had seen encouraging signs that you were heeding the appeals which we Socialists had been making to you and your Commission."
"Then, a few days later, I found an interview with you in the in which you took a completely different line from the one you had presented when you addressed this Parliament. ‘Economy is in the front seat’, you were now saying."
"No! Social coherence is in the front seat – at least for us Socialists, Mr President – and we shall not release you from your obligations on this score."
"You presented a work programme with Socialist elements but then gave an interview in the which went in the very opposite direction."
"Later, Mr Špidla presented a paper to which we Socialists can heartily subscribe, but this was followed by comments in the press by Mrs Hübner which we find absolutely impossible to accept."
"You made it to the Berlaymont building, Mr President, but I have the impression that, whenever you arrive at the Schuman roundabout, you are no longer sure which exit to take."
"For this reason, let me suggest that you follow our Socialist proposals, because the problem with the European Union is this: if we do not make it clear to the public that this Union of ours offers them social security, and allow them to carrying on thinking that Brussels is out to destroy their social security, the risks we incur will outweigh the opportunities we create."
"Until we stop conveying that impression, citizens will continue to turn their backs on Europe."
"This has to do with the fact that the neo-liberal approach is presented – perhaps not by you, Mr Barroso, but by many of your Commissioners and, what is far worse, by a great many of your officials within the Commission as a fact of everyday life; all will be well with Europe, so the theory goes, when it is deregulated, made more flexible, and locked into a downward social spiral."
"As long as this is the main thrust of your Commission’s policies, the climate will never change in favour of the EU."
"We Socialists have not been elected to support the sort of neo-liberal policies that are enshrined in the Bolkestein directive, but to guarantee both sides of the coin on which our discussions have long been focused."
"On the one hand, we need competition and flexibility, but this increase in competition and flexibility must serve to promote the achievement of the other goal, namely social stability."
"For this reason, I ask you to stand by what you said in your strategic guidelines and what you presented to us, together with Mrs Wallström and Mr Verheugen, in the Lisbon strategy, which formulates these very principles: greater flexibility and more competition, certainly, but also an enduring commitment to the social structures that are Europe’s greatest achievement."
"If you read our resolution, you will see that we are willing to engage in constructive cooperation with you, but only if you, along with your Commission, are willing to build a social Europe."
"Then we shall gladly give you our backing."
". Mr President, it is bizarre that socialists believe that there can be social progress without economic growth and structural reform."
"It is also incredibly naive of Martin Schulz to criticise the President of the Commission for playing a part in domestic politics: we are not served by the – political people divorced from their political roots."
"My only criticism of the article that I saw in the was President Barroso's swipe at 'naive federalists'."
"I have no idea what he had in mind there."
"My group welcomes the sharper focus of the work programme and its grounding within a clear political strategy."
"However, I am also struck by the great size of the programme."
"Clearly, a greater sense of priorities will be required."
"For my own group, our priority is to complete the single market, especially in the area of financial services."
"This will require a review and, perhaps, stronger scrutiny of the legacy of the Prodi Commission than the programme has presently enjoyed, certainly with respect to software patenting, but also access to port services."
"We place great emphasis not only upon the improvement of the quality of drafting, but also upon reducing somewhat the quantity."
"I finish with a plea for a focus upon a programme that has begun but is far from finished, especially as regards the financial and trade regulations concerning Northern Cyprus."
"We have to bring the Turkish Cypriots in from the cold."
". Madam President, President Barroso has just proposed complicity in a good cause between the Commission and Parliament."
"On behalf of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to refer to two possible areas of complicity in the light of current events."
"You mentioned the most relevant event yourself, Mr Barroso, namely the forthcoming talks in Brussels with the President of the United States."
"I believe that, following Condoleezza Rice’s charm offensive in Europe, it must and it will emerge in the coming days and weeks – and the Iran issue will be the acid test – whether we have only one common goal and continue to go our own separate ways, or whether we manage to develop multilateral measures and avert the danger of unilateralism, which we saw during the preventive war against Iraq."
"On behalf of my group, may I warmly encourage you and strongly urge the Commission to make every effort in the forthcoming talks to persuade the US Administration to lend its active support to the negotiating strategy of the three EU representatives."
"Let me reiterate the common aims of both the American and the European negotiators and the EU Member States."
"Our aim is complete consensus."
"We must prevent the further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the wider Middle East."
"We must press on with the development of a political strategy for the wider Middle East on the basis of the European security strategy."
"We must succeed in enshrining a binding commitment by Iran to refrain from military use of the potential created by its nuclear programme, and we need unlimited access for the International Atomic Energy Agency to enable it to inspect all of Iran’s nuclear facilities."
"These are the prerequisites for the creation of a ring of security around every country in the region, including Israel."
"I am convinced that the European negotiations are the right way forward and are far more likely to succeed if we can persuade President Bush not merely to wait in the wings, not to engage in verbal sabre-rattling and not to keep open the option of a preventive attack, but to put on the agenda an active review of the current economic sanctions against Iran, as well as discussing security guarantees for Iran."
"I believe we shall advance in this area if we also remain true to our principle of safeguarding human rights."
"I appeal specifically to the Commission not to shelve the dialogue on human rights for the duration of the negotiations, but to intensify it."
"I very much regret having to say this, but I have learned that the German Government, the selfsame Government which is actively supporting our negotiations on the EU side, has instituted deportation proceedings against a 26-year-old woman who obtained a divorce from her Iranian husband and converted to Christianity."
"Deportation to Iran in these circumstances – and we have opposed it in two previous resolutions – exposes a woman to the danger of stoning, persecution or even death."
"I believe that such a bipolar policy makes it difficult, but we must manage to rally a majority in Europe behind a coherent human rights policy."
"That will establish our credibility on the Iran issue."
"I have no wish to see Iran succeed in playing off the Europeans against the Americans, because we both have the same objectives."
"I must re-emphasise that point."
"Let me also refer at this juncture to another issue where my group is in agreement with the President of the United States, namely the continuation of the embargo against China."
"If we say that the criterion of respect for human rights is fundamental to our European foreign policy, we must acknowledge that the human rights situation in China remains appalling, and it was for this reason that the House adopted a resolution only a few weeks ago in which it rejected the initiative launched by President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder."
"We expect this embargo to be maintained and reaffirm that economic interests must not take precedence over human rights."
". Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, even though the subject of this debate is the Commission’s legislative and work programme for 2005, it must, of course, be seen in the wider strategic framework, which is strongly influenced by the Lisbon strategy and, regrettably, is designed primarily to intensify competition."
"To make matters worse, I believe it is also using the wrong means to pursue that goal."
"The operating profits of the large conglomerates in the European Union increased by 78% in 2004."
"The ratio of profits to GDP is at what is nearly its highest level in the last 25 years."
"Over the past 12 months, another substantial surplus has been registered in the balance of trade and the balance of payments."
"Even in the Federal Republic of Germany, where the large companies are constantly bleating about being shackled by an uncompetitive location, 46 of the 50 companies listed in the Dax index clocked up staggering increases in their profits over the first three quarters."
"At the same time, unemployment is rising."
"There are more and more debates on the introduction of longer working hours in various different forms."
"Employees are expected to practise wage restraint, which effectively amounts to a drop in real incomes."
"Welfare benefits are being cut or recipients’ contributions drastically increased, and schemes based on solidarity are increasingly being shunted towards dependence on private funding."
"These actions are weakening demand instead of strengthening it."
"We regard this as a pernicious trend."
"Of course we need competition, but it must be compatible with the Gothenburg criteria, so as to minimise unemployment, maximise consumer protection and guarantee social security within a healthy environment, and so as to achieve social cohesion through solidarity and sustainable development."
"Accordingly, we must make the following pleas to the Commission: abandon your neo-liberal economic policies and scrap your directives on service provision in the single market as well as the Working Time Directive and present replacements in the form of directives on improved health and safety at work or on the harmonisation of welfare standards."
"Protect small and medium-sized enterprises by using the directives adopted by the last Parliament, such as the directive on software patents, as the basis for a new proposal."
"Together with the Council, amend the Stability Pact to make expenditure on education and training count as investment, thereby eliminating it from the calculation of the debt ratio."
"Strive for democratic and socially just world trade by trying to reform the WTO, and do not go to Hong Kong with the same ideas that the old Commission took to Cancún."
"Do not argue for more effective military options, but only for peaceful solutions."
"Campaign for better protection of the environment, and remember that there is certainly still work to be done here in the European Union in fields such as biodiversity, the avoidance and recycling of waste and the sustainable use of resources."
"Exert more influence in the struggle to protect the global climate, because not only the United States but also China, India and Brazil must be motivated to commit themselves more firmly to this effort."
"This would be the right course for the European Union; it would promote sustainable development and create jobs."
"It is wrong to perpetuate and even intensify the pursuit of the old roads to nowhere that have long been discredited."
". Madam President, I should like to bid Mr Barroso good evening, but oh dear, oh dear!"
"Here we go again!"
"This legislative programme has been shaped largely by the annual policy strategy, which was published by the last Commission in February 2004."
"The European Commission is the unelected government of the EU, but what other government anywhere in the world would have its legislative programme set out by its predecessor?"
"The UK Independence Party has complained before that the Commission is unaccountable, but this demonstrates just how undemocratic things are."
"We will be lumbered with policies framed by people who are not even in office any more!"
"On 26 January Mr Barroso spoke to Parliament in Brussels about this programme, but Mr Prodi and his team put it together."
"The new Commission's central policy objective is economic growth."
"This was also the central objective of the old Commission's document, drawn up last February."
"Indeed, Mr Prodi made it one of his key objectives when he first came to office in 1999."
"A fat lot of good it did, as EU growth is lower now than it was then."
"Fortunately for Mr Prodi, he is safely back in Rome and is no longer answerable for his failures."
"The document states that, due to the institutional changeover in 2004, a lighter procedure than usual was adopted for the European Parliament to consider the policy strategy."
"That procedure was concluded last April – in other words, even before the election of the present European Parliament."
"We all know this is a phoney parliament, but this demonstrates just how pointless it is."
"Europhiles have been complaining that the British people will not be properly informed about the EU Constitution."
"The Spaniards have just voted on the Constitution, but the fact is that 90% of Spaniards – whom the Europhiles think were well informed about the Constitution – told Spain's state polling organisation that they had little or no knowledge of it, and less than half of them bothered to vote."
"What the citizens of Europe should be informed about is not the impenetrable Constitution, but the mountain of EU legislation which will pass through the EU's institutions this year – legislation dreamt up by a defunct Commission and approved by an expired Parliament, both of whom are no longer accountable to the people this programme will affect."
"However, the citizens of Europe – especially those in Britain – are waking up to what is going on."
"Soon, not only will the last Commission and the last Parliament be defunct and expired, but so will the whole EU project – and the sooner the better!"
"Madam President, the key challenge facing the European Union at this time is an economic one. The European Parliament, the European Commission and the EU governments are going to have to work together closely if the objectives of the Lisbon strategy are to be met."
"This will not be an easy task – we must not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead of us."
"One of the issues that must be looked at most carefully relates to the regulatory framework in Europe – we need less regulation in Europe, not more."
"This was outlined very clearly in a report in today's on a study by the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, which stated clearly that most people involved in banking and financial services believe that we have far too much regulation and that we need to tackle it so that business can become more competitive."
"The key priorities for the European Union at this time include: the completion of the Financial Services Action Plan so as to guarantee a greater level of competition amongst the financial institutions operating within the 25 Member States of the EU, which includes ensuring that retail banking services are available to all EU citizens in the 25 Member States; facilitating the merging of European banks and the updating of asset management legislation so as to guarantee that fund managers can operate asset funds on a cross-border basis; the introduction of new legislation to reduce the costs of clearing and settling trading security transactions; and the introduction of greater competition in the insurance sector."
"The European Union must promote a greater level of dialogue with America to streamline the rules governing the operating of the accountancy industry."
"The European Union operates under a system known as IAS, which is the International Accountancy Standards system."
"Meanwhile, the American business community operates under the GAAP accountancy structure."
"This year, 8 000 companies will be listed on European stock exchanges, operating under the IAS system."
"It is simply wrong that America and Europe operate under two different accountancy models."
"A greater level of dialogue will have to take place to hammer out these issues."
"The European Union must implement the new Services Directive."
"It must guarantee that the benefits of all technologies are available to communities in Europe, both urban and rural."
"Mr Barroso, your recent statements on the Lisbon strategy and the economic way forward for Europe have been very positive, and I wish you well."
"I hope that you are successful – Europe needs you to be successful."
"Mr President, this programme offers real hope for the revitalisation and refocusing of the Lisbon Agenda."
"However, as we approach the Spring Council next month, it is vital that national governments get a grip and push ahead with the economic reforms that are vital to the future prosperity envisaged in the programme."
"In recent weeks, I have been impressed by the statements by the President of the Commission and his clear aim of putting growth and prosperity at the heart of his strategy for the period ahead."
"Similarly, I am unimpressed by the rantings of Socialists, like Mr Schulz, on refocusing priorities within the Lisbon process."
"The left in Europe remain wedded to the old ways of inflexible labour markets, high non-wage labour costs and other barriers to growth."
"Can they not see that it is precisely because of the old social model that Europe is today in relative economic decline?"
"Can they not understand that the high unemployment in so many parts of Europe is caused by the very outmoded proposals that they cling on to in economic terms?"
"Nothing Mr Schulz has just said would help any of the five million presently unemployed in his country."
"Therefore we continue to urge the Commission President to keep up the pace on reform, and we urge the governments to take heed of the reasons for the failure of the Lisbon Agenda in the first five years."
"We want to see a renewed commitment to the completion of the single market."
"Mr Barroso sensibly understands that many remedies for the lack of economic dynamism lie in the hands of Member States themselves."
"However, in addition to the lead he has taken, I would encourage him to put real effort into reducing the legislative output from the Commission itself."
"The Commission must be as efficient as it is requiring our businesses and citizens to be."
"He rightly talks about better regulation, but the priority must be less regulation and, crucially, that legislation must be subject to full impact assessment."
"British Conservative MEPs have been at the forefront of campaigning for less regulation and enforcing such impact assessments."
"I look forward to, and am confident that I will see, some progress soon on all these issues in relation to the Services Directive, which I am so pleased he supports."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that you in the Commission and we in Parliament – or at least the vast majority of Members of this House – want to win hearts and minds for the project of European integration."
"If that is what we want, we must offer citizens real substance, and explain the importance of that substance."
"In our view, a social Europe should be the priority."
"In order to achieve a social Europe, however, we need jobs."
"For jobs we need growth, and for growth we need both investment and, first and foremost, education, training and lifelong learning, and – yes, Mr Kirkhope – we need greater flexibility too."
"Anyone calling for flexibility, however, must know that flexibility and social security are not mutually exclusive; as the Nordic model has shown, the public is in fact willing to accept a greater degree of flexibility if a social safety net is in place and if there are also, for example, extensive opportunities for further training to enable people to cope with the implications of this flexibility, including its social implications."
"We also need effective public services."
"Your statement, Mr President, did not entirely satisfy me, because the question of services cannot be reduced to market economics."
"Our public services are part of our own identity; whether they be postal services or local transport, they are part of the European identity, which the people of Europe rightly want to see defended."
"This is therefore not a purely economic matter, but a profoundly emotive issue too."
"One final point: what Vice-President Wallström did very recently with regard to the rights of air passengers was a very positive step, in my opinion."
"The fact is that we must go public and tell people what we have achieved in this Parliament, including our responses to proposals from the Commission."
"We must tell them that we are here for them, which is why I ask you not to approach legislative measures from an exclusively technical perspective as a means of creating better regulations, but always to think of the people for whom we make these laws and to whom we wish to communicate them."
"If the Commission and the European Parliament can pursue this approach together in future, we shall win many, many hearts and minds for this European Union of ours."
"Madam President, I believe the President-in-Office of the Council has already made the point that this is a good day."
"We have now seen the results from Spain, which put us all in a better position, not only as regards the referendum campaign but also by making it clear that a great nation has decided by a large majority in favour of this political project."
"We also have something to show tomorrow, when you see President Bush."
"It has become clear to all of us – and this must be reflected in our policies – that only joint action makes us a significant factor, and this action pays off, because I can find no other explanation for Condoleezza Rice’s comment that the European Constitution should be adopted."
"US policy, indeed, is sounding an entirely new note here."
"Allow me also to express my thanks to you, President Barroso, for your own particular role in enabling the President of this House to take part in tomorrow’s meeting."
"I should like to refer to another related point, namely our neighbourhood policy."
"I do not believe we have made enough progress in this direction, and President Yushchenko will be here in Parliament on Wednesday so that we can seek a new way to address the formidable challenge of cementing democracy in Eastern Europe, so that closer links can be forged between Eastern Europe and the European Union."
"This implies an urgent need for something more than the neighbourhood policy, because the alternative is increased pressure to narrow the focus of discussions prematurely onto full membership, which we could not deliver immediately, because it would overstretch the integrative capacity of the European Union."
"We must offer a vision to the people of these countries, and so it is certainly worth considering whether there should perhaps be another option besides full membership, an option that does not close the door on full membership but holds out that prospect as a long-term goal."
"At the same time, such an option can bring immediate gains, as happened in the past with the European Economic Area, from which Austria, Finland and Sweden entered the European Union."
"I ask the Commission to give this serious thought, because I fear that we shall otherwise become embroiled very soon in a difficult situation."
"It has been made very clear this afternoon that we are providing these countries, which were victims not only of the Second World War but also of the dictatorship that followed it, with a prospect that enables them to build democracy while strengthening this European Union of ours without impairing its ability to act."
"Mr President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make a few personal observations on the Commission’s Work Programme."
"This is a splendid inventory of the kind once drawn up by the poet Jacques Prévert, but it reminds one of what Wim Kok used to say about the Lisbon Process, ‘Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing’."
"The Commission’s Work Programme is a rather similar case, where one cannot see the wood for the trees."
"Each Commissioner has done his or her best to decorate their own Christmas tree by hanging a few bits of tinsel of their own upon it."
"I am not criticising you, Mr President."
"If you had confined yourself to what was essential, the Members of this House would have been the first to say that you had forgotten this or that issue they considered more important."
"Nonetheless, I would ask you to devote your energies to what is essential."
"Europe must defend its social and environmental models."
"We all agree that Europe must carry out reforms and be more flexible in certain areas."
"You will not, however, win the support of Europeans by voting in favour of what the right is preparing to vote in favour of tomorrow when I present my report, that is to say less tax for the rich and more labour for the workers."
"That will not work."
"In its 2005 annual report, the Economic Policy Committee said that Europe needs a macroeconomic framework supportive of stability and growth and that such a framework is indispensable, but that governments will reap the full benefits of structural reforms in terms of growth and employment only in an appropriate macroeconomic environment."
"We have stability, Mr Barroso; what we now need is growth."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, as we know, it is the Commission’s legislative programme that enables us to translate the Council’s political priorities into practical actions."
"We are therefore pleased to note that priority has been given to the implementation of European legislation, but we want firm commitments for future years."
"The strengthening of security in Europe does indeed remain a priority, yet it must not on any account be strengthened at the expense of civil liberties."
"The proposals that have been put forward on improving the exchange of information and strengthening operational cooperation are a step forward in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, but Europeans’ feelings of insecurity, which we acknowledge, must above all be combated through an active policy of protecting and promoting fundamental rights."
"That is how our democracies must defend themselves, and that is how they will win the day."
"We want initiatives to be taken with a view to combating racism, xenophobia and forms of discrimination."
"The strengthening of judicial cooperation remains one of the priority measures to be taken in order to ensure that Europeans have the same rights and the same access to justice everywhere in Europe."
"We therefore welcome plans to extend judicial cooperation to include certain aspects of family law."
"We call upon the Commission to maintain this commitment and to present proposals based on the principle of mutual recognition in the areas of the evaluation and use of evidence and procedural guarantees."
"We wish to see a fairer approach adopted to asylum and immigration issues, namely one that will above all enable rights to be respected and burdens and responsibilities to be shared."
"We want to see legal immigration channels opened whereby migrants’ basic needs and rights are respected."
"Finally, we ask that significant progress be made on the matter of defining minimum standards for granting and withdrawing refugee status."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with a brief comment on the political content of the speeches we have heard today, particularly that by Mr Schulz."
"I believe – and our current debate on the Lisbon strategy bears this out – that the Lisbon strategy has several pillars."
"There is absolutely no doubt that all the pillars are, in principle, equally important components of the strategy."
"On the other hand, it is a truism that proper social and environmental policies cannot be pursued without a functioning economy."
"The economy is, as it were, the key to the realisation of all our other good political intentions."
"Priorities must therefore be set accordingly, although the pillar structure must not be forgotten."
"I should perhaps mention in passing that there is no better social policy than the creation of jobs."
"That may be another truism, but it still needs to be said."
"Another gentle reminder might be in order, because the President of the Commission is constantly being taken to task over this matter."
"Both of the competent Vice-Presidents of the European Commission – the one who signed the paper in Lisbon and the one who signed the programme we are discussing today – are Socialists."
"It is perhaps appropriate to reiterate that in passing."
"This should mean that the dossier is in the best hands within the Commission, and I fail to see the point of forever dredging up this discussion on alleged differences that do not even exist."
"I also have a particular appeal to make in this matter, which is that the Commission must attach high priority in the framework of this legislative programme, as in other areas, to the implementation of its interinstitutional agreement with the Council and Parliament."
"This is vitally important."
"Among the reasons why things have not worked as well as they should in the past have been the lack of impact assessments of legislative proposals and the inadequate way in which the consultation of stakeholders has been conducted."
"I urge the President and Vice-President of the Commission, particularly in the course of their work over the coming months, to ensure that the interinstitutional agreement is consistently implemented in this context."
"In many areas, this will be the key to the success to which they and all of us aspire."
"Madam President, may I say to Mr Barroso that he devoted his speech today to three splendid aims: prosperity, solidarity and security."
"That naturally arouses great expectations among us Members, and I have to say, Mr Barroso, that my reaction was similar to that of Mr Swoboda, for what you went on to say about the directive on services under these headings actually turned out to be rather insubstantial."
"If you really want us to achieve prosperity, solidarity and security for our citizens, you will have to deal a great deal more thoroughly with this directive on services than you seemed to indicate today."
"If you are serious about your partnership with us, and indeed with all the institutions, you will have to go much further yet."
"Moreover, we must not forget something that is even more important, Mr Barroso, and that is our partnership with the people of the European Union, with all of its 450 million inhabitants."
"It is for them, and for no one else, that we make our policies."
"– In recent weeks, the Commission has taken decisions on two key themes: the strategic guidelines for its mandate and the reform of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Both decisions emphasise the fact that the highest priorities for the EU, in the current circumstances, are reinvigorating economic growth and creating jobs."
"Frankly, I do not understand the argument over which comes first, economic growth or jobs."
"For me it is simple."
"Jobs are created in companies."
"Well, companies only grow and develop when there is a climate of confidence and a widespread desire to create an investment-friendly atmosphere."
"This approach to life, this culture, will become a reality if the capacity is there to carry out the right economic policies."
"The greater the commitment among the Member States to implement the necessary reforms, the more quickly such a culture can be introduced."
"That is the only way in which we can maintain, and indeed develop, the European social model."
"Economic dynamism must not be seen as the enemy of social protection; it is, in fact, its staunchest ally."
"I have a different concern, however, which relates to the definition of priorities and the clear allocation of responsibilities."
"It was precisely because of the absence of these elements that reform of the Lisbon Strategy was needed."
"It is now the duty of the Member States to display the reforming spirit proposed by the Commission through practical political action."
"There is a pressing need to carry out reforms, which, for the most part, are not popular with the public, but which Europe needs."
"These reforms will only succeed if they are explained, exhaustively if necessary."
"That is the only way in which they will be understood and accepted."
"I shall finish by saying that, to my mind, it is worthwhile looking into the benefits of escaping from the office environment and going out onto the street, and, as Members of the European Parliament, we should be the first to do this."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, we should welcome the fact that the European Commission intends to focus its efforts on three issues, namely economic growth, social welfare and environmental protection."
"Only time will tell, however, whether and how these laudable plans will actually be put into practice."
"Any kind of imbalance, in particular one favouring economic growth at the expense of social welfare and environmental protection, would pose a threat to Europe and its citizens, and in particular to the citizens of the new Member States."
"Yet the European Commission is also the guardian of the Treaties, and as such it monitors the Member States’ application of legislation."
"I would therefore call on the Commission to monitor such application on a regular basis, in particular with regard to compliance with the principle of non-discrimination."
"This principle, the implementation of which is mandatory, has already given rise to concerns relating to the provisions of the REACH Regulation and the services directive."
"Is the European Commission not worried that attempts to exclude building services from this directive will be viewed as discriminatory by the new Member States?"
"There are other examples of such practices, and I would therefore call on Mr Barroso to ensure that the Commission monitors the application of legislation very closely as far as the principle of non-discrimination is concerned."
"Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, having listened to this debate, I cannot but repeat that we need to think more like Europeans and stop engaging in national and party politics."
"We need more optimism and confidence, more serious intent, more clarity and scrutiny and the political will to honour the pledges we make from our soap boxes."
"We need more leadership – more leadership from political circles, more leadership from those in government and more leadership from the Commission."
"I should also like to appeal to everyone here to reflect a little."
"All of us are here to make the four freedoms a reality in law and in fact, and everything that serves this purpose is good politics."
"We must reflect on what we have enshrined in the Constitution."
"I really do not understand why we are arguing about these things today."
"In the Constitution, we proclaim the principle of a social market economy."
"In so doing, we are clearly stating that the market is not an end in itself but a means to an end, that we need an efficient market which fulfils its social and environmental responsibilities."
"We have set ourselves the aim of full employment, and we have set ourselves the aim of sustainability."
"Why do we keep conveying the impression to the general public that we are playing off these aims against each other?"
"We do not need any more short-sighted populism; what we want is greater responsibility for the future."
"May I therefore make this request to the President of the Commission: apply a subsidiarity test before the presentation of proposals."
"Explain to the public what there is to be gained by legislating at EU level."
"Define the benefits in terms of growth, competition and employment."
"Define the target group."
"Define clearly the motives, aims and effects and say who has to do what by when, so that we can exercise our parliamentary right of scrutiny."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"The Commission has drawn up an extensive and ambitious programme."
"It has drawn up priority tasks which I agree with and support."
"I am also pleased by the ambition, energy and of course the enthusiasm of the Commission President."
"Yet if we want Europe to be effective, if we want Europe to be closer to its citizens and if we wish to achieve the objectives, then we must act much more effectively than hitherto ourselves."
"An important part of the European Union’s effectiveness is its administrative systems, its public administration."
"You mention them in the strategic objectives on page four, Mr President."
"This is very pleasing."
"Yet at the same time I recall that the Prodi Commission began the reform of public administration in the European Union."
"Former Commissioner Kinnock was responsible for this."
"While I am unaware of how the whole thing ended, if indeed it was ever started, the fact remains that the citizens of the European Union see this as a great bureaucratic apparatus, removed from the people, an apparatus which costs a great deal and which requires an extremely large amount of administration for every trifling thing, not to mention major projects."
"So all of us together, not just those of us here in the European Parliament, but also our electorates, justifiably expect the new Commission to find, within the framework of the priority tasks you have set out, the energy, time and will to deal with its own administrative system, with its own bureaucracy."
"In this regard I anticipate very clear answers."
"And one more thing! Good legislation is fine, but what is more important is that we actually put good legislation into practice."
"Thank you very much!"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, my comments will be addressed primarily to Mr Schulz."
"Mr Schulz, following our conversation about the resolution on Auschwitz, you have completely altered your views and have thereby won my utmost respect."
"Thank you."
"Now, however, I should like to respond to your critical comments regarding the Pope."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the matter of the budget and the funding earmarked for the meeting of young people with the Pope in Cologne, I should like to make it clear that if anyone else managed to bring together so many young people for a good cause, I would certainly vote in favour of providing funding for the meeting."
"I would do so whether the person in question was Mr Schulz or the chairman of any group or party, and I would do so regardless of whether that person was a Socialist, a Green, a Catholic or an adherent of any other political movement or religion."
"If the event concerned promoted social and psychological unity and the creation of a common Europe, then it would deserve genuine respect."
"I believe that Mr Schulz will acknowledge that this is the case, and indeed I can see him nodding in agreement."
"I should like to thank him for that."
"I should also like to remind Members from the ten new Member States, and not only those from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but also those who are Socialists, Greens, Communists or non-attached Members, that it is thanks to the Pope and his actions that we are able to discuss a common Europe together today."
"If it were not for him, we would still be unable to hold such a meeting, and I should like to remind Mr Schulz that this was mainly the Pope’s doing, and that Mr Kovács only played a small part at most."
"If Members are not aware of this fact, or have forgotten it, I should like to remind them most strongly of it, and encourage them to vote in favour of this grant, which will allow the meeting to be held in an appropriate fashion and ensure it will be a great success."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, allow me to congratulate Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, on the legislative programme of the Commission and on the programme he has presented."
"Europe today has grown to consist of 25 Member States, and I am one of those Members who come from one of the countries most recently added to it by enlargement."
"Europe is what it rightly should be; a Europe with a significant voice in global decision-making processes, and we must maintain this role by continuing to reinforce the foundations once laid by Schuman, De Gasperi and Monnet, based on principles that have enabled the European Union to come as far as it has today."
"The work that the European Union performs must constantly reflect the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity."
"It is vitally important that economic growth be equally spread around all European regions."
"Europe is obliged to help those who for some reason have lagged behind to catch up and expand their economies."
"A strong economy can be created by closer cooperation between the Member States, and this is where I would like to congratulate the Commission on the implementation of a new economic strategy that aims to create over six million jobs."
"The Lisbon Strategy must be an absolute priority for all of us who work in the European institutions."
"We must be able to translate this strategy into work and prosperity, a goal that can be achieved only if we manage to eliminate excess bureaucracy and create a strong business environment."
"We in this House must encourage initiatives that will create work across our continent."
"Europe’s citizens expect us to improve Europe’s standard of living, and so we must do our best."
"The legislative and work programme that was presented gives a clear indication of the Commission’s vision for the coming years and, if it cooperates closely with Parliament, I think we can translate this new programme into benefits for all European citizens."
"Mr President, I will try to reply to some specific questions and then I would like to deal with a more general issue of policy, which I believe to be important in terms of our future work."
"With regard to the specific issues, first of all, Mr Duff, you told me that you had not properly understood, or not appreciated, a comment apparently attributed to me concerning naïve federalism."
"I would very much like to clarify what I said, because it may not have been clear in the context."
"When I criticise naïve federalism, it is not in fact federalism itself that I am criticising; quite the opposite."
"I have great respect for all the federalists, all the men and women who founded our great European project."
"I still believe, moreover, that the federal method is essential to this Europe of ours."
"Furthermore, the community method, or at least the method we generally describe as such, is a kind of federal method."
"So, in reality, I criticised naïve federalism as contrasted with what I might consider to be a more sophisticated and more intelligent form of federalism, that is to say, an approach that does not seek to build our European Union – an increasingly close union between all Europeans, at the expense of the legitimacy of the democratic states."
"Our countries are, in fact, democratic states with democratic governments and democratic parliaments."
"I have had the honour of working in Geneva with a great federalist, Denis de Rougemont, who sometimes blamed the state for all evils, as if the state were not also a democratic institution."
"I am in favour of an increasingly strong Union, but that strengthening should not jeopardise the legitimacy of the democratic states."
"I very much wish to offer that clarification because I have heard criticisms of my comment, which gave a distorted view of my thoughts and feelings on the subject of Europe."
"The second issue relates to security and justice."
"We have talked a lot about the economy, but we must not forget that we have a programme – and a very ambitious one at that – in the field of security and justice – a programme that will be implemented by Vice-President Frattini."
"That, specifically, was the subject of one of the questions raised."
"Security, justice and the protection of fundamental rights will be one of the Commission's priorities."
"We need to offer a practical response to people’s demands in terms of security."
"That is why, in 2005, we are, in particular, going to present Parliament with the action plan aimed at implementing the strategy adopted in The Hague, in the form of proposals concerning the protection of the victims of organised crime, women and children in particular."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that this is a new dimension to the action described in our programme: placing more emphasis on the protection of children."
"We believe – and I also very much want to stress this – that this is a field in which it is possible to strengthen action at European level."
"Proposals can thus be presented with a view to strengthening mutual recognition and trust between the judicial authorities, and a proposal concerning a European strategy in relation to legal immigration and to the fight against people traffickers can be drawn up."
"Security, justice and the protection of human rights are a genuine priority, and I would like you to know that the Commission is going to do everything possible to respond to those demands."
"Certain Members, including Mr Karas, Mr Kirkhope, and Mr Lehne, and also Mr Goebbels to a certain degree, have raised the issue of how to focus legislation and of whether it should be strengthened or restricted."
"I am delighted, moreover, that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are fully aware of this concern."
"When I talk about ‘better legislation’, I do not always mean that we need less legislation."
"In certain cases, precisely because we are a Union, we need a degree of harmonisation or more legislation, sometimes in order to harmonise or simplify the existing legislation."
"I would, however, like to stress that we do share this concern about the quality of legislation, and we have introduced it into our programme."
"Throughout all of the action we take, we shall, therefore, be weighing up the factors of cost, proportionality and subsidiarity that we shall be using for the purposes of impact assessment."
"This is why – and I say this partly in response to Mr Goebbels – we have of course had to draw up a list of our main objectives."
"This is an implementation programme for this year."
"You would no doubt criticise us if I only presented four or five priorities."
"The political line is one dimension and, in this regard, we are talking about very clear and well-focussed priorities, defined when we presented the strategic objectives."
"The specific, legislative and implementation programme is another dimension, and one of which you should be aware so that you can monitor our activities, the Commission being answerable to this Parliament."
"With regard to another specific question, namely climate change, I would like very much to say to Mrs Beer, who I am sure will put this question to President Bush tomorrow, that one of the subjects on our agenda is the possibility of cooperation with the Americans, partly in a post-Kyoto spirit."
"That is a sensitive subject."
"We are aware of the positions taken by the American administration to date, but I believe we should embark upon a dialogue on this issue with the United States of America."
"I shall probably have the opportunity to raise this issue with the President of the United States."
"With regard, now, to the issue of the Directive on Services, I would very much like to say, in response specifically to Mr Swoboda, that I agree with your concerns about services of general interest."
"I have already said this on many occasions: services of general interest, or certain public services, are part of what might be called the tradition, or organisational culture, of certain states."
"We are therefore seeking specifically to ensure that these concerns are taken into account, since we believe them to be legitimate."
"That is why my Commission has taken the initiative to review certain aspects of the Directive on Services, and I was expecting a word of congratulation from yourselves."
"It is exactly the opposite that I hear from you when you describe this Commission as neoliberal even though it was not this Commission that presented the directive in question."
"In fact, we are seeking a balance while maintaining the objective, which is to create a genuine internal market in services, since that is essential to the creation of jobs in Europe."
"This is an objective we cannot abandon and on which, furthermore, there is consensus until 2010, but it must be pursued in a balanced manner."
"That is the fundamental political question I would like to put to our friends in the Socialist Party in the European Parliament, and in particular to Mr Schultz, who raised this question."
"You must choose: either you want to oppose the Commission or you want to work with it."
"I have already said that the Commission wants to work in a spirit of cooperation and constructive rapport with Parliament and, in particular, with all those Members who truly want to move Europe forward. This is no neoliberal proposal on our part."
"The proposals I have put forward in this House are the result of a consensus."
"The Commission includes Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals."
"The Lisbon Agenda was presented to the Commission by myself and Vice-President Verheugen, who is a member of your political grouping."
"The programme I have just presented today has been presented by myself and Vice-President Wallström, who is also a member of your political grouping."
"We do not want to engage in dogmatism; we want to unite those Europeans who want reforms for Europe, but we do not want to abandon the reforms."
"If it has been possible for the Commission to take all these decisions unanimously, although there may have been expressed differences; if Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Independents have reached a consensus, why might we not also achieve that here in the European Parliament and unite around an ambitious programme of reform for this Europe of ours, which takes account of social and environmental concerns?"
"Do not present a caricature of our Commission. That is not fair."
"If you look at the list of our objectives, you will find that it contains a series of specific proposals in the social and environmental fields."
"We are well aware that, today, it is impossible to create growth without an environmental dimension."
"On the contrary, we believe that the environment contributes to growth and increased competitiveness in Europe."
"We agree on this point, so please do not see obstacles where there are, in fact, none."
"What we want is to make it clear that the status quo is no longer an option today, that Europe has serious competitiveness problems when compared to other regions of the world and that we intend to put this right by adapting and renewing our social model."
"That is why the Commission has a President who wants reform, but also Socialist, Liberal, Christian Democrat and Independent members who all also want this reform to be carried out in a spirit of balance and proportion."
"I would therefore like to ask the PSE Group not to set itself up in opposition to the Commission: on the contrary, I would ask it to cooperate, though not in an uncritical way, with us, just as all the other groups do."
"Mrs Grossetête, who is a member of the largest political grouping in the European Parliament, has also expressed to us certain demands and requirements, and I thank her for that."
"I would now like to draw your attention, as fellow Europeans, to the fact that this is not just any moment in the history of Europe."
"Yesterday, we learned the result of the referendum in Spain, and we are delighted about this, but we shall also have a referendum in France."
"We shall have a referendum in the United Kingdom; I talked about it today with Prime Minister Blair in London."
"What do you believe Europeans expect now?"
"They want the institutions to work together; they do not have a very good understanding of the fine details of the debate or of the policies of the political groups."
"They want to know whether the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council are working along the same lines and whether or not they are genuinely concerned about their problems."
"I believe it would be highly inappropriate, at a time like this when very important referendums are taking place, for people to look at Europe and see, on the one hand, the Commission and, on the other, a number of large groups such as your great European Socialist grouping, and thus to be presented with an image of division."
"I have already addressed this very sincere appeal to some of you personally and I would like to repeat it."
"We should not abandon our ideas, of course, since we are all very attached to them, but it is possible to look beyond these ideas and reach a dynamic consensus in favour of the reforms Europe needs."
"I believe that this is genuinely possible."
"The last issue relates to the criticism you expressed, Mr Schultz, of the statement I made about my country."
"As, moreover, you acknowledged, I did not, where this matter was concerned, fail to honour any obligation, because the Commission's code of conduct clearly allows Commissioners to be active members of political parties and unions."
"There was therefore no failure to honour obligations."
"All I did was express my solidarity with the party of which I was President for several years."
"What would have been a real political event in my country is if I had kept quiet!"
"I would therefore thank you for not putting the question in the form of an attack against me personally for the position I took, because it was perfectly permissible for me to take that position."
"You raised the possibility of the code of conduct’s being revised in terms of the interinstitutional agreement."
"I would very much like to say that I am completely opposed to this idea, since our code of conduct stipulates that the members of the Commission may participate in an election campaign if they request authorisation to do so from the President of the Commission."
"The question you raised is therefore about what happens in the case of the President of the Commission."
"I must state that if the President of the Commission has the power to decide whether or not Commissioners can participate, then he also has that power in relation to himself."
"This is clearly laid down in the Treaty, Article 217 of which states, and I shall read it in English:"
"The members of the Commission shall carry out duties devolved upon them by the President under his authority."
"The Treaty therefore clearly establishes the principle of the President's political leadership of the College and the principle of the President's authority."
"So to accept, by means of an interinstitutional agreement, a reduction in the authority of the President would be contrary to the Treaty as it stands, and to weaken the President of the Commission's authority would mean weakening the authority of the Commission itself."
"We need a strong Commission."
"That is why I believe that your proposal is not a good one."
"I would draw the attention of all the political families to the fact that we, the European Parliament and the Commission, must strengthen each other on a mutual basis."
"We are the European institutions . We can do extraordinary things together, and we must therefore enhance each other’s status."
"Personally, I try to enhance the status of the European Parliament in all my public statements, and not just in my statements."
"I would expect you to do the same, since we have great challenges to face together, and together we can win the day."
"However, we cannot do so by reducing the importance of the Commission and by asking the Commissioners to be civil servants. Instead, we must ask them to assume their political responsibilities, to exercise their citizenship and to express their preferences, always while working in a European spirit of course."
"As a citizen, I have the right to express my point of view about my own country. I have the right, like all European citizens, to vote in accordance with my opinions."
"As President of the Commission, I will not discriminate."
"In fact, at your request, I received the leader of the opposition, who will become the Prime Minister of my country."
"I received him a few days before the beginning of the election campaign, because, as President of the Commission, I do not use my post to oppose any particular government and I do not distinguish between governments of the left and of the right."
"In fact, I believe that the Commission should represent the general European interest."
"Having said that, the members of the Commission are political men and women."
"Perhaps some Members of this House do not like that."
"As citizens, we have rights, however. We have the right to express ourselves, and that is a fundamental right."
"That is why I do not accept your criticism in this regard."
"I would like to point out that we all need strong European institutions. This institution – the Commission – must be strong and must work with a strong Parliament, firmly committed to change and reforms and with the sense of balance that is at the heart of our Europe."
"I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate pursuant to Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum."
". Mr President, perhaps I am breaching the working time directive this evening!"
"Over the coming years we will do much together that could help shape the world in which we live."
"This is a unique chance to address a unique phenomenon."
"Managing the impact of globalisation, both at home and across the world, represents an unprecedented challenge."
"If we get it right, we can offer billions of people a decent chance in life, tackling extreme poverty, fighting disease and hunger, promoting good governance and supporting development and inclusion, with the structures and financial means to bring them about."
"If we fail, we will sow the seeds of continuing injustice, division and instability."
"That is why this Commission has proposed a programme which is as relevant to Europe as it is to our partners around the world."
"It is designed to spread prosperity, strengthen solidarity and offer security."
"We must offer an internal and an external response."
"Inside the Union, we must boost cohesion and deliver the full potential of our recent and future enlargements."
"Through our social agenda we must continue to fight exclusion and poverty; we must help more people find work in a dynamic and growing economy; and we must change attitudes and behaviour, supporting our goal of sustainable development by taking ambitious action."
"Outside the Union, we must pursue the Millennium Development Goals with renewed energy and imagination."
"Creating this fresh momentum is a key goal of our ongoing review of sustainable development, ensuring that our internal and external actions are better coordinated."
"As Europeans, our shared values and experience can be a major force for improving the quality of life of billions of people around the globe."
"Our unique model of cooperation is inspiring regional cooperation, for example the development of the African Union."
"It ensures that our voice is listened to when it comes to reforming international institutions."
"Last week, the Kyoto Protocol entered into force."
"Kyoto is a good example of our ability to bring a European perspective to helping shape developments at a global level."
"Kyoto and the Millennium Development Goals also highlight the dilemma we face."
"We must deliver effective action at a global level, but we must also drum up wide support for our proposed action among countries and civil society."
"That is the new reality of global governance that is taking shape."
"It is defined as much by our formal gatherings in the WTO, the World Bank, the G8 as by the more informal settings provided by the World Social Forum or the World Economic Forum."
"That is why I welcome our debate today."
"Both Porto Alegre and Davos stand as symbols of one real benefit of globalisation: our ability to engage in continued dialogue at an international level with regard to the type of society we want."
"This possibility is giving more people a voice in shaping our future."
"While such meetings do not necessarily set a political agenda, they act as a sounding board for a broad spectrum of public opinion."
"Let me elaborate on the events in Davos and Porto Alegre."
"This year, I participated in the event at Davos; next year I hope the Commission will be able to join the 150 000 people attending the World Social Forum."
"Fortunately, in Davos I was able to talk about Porto Alegre in detail with President Lula of Brazil, a good friend of mine."
"I have great respect for his vision and commitment to making globalisation work and reducing global disparities."
"Our discussions gave me a sense of the mood in Porto Alegre."
"One thing which struck me above all else is how the agenda of both gatherings are tending to converge."
"Davos was not a hotbed of neo-liberalism, nor was Porto Alegre simply an anti-Davos demonstration."
"Among other issues, the discussions focused on the fight against poverty, the situation in Africa, the role of trade and economic dynamism in spreading prosperity and opportunity, the need for a sustainable path for global development and the challenges of global security."
"I could draw a number of lessons from what I heard."
"First, we should not deny that, while the agenda are converging, the two audiences are looking at the issues involved from different angles."
"Nevertheless, the representation of civil society is increasing in the World Economic Forum, and there is a broadening range of participants in the World Social Forum."
"I took two key messages away with me from Davos."
"First, we must act together to solve global problems ranging from poverty and development to climate change."
"I was proud to see that European leaders such as Jacques Chirac, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder were ready to set the pace."
"They took the initiative to propose some important ideas."
"Second, we need to light the flame of economic dynamism to stimulate reform around the world, not as a goal in itself, but as the best means of offering more people the chance of a decent life."
"We can turn globalisation into an advantage."
"European leadership is required to face the challenges arising from globalisation."
"Finally, Europe can do a lot, but we can certainly achieve more if we are able to act together with other partners to address global challenges."
"This is the message that I will pass on to President George Bush tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must find the means to ensure that the commitment of the participants in the World Economic Forum and the World Social Forum bears fruit."
"Europe must provide a link between the very different perceptions of the possible consequences of globalisation."
"In this regard, I would like to respond in several ways."
"First of all, the European Union is, and must remain, an ambitious player on the world stage."
"It is the largest integrated market."
"Its gross domestic product is the largest in the world and it is the world's top player in international trade."
"We, the European Union, are the largest provider of international aid and, as the tsunami tragedy has demonstrated, we are prepared to show solidarity."
"Thanks to the euro in particular, we are a key partner in the field of international financial relations."
"We must use our network of bilateral relations to move things forward, to encourage change and to promote respect for fundamental rights and freedoms."
"Furthermore, if we acknowledge that we are a world player and that our ambition is to play a decisive role, we must champion an effective form of multilateralism."
"We must continue to promote the development of a world order founded upon the rule of law, but that rule of law must not just serve the interests of the rich western countries."
"We must demonstrate solidarity."
"This is why we are expressing our commitment to the United Nations, our determination to seek creative international solutions in order to improve prospects in Africa – as I have said, Africa will be our priority – and our desire to promote the quick completion of the Doha development round."
"Finally, the European Union must mobilise a wide range of political instruments aimed at improving the fate of our neighbours in the world."
"We must take the best advantage of the new possibilities offered to us by the Constitution thanks to the creation of the post of foreign affairs minister and of a European foreign action service."
"We must, however, also focus our attention on the priorities and achieve concrete results."
"These objectives will be reflected in the initiatives we take, such as reviewing the European Union's approaches to sustainable development and preparing the review of the Millennium development objectives."
"They are objectives that already form an integral part of the European Union's partnership for growth and employment, which I launched at the beginning of this month."
"I shall conclude now."
"The European Union is a world player."
"We must accept that responsibility."
"We must contribute actively to defining the new world order and enhance international governance founded upon the rule of law."
"Europe has a very specific contribution to make."
"We must strengthen the European Union as a civil power."
"We must ensure that the ideas of peace and democracy and the principles of the market economy are disseminated throughout the world: the principles of open societies."
"We have the instruments needed to make a real difference."
"The European Union must, therefore, respond to the hopes placed in us both by our citizens and by our international partners, whether it be in Davos or in Porto Alegre."
". Mr President, earlier we heard an excellent speech from the President of the Commission on how we need to work together and cooperate to make Europe the most competitive and economically prosperous entity on the globe."
"We are facing challenges from China, India, Brazil and other countries."
"We have heard a clarion call from the President asking us to throw out the old models and to create new ones in order to compete."
"In that context I want to say that we agree that the World Economic Forum was a tremendous success, as global representatives from governments, businesses and civil society managed to agree on a coherent set of principles for action: matching global trade with sustainable development."
"Many of these – such as concrete measures to liberalise trade and accelerate aid to the poorest countries – will be of great benefit in helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in the World Economic Forum."
"At this point, however, and less diplomatically than the President of the Commission, I must also make some remarks about the World Social Forum, which proved to be something of a disappointment by comparison."
"Poverty reduction is the largest of the Millennium Development Goals and, as one main aim of the World Social Forum's participants, one would have expected the Forum to produce some concrete recommendations as to how this might be achieved."
"Yet even journalists who were generally in favour of the World Social Forum had to admit that its basic objective was not to produce a unified document suggesting concrete ideas for fear of spoiling the diversity of opinions, and that the resulting proposals contain many contradictions."
"We in the European Parliament respect diversity and want to hear the views of world social experts as part of our commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"But, logically, we cannot do both simultaneously – one thing and its opposite."
"I would, therefore, call for more unified proposals from the World Social Forum in the hope of achieving those goals more rapidly and without wasting further time."
"In this regard I was also disappointed that, as the President of the Commission said, although we are the largest economy there were very few people from the European Parliament in the World Economic Forum."
"Do the people who are arranging these matters consider that the elected representatives of the people of Europe are also important in the decision-making process of the World Economic Forum?"
"Mr President, I would first of all like to say how delighted I am that a debate with the Commission, represented by yourself, Mr President of the Commission, can take place in this Parliament the day after the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum."
"I believe that it is a sign of recognition by this House of the World Social Forum which, when it was created in 2001, was portrayed by many as an ineffective gathering for challenging globalisation."
"In reality, social forums and the movements that promote them have revolutionised the debate on globalisation."
"They have popularised many issues and positive proposals which are now debated in all international bodies including, increasingly, within the World Economic Forum in Davos."
"When I say that, I am thinking about access to global public assets, the creation of global taxes, the cancellation of debt, the reform of the international financial institutions and the latter’s need for transparency."
"I believe that one of the other important contributions of the social forums has been to root the challenge to liberal globalisation, to the economic and social injustices it creates and to its often destructive consequences for the ecological balance of the planet, not in the false belief that national or sovereigntist solutions had to be found, and not in a rejection of the very idea of globalisation, but in the view that globalisation and its rules and institutions must be transformed, in order to allow for a different kind of globalisation, a globalisation of solidarity, of democratic triumphs and of human rights, a globalisation that guarantees the right of all peoples to development, justice and peace."
"For the European Union, this new world civil society is a source of support, because its aspirations coincide with objectives that the Union has established for itself at international level."
"However, it is not enough to take pleasure in its emergence. Our policies and decisions should reflect its demands and its aspirations in practical ways."
"So we must demonstrate that Europe can make a difference, as you have said."
"We must demonstrate – and we are doing so in certain fields, such as with the Kyoto Protocol, which you have mentioned – that we really are able to transform international policies."
"In the social field, as in other fields, such as those we have just been talking about, declarations of love are not enough; we also need demonstrations of love."
"Today, 21 Member States have not yet fulfilled their promise to provide 0.7% of gross domestic product in development aid."
"A global tax is today being discussed."
"I am pleased about that, and many Member States have signed the New York declaration of September 2004, but unfortunately the reticence of some nations is being used as an excuse not to take any decision."
"I would, therefore, like to make the following proposal: that the Union, by means of the Commission, should help those Member States that wish to commit themselves by means, if necessary, of enhanced cooperation, so that they do not remain blocked by the reticence of some nations to implement, from now on, a tax dedicated to international development funding."
"It could be used in the fight against AIDS, because a recent Council document indicates that, if nothing is done between now and 2010, a fifth of the active population in five of the developing countries most affected is going to disappear."
"Take the initiative, Mr President of the Commission."
"Show that Europe can indeed move on from statements to actions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos was a resounding success."
"The global elite from the business, political and academic communities made it clear that they are fully aware of their responsibility for the problems in the world and that they are willing to act."
"Bono, the lead singer of the Irish band U2, summed this up very succinctly: if you want money and if you want help, he said, you must talk to those who can give money and provide help."
"What makes the Davos meeting so important and so useful is that it brings these very people together."
"The same cannot necessarily be said of the World Social Forum, and the outcome of the latter, I believe, is also far more open to criticism."
"It may have surprised the critics to learn that the main topics in Davos were Africa, problems relating to the worldwide growth of poverty, how to shape the globalisation process in such a way that everyone derives some benefit from it and how to bring about fair world trade."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are convinced that free trade is the best development aid."
"Free trade is what helps countries that want to develop, and free trade is also what motivates developing countries to become increasingly competitive."
"The EU should lead the way here."
"In particular, it should put free trade on the agenda, especially in areas where trade barriers still exist, namely areas covered by its agricultural policy."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are also vehemently opposed to the introduction of any global tax on financial transactions."
"Making ourselves poorer in this way would not help the poor to become richer."
"It is also illusory to believe that solidarity is fostered by introducing new taxes, in other words by imposing what is tantamount to a financial penalty on those who are actually supposed to help."
"No, the real way to create solidarity is through a worldwide change in people’s perceptions and, quite simply, through willingness to adopt other measures of assistance."
"We therefore support the priority given to the issue of debt cancellation and find it an eminently sensible course of action, and we believe that those countries which are moving towards democratisation and which are committed to the introduction of sustainable and free economies should be eligible for full debt cancellation."
"Such forms of aid, however, will have no long-term impact if they are only one-off gestures."
"For this reason, let me repeat that free trade is what both the developing and the developed countries need most and what will enable us to progress."
"If we want world trade to be fairer, our foremost aim should be to make it freer."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that I agree with practically nothing the previous Member said and, like many Members of this House, I attended the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre."
"At this point, it is not a question of competing to see who is in the best position to combat poverty, but of seeing things as they are."
"On the one hand, the World Social Forum was an enormous success this year – 155 000 participants, 135 countries; that is considerable – and it has taken on a new tone since, on a certain number of issues – social, environmental, economic, financial – many networks have continued to be put in place and have done extremely serious work, in an extremely concrete manner, in order, specifically, to produce a number of proposals which have yet to be developed, but which are very real."
"On the other hand, the World Social Forum does not just consist of NGOs, it also includes parliamentarians – the Parliamentarians’ Forum – and local elected representatives, of which there were also many this year, who have discussed district and local authority policies in response to the challenges we are facing."
"Very dynamic, enthusiastic and hard-working young people are also extremely well represented, and I do not believe we can casually sweep aside such dynamism and vitality."
"In reality, the World Social Forum has two aims."
"Firstly, to explain that free trade cannot provide a response to the increasing social inequalities."
"They are not increasing because of a scourge which has merely come out of the blue, but rather because the policies being implemented over recent years in the fields of structural adjustment and of reducing public spending have led to increasing inequalities and poverty and to increased deterioration of the environment and of the planet as a whole."
"The second aim is to propose an alternative to the current development model and reject the presentation of world free trade as a panacea and a miracle cure for everything."
"It is clearly not these things."
"All the bodies of the United Nations indicate that the situation is deteriorating today."
"Finally, whether we are talking about Porto Alegre or Davos, what we need is practical action."
"We must no longer be content with words, images and positions adopted."
"We need very practical and precise commitments, a work plan."
"Mr President of the Commission, that is something else we expect from you who are, together with the Commission – and with us all – in a position to take decisions: not just good intentions or Millennium objectives, but also extremely specific proposals."
". I should like to start by saying that I am delighted that this debate is taking place, as it is one that I think is urgently needed."
"Although there has been a great deal of empty talk – particularly on the part of Mr Barroso –it is fashionable nowadays to use impressive-sounding phrases while continuing to pursue the same policies as before."
"This sort of behaviour is quite typical of the World Economic Forum in Davos, and, indeed, the phrase I would use to describe this Forum was coined by the well-known academic, Elmar Altvater; he described it as a big show, and, unfortunately, a rather unproductive one."
"Yet it is interesting to note that there has been a change in the terminology used at the Forum and in the issues with which it deals."
"It would be no exaggeration to say that it is increasingly the critics of the World Economic Forum who are setting its agenda; these critics met at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, where 150 000 people held debates and protested against neo-liberal and neo-imperial policies."
"The Social Forum movement is of crucial importance in terms of opposition to both globalisation and war."
"The World Social Forum saw a large number of very pragmatic debates held on issues ranging from human rights for all – not only for people in Western countries – to the protection of public property, as well as debates held in protest at cuts in social services, in protest at the war, in protest at debt – with particular reference to the question of when the debts of the countries affected by the tsunami will finally be cancelled – and in protest at poverty."
"Environmental issues also featured heavily on the agenda, and I took part in a forum on water, for example."
"I should like to make it quite clear – and this is a point that must be stressed – that the participants of the World Social Forum levelled their criticism and protests not only at US policy, but also at the policies of the European Commission and the European Council."
"By following a similar path to that of the United States – or in other words following in the wrong footsteps – the European Union is losing ever more credibility in these circles."
"The participants of the World Social Forum did not wish to play the game that we see the European Council, the Commission and a great many Members of this House playing time and time again; looking askance at the USA whilst talking up their own policies."
"Can something along the lines of the Bolkestein directive be a genuine alternative to US policies?"
"The answer to this must be ‘no’, as it is a neo-liberal programme."
"Can it be a genuine alternative to enshrine, as has been done in the EU Constitutional Treaty, a commitment to armament or an open market economy with free competition?"
"The answer to this must also be ‘no’."
"Mr Barroso, you said that the EU is a global player, but the key question that needs to be asked is what kind of a global player it is."
"It must be made quite clear that free trade is not a foolproof way of reacting appropriately to the kind of policies that are currently being pursued."
"Instead, real debt relief must be provided; there must be a move away from neo-liberal and economically liberal policies, and the whole process must not go hand in hand with the militarisation of the European Union."
"I should like to close with a quote from a declaration adopted at the Forum, one that calls for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq and expresses support for all efforts to bring them home."
"‘We support efforts to organise soldiers, conscientious objectors and military families against the war."
"We support the counter-recruitment campaign and demand political asylum for deserters.’"
"The message could not be clearer."
"Mr President, globalisation would, in an ideal world, be the key to greater competitiveness, growth and improved living conditions."
"It is not only in recent times, though, that reality has had a different tale to tell, and this makes it even more important that the World Economic Forum in Davos and the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre should examine, on a regular basis, the methods employed by globalisation and the effects resulting from it."
"The recent World Social Forum drew up over 350 proposals on globalisation, although I hope that these will be pruned down so that we are left with fewer, but more meaningful recommendations."
"If action is to be effective, principles must be thought through with crystalline clarity."
"Three priorities were proposed by the World Economic Forum; the reduction of greenhouse gases, more money for the poorest countries and the abolition of trade barriers through the WTO."
"What is missing from this list is corporate social responsibility, for which businesses themselves should be accountable."
"It is not only the economic weight of businesses that matters, but also the extent of their social activities."
"The turnover of the top multinational corporations is higher than the combined total of the budgets of the UN Member States."
"It is safe to say that if Mr Ackermann of Deutsche Bank – a company that can certainly be considered a global player – had read this recommendation, he would not have announced a return on capital of 16% in the same breath as the loss of over 6 000 jobs."
"Those affected by his ‘smart sourcing’ method, view it as nothing but a combination of compulsive profit making and irresponsibility. ‘Smart sourcing’ has every chance of becoming 2005’s least popular new phrase."
"On a more positive note again, both the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum are important platforms for inspiring debates."
"I therefore believe it to be necessary that both the President of the European Parliament and representatives from our specialist committees should participate in these forums in future."
"More than ever before, global elites need representatives of the people."
"Mr President, I was dismayed by President Barroso's contribution at the end of the debate on the presidency's programme – particularly his defence of his intervention in Portuguese politics."
"Mr Barroso, you are no longer a Portuguese politician: you are a European politician, selected by this Parliament and by the Council of all of the Member States to represent Europe."
"You cannot intervene in domestic politics as a Portuguese politician; that is not acceptable."
"Unless you understand that, you will weaken the Commission."
"Criticism of that position will not weaken the Commission but your actions will."
"That is not unrelated to the issue that we are currently discussing in connection with the World Social Forum."
"An awful lot of people right round the world look to Europe as the only transnational, democratic institution that has the capacity to try to rein in the forces that they see destroying the world."
"If you cannot see the role of the Commission as a body that can transcend national politics and parties in a way that will give a lead to the hope expressed in the World Social Forum, then we are wasting our time here."
"I appeal to you to bear in mind that you represent Europe, not Portugal."
"To take the example of the Services Directive – you say that you are committed to the European social model."
"We take your words at face value, but we will not accept them forever."
"We need to have a concrete example of your commitment."
"The only way, in my view, in which you can demonstrate your commitment is to extract the 'country of origin' principle, which directly attacks the European social model and which directly attacks the solidarity and approach to the development of a European single market."
"I want a single market in services, but I will not accept the 'country of origin' principle, which will give us a lower level of social services and will undermine the faith that millions of people outside Europe place in us to lead the way in creating a better world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Barroso for his speech before this House."
"I do not want to go into detail, but I should like to focus on an issue that I believe to be of great significance, and perhaps even the greatest significance, in political terms."
"Two fora have been held, an economic forum in the wealthy city of Davos, and a social forum in the poor city of Porto Alegre."
"What is worrying is that not enough attention was paid to social issues at the economic forum, and that the ‘social’ forum is turning into a vehicle for questioning, and even challenging, the economic forum."
"Two approaches are emerging in the search for solutions to modern-day problems."
"The first of these involves looking for ways to develop the economy, whereas the second involves looking for ways to ensure social goals are attained, despite the fact that the two issues are intimately linked."
"Discussing economic and social issues separately amounts to a grave misunderstanding."
"I therefore believe that in future, instead of two global initiatives competing with each other, there should be a single economic and social world forum."
"This is where the European Union, and in particular the European Parliament and the European Commission, can play a role by pushing for such a forum in the future."
"I thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, President Barroso, if you have to contravene the Working Time Directives, you can comfort yourself with the thought that it is, in any case, with the best of intentions, namely that of discussing global justice and the role of civil society."
"In Porto Alegre, I was one of 155 000 delegates from 135 countries."
"At the same time, 20 Heads of State and 70 ministers met in Davos."
"Was any listening done in Davos, however?"
"Perhaps from a theoretical European perspective it is possible to believe that free trade, capitalism and liberalisation constitute the solution to development problems."
"The theory is not, however, consistent with the everyday lives of millions of people, and it is time that we began to adjust the theories to the reality, and not the other way around."
"It is time that trade became a tool for human beings, and not vice versa."
"We must stop demanding the liberalisation of water and other sensitive sectors in return for countries’ being well treated."
"President Barroso, when you meet President Bush and the EU Heads of Government, you can remind them of their 30 year-old promise to give 0.7% in aid."
"That aid would not even be needed if more of the profits from production in the developing countries were to stay in those countries."
"You are sincerely welcome to attend the next World Social Forum, to be held somewhere in Africa."
"I can lend you a few fair-trade clothes made from environmentally friendly materials so that, one day, you can take part incognito, as an ordinary delegate, and genuinely experience the atmosphere there, without the interference of security guards."
"It is precisely that joy and that spirit of cooperation, without hierarchical structures, which exist between everyone in the World Social Forum, that offer hope for the future."
"Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an unfortunate fact that what both our first debate today and the one we are now holding have in common is that they appear to be dominated by confrontation rather than cooperation."
"I would like to see the World Economic Forum and the World Social Forum merge, thus enabling us to talk to each other, rather than about each other."
"Although you said, Mr President of the Commission, that the EU is a global player, I do believe that we have yet to become a global player rather than a global payer."
"Tomorrow will be an important step in this process, and I wish you the best of luck in this respect."
"The EU is needed, and it bears responsibility."
"We share responsibility, while yet being reliant on others; we both shape events and are affected by them."
"Our understanding of fundamental freedoms and human rights, our rejection of the death penalty, of child labour and of discrimination of any kind, our concept of what it means to be human; all these things know no borders, whether these be borders of countries or of continents, and it is in this sense that we also bear responsibility for what happens in the rest of the world."
"The answer to globalisation must not come from Europe alone; what is needed is a debate on a model world order."
"We need a global code of ethics and global principles of action, in spite of the fact that different cultures exist."
"I therefore believe that we should speak up in favour of multilateralism, that we should support the initiative for a global Marshall Plan and that the EU should hold a UN conference, and that this House should call on churches throughout the world to convene an international ecumenical conference and to agree common principles of action."
"I believe that the European model of an environmentally friendly social market economy could become a worldwide hallmark of the EU, and that this would allow us to help change the unfair rules that currently govern the global economy."
"Mr President, the World Social Forum was originally initiated as a counterpoint to the World Economic Forum in Davos with the intention of trying to force social issues onto the globalisation agenda."
"At this, its fifth meeting, there are over 150 000 participants from 150 countries and, amongst the hundreds of meetings, representatives of the IMF and the World Bank face their critics for the first time."
"These two institutions stand accused of imposing neo-conservative economic fundamentalism on the poorest countries in the world."
"Aid carries with it the poison pill of conditionality that forces the opening of the markets to privatisation of state assets, and the straitjacket of monetarist policies."
"This approach flies in the face of reality."
"The challenge to them is to name a country with a weak economy that has opened up and succeeded in developing its economy."
"The two latest much-lauded success stories are India and China, neither of which has followed their prescriptions."
"Both protected their young, growing industries until they were capable of entering the global market."
"But even India has its downside."
"Its economy is booming but it is a pity about the poor."
"In 2003, 11 000 new millionaires were created in India, while 8 million people were unemployed and 50 million lived on less than a dollar a day."
"What is to be done?"
"In the next ten years 45 million children will die of poverty-related diseases, 12 million AIDS orphans will be produced in Africa, and 100 million children will remain totally illiterate."
"The World Bank claims it is merely carrying out the wishes of the 147 states which own it – a verbal sleight of hand."
"African countries do not impose conditionality on themselves, nor do the Latin-Americans."
"It is the G8 industrialised countries that make decisions, often led by their own self-serving agenda."
"Yet the fact that the IMF and the World Bank are now ‘talking the talk, but not walking the walk’ suggests that pressure from civic society can have an impact."
"The World Bank is including poverty reduction programmes in its plans, and is expressing concern about countries such as Tanzania which spend more on debt servicing than either health or education."
"China and India can force these issues onto the agenda and the fact that the European Union has more votes in the IMF than the United States suggests that the World Social Forum slogan 'Another world is possible' is achievable: with sufficient willpower and political commitment."
"It is for the NGOs and civic society to give Europe's politicians the necessary backbone."
"Mr President, whether gathered against the backdrop of the Swiss mountains or the Brazilian coast, I am convinced that all participants in the Davos and Porto Alegre conferences were united in the one goal of tackling poverty and economic development."
"It is therefore particularly pleasing to see that in Davos and in Porto Alegre, the crucial importance of liberalising world trade was recognised."
"Economic growth is the cornerstone of development in developing countries, whether we are dealing with climate change or guaranteeing good education."
"It follows on from this that I cannot emphasise strongly enough the need for the forthcoming Doha round to be a success, and the crucial role that the Commission and the Member States have to play in this."
"Whoever is serious about aid to the developing countries should not be blind to what goes wrong at home."
"Europe’s tariff barriers are, to my mind, an example of how things should not be done."
"Alongside positive points, there are also a few negative points to be identified."
"The pleas for extra tax on international financial transactions, the famous Tobin tax, strike me as eccentric, as does the extra tax for multinational companies."
"I see no good in such measures."
"They put the cart before the horse."
"Those who strive towards freer world trade should not impose new rules at the same time."
"Finally, I am surprised at those who promote unconditional debt cancellation for the developing countries."
"My group finds it simply unacceptable that this should be done without conditions being imposed."
"We believe that countries actively and successfully pursuing democracy and good governance should be able to count on support, but debt relief should not be granted without a commitment to that."
"The liberal priorities are freer world trade and the emphasis on economic development."
"That is the way to fight poverty and is, at the same time, the basis for an effective and affordable social safety net."
"It also allows us to pursue a more environmentally-friendly policy as a result."
"The question is: will we all go down together in apathetic solidarity, or will we opt for dynamism, innovation and progress?"
"I welcome the leadership of the Commission President to opt for the latter."
"That, President Barroso, is a political role and we specifically want you to act politically."
"I consider your position in the Portuguese elections to be very justifiable, and your absence would, moreover, have been construed as complete disloyalty to your Portuguese heritage."
"I find your involvement very valid and I only regret that it did not benefit your Party more."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I had the honour of participating in the meeting of the World Economic Forum as part of the Young Global Leaders programme."
"I know that you, Mr Barroso, were ‘Global Leader of Tomorrow’ at one time, and now several Members of the European Parliament are involved in this programme for the young."
"The Economic Forum was an excellent indication that world business wants to take responsibility for the global challenges facing us."
"On the opening day of the Forum, an interactive Global Town Hall discussion was held."
"This was a seminar in which 700 decision-makers at Davos set priorities for the world’s problems using Gallup polls, and discussed the challenges they presented."
"When we consider the age, sex, places of residence and range of occupations of the participants, the results are quite astonishing."
"What, for example, would we imagine that men between the ages of 40 and 60, mainly from the EU or North America, and half of whom are business executives, think are the greatest challenges posed by globalisation?"
"Would they be profitability in business, flexibility in employment, increased turnover, or the China phenomenon?"
"Not at all."
"The greatest challenges, as proposed by this group, were the elimination of poverty, the establishment of equitable globalisation and the management of climate change."
"Global responsibility has progressed a great deal when leading businessmen say that to eliminate poverty people have to go beyond their normal way of thinking, extend the benefits of globalisation to the poorest regions and create global leadership to combat climate change."
"It is also worth noting that there is genuine convergence between the views expressed in Europe and North America."
"Globalisation does not appear in the end to be the sort of divisive factor that the left-hand side of this Chamber believes it to be."
"These issues would be at the top of the agenda if the Friends of the Earth organised a similar meeting."
"The World Economic Forum has also proposed concrete action and a timetable to respond to the challenges."
"I am certain that there are also initiatives connected with the World Social Forum on which we have the same views."
"As the objectives are common to both, it would be more sensible to aspire to them together rather than separately."
"We give you in the Commission our full support in this."
"Mr President, Commission President, ladies and gentlemen, some of us were in Porto Alegre a few days ago, either as part of our national responsibilities or, in my opinion more importantly, as part of the World Parliamentary Forum."
"I would therefore firstly like to thank my fellow Members who were in Porto Alegre, and in particular my colleague Harlem Désir, for the work they have done over many years to enable Europe to take part in this large-scale civic meeting."
"Many commentators and participants shared the fear that this movement would run out of steam, but that has not been the case."
"The anti-globalisation movement has been able to redirect its activities and to define a new organisational method that has resulted in the World Social Forum being no longer just a platform for demands but also a platform for proposals."
"Moreover, the fact that the Davos Economic Forum discussed some of the subjects brought up in the world social forums proves that the questions asked there are ones that ask us all what sort of world we want."
"Neither the World Social Forum nor the World Economic Forum in Davos, however, is a political actor that can, on its own, turn demands into political decisions."
"That is why a body like the European Parliament is duty-bound to pass on and lend powerful support to a number of initiatives, such as cancelling the debt of poor countries, increasing and improving public development aid, instituting a global tax, reforming international trade rules, combating tax evasion and tax havens and defending public services."
"A number of Heads of State or Government have already taken initiatives, and other proposals will need to be put forward at the G8 summit."
"In this year, 2005, in which we will make an interim assessment of the implementation of the Millennium Objectives launched by the United Nations, these are all positive moves, provided they are not just more empty promises."
"That is why more than 100 organisations, NGOs, associations and trade unions will run a mobilisation and questioning campaign at global and European level this year."
"This campaign will speak out on the subjects of trade and poverty, in particular, and one of the first of its many initiatives will be a global action week for fairer trade next April."
"We already know that, at the rate things are going, the Millennium Goals will not be achieved."
"It is therefore down to us to keep the promises made by others a long time ago, by supporting these initiatives and this global anti-poverty campaign in order to emphasise and demonstrate our desire for a better distribution of wealth, in a democratic and peaceful world. Politicians have let people down in the past."
"They may well do so in the future, but under no circumstances must they abandon the idea that they themselves have to fight for a fairer world, and translate this idea into action."
". Mr President, I feel that this has been a very interesting debate on issues that are important to our common future."
"Your speeches, ladies and gentlemen, have confirmed the richness of the debate and have demonstrated the wide range of viewpoints on the subject of globalisation."
"At this stage, I should like to highlight a point that I believe was also aired during Mr Désir’s speech, concerning a degree of convergence that, despite everything, is becoming apparent – I mean regarding globalisation."
"At first it appeared that there were two extreme positions: one consisting of seeing only the negative side of globalisation and the other, initially expressed in Porto Alegre, something of an all-out rejection of globalisation."
"What we are seeing today – what is clearly visible – is that, at the Davos Forum, a certain effort at corporate social responsibility is being made and an increasingly strong emphasis is being placed on a programme for global government or governance. There is also an interest in taking on board some of the concerns expressed by so many non-governmental organisations and by so many protagonists of the movement that initially saw itself even as an anti-globalisation movement."
"Many of those people originally in the anti-globalisation movement quickly realised that globalisation was inevitable."
"Today’s globalisation is not the result of a decision made by any one country or group of countries, and nor is it a conspiracy on the part of a group of companies."
"Today’s globalisation has much more to do with the trends of international trade and, in particular, the technological revolution, which no government really controls."
"Consequently, instead of just protesting against globalisation, many of these actors and protagonists have chosen, rightly in my view, to seek an alternative form of globalisation, and to try to incorporate some of their concerns into globalisation."
"That is our position."
"I welcome this because I feel that we can learn from both Davos and Porto Alegre, although proposals have been made in both places that cannot be taken very seriously."
"There are lessons to be learnt, however, from both processes."
"With regard to Europe and the Commission, what can I tell you?"
"We must, I feel, work on practical issues, from both an internal and an external perspective."
"From an internal perspective, are we in favour of cohesion or not?"
"I am in favour of cohesion and the Commission is in favour of cohesion – economic, social and territorial – and I therefore appeal to you today, ladies and gentlemen, to help me and to help the Commission ensure that all EU governments are also in favour of cohesion and ready to offer their help with, for example, the financial perspective that we have been debating, because poverty does not only affect countries of the Southern Hemisphere, it also affects Europe."
"Europe now has greater disparities than ever before – and this is especially true of post-enlargement Europe."
"We need more advanced programmes in Europe to fight social exclusion."
"Accordingly, if we wish to conduct a coherent debate on the issue of cohesion, we must begin by seeking to implement cohesion – economic, social and territorial cohesion – here in Europe."
"This forms part of a fast-track approach that is vital for the Union."
"Then there is the external perspective: what can the Commission and the EU do on the external stage?"
"In this context, two areas that I think should not be seen as mutually incompatible or contradictory are those of international trade and development aid."
"Some remarks that I heard were against international trade on the grounds that international trade is, to some extent, the embodiment of the neoliberal model."
"Let me tell you once again that, in my conversations with the leaders of developing countries, the first request that almost all of them make is in the area of trade – they want greater access to the markets of more developed countries – and so we must also help these countries with regard to trade."
"It cannot therefore be said that trade and aid are irreconcilably incompatible."
"It is clear to me that we can and must do more for developing countries, in both of these areas."
"Yet we can also ask more of them, because when the EU and the EU Member States give considerable amounts of aid, as we do – worldwide, the EU is the biggest donor of development aid – we also have the right to demand good governance on the part of those countries and we want to know if the money given to them is being used properly and above board and if in fact the reforms aimed at better integrating those countries into international trade are being carried out."
"This is also a shared responsibility."
"Let me tell you that the Commission wants to go further."
"We want to make a more ambitious contribution towards achieving the Millennium Objectives."
"As things stand, it is clear that we are only limited by the resources available."
"We therefore intend to continue to work with the Member States and with Parliament in order to set a more ambitious agenda in the area of development aid, above all by placing Africa at the forefront of our priorities, because Africa has structural problems that other regions have, to some degree, already overcome, particularly because of their more successful integration into international trade."
"I should like to assure you that the Commission and I would like to see an attitude of greater decisiveness and greater commitment to the aims of a global world, a fairer global world in which the EU must play a leading role in encouraging more responsible governance of our planet’s resources and creating a fairer society on a global scale."
"These are our values, and we are ready to fight for them."
"I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate pursuant to Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"– (A6-0020/2005) by Antonio Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record [COM(2004)0664 – C6-0163/2004 – 2004/0238(CNS)];"
"– (A6-0036/2005) by António Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal law in the Member States [2005/2003(INI)]."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I should like to make some comments on both reports: the one tabled by Mr Costa and the one tabled by Mr Di Pietro."
"There are some important links between the two reports and the two initiatives."
"The first concerns the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal legislation; the second, tabled by Mr Di Pietro, concerns a proposal regarding the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record."
"It is my personal conviction, and one shared by the Commission as a whole, that the quality of justice is a fundamental element in the great project – now enshrined in the European Constitution – of creating a real European area of justice and freedom."
"It is obvious that the quality of justice is based on the principle whereby a Europe in which internal borders are disappearing has to ensure that the decisions made by its courts are, above all, enforced quickly and simply, because the response that people are awaiting depends on the credibility of the legal systems."
"That principle obviously presupposes another, that is to say the principle upheld by those working on ‘mutual recognition’: a decision by a judge in one Member State can and must be recognised by the legal system of another Member State."
"That is the essential condition for establishing a European area of justice."
"Implementing such a principle of mutual recognition, however, requires a high level of mutual trust: there can be no mutual recognition without mutual trust among the judiciaries, the courts and the legal systems of the Member States."
"That is why the programme that the Commission is committed to carrying out contains a specific reference – requested by the European Council, by the way – to the quality of justice, which means decisions being enforced quickly and smoothly and implies a high level of mutual trust among the legal systems and judiciaries."
"The rapporteur, Mr Costa, proposes creating a European mechanism for the evaluation of the quality of justice, a mechanism based on a Quality Charter for criminal justice."
"I think that is an interesting idea, since we know that in other, less sensitive areas, a mechanism for parallel evaluation and for monitoring the results of measures has worked and has helped to establish the principle of mutual trust."
"Thus the rapporteur’s proposal is an interesting one."
"Besides, the Commission believes that on such a sensitive subject, which touches on Member States’ competences, it is necessary to set up an extensive consultation exercise and, above all, to listen to those involved."
"The Commission is working hard and will continue to work hard on both aspects, first of all by listening to the categories involved, that is to say the judges, the associations and the bodies representing the judiciary in the Member States."
"By the end of 2005 we intend to issue a preliminary communication on judicial training – that is, the training of judges – and then, in 2006, a communication on the evaluation of the quality of justice."
"We therefore intend to work along the lines suggested in Mr Costa’s report."
"My final thought on this topic is that no mechanism for evaluating the quality of justice should bear upon or have a detrimental effect on the independence of the judiciary, either directly or indirectly."
"It would be a dreadful result if the principle of evaluating the quality of justice – which is a public service – should indirectly harm the independence of the judiciary, which is an essential requirement for providing the public with a quality service."
"A judiciary that is not independent certainly cannot be top quality."
"That, then, is why our aim will be to achieve high quality in justice while holding to the premise I have just mentioned: respect for the independence of our judicial systems and judiciaries."
"With regard to Mr Di Pietro’s report, mutual trust, as I have already said, is clearly an essential element in the quality of justice and is vital in making the mutual recognition of decisions and procedures work properly."
"It is clear, then, that the proposal for a decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record – a Commission proposal made last October – is a good example, in my opinion, of the real importance of applying the principle of mutual trust."
"You will all recall the Fourniret affair, the tragic case of paedophilia that was instrumental in making Europe respond more swiftly."
"That case showed how poorly the exchange of information between Member States on people’s criminal records was working."
"We need strong measures."
"I am convinced that the text currently being examined, to which Mr Di Pietro has referred and will refer again, is just a first step."
"It is an urgent first step, for the short term."
"Clearly, the next step that the Commission is considering is to have a faster, computerised system for exchanging information, which, of course, must fully comply with personal data protection rules."
"Parliament will obviously have further opportunities to give its views on this more advanced proposal in the near future."
"Clearly, in any case, we must now ensure that the register of criminal records in a person’s Member State of origin works as well as possible so that, when it receives a request for information, the register in that Member State of origin can supply all the necessary answers about the situation without delay."
"Better relations among the national authorities responsible for criminal records must therefore be established and, clearly, the Commission expects to achieve further improvements in the longer term."
"As you all know, we have adopted a White Paper which proposes a rather more effective information exchange mechanism."
"We will be listening to the responses to the questions raised in the White Paper."
"To conclude, the Commission will work closely with Parliament in permanent collaboration, because in exchanging information we have to find the right balance between the need for security, the need to protect people’s right to be safe, and people’s fundamental rights."
"In that respect I should like to refer once again to personal data protection, because such a balance will need to be debated very thoroughly here in Parliament."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am called upon to explain my report on the proposal for a Council decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record."
"This proposal – as Mr Frattini has rightly stated – constitutes just a first step, which needs to be taken urgently."
"The aim of this proposal for a decision will obviously be supported by everybody; the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – to which I have the honour of belonging – certainly supports it fully, as does the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which gave the Council proposal in question its almost unanimous approval."
"The aim is to improve the quality of justice in Italy, in Europe and in all the Member States."
"The tangible measure put forward in the proposal for a decision is to share the information contained in criminal records."
"In fact, such sharing was already provided for in the 1959 Convention."
"Technically, however, it is difficult to make such an exchange of information work and to keep it up to date, since at present, under the 1959 Convention, information is only networked once a year and requests are made without a pre-established time limit."
"The Council proposal thus has the benefit of making information available more promptly, until, of course, the computerised system that the Commissioner mentioned can provide the information even more quickly, virtually on line."
"I should like to clear up a misunderstanding on the part of those who see a problem in the relationship between data checking and privacy."
"Criminal record data are for criminals as medical records are for the sick: they are factual data."
"The problem is who uses such data and how they use them."
"To that end we ask that the data should only be used by judicial authorities and with other judicial authorities, and only in relation to unappealable convictions."
"That is why the Council was right to include the concepts of ‘criminal record’ and ‘unappealable conviction’ among the terms to be defined prior to such decisions."
"I therefore agree with this work in progress, which is to be put into effect while we await the decisions that will be coming in the White Paper, just as I also agree with the principles that you have just enumerated, Commissioner."
"You said that these decisions and, more generally, the recommendations that Parliament is preparing to make should depend on two principles, which I believe we can all subscribe to and which I certainly subscribe to, as you do."
"The first is that the decisions of the courts should be enforced quickly."
"The second principle – as you said – is that there should be mutual recognition of and mutual trust in the decisions made by courts in each individual country."
"Thirdly, you said that any evaluation of the quality of the work done by the courts must not affect the independence of the judiciary."
"I fully agree with that view, Commissioner, and I would therefore ask you to have the Commission move on to more concrete measures relating to such issues."
"In particular, as well as listening, I would ask you to state what you will do if a Member State shows that it has no confidence in the courts so that, for instance, there is a Member State which has not yet implemented the European arrest warrant."
"We therefore explicitly request that, when similar topics are debated, the Commission should put pressure on Member States that have not yet implemented them, otherwise it might be thought that those Member States have no confidence in the decisions of other courts and other Member States and that they do not intend to implement the courts’ decisions straight away at all."
"Similarly, we believe you are right to say that the independence of the judiciary must be respected, but we would also like to know what the Commission proposes to do when even members of the government in a particular Member State do not respect the judiciary and go so far as to make a mockery of it in the courts themselves."
"I believe, then, that the Commission also has the duty to issue directives and recommendations, so that the efforts we are making to improve the quality of justice in Europe and in the Member States are not derailed by a particular Member State for its own very special reasons."
". – Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, implementing the area of freedom, security and justice is one of the most stimulating challenges facing the EU, of which the most important element, as we proposed in the Hague Programme, is the need to ensure high quality justice throughout Union territory, without prejudice to the plurality of the existing judicial systems in the 25 Member States."
"In accordance with the Hague Programme, as is already the case with Tampere, the cornerstone in building the area of freedom, security and justice is mutual recognition, as Mr Frattini has just reminded us."
"In order for mutual recognition to exist, however, there must also be mutual trust, and, as Mr Di Pietro highlighted just now, mutual trust is not a matter of faith."
"Mutual trust must be built up and must work effectively."
"We must acknowledge that among our 25 Member States – among the judicial authorities of our 25 Member States – such mutual trust does not exist to a satisfactory degree."
"Mutual trust must be stepped up."
"I therefore begin this initiative report by proposing that there should be a mutual evaluation mechanism among the various Member States."
"Clearly, such a mechanism will respect the independence of judicial authority, and will involve the national parliaments and the judiciary’s governing bodies. Accordingly, our evaluation will be the result of a broad range of views on the quality of criminal justice in each of the Member States."
"Secondly, I feel that it is crucial that this evaluation should be an objective evaluation, and in order for this to be the case I propose that a Quality Charter for Criminal Justice should be created."
"The Charter should be created on the basis of the interpretation of the right to a judge in the European Declaration of Human Rights, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Communities, and on the basis of both United Nations and Council of Europe recommendations."
"This Quality Charter must act as an objective reference framework enabling evaluation of the different criminal justice systems in the different Member States. In this way, we can spread best practice, we can have benchmarking exercises and we can ensure that all European citizens, wherever they may be in EU territory, enjoy high standards of quality."
"We are all aware, however, that in addition to mutual recognition, there must also be a minimum level of harmonisation."
"The Council has set out the criterion for the harmonisation of material criminal law, and our report proposes that we endorse the Council’s proposal."
"The Council has called on the Commission to prepare for harmonisation of the list of offences referred to in the Constitutional Treaty at the earliest opportunity, so that by the time the Constitutional Treaty enters into force the preparatory work will have been completed and the Council can quickly, in conjunction with Parliament, adopt the harmonisation standards called for in the new Treaty."
"With regard to procedural law, we feel that we must be selective, yet ambitious as to the scope of our action."
"We therefore propose four key areas: firstly, the harmonisation of standards relating to the gathering and assessment of key evidence, an issue that the Commission has said it is already working on; secondly, harmonisation enabling sentences to be served, and ensuring that any preventative measures applied are executed; thirdly, the minimum rights of detainees in any Member State; and, finally, the consideration of further conviction in respect of acts already subject to harmonisation measures."
"With this report Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission to speed up their work so that all of us, working together, can make a contribution to an area of freedom, security and justice with higher quality criminal justice in Europe."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"In the political documents of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for example the documents from the congress and other documents of our party in the European Parliament, we stress the importance of the security of people and their property; after all, we promised this to our electorate."
"On the other hand we are faced with a growth in increasingly serious forms of crime and terrorist acts."
"It is entirely clear that no individual Member State of the European Union can alone ensure its own security any longer."
"We need cooperation and joint action, and we need to seek out and promote all those activities that enhance our security."
"In this sense my group supports the proposed Council decision on the exchange of data generated from criminal records, as well as the report of rapporteur Mr di Pietro."
"We are somewhat surprised, however, that the Commission only intends to establish a new computer system for data exchange between 2008 and 2010."
"I have the feeling that the exchange of data is more a political than a technical question, for if serious political will exists, then the Commission should speed up the construction of an adequate information technology system, since it is clear to anyone that we are in the information age and that construction of an adequate information technology system cannot be such a complicated issue."
"Obviously this is being impeded by some other, weightier issues, such as trust or the quality of individual branches of power."
"In this regard I propose to the Commission that it does indeed speed up the construction of the information technology system."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the main concern of European citizens is that the European Union should guarantee them a high standard of living and protect their rights."
"We must therefore ensure that all European citizens benefit from the same rights, the same quality of justice and the same access to justice, wherever they are in Europe."
"In this context, it is vital to improve judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters."
"In addition, freedom of movement in Europe enables criminal networks to profit from the opening up of the European Union's internal borders while at the same time exploiting the lack of European coordination with regard to justice and thus evading capture."
"We must therefore now adopt the necessary mechanisms to meet the new challenges now facing European judicial cooperation."
"The exchange of information extracted from the criminal record provides European magistrates with specific mechanisms making it possible to speed up proceedings so that criminals do not go unpunished."
"For example, it will be possible, as you say, to put an end to known cases of paedophilia more quickly."
"Such mechanisms and practical measures must be put in place in order to improve mutual trust in Europe's judicial systems, which is an absolute necessity."
"This is because the current lack of trust constitutes a major barrier to achieving mutual recognition of current practices and to reaching an appropriate level of approximation of judicial systems."
"I also join with António Costa in calling on the Commission to put forward proposals based on the principles of mutual recognition of decisions and of minimum harmonisation."
"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my pleasure at the proposal to extend judicial cooperation to certain aspects of family law, which is included in the legislative programme for 2005."
"I very much hope that we will continue working along these lines."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Costa, on his report and on the excellent conclusions that he set out, which, by the way, have been approved almost unanimously by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"In my opinion, this report sends a strong signal from Parliament to the Commission and the Council."
"It bears witness to our desire to ensure a higher quality of justice for all European citizens, I would even say for anyone within the territory of the European Union, thanks in particular to the Quality Charter for criminal justice and to the proposed evaluation system."
"Mutual recognition of decisions taken in criminal matters in the various Member States assumes that all the States have confidence in each other’s judicial systems."
"That is why we need to define common basic standards that are better harmonised whilst maintaining justified diversity, as Mr Costa has reiterated."
"This is more than just procedure, however."
"Ensuring and checking that judges are properly trained, open-minded, level-headed, alert, efficient, conscientious and able to manage the existing means as well as possible clearly does not run counter to the essential independence they must have."
"We need to increase the transparency of the justice system and improve people’s perception of the working methods of judges, who sometimes suffer from a lack of credibility and trust."
"Finally, I believe it is essential for us to ensure that our recommendations are followed up."
"We need action, not just intentions, Commissioner."
"That is why it is important to set up a follow-up committee made up of experts, magistrates, lawyers, users of the justice system and representatives of national parliaments with the task of assessing and evaluating the way in which our recommendations are put into effect."
"If we manage to implement these recommendations, we shall genuinely succeed in making the European Union a State under the rule of law."
"These are issues that are essential to the functioning of our democracies, respect for the law and respect for citizens' rights."
"With regard to Mr Di Pietro's excellent report, I completely agree with the analysis and proposals that it contains, but I would like to stress the fact that the proposal put forward is modest, is limited to the current legal framework, which dates back to 1959, and therefore does not meet the need for the provision of information regarding criminal records."
"I think there was a desire to respond to the emotions aroused by the Fourniret case."
"We will wait impatiently, as Mr Frattini announced, for more general proposals, which are essential if we are to combat terrorism, serious crime and crime in general more effectively."
"The small step we have taken does not release us from moving rapidly on."
"Mr President, this evening, we are once again discussing the magic word ‘mutual recognition’ as the cornerstone of European judicial cooperation."
"It does, of course, presuppose that the Member States work together effectively, that they can look beyond their own borders and know how things are done elsewhere, that they are also agreed on a number of basic standards, for example in terms of law of criminal procedure and, above all, build on the trust in each other and on the reasons why they can indeed trust in each other."
"Mr Costa’s proposal is of particular importance for building confidence in efficiency and sound administration of justice, whereas the main thrust of Mr Di Pietro’s report is to improve cooperation in terms of information."
"My group gives its wholehearted support to both reports and I would like to thank you warmly for all the work you have done on these and the pleasant cooperation, but much more is needed than these small steps forward."
"There is a host of new proposals in the making, and they all constitute small steps forward, on paper anyway, for in my experience, Member States very often put the brakes on."
"To them, the idea of mutual recognition mainly appears to be a way of not having to change anything at national level."
"We all tend to be interested only in our own patch, and others have to respect the decisions that are made about it."
"I can tell you that my group is not afraid of looking further afield, although we are a little hesitant about this enormous host of new rules, for such quantities often affect transparency, the defences of people who are forever being faced with changes, and also the clarity of what we are doing here."
"I can say that my group is in favour of a European Public Prosecutor’s office; we are in favour of a European criminal code, of Europe-wide rights for suspects and for victims, of the sharing of information and, above all, in favour of a hefty investment in the in-depth training of all police and judicial officers in European cooperation."
"The fact is that, ultimately, it is on the workfloor, rather than here, that this will need to be put into practice."
"I hope that we can all join forces in a major effort, including a financial injection, in order to ensure that everyone is well-informed about this."
"Mr President, both reports are expressions of the well-known ambition to extend the power of the EU institutions at the expense both of the Member States and ultimately, therefore, of democracy"
"Of Mr Di Pietro’s report, I can only say that it concerns a matter belonging within the remit of the Council of Europe and not of the EU."
"Mr Costa’s report is full of fine-sounding idealism, but the ideals and the good intentions suffer from the unfortunate defect of generally lacking a basis in reality."
"I would first of all point to the fact that, in a number of Member States, criminal procedure and the prison systems contain numerous gross infringements of fundamental human rights."
"Should not reality be cultivated over and above airy ideals?"
"The report’s single ambition is to cultivate mutual trust in the principle of mutual recognition of the other Member States’ legal decisions."
"Yes, but what if the Polish, Greek or Italian judge, counsel for the prosecution or prison authority does not deserve to be trusted?"
"What matters is surely what happens in reality."
"The report’s second objective is to force the Member States to punish specific acts, as per Article 271 of the Constitution."
"If reality had had a role to play and if the criminologists had been asked, a clear answer would have been received."
"What we have here is, at worst, barbarism and, at best, arbitrariness."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have talked about the quality of justice and we have examined the report, which seems to be based on an attempt to bring forward the Treaty provisions, particularly Article III-271 on the assessment of particularly serious criminal acts, such as those connected with terrorism."
"It is fair to ask, then, whether we are not pushing ahead too far with this rather optimistic vision of the quality of justice and mutual recognition of judiciaries."
"Indeed, precisely on the sensitive subject of terrorism, some very serious things are happening, such as decision number 2849104 by the judge for pre-trial hearings in Milan, Dr Forleo, on the subject of terrorism."
"The decision, concerning the activities of some people charged with terrorism (whose names were placed on both the United Nations and the European Union lists), makes a strange distinction, invented by the judge herself, between terrorists and guerrillas."
"The judge in question specifically writes that ‘violent or guerrilla activities, even if carried out by armed forces other than regular forces, cannot be prosecuted even under international law, provided there is no breach of international humanitarian law’."
"We are faced with Community laws on terrorism that have been stripped of meaning."
"We are faced with the betrayal of the civilised stand against terrorism adopted by Europe – including in this Chamber."
"It is a very serious matter, and I feel it is my duty to condemn it."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when debates on accession to the European Union were held in the new Member States, including my country, Poland, the key arguments we put forward related not only to economic growth and national security, but also to personal security."
"This issue is all the more important because crime is rising throughout Europe, unfortunately also in the new Member States, and radical measures must be taken to stem this constant rise."
"A great many new types of crime have appeared, for example the well-publicised problem of Internet crime, and all these developments mean that new regulations are required."
"They also mean that there is a need for harmonisation, and this is why we welcome both Mr Di Pietro’s report on the exchange of information from the criminal register and Mr Costa’s report on the quality of criminal justice in the European Union."
"It should not be forgotten, however, that the harmonisation of criminal law, or indeed of any other kind of law, must not merely mean that everyone is brought down to the same level, or that differences are eradicated to the detriment of national traditions, customs and needs."
"The latter are the basis upon which national legislation has been established, and if harmonisation were to take place in too mechanical a fashion, local traditions could be harmed."
"Most importantly, countries should not have to bring their legislation into line with laws and customs in other countries where criminals are treated with particular care, where they are gradually transformed into victims while the victims are forgotten, and where criminals can in fact expect greater protection than victims."
"This relates in particular to the issue of whether detainees should be granted the right to be seen by a psychiatrist, who would have the task of immediately assessing the detainee’s behaviour, and potentially absolving him or her of guilt."
"It may well be appropriate for this to happen at a later stage in the judicial procedure, but it need not occur at the very beginning."
"It must not result in criminals enjoying greater rights than victims, even though this is something that is unfortunately becoming increasingly common in modern legislation and judicial practice."
"It is unacceptable for the victim to be viewed as already having irrevocably become a victim, while at the same time the criminal is considered to be some sort of new victim who must be rescued, as this is quite simply untrue."
"The criminal should always remain a criminal and the victim a victim."
"The exchange of information from the criminal register is another issue worth considering."
"It should not be forgotten that the lengths of time after which criminal convictions are deemed spent vary between the different Member States, and steps should be taken to avoid situations in which someone is regarded as having a criminal conviction in one Member State, although this is no longer the case in another Member State."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"I have finished, and there is no need for you to use your gavel."
"Mr President, in the explanatory note to its proposal, the Commission states that recent tragic paedophile cases have brought to light major dysfunctions in the exchange of information about convictions among the Member States."
"Commissioner Frattini mentioned the Fourniret case a moment ago."
"A French paedophile, having been convicted in his own country, was able to go about his business undisturbed in Belgium, because the French authorities had not thought it necessary to provide the relevant authorities with information about him."
"The proposal that is now being debated is far too long in coming."
"It is, after all, a supplement to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which dates back to 1959."
"Moreover, the proposal is inadequate and does not offer an answer to a large number of problems."
"The Member States must update their criminal records and make them available more quickly."
"They must also provide information requested by other Member States more promptly and use standard forms to do it."
"Those are a few steps in the right direction, but this is all, of course, in anticipation of the introduction of a fully-fledged, automated system of data exchange."
"The Commission must set about this at the earliest opportunity, certainly when it claims that the system will not be in place for another few years – itself a bad omen."
"There are, of course, a huge number of legal implications, and these will need to be discussed at length."
"Once this House has voted on the present proposal, we must certainly not create the impression that the problems relating to the exchange of information have been resolved."
"The Commission has used an apt example to illustrate that this is clearly not the case."
"Member States are not required to inform the state where convicts live when that is not the state of their nationality."
"In other words, these measures will enable Fourniret, whom I have already mentioned, to slip through the net once again."
"Mr President, both the Tampere Programme, and later the Hague Programme, identified the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases as one of the European Union’s goals in the field of criminal law."
"Effective judicial cooperation based on mutual trust is required to achieve this goal, as a lack of such cooperation can mean that criminals hide in other countries in order to evade responsibility for their crimes."
"This in turn leads to a rise in feelings of impunity, which results in increased crime levels in Europe."
"It is for this reason that my political group welcomes the Costa report, which contains recommendations to the European Commission relating to the establishment of a quality charter for criminal justice, as the fundamental rights granted to defendants, victims and barristers by the proposed charter may at the same time be used as criteria for a mutual assessment of the quality of justice."
"Although a specific legal basis for such an assessment will not be provided until the Constitutional Treaty is in force, I believe that a general legal basis can already be found in the Treaty of Maastricht."
"In my opinion, it would therefore be a good idea for the European Commission to comply with the report’s recommendations by starting to develop the criteria and methods to be used in carrying out such assessments."
"This task will be complicated somewhat by the fact that allowance must be made for the varying legal systems which are in place in the different Member States and which are based on different legal traditions and cultures, as well as for the different judicial systems."
"The methods for carrying out such assessments should also ensure that credible conclusions are reached based on reliable analyses."
"It is worth noting that mutual assessments of justice should also be backed up by other measures, such as those that ensure the independence of the judiciary from political influence is not only respected, but also enhanced."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President, criminal justice in Europe needs to be independent but not beyond evaluation and beyond examination. European citizens need to have confidence in the criminal justice system, they need to be confident that their fundamental rights will be respected, they need to be confident that transparency and quality will be present in any court in the European Union."
"We recently had a very bad experience in Greece: the discovery of bribery and corruption in the judicial system."
"It is a discovery which has severely shaken the confidence of Greek citizens in their judicial system."
"Although the Greek judicial system is now putting its house in order, that is not enough."
"As other countries in Europe which have faced similar corruption in their judicial system know, this is very, very difficult."
"We are therefore being called upon to bring in European support."
"How can Europe provide support?"
"By evaluating special procedures and best practices."
"And where does the problem lie?"
"Anyone who contests the importance of evaluation is being conniving."
"Even if a Member State believes that its criminal justice system is so exceptional that it has nothing to learn from the others, it should at least help the others to learn from it and, as judges themselves are involved in the quality map, there is no problem about their independence with this proposal."
"Thank you."
"In view of the extensive range of the provisions in the Constitutional Treaty for Europe regarding the convergence of national legislations in the area of criminal, material and procedural law, we may conclude that the plan for a single criminal law area is taking on an increasingly clear outline."
"Setting it down in the Constitutional Treaty is the result of legislative development since 1990, and not its beginning, and it relies in particular on the principle of mutual trust."
"In view of the different constitutional orders and criminal law traditions, this trust must be based on specific, comparable, minimum criteria."
"We support this orientation, but parliamentarians also have a duty to monitor closely the methods of unifying legislations, especially in terms of the urgent need to strengthen the protection of basic human rights."
"If we were not attentive to the balance between these two elements, criminal law would be effectively unified, but it would not necessarily be democratically legitimised."
"Criminal law is also an identity card for the quality of democracy."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I have no difficulty with the sensible exchange of information about criminal convictions between Member States, but only the politically blind could fail to recognise the proposals in the Costa report as part of the harmonisation process that is under way in the criminal justice system across Europe."
"That, of course, is in anticipation of the EU Constitution, within which that harmonisation has a key role to play."
"I for one am opposed to a criminal justice system established on the continental model, with its inherent assault upon the essential building blocks of our distinctive and historic British common law system, which include not least trial by jury, habeas corpus, and the separation of the judiciary from the investigative process."
"This Costa report, despite its plausible verbiage, is part of that process of harmonisation aimed at creating a single criminal justice system."
"That is not serving the interests of the British nation in my view and therefore I will oppose that report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sometimes the case that the Commission, the Council or Parliament – or two of these institutions, or all three of them – are too many steps ahead of the public or a particular group; in such cases we act with too much haste and too much ambition, and are then forced to carry the weary upon our shoulders."
"The issue we are debating tonight is one for which we all bear responsibility, because what is of vital importance is the results we achieve – or rather, those we do not achieve."
"Commissioner, it is not merely that we are struggling to keep up with the real nature of crime today, given that for many years now organised crime has no longer been the only kind of crime that crosses borders; we are also struggling to keep up with individual crime."
"In both cases we are also struggling to give the public what it wants."
"The public has a right, and indeed the political will, to ensure that twenty-first century crime is not fought with nineteenth century methods."
"Unfortunately, the impression is sometimes given that information is requested and delivered by telegram, and it therefore needs to flow better."
"Despite the numerous fears that have been expressed, this would not mean any reduction in the level of data protection; after all, information relating to certain types of specialised crime committed in Kehl is just as important in Offenburg as in Strasbourg."
"Our priority in exchanging of information of this kind is the public’s right to protection, and not the criminal's right to privacy."
"Nor is the issue at stake here that of trust between Member States; it is quite simply a matter of whether the public trusts Europe, and the extent to which it trusts us to do a good job of handling this issue."
"If there is a conclusion to be drawn from all of this, then it is that we are actually asking – as a leading German newspaper has done – whether the public wants a single criminal code, and the answer to that question is ‘yes’."
"The conclusion that should be drawn from this report is that everyone should state clearly whether they want genuine improvements to be made or not, and that in any case software problems should not be used as a smokescreen."
"– Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I do not wish to add anything to the reports by Mr Di Pietro and Mr Costa, with which I am in absolute agreement."
"I should like, instead, to reflect on a contradiction that we are being called upon to face this evening."
"Everyone knows that only a strengthening of judicial cooperation can make a significant contribution to the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and that implies mutual recognition of judicial decisions, exchange of information and harmonisation of guarantees relating to legal procedure."
"We also know, however, that many Member States do all they can to hinder such judicial cooperation in every way."
"Your mandate, therefore, in our opinion, also consists in standing up to the Council and making sure that all the European institutions firmly adhere to that objective."
"Greater political will is needed to enable us to carry out what the European Constitution provides for and prescribes, which we do not want to remain unfulfilled."
"Precisely for the sake of consultation and judicial cooperation, Mr Frattini, we urge you to intervene respectfully but firmly with the Italian Parliament and the Italian Government, partly because you used to be a minister in that government yourself."
"Italy is the only country not to have implemented the European arrest warrant."
"Something that might have been just serious until yesterday is, you will agree, an absolute paradox today."
"Mr President, this debate is about confidence and trust."
"In every Member State, every prison and every detention centre, there are nonetheless people who feel they were given unfair trials due to the fact that they did not know the language, that the evidence was not evaluated correctly or that they were brutally treated by the police or while they were in custody."
"This is in spite of the fact that we have rules in place in Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and, above all perhaps, in rules forming part of Community law within the EU."
"If people are to dare to make use of the four freedoms, we must also have rules governing the security not only of goods and capital but also of individuals."
"For people to be able to assert their rights, current rules require national legal remedies to have been exhausted."
"A court can request an advisory opinion during a trial, but an individual cannot."
"We must, then, introduce the opportunity for individuals to request personal enquiries or special representatives so that they are given the same rights as courts."
"Only then shall we be able to talk about confidence and trust."
"– Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, there is work for us to do together if we are to improve the standards of quality and efficiency of justice. We must be mindful that the cornerstone of our European themes is the independence of the judicial system and the protection of citizens’ fundamental rights, at both substantial and procedural level."
"In case there is any doubt – and I am happy to say this again – I wish to compliment Mr Costa on his excellent report, which states that European citizens must be guaranteed the right to justice, both by the Union, whereby they are guaranteed comparable treatment, regardless of the Member State in which they happen to be, and by the Member States, depending on their respective powers, whilst ensuring that the differences between the various judicial systems do not stand in the way of attaining high quality justice and protection in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I agree with the rapporteur that mutual trust must be strengthened in order that there can be mutual recognition of judicial decisions, thereby contributing towards the gradual development of a European judicial culture."
"I endorse the idea of adopting a European Criminal Justice Charter, which would be the basis for evaluating how well the judicial systems in the Union work. I also support the idea of setting up an objective and impartial system for mutually evaluating the quality of justice, based on comparable statistical data, which should be put into practice at the earliest opportunity and should involve both the European Parliament and national parliaments."
"I should also like to commend Mr Di Pietro for his work and for the proposals that he is putting forward on the reduction of time-limits and the conditions for access to personal data."
"In other words, the current system of exchanging criminal record information is not effective."
"It is essential that a computerised system be created for Member States to exchange information, offering quick access to this kind of information throughout EU territory, and I welcome Mr Frattini’s new ideas on the subject."
"Mr President, this is an important report because it emphasises two key areas which have not been emphasised enough previously."
"Mr António Costa has taken an important step forward in signalling that it is the quality of justice, and not just mutual recognition, which is key."
"If anyone in this House doubts this issue, they should look at the 'Copenhagen criteria'."
"The quality of justice in many of the accession states and the need for improvements was an essential part of joining the European Union."
"Nor should any of the existing 15 Member States be complacent that they have all the right answers and the highest quality of justice."
"Look at how we deal with minorities and vulnerable people."
"That is where this issue will be tested."
"The Quality Charter for Criminal Justice in Europe should not be something that Member States fear."
"They should welcome it, because this is one of the most visible areas of cooperation in the European Union that our citizens recognise."
"They see it in the media, they want to see solutions at a European level, they want to feel safe in a European Union which delivers swift justice and protection for the innocent."
"– Mr President, I shall confine myself to a few thoughts on Mr Di Pietro's report, which I fully support."
"The rapporteur's report contains positive elements because, on the one hand, it specifies the dates and, on the other hand, it highlights the need to speed up procedure, in the event of urgent cases, to 48 hours."
"However, the Commissioner's attention should be drawn to the fact that the issues addressed in the reports by both Mr Di Pietro and Mr Costa may be a step in the right direction but they cannot be seen as a daring step."
"I believe, for example, that the application of the principle of mutual recognition in the field of criminal convictions must be an immediate priority."
"Also, the terms 'conviction' and 'criminal record' need to be clearly defined and the terms 'offence' and 'punishment' need to be harmonized."
"I truly believe that the integration of the European Union cannot come about if we do not proceed rapidly to unify rules relating to justice."
"However, the Commissioner's intervention today did not convince me that the Commission will proceed at such a rapid pace in this direction and that is a pity."
"Mr President, the common legal area is based upon mutual recognition."
"In recognising each other’s judgments, we must be able to rely upon the quality of the legal systems, rely upon equal treatment, rely upon effective due process and rely upon fair trials with counsel and, if need be, interpretation."
"Let us compete on an upward trajectory where legal quality is concerned."
"Thank you, Mr Costa, for a constructive report."
"I turn now to the exchange of information, which is a more sensitive area."
"Mr Di Pietro has improved the proposal, but I should like to emphasise three points."
"Firstly, data protection will have to be of the same quality within the sphere of combating crime as it is within the internal market before data is exchanged."
"Secondly, the European Data Protection Supervisor must express his or her opinions on sensitive issues."
"Thirdly: in addition to the Member States’ being informed of how the information is used, the individual too must be told what information has been given out."
"We have been given a Commissioner who, I know, listens and who understands these issues."
"I hope that Commissioner Frattini will include these three elements in the future when it comes to increasing data protection in order to ensure that we obtain the same quality of data protection in the sphere of combating crime as we already have in the internal market."
"In this connection, I really pin a lot of hope on Commissioner Frattini’s further efforts. I wish to thank him for the efforts he has already made in the area of data storage and believe that these will also bear fruit in the area of data exchange."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal legislation is a core theme in the EU’s global justice project."
"Criminal justice is the most hotly debated area of human rights – its reciprocal nature, its conflicts and the fact that it is based on a principle of essential dignity."
"The criminal justice issue therefore goes to the moral core of European political culture. It is therefore of pressing importance that we pursue an active policy aimed at enhancing the quality of criminal justice and at harmonising Member State legislation."
"The emergence of a European Constitution, which incorporates a binding Charter of Fundamental Rights and constitutes a system of values characterised by unity and integration, demands higher quality justice and the harmonisation of criminal legislation."
"Criminal law is in fact material constitutional law and synthesises all fundamental constitutional values."
"The absence of harmonisation in this area will imply non-compliance with the principle of equality among citizens, and, by extension, non-compliance with the Constitution."
"The harmonisation of the criminal justice system must not therefore be done half-heartedly, nor must it be merely the basis for mutual recognition of judicial decisions; it should be an end in itself."
"A concerted policy, by virtue of the very fact that it is a concerted policy, does not jeopardise the Member States’ decision-making powers in this area."
"The European Constitution’s system of values also implies that the harmonisation of legislation must cut across the entire criminal justice system."
"It should not solely consider the main strands of the process and the serving of sentences, but should be extended to cover the substantive rules, the politics of defining offences and to the criteria for setting sentences."
"Security should not be the sole concern; we should also be concerned with humanising criminal justice."
"If Europe does not embrace this scheme, its Constitution’s justice system will be, to quote Kafka’s satirical metaphor, a system of open doors through which nobody can enter."
". – Mr President, I am grateful to the rapporteurs and the Members who have spoken, even for calling on the Commission to act and to act quickly."
"I shall try to give not exhaustive answers – clearly I will not have time for that – but some information that may be useful to Parliament."
"By the end of April, the Commission will present a communication on mutual recognition and the development of the principle of mutual trust."
"This communication will include and touch on most of the issues covered by the two reports that we are examining today, and will deal with the evaluation of justice, training for judges and the harmonisation of a number of procedural rules."
"In that respect, I would also add that by the end of the year we will be putting out a Green Paper on the presumption of innocence: many Members of this Parliament have highlighted the need to reconcile the right to safety, and hence the right to have crime brought under control, with legal guarantees for the accused."
"In early 2006 we will be publishing a second Green Paper dealing with the gathering of evidence, which will certainly be followed by more complete initiatives on the implementation of alternative sentences as well as an interesting – and, I hope, extremely useful – initiative: a framework decision, which we expect to draw up during 2005, on alternative control measures to temporary custody."
"You are aware that the subject of temporary custody, or detention prior to conviction, is one in which people’s rights to freedom have to be weighed against the state’s right to prosecute criminals."
"These, then, are just a few examples of initiatives – but ones I believe to be important – which the Commission will be putting forward over the coming months."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will be happy if the Member States in the Council are as bold as you have been today regarding the exchange of information on criminal records."
"The Commission would certainly like to move faster on the computerised information exchange system."
"We started a debate last month at the Luxembourg Council of Ministers and we intend to continue it."
"There are technical problems, however, as well as the political ones which someone pointed out."
"We still lack that degree of mutual trust that we need to allow data on past convictions to be entered into an electronic search engine, which in technical terms could be set up very quickly."
"As Mr Di Pietro rightly said, it is not a question of new data but of data on convictions, which can be used by judges."
"We will therefore be very careful to prevent any use of such data that falls outside the rationale given by the judicial authority – which we obviously have to trust – when it asks to see the information."
"To conclude, I believe that this subject needs a more united Europe."
"It needs a more united Europe because we have to harmonise our criminal justice systems, which are unfortunately highly diverse, and we have to be sure of the legal positions when – and let us emphasise this – we respect the independence of the judiciary."
"Perhaps we should worry about harmonising the rules: the rules about what a criminal association is and how and why the head of a criminal organisation can be punished vary too much from one country to another."
"That, then, is what we should worry about: harmonising the criminal law systems a little more."
"In the end, we will carefully monitor how well the Member States adhere to these principles."
"In three days’ time, I will be presenting the Commission communication on the European arrest warrant to the Council meeting of Justice Ministers, and I will take the opportunity to say quite clearly that unfortunately – and much to my regret – Italy is the only country in Europe that has not yet adopted the necessary national legislation, and that there are also a few countries that have adopted national legislation but, as one of you pointed out, have tried to reintroduce filters that are not in keeping with the European spirit."
"The arrest warrant legislation serves to speed up the implementation of certain procedures; if we want to speed it up in the case of terrorism and organised crime, all Member States must have confidence in the system, and we will keep a watchful eye open to ensure that Europe’s rules are fully observed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mr Jonathan Evans (A6-24/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission’s XXXIIIrd Report on Competition Policy – 2003 (2004/2139(INI))."
". Mr President, it might seem a little incongruous that we are today, at the beginning of 2005, discussing the European Commission's Report on Competition Policy for 2003."
"That is just because last year was election year, the debate as such is about very much wider issues."
"It is an opportunity for Parliament to place on record, as we should, our enormous respect for the outgoing Commissioner, Mario Monti, who was the Competition Commissioner at the time of this report."
"It is inevitable that the report itself and Parliament's response draws upon the major programme for the reorganisation of competition policy for which Mr Monti has received so much praise."
"This is a debate that had to take place with industry, and not just in relation to the modernisation of the anti-trust rules themselves."
"Industry had to recognise the purpose of this reform."
"The aim was to do away with a system that was in itself unnecessarily bureaucratic so as to redirect the resources of the Commission to cracking down properly on hard-core cartels."
"In addition, we have seen the reform of the Merger Regulation, reorganisation of the merger control task force and the first steps in relation to state-aid reform."
"I know our new Commissioner also shares this view in relation to the legacy of Mr Monti, because only recently she has been speaking at Bocconi University and making very similar remarks about Mr Monti's contribution."
"It is also inevitable that we would direct our attention not just to this programme of work and the lessons to be learned from it, but also to the way in which that programme of work now affects efforts to improve Europe's competitiveness."
"We are not trying to change the rules about competition policy for the sake of it or as a form of bureaucratic exercise."
"The purpose here is to act in the interests of consumers to increase Europe's competitiveness and develop growth and jobs."
"That is what the operation of an effective competition policy is all about."
"I want to say a word about the new Commissioner and I hope it does not embarrass her."
"Many people have asked me my opinion about the change we will have now."
"I suppose up to four weeks ago we were all asking that, to some extent."
"The Commissioner has been very active in the course of the last month."
"On 3 February she spoke to Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and set on record her agenda in this role."
"I have already referred to her speech in Milan at Mario Monti's university, and on 17 February Mrs Kroes made another speech in Paris."
"Taken together, these speeches clearly set out the progressive agenda that the European Commission intends to take forward."
"I commend the Commission for being determined to clarify the rules in relation to state-aid reform."
"In our report we refer to this as an area where we are seeking further action on the part of the Commission."
"This does not mean a situation in which the Commission just sits idly by waiting to see whether somebody is going to make a complaint about uncompetitive behaviour in some part of the economy."
"We want to ensure that the whole way in which business operates within Europe is one that encourages free and fair competition and consequently enhances the competitiveness of Europe."
"Finally, a further area for which Mr Monti deserves special praise is his work in relation to international cooperation."
"We can cooperate even when we are being competitive."
"I well remember the reaction of some people in America a few years ago to the GE-Honeywell decision that was taken by Mr Monti."
"Today I had the honour of being present to hear President Bush's speech and afterwards seeing him shake the hand of Alex Schaub, the Director-General of Competition at the time that decision was made."
"That is an example of international cooperation."
"I commend the outgoing Commissioner and I look forward to the tenure of the incoming Commissioner, Commissioner Kroes."
". Mr President, it is a great pleasure to be here for my first debate with you in plenary, and the subject could not have been better chosen."
"It is no coincidence that today's agenda started with the Commission working paper."
"The President of the Commission underlined how important the work programme is for this term of the Commission."
"Mr Frattini took the lead by explaining the priority we attach to criminal matters and justice."
"And now it is for me as Competition Commissioner to explain our position on what is in Mr Jonathan Evans' report."
"I welcome the support of the European Parliament, and I acknowledge the support you have given in the past to the European Commission, and especially to Mr Monti, as you rightly emphasise."
"There is no doubt that I have inherited a great legacy from Mr Monti."
"The greatest tribute I can pay him is to continue his work and build on it."
"Under the leadership of President Barroso, the European Commission has recently proposed a new partnership for growth and jobs."
"Competition policy, as Mr Evans rightly mentioned, has a crucial role to play here."
"Competition is the central driving-force for competitiveness and growth, and we badly need that growth."
"That was clearly stated this afternoon by speakers from both right and left."
"If we are to deliver on the fundamental social and environmental objectives which are at the heart of our European values, then economic growth is a must."
"There are three ways competition policy can contribute to partnership."
"Firstly, later this spring we will launch a debate on reviewing the state aid rules within the overall objective of 'less and better', which here means better focused aid."
"Aid should be concentrated where it can add most value: for innovation, research and development, risk capital and the development of those regions lagging furthest behind."
"Secondly, we will maintain a fair and firm approach to enforcement and will remain tough on cartels."
"There is no doubt about that."
"That was also Mr Monti's approach."
"As the report highlights, it is not acceptable to let the global advantages of the single market be undermined by cartels and other unfair business practices among a handful of undertakings."
"Thirdly, we will look at new ways of promoting competition in the internal market, by using sector investigations and competition screening to uncover and tackle the remaining, often hidden, regulatory and private barriers to free competition."
"In taking these priorities forward, I will take account of the helpful observations presented in the report before us."
"I can assure you of my commitment to ensuring an ongoing and constructive dialogue on competition issues with this House."
"Mr President, first of all, might I be permitted to express my appreciation of Mr Evans’s reports and its conclusions?"
"I also wish to express my appreciation of Mrs Kroes’s contribution and emphasise that I am among those who look forward with high hopes to possible further contributions of hers."
"I believe we have to be aware of the fact that what, right now, is the driving force in the European Union and in the work on developing and modernising our society is competition."
"We have the pressure of external competition resulting from globalisation and that of internal competition, reinforced by enlargement and the internal market."
"Such competition releases considerable dynamism and energy into European society, and not only where development, growth and new jobs are concerned."
"I also believe that it is in practice the most powerful tool for European integration when it comes to the spread of ideas, goods and services across borders."
"That is what is happening right now, and I believe there is a danger of our underestimating it."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner to try also to include this dimension of the effects of competition in future competition reports."
"It is not only a matter of economics, but also of European cooperation in its most practical sense."
"I believe we have the task of extending the basic conditions of competition to new areas."
"What is at issue here is the knowledge-based society, involving research, education and health care."
"As Mr Evans points out in his report, it is also a question of energy and telecommunications markets."
"I should also like to draw the Commissioner’s attention to that part of the report that deals with the importance of also creating sound conditions for European manufacturers to compete globally and with the importance of the need, when making competition assessments, to consider the whole of the internal market and not only national and local sub-markets."
"Companies of the future will require a large domestic market."
"That is what the internal market needs to be for, and it is with this in mind that competition should be developed."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Kroes, Mr Evans’s draft report did not give rise to any fundamental disagreements."
"I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the spirit of cooperation that led to consensus on almost all of the amendments that I tabled as shadow rapporteur and on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"These amendments clarified a range of points, not least that competitiveness is an essential factor in fostering growth in Europe, although this is only one of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, equally as important as cohesion and the environment."
"The next point was that the relationship between competition policy and state aid must be clarified; the third was that the rules regarding technology exchange agreements and research and development aid, particularly in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises, must be clarified; fourthly, that the relationship between the financial instruments linked to the Kyoto Protocol impacting at company level and competition policy must be clarified; fifthly, that the new Member States must adapt quickly to competition policy; and sixthly, that close ties are welcome between competition policy and international trade policy, both at multilateral level, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, and at bilateral level with the main partners, including China."
"Those are some of the proposals that were accepted."
"Two proposed amendments did not achieve consensus: one is to be tabled by Mrs Batzeli, and the other concerns the sentence in which the rapporteur proposes, and I quote, that ‘Parliament expresses its concern at the continued failure to achieve full liberalisation in the EU gas and electricity markets’."
"I feel that liberalisation is not an end in itself."
"It is a means whereby in this sector, in common with other essential supplies, the consumer enjoys the best possible conditions in terms of price, quality and universality, because those consumers are citizens, first and foremost."
"Liberalisation must take place within a framework that guarantees the status of gas and electricity as a public good."
"That is the thrust of the amendment that I had the opportunity to table."
"What must be remembered, perhaps today more than ever, is that the EU project is a political one, albeit with an economic foundation."
"If the supremacy of the market means that the citizens will, on a long-term basis, be prevented from enjoying their fundamental rights ..."
". – Mr President, the title, which refers to state aid for public services, is a misnomer, because this is aid for companies."
"As long as the state monopolies existed in public services, they mainly served the interests of the plutocracy."
"However, today, within the framework of capitalist restructurings, most public services have been given – and others are going to be given – to private capital, so that their profitability can also be reinforced in this way."
"Consequently, the European Union's main criterion for state aid is not to cover grass-roots needs and resolve grass-roots problems, but to approve it so that big business never loses out and so that there are no repercussions on its profitability."
"In addition, the Commission proposal comes within the framework of the capital restructurings promoted by the opening of the markets on which big business will derive even more profit, while the aspects of the proposal about exemption from approval of state aid by the European Union for small services of general interest, airlines and shipping companies, are insignificant."
"They do not under any circumstances satisfy enhanced grass-roots needs and that is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall vote against the proposal."
". Mr President, we all recognise that there is a case for promoting competition in the interests of economic efficiency and Mrs Kroes has promised to continue the work of her predecessor in routing out unfair state aid and cartels wherever she can find them."
"I want to suggest how she could do much better than this."
"Our rapporteur Mr Evans notes that the competitiveness of European business is one of the key objectives of the Lisbon Agenda."
"Unfortunately, too often competitiveness in the EU is too often taken to mean that every nation and every company has to suffer under the same regulatory burden or the same 'level playing field'."
"This is not really the same as competition."
"Dare I extend Mr Hökmark's remarks and suggest that if the Commission is truly interested in promoting competition it should include regulatory competition."
"This would be a much richer source of efficiency."
"Give nations some freedom to determine their own agricultural policies and to decide for themselves how they want to ensure their own health and safety."
"Allow nations to set their own rules over everything that is not directly concerned with trade or other matters of common interest."
"A radical suggestion maybe, but it would allow competition from the more lightly regulated economies to provide the spur for lighter regulation elsewhere and we shall all prosper."
"For those EU regions that are struggling to converge, relief from over-regulation would surely do much more good than any amount of handouts from the diminishing pool of Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"Mr Barroso has made some cautious remarks about easing regulation but I fear it is unlikely to occur."
"If meaningful deregulation could be achieved then all the sorrow about the failure of the Lisbon Agenda could be turned to rejoicing as EU economies really begin to move out of the sick bay."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"The basis for measures relating to the market for goods and services is coherent action in the field of competition policy."
"The report on 2003 shows that good progress has been made in this respect, but that shortcomings remain."
"Fresh challenges are presented by the accession to the EU of ten new Member States with varying regulations on competition law."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to highlight several problems."
"In a number of Member States, the markets for certain services have been taken over by professional associations or organisations, which create obstacles restricting competitiveness."
"The directive must also set out the conditions according to which financial assistance may be granted for public services or production, to ensure that such assistance does not end up amounting to long-term subsidies, as this would damage competitiveness."
"Finally, there should be provisions allowing public services at town or commune level to be exempt from all requirements relating to competitiveness, provided that this would mean better solutions for local problems."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, competition policy is one of the Commission’s key tasks in relation to the internal market."
"To judge by the debate that took place a few hours ago, it is apparent that the European Union really is a global player in this field."
"It is also apparent that Mrs Kroes is acting as a stand-in as far as this work is concerned, since the report that has been tabled and is being discussed relates to the previous Commission’s work, and I should like to wish her the best of luck in this respect."
"For as long as the European Communities have existed, the successful work carried out by the Commission has played a significant part in helping to ensure that a characteristic feature of the European market has been fair competition, which has brought the benefits of quality and reasonable prices to all citizens."
"It is against this background that Mr Evans’ report evaluates the work carried out by the Commission’s Competition DG in 2003, even though decisions that were taken during this period were taken under the aegis of the previous Commission."
"The aim of the debate on this report should therefore be to examine and evaluate the extensive amendments that have been made to European competition law and the major changes that have taken place within the European Commission in terms of their future effectiveness."
"There can be no doubt that the aforementioned amendments and changes are, in principle, likely to maintain the high standard of European competition policy."
"As I mentioned in my question, however, I believe that there are a number of areas where improvements would be useful."
"These include protection for principal witnesses in competition law cases throughout Europe, the legal status of Internet publications and guaranteed protection against double prosecution under monopoly law."
"Irrespective of these concerns, however, the report before us provides an excellent basis for carrying out future work in the usual successful manner."
"I wish you the best of luck in ensuring that the decisions you take over coming months stand up in court."
"I also hope that you will be able to follow the previous Commission’s example and to take decisions that are in the public’s interest, as trust and authority are crucial as far as competition policy is concerned."
"I hope that you will enjoy both."
"– Mr President, it is particularly positive that the Commission in its references to sectoral developments highlights, among other things, the need for additional Community efforts in the sector of the mass media, so that their liberalisation can safeguard pluralism and economic development."
"Commissioner, Mr Evans, I really wish to congratulate you in person on your work and, more specifically, on your work in this report."
"I should like at this point to draw your attention to the fact that, because of the cultural peculiarity of the audiovisual sector, which is such that this sector cannot be treated as a normal industry, the Commission must clarify the role which the main shareholders play on the basis of competition policy."
"We feel that it is important for the Commission to impose pluralism on the media, both at national and at Community level, by consistently safeguarding the free participation of everyone in the audiovisual media sector."
"Commissioner, given that the Commission emphasises that competition rules, as you state in your report, are the rules on which the resolution of the problems which derive from the creation or the strengthening of the dominant position on the market will be based in order to address priority agreements, will a policy be approved under which restrictions on the basic shareholder act as a check on the competition policy of the mass media?"
"I should like us to receive a response so that our rapporteur, Mr Evans, can perhaps accept the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
". Mr President, I would like to thank those who gave me positive feedback."
"I also listened, of course, to those who were more critical."
"Mr Evans' support for the idea and the faith expressed in his report was a great start."
"I set out my own philosophy in my recent speeches at Bocconi and at the OECD in Paris, where all those national authorities from around the world that are active in the competition field were gathered."
"Those speeches and this report show, I think, that we are on the same track."
"We are all aware that competition is the instrument for getting our economy in better shape, something that we badly need in Europe."
"We have both a lack of economic growth and a lack of productivity."
"We badly need economic growth because we have environmental and social welfare objectives that we rightly believe are essential within our culture."
"I found the remarks that honourable Members have made very interesting and stimulating."
"They mark the start of our dialogue."
"As I mentioned before, I would be delighted to be invited to EMAC to discuss this item."
"Concerning competition in technology transfer, there is indeed a way of developing this within our competition policy."
"It is not a separate item, it is all combined in one policy."
"Regarding Mr Rutowicz's question about a market definition in merger cases, the Commission welcomes, and indeed promotes greater integration of markets."
"There is no doubt about that."
"As markets integrate, the relevant anti-trust markets will also become wider."
"However, for the time being many markets remain national or regional and this must be reflected in competition analysis, including market definition, so that competition and consumers do not suffer."
"Mrs Elisa Ferreira asked about gas and electricity liberalisation."
"I agree that it is important to improve the functioning of the energy market."
"In close cooperation with our energy colleagues, we are investigating the current status of the market."
"We are investigating the conduct of incumbents in certain markets and plan to carry out sector inquiries."
"The sector inquires will provide important input as to how the markets function and how they can be improved."
"It is important to differentiate between preferences for liberalisation."
"I could not agree more about having a positive attitude towards liberalisation."
"However, in some cases where liberalisation has taken place there are still activities within that market that we do not accept."
"When that happens, one should not say 'I am against liberalisation'."
"We have a duty to find out what the actual situation is and who is not acting properly and not meeting our expectations."
"Mr Rutowicz made a couple of remarks with regard to state aid reform."
"The conclusion of the Prodi Commission, later repeated by the European Council, was that there should be less aid but better aid."
"In addition, it was concluded that with enlargement we had a further reason for less and better aid for those areas that had already enjoyed the benefit of such aid."
"We now have to realise that within the ten new Member States there is a new territory which we have to improve, where aid could be of great help."
"With better focus and a better use of tax-payers' money we can concentrate aid where it really generates the greatest value; where it contributes to cohesion; where it boosts innovation, research and development, and risk capital so that small- and medium-sized companies can also play a positive role as an engine of innovation in stimulating the economy."
"We need to ensure that they have access to risk capital because they need to take their ideas forward."
"Better focused state aid means better economic results and governance and ultimately, better and more secure jobs and better use of tax-payers' money."
"In early spring we will have a chance to present the action plan on state aid reform."
"That action plan will include measures to rationalise the state aid framework."
"I want to reduce a lot of the red tape, a lot of the bureaucracy and I think that notification requirements for straightforward low impact aid should be one of those items we can get rid of, thus focussing resources on checking the more problematic high-impact subsidies."
"Mrs Ferreira said that the title was misleading."
"I think that the title of the report just covers what we are really focusing on."
"Another question was about audiovisuals."
"Maintaining and developing media pluralism is a basic public goal of the European Union, together with the preservation of cultural diversity and freedom of access for the Union citizen to all kinds of media platforms."
"The application of competition policy instruments in the media sector is limited to addressing the underlying market structure and economic impact of media undertakings' behaviour."
"Nevertheless competition policy can and does make an essential contribution to the maintenance and development of media pluralism both in traditional television and other broadcasting markets and the new media."
"Mr Schwab underlined that the European Union is a global player and that therefore it is essential to look at the price, at the quality, and also at the research possibilities to fall in line with our global competitors."
"It would be a good idea, to focus especially on increasing efficiency and transparency and to work towards a less bureaucratic one-stop shop for leniency applications."
"This will be explained in the new paper I am preparing which will also support greater efficiency and transparency."
"I have tried to answer the questions that were raised."
"Again, thanks for the opportunity and thanks again to Mr Evans and all those who have been involved in the preparation of this report."
"Today's debate is just the start."
"It is very important to continue the discussion and to feel that you are on the same track as us in the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mrs in 't Veld on State aid in the form of public service compensation."
". Mr President, I do not doubt that you will be pleased to hear me say that I will keep it brief and will not inconvenience you with my husky voice for any longer than necessary, because I am afraid that as a Liberal, I have to conclude that there is not exactly a level playing field between myself and the flu virus,but that I simply have not survived the competition."
"The EU Treaty contains two objectives that are important to this report."
"The first one is that on the one hand, we have state aid rules which must ensure that the internal market operates effectively, and on the other hand, the Treaty also states that those rules must not hinder the proper functioning of public services."
"The internal market has brought us many benefits, in the area of public services as elsewhere."
"We also find that we are all very much attached to the so-called European social economic model with good public services, which has, moreover, provided us with a high level of competitiveness."
"The Commission’s proposals are very welcome and I am pleased to hear that Mrs Kroes’ words do no more than underline what we have written in our report, namely that we aim to reduce state aid on the one hand, and do away with unnecessary red tape, on the other, and that we are focusing on those things that really distort the internal market, which are, after all, detrimental to our economy and also, therefore, to the foundation on which public services rest."
"I should like to outline a few key points."
"First of all, I should like to underline once again that the focus must be on the citizen as user of the services and as taxpayer."
"This may seem a little bit like stating the obvious, but all too often in reality, what takes priority are political interests, corporate interests, institutional interests and all kinds of other interests, to which, quite often, the interests of the individual have to give way."
"The second point is the definition of what we term small services of general interest."
"The Commission has proposed granting those small services exemption from the obligation of prior notification for state aid and has, more or less, suggested that we use the same threshold of EUR 50 million maximum by way of annual turnover as we do for medium and small enterprises."
"Although the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has, at my proposal, followed this suggestion in the first instance, I do think that we should review the practical implications in a few years’ time, because we have no idea of how many businesses, how much state aid in total, and how many applications for state aid are involved."
"I should therefore like to know the exact impact of that threshold."
"Another important point for me is evidence-based policy making."
"For years, we in this House have been waging traditional trench warfare between Left and Right about the liberalisation of public services."
"I think it is important that we should finally have the facts on the table."
"In the report, we therefore urge the Commission to present an up-to-date and detailed report on public services every four years, when this regulation is up for renewal."
"I should like to finish off with a minor, slightly technical point."
"One paragraph in the report was included after we had adopted an amendment, and that paragraph seems to suggest that this House proposes that the task of offering a certain service must, in all cases, be assigned via a tendering procedure."
"That is not, of course, what is intended."
"I think that there are many people – maybe not all, but many – who will agree with me that that is, in itself, a sound procedure, and one that, in many cases, leads to sound results, but I would like to do away with the misconception that as of today, this House will decide that all services must be assigned via such a procedure."
"It is unfortunate that no amendments have been tabled to do away with that misconception, but I would in any event like to make this clear to the Commission in today’s plenary."
"Mr President, many thanks for the clear explanation of Mrs in ‘t Veld’s report; the problems that are raised in it are extremely important, because certainly now that we will, based on the state aid review, examine the best way of achieving the most effective result, it is the observations that have been made here that matter and therefore very much apply here."
"As I have said before further to the discussion on Mr Jonathan Evans’ report, I agree that we must cover all the angles in order to proceed in a more transparent and more effective way, thereby cutting down on bureaucracy and red tape, which does not benefit anybody, is too time-consuming, and, as Mrs in ‘t Veld put it very graphically, ultimately, what matters is the public, the consumers and taxpayers, who want to know what happens with their money and to what effect."
"That is why, when talking about definitions, and particularly about how to define small services of general interest, it is appropriate in any event not to jump the gun and to say that we know what is to be understood by it for all eternity."
"This is an area in which we have to gain experience, to see how things pan out, what the turnover would be in which situations and where, and what level of state aid would be involved."
"What is ultimately the extent of state aid that you do not only entertain, but also must take into consideration?"
"In addition, Mrs in 't Veld stated very clearly that she favours evidence-based policy-making. We must finally put this into practice and ask ourselves whether it would not be a good idea – I, for one, think it is one, and it is one that I am glad to adopt – to submit a report in four years or so to demonstrate the impact of it all, and check whether it has the desired effect or whether there are maybe better methods for achieving our goal."
"If we talk about state aid, then it is not the intention, certainly in our discussion, for that to be a permanent arrangement."
"The intention is to use state aid as a way of setting in motion a process that will, eventually, lead to self-sufficiency."
"To quote a well-known Chinese saying, it is the intention that, eventually, fish are caught with the fishing rod you give, rather than fish only being handed out to those who need them at the time."
"I agree that this is a sound, experience-based report and explores whether state aid works, how it works and whether this is the best way of going about things."
"However, we do come up against the Court ruling in the Altmark case, which brings us to the fourth criterion."
"I assume that the first three criteria are clear, and with regard to the fourth criterion, we have to establish that tendering is possible in all situations."
"In those cases where tendering is possible, it is obvious that we need to apply the four criteria, but in other cases, people need to take the best possible decision under the given circumstances, and we have to conclude that we need to gain some experience in that area in order to formulate the best methodology."
"I would therefore like to echo the rapporteur in this and say that we can indeed gain the experience together and submit it in a report."
"Four years are a good timeframe within which we can make some valid statements on this score and hopefully reach some conclusions again in a future debate."
"Thank you."
". Mr President, my group is committed to open markets with free and fair competition as they will provide the best quality products and services at the best price."
"They will also best produce the economic benefits that we need if we are to reach the Lisbon objectives and if we are to pay for our social and environmental ambitions."
"Another important consideration in our Group is subsidiarity: the decision should be taken at a level as close as possible to the citizen, which is compatible with a properly functioning single market."
"There is no need for Europe to step in where a decision is best taken at national or local level."
"We are therefore pleased that Mrs in't Veld's excellent report succeeds in accommodating these two priorities."
"The overall thrust is to call for fair competition in free markets."
"Like her, we would always prefer a transparent tendering process."
"However, if local authorities, in their wisdom, feel they can do better for their citizens, they can so do without having to notify the Commission, as long as they keep within the rules, which ensure that potential competitors are not harmed and, most specifically, that they are small in scale and very local in nature."
"A clear decision was achieved in committee that gives the Commission a strong steer."
"We are happy with this and we will support this same line tomorrow."
"We wish Mrs in't Veld well with her report."
"Thank you Mr President."
"Let me start by congratulating Mrs in 't Veld on her report, which I see as representing another step towards the abandonment, by the members of this Union, of the attempt at squeezing everyone into one size, which, in the long run, does not fit anyone."
"Instead we are moving towards the principle of subsidiarity, which involves us in recognising the needs of the countries and regions and of localities."
"I think that whoever believes in balance, recognises that the market economy has several advantages, although we must, at the same time, recognise that intolerable shortcomings keep occurring, and those who are entrusted with power and leadership do not budge."
"Without any doubt, there are cases of abuses, but there are several other cases, where, if properly regulated, State aid will be the social soul that arrives where the cold calculations of the market's reasoning do not."
"The ultimate success of this Europe and of its Member States cannot be measured only through the economy’s statistics."
"A healthy economy must be the means whereby we are led towards the real ultimate purpose, that of giving our families a decent life and dignified work in a better environment."
"Obviously, every type of aid that is given must be given within an agreed framework that takes into account the realities of different countries."
"Planning this framework must involve everyone, and here I emphasise ‘everyone’ – the social partners, trade unions, the consumers and the private sector, and, while we are on the subject of consumers, it would be appropriate to also remember the minorities among consumers and the taxpayers."
"I will give an example: an amendment I tabled, and that I am pleased to note was accepted in this report, makes it easier to supply aid from the air, as well through sea routes between islands."
"Let me give you an example why this is so."
"Currently, in order for the citizens of the island of Gozo to cross over to the main island of my country, Malta, using a 12-minute helicopter trip, the market economy requires them to pay much more than they would pay for an airline ticket for a trip between London and Brussels."
"Imagine how such a region can develop without some aid from the State."
"We must move even further forward than we have done to date."
"I only have to look at the shipyards in my country, which the government is trying to close down, while blaming European Union regulations for the need to do so."
"Despite the demonisation of the shipyard workers, these sectors and enterprises have a huge load of work and a large commitment to give in terms of an era of greater technical capacity."
"Other large countries of the European Union hid behind the military in order to give subsidies to this sector."
"We cannot do that."
"There are those who say that these subsidies go against the laws of the European Union. I say: then let us change the laws."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her outstanding work, as she has brought a great deal of expertise and enthusiasm to bear on an extremely complex issue, and has presented a very lucid report."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe regard it as self-evident that the public sector must safeguard the provision of certain services."
"There is a need, though, for great care to be exercised when using taxpayers’ money, and it must be used only in cases where it provides consumers with genuine added value."
"It is for that reason that clear rules are needed."
"In principle we welcome the Commission’s attempts to lay down a framework to make sure that funds are used in a transparent, objective and easy-to-understand way."
"What we want is a solution that ensures that competition is effective and that the rules on services of general interest are not used to distort competition."
"Completion of the internal market must not be slowed down by an unchecked and indiscriminate distribution of State aid."
"What we want is quite the opposite, namely to lend our support to a solution that makes it possible to achieve a number of goals."
"These include the drawing up by the Member States of a definition of services of general interest; even if these definitions are not identical, they will be comparable, and we do not regard this as violating the principle of subsidiarity."
"In addition, State aid must be used in a targeted and focused manner in instances where it helps to safeguard the future, with its future use being somewhat more restricted than has been the case to date, and the rules on such aid must not interfere with the further implementation of the internal market."
"We are opposed to the prevention of a possible liberalisation of services of general interest by means of derogations to the directive on services, such as has been attempted by the Federal Minister for the Economy in Germany."
"Finally, I should like to call on the Commission to provide further explanatory documents to ensure that the rules are made easier to apply."
"It should develop benchmarks and examples of best practice as points of reference, for the best practice approach can act as a source of good ideas, derived from other Member States’ successes."
". Mr President, my Group has tabled a number of amendments and requested several separate votes on this report."
"This has been done to give Members the opportunity to ensure that the report clearly favours public service providers, particularly in the fields of health and social housing provision."
"The report affirms our belief in the importance of high-quality services of general interest that are accessible to all."
"It also recognises the right of local authorities to self-government."
"So far, so good."
"However, recital E contends that 'the internal market, liberalisation and compliance with the rules on competition have on the whole led to improved access to SGIs, new services with more choice, better quality and lower costs for consumers'."
"In our view this is questionable to say the least."
"The report also asserts that no distinction should be made between public and private enterprises and that all SGIs should be put out to tender."
"The rapporteur seemed to suggest that there was some misunderstanding about this, but that is how it comes across."
"This would cause problems for in-house services within public bodies such as local housing authorities and health boards."
"My Group cannot accept a lack of clarity on this point."
"On the contrary, we would support an approach that clearly exempts from the prior notification requirement the kinds of local services that do not affect the development of trade, and do not conflict with the interests of the European Union."
"State-aid rules have frequently led to difficulties and uncertainty for local authorities and other public service providers."
"We ought to have certainty, and we hope the House votes in favour of that tomorrow."
"Mr President, this report highlights the issue of whether it is acceptable for centralised decision-making in Brussels to have an impact on people’s lives on an everyday basis."
"There is a widespread feeling that practices that used to be well-established are being called into question, in particular in the case of services of general interest and possible compensation for the provision of public services, and this has left a great many people fearing that they will be left with nothing at all."
"I particularly agree with the comments made by the penultimate speaker, Mr Klinz of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, namely that the priority for Brussels must be greater transparency in order to resolve this problem, and that there is a risk that the smaller Member States will continue to use subsidiarity to their own advantage, either by imposing artificially high prices or by helping their friends."
"I am also firmly convinced that unless the Commission speeds up the procedures for assessing internationally comparable best practice models, we run the risk of having to submit a negative final or interim report in four years’ time."
"The one additional point I should like to make is that I cannot understand why such far-reaching exemptions have been granted to public service broadcasters."
"The latter increasingly resemble private broadcasters in terms of their working methods and the way they market themselves, and I believe that their activities in many fields, for example online services, mean that what we are seeing amounts to additional subsidies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, one of the main problems encountered when applying European legislation on State aid to the provision of services of general interest is legal certainty, or rather legal uncertainty."
"It has not always been obvious to decision-makers in local authorities at city, municipality or district level whether compensation for special expenses connected with these services comes within the scope of State aid regulations."
"The dilemma these decision-makers face is whether these payments have to be declared to the Commission or approved by it."
"There are serious legal consequences if compensation is not declared when it should have been, yet if declarations are submitted unnecessarily in cases of doubt valuable time is lost during this procedure."
"Steps will now be taken to reduce this legal uncertainty, and this is something I wholeheartedly welcome and support."
"As has already been mentioned, the ruling by the European Court of Justice on the Altmark case is the legal basis that the Commission has used to put forward its proposal for an exemption decision."
"This proposal complies with the demand Parliament made in its resolution of 14 January 2004 on the Green Paper on services of general interest, and it is a sign that support exists for a control policy that focuses on cases that are key to effective competition in the internal market."
"Under this proposal, compensation that only has a very minor impact on the internal market will be exempt from State aid control procedures, which will mean a great deal more legal certainty for local stakeholders."
"Compensation for services of general economic interest that have only a minor impact on the internal market is frequently granted on a strictly limited and local basis, and is therefore a good example of an instance where exemption would be decided on."
"Provided that other criteria are complied with, such as providing a clear statement of responsibilities and adherence to the principle of transparency, such compensation will also benefit from the planned increase in legal certainty."
"The rapporteur has submitted an outstanding report, and ensured that it expressed the majority view by putting it to a vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I hope that the House as a whole will view it in the same way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, for a long time I was among those who believed that the only type of bureaucracy was state bureaucracy."
"Now, though, as an MEP, I have discovered an inextricably linked market bureaucracy: State aid."
"I believe that the proposal put to us today constitutes real progress, namely – as you just said during the previous debate, Commissioner – the exemption from the notification requirement of minor aid that is not considered to have an impact on the single market."
"In my opinion, this is a considerable step forwards."
"We need to consolidate this, and it would also be worthwhile to definitively rename it public service compensation, rather than State aid."
"This is a new legal category that could be created."
"With regard to the report that has been presented to us, I am one of those who believe that there are things that need to be stabilised."
"In particular, I do not think that we can vote again as we did in committee: hospitals and social housing must be clearly integrated in the scope."
"This, though, is probably not enough."
"I am one of those who suggest that there should also be autonomous services within local communities, which other texts are in the process of recognising, in particular the regulation on the public service obligation in transport."
"We will probably have to wait for the Commission's communication on social services in order to be able, maybe tomorrow, to include these in this text."
"Finally, I think we need to consider the issue of the fourth criterion from the Altmark ruling."
"This criterion is so complicated that it would introduce to this document – which is a simplifying document – new complications for local communities."
"As you know, it involves comparison with the reasonable profit of a comparable undertaking at EU level."
"This is absolutely impracticable."
"Consequently, perhaps this fourth criterion could at some point be abandoned, even at the risk of slight overcompensation, so that your aim of simplification can finally be pursued and achieved."
"Mr President, I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur and to say that I welcome this initiative, which clarifies the relationship between, on the one hand, state aid and, on the other hand, the provision by Member States of compensation for the cost of services of general economic interest."
"Services of general economic interest are essential for improving the quality of life for all citizens, and these services are often central in helping to attract investment to less-favoured areas and rural areas, thus boosting their competitiveness and leading to greater cohesion within the EU."
"At a national level within Ireland, the post office network is under threat, particularly the smaller rural post offices that are not computerised and cannot, therefore, offer an adequate level of service to citizens."
"The post office network will require a public service obligation in order to remain viable, and this proposal to exempt small-scale public funding such as this from the obligation of prior notification to the Commission makes absolute sense in that it allows sufficient flexibility at national and regional level without distorting the internal market."
"Indeed, as the rapporteur and the Commissioner have both said, it also cuts down on red tape."
"Mr President, I agree with those who say that the Commission’s proposals are a first step and that Mrs in ‘t Veld’s report is a first step as well as a sound report."
"The legal uncertainty is too great at present for the local players."
"At the moment, we are leaving it up to the Court of Justice to decide what exactly should be done about state aid."
"While that is a first step, we see it as too insubstantial."
"Exempting compensation paid to hospitals and social housing is a first step, but we think that others should be added to the list."
"Commissioner, we would add care homes and employment agencies, which should be exempt from notification."
"As for the fourth criterion in the Altmark judgment, that is totally unacceptable to us and also not feasible in practical terms."
"After all, what is the definition of the average well-run private undertaking?"
"What if there is no private equivalent?"
"Does making reference to the average private undertaking not oversimplify the task assigned to the public service?"
"Pretending to be a well-run private undertaking can also impact on redundancies and cause social upsets."
"I would therefore ask for this criterion to be deleted."
"Mr President, Mrs in 't Veld, Commissioner, the Commission is continually telling us that it cannot put forward a framework directive on services of general interest because the issue is apparently too broad and is covered by the subsidiarity principle."
"With this ‘Monti package’ and the proposal for a directive on services, however, the Commission is dealing with the issue of public services."
"With one small stroke after another, it is painting a sort of Impressionist picture representing its own vision of public services."
"Unfortunately, Mr Barroso is no Manet or Renoir."
"According to this picture, any financing of public services is necessarily State aid, and thus by implication contravenes the principle of free and fair competition, an aberration that must be stamped out."
"The right of this Parliament goes even further, moreover: Mrs in 't Veld's report rejects the Commission's proposal to exempt the social housing and hospital sectors from the notification requirement."
"Similarly, if Parliament assents to the requirement for a tendering process prior to any award of public service compensation, it will weaken all the small local public services that are directly and indirectly managed by the public authorities."
"In conclusion, we are observing, following the dismantling of the great national public services, the weakening of local public services."
"This report is in fact deceptive: it claims to make consumers happier, while eroding their citizen's rights with regard to public services."
"This weekend, the Portuguese electorate showed their displeasure at this to their former Prime Minister, Mr Barroso."
"Mr President, you were right in saying that there are many ladies present in our group this evening, and I know that will be to the Commissioner’s liking."
"Following the harsh words which have also been spoken from our side of the House, I will also try to congratulate Mrs in 't Veld and look at how we can, after all, reach compromises on this issue."
"I am told that she has indicated a willingness to take some of our amendments into consideration."
"I think that the first point is the in-house provision of services, in which respect, we would like to stand by what we said in last year’s Herzog report."
"Therefore, if she could support amendments in that respect, that would help us a great deal."
"The second point is public procurement and transparent tendering, which is covered in a number of amendments tabled by Mr Purvis, and also in an amendment by Mrs Wagenknecht, who states that this tendering should not take place unless required by law."
"This may be a bridging provision to clarify something that has, as you yourself indicate, not been incorporated well."
"Based on this, we can subsequently bring the different texts – there are always four different texts – into line with each other."
"Lastly, there is the issue about exempting hospitals and social housing, which we, too, regard as a rather random selection."
"We too would like to see this examined transparently and would like to see what the implications are, but would also like to indicate that much more is yet to be done and much more thought should be given to the way in which the criteria are determined."
"That is something that we believe should happen, not in four years’ time, but now, at a time when the services directive is up for discussion, to enable us to draft clear criteria based on a framework directive and services of general interest, precisely where the combination of private and public tendering is concerned."
"I would like to continue this discussion with the Commissioner in due course."
". Mr President, I wish to apologise to Mrs in 't Veld for failing to mention at the outset that I was impressed by her report."
"I know it was a difficult job, but the result has been worth it."
"The contribution this report has made to the debate is really important, so I congratulate her."
"One of the key motives behind the Commission's proposal is to increase legal certainty and predictability."
"One of the remarks made this evening referred to the need for predictability for those who have to deal with public services and public service financing schemes."
"As I have already mentioned, we also want to reduce the administrative burden: to get rid of red tape and a lot of bureaucracy not only at European level but also at national and regional level."
"That is why timing is so essential."
"The question of the efficient functioning of services of general economic interest is of great importance for the Commission, and for Parliament, the Member States and for the consumer – the European Union citizen."
"Contrary to what is sometimes said, Community competition rules do not hinder the proper functioning of these services."
"They do not affect the prerogatives and responsibilities of national, regional or local authorities to define, organise, finance and monitor public services."
"I very much agree with the idea that we should occasionally review what we are doing."
"When we consider the Altmark court case, it is not that difficult to make a clear decision on three of the four criteria."
"Therefore, I do not agree with the Member who said that it is difficult to define a true public service."
"Nor is it difficult to define a contract or to identify the parameters of compensation."
"As Mrs van den Burg said, there could be difficulties when tendering is a possibility."
"When difficulties arise, you need to calculate the costs on the basis of a well-run company."
"Therefore, as far as the fourth criteria is concerned, having implemented this court case ruling for four years we can take our experience into account."
"We know that in reality tenders are not widely used for small services of general economic interest."
"Under Altmark, the compensation paid is therefore state aid and needs to be notified."
"The Commission's established policy is not to restrict the financing of companies in charge of public service obligations."
"However, we ensure that this financing is really necessary and does not lead to undue distortions of competition."
"The current proposals respond to the new environment arising from the Altmark case."
"The Commission's draft decision seeks to reduce the notification burden as concerns small services of general economic interest."
"The Treaty establishes that the efficient functioning of services of general interest is a shared responsibility between the Union and Member States."
"The proposals before you today form a part of the Commission's efforts to play its role in achieving this."
"I welcome the fact that you support the reduction of unnecessary red tape and I will take that into account."
"The draft decision excludes small public services from the notification burden, thereby matching the thresholds set for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"As Mrs in 't Veld's report suggests, the Commission considers this to be the most appropriate approach."
"The hospital and social housing sectors will also be exempt from notification."
"This is made quite clear, and is justified by the high amounts of compensation necessitated by the nature of these public services."
"I very much agree with the idea that the Commission should review the application of new rules after a certain period, and after carrying out an impact assessment."
"In line with other state-aid frameworks, such as the regional aid guidelines and the block exemptions, we suggest that the framework should apply for six years and be renewed, on the basis of a review, for four years in this case."
"For reasons of legal certainty, the validity of the decision should not be limited in time, but I very much agree with the need to hold a review."
"It was also suggested that there is a necessity to consult widely on the definition of the public service obligations, particularly where this concerns users."
"The Commission agrees in principle, but it is up to Member States and their regional or local authorities to define public services in practice."
"The Commission can only recommend that Member States consult widely on that matter."
"I have consulted my colleague, Mr Barrot, on the suggestion of expanding the scope of the decision concerning transport."
"There are several sector regulations in this field, which make extending the scope of the current package difficult."
"However, I understand that a separate package is being prepared, and your comments on land and air transport links certainly constitute interesting input for that package."
"A benchmarking exercise, especially the benchmarking of public services and services of general economic interest, would be difficult to carry out."
"It might not be technically feasible, since public services are structured in different ways in different EU countries."
"Considering the costs – and, perhaps, the limited usefulness – of such a study, I do not think it is a good idea."
"I am aware of the problem involving existing compensation when the conditions applicable are not met."
"I understand that Member States need a certain period of time to modify their existing schemes."
"We will consider ways of granting legal certainty for a transitional period."
"The criteria for the Altmark ruling need further work and clarification."
"In its White Paper on Services of General Interest, adopted in May 2004, the Commission announced that it would adopt a text on this issue in 2005."
"Mrs De Vits asked about social health and care services, and these are already covered by the draft decision."
"In the light of the amount of public service compensation generally granted to care services, most should fall within the thresholds for compensation defined in the decision and should therefore benefit from the exemption from notification."
"On the points raised by Mrs De Vits, the Commission supports the recommendation that tendering processes should be used wherever possible, and in most cases in which the Altmark criteria have been met there will be no state aid."
"But we know that, in reality, tenders are not widely used, particularly for small services of general economic interest."
"I agree with Mrs van den Burg that we need to take experience into account."
"In the light of experience, we will have a better and clearer view of how to handle this."
"If there is no way of tendering, then the cost basis of a well-run company – in this case, a public service company – should be taken into account."
"I thank Mrs in 't Veld again."
"We will certainly return to these matters once we have had more experience."
"The debate is closed."
"I should like to thank the interpreters for having stayed with us for so long, and also the remaining Members, the majority of whom are women – indeed there are more women in the Chamber than men."
"I declare the sitting open."
"Mr President, although I very much support this request for urgent procedure, I would, however, like to point out that care needs to be taken in implementing this proposal not to destroy the local economy, especially the fishing industry."
"Subject to that proviso, we support this proposal and the request for urgent procedure."
"Mr President, my point of order is not about the vote on tsunami vessels but about interpretation problems in Parliament."
"Yesterday I spoke here in plenary."
"I had a two-minute speech and my political message was totally turned upside down by the interpreters."
"It made me look stupid."
"My colleagues could not understand a word I was saying in Finnish."
"This is a constant problem for all the small language groups in Parliament."
"I shall not use Finnish any more in plenary if the result is that my political message is turned upside down."
"The same thing happened at the start of this sitting with Polish, a very nice language."
"Interpretation is not up to its task and this is a terrific problem for this House."
"I want this noted for the record."
"Your concerns will be noted in the record, Mrs Kauppi."
"I understand why you spoke in English rather than Finnish."
"It is a serious matter and we shall look into it."
"– Mr President, the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries will let you know how much we appreciate this request for urgent procedure."
"We have followed what Commissioner Borg has done since the tragedy took place and have supported him."
"On a practical level, we shall hold an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Fisheries at 5.30 p.m. in order to decide whether each measure, as Mr Swoboda said, is in the meeting’s best interests."
"In principle, however, and I believe that this reflects the opinion of most Members, I am entirely in favour of the urgent procedure."
"Mr President, we have now heard two speakers in favour and, according to the rules, we are entitled to hear one speaker against."
"Let us firstly agree that everyone wants to give aid as quickly as possible in the most efficient way possible."
"I would, however, advise against urgent procedure."
"It is a nice idea, that of exporting old fishing vessels, but it would not work very well."
"The FAO has still not received any lists of the vessels countries want."
"Moreover, it is warning against problems involving incorrect equipment and unduly high capacity."
"These matters must firstly be investigated."
"What is more, a conference of the regional fishing organisations held a meeting last week in Sumatra, involving representatives from, for example, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka."
"They are opposed to the export of old vessels."
"They would rather have help developing their local shipyards and fishing fleets."
"In order to obtain a proposal that works and that is just what is needed, usual procedures should be used so that local considerations can better be put into the equation."
"We need more dialogue with the FAO and local fishermen before we are ready to vote."
"– Mr President, in adopting this report, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs of course supported the Council’s request for urgent procedure, but at the same time called on the Council, by means of an amendment to the legislative resolution and to the recital in the regulation, to provide every opportunity for diplomacy before finally adopting the text."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I therefore invite this House to follow the suggestion made by the committee that I have the honour to chair, a suggestion that was also unanimously supported by the Committee on Development."
"From a procedural point of view, and in order to pre-empt any disputes from third parties, I ask you to draw the Council’s attention to the need, at the legislative consultation stage, to forward complete texts to Parliament, including annexes."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"- (A6-0026/2005) by Mr Goebbels, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European economic situation – preparatory report on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines [2004/2269(INI)];"
"- (A6-0025/2005) by Mr Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Public Finances in EMU – 2004 [2004/2268(INI)]."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on macroeconomic policy is becoming increasingly ideological."
"In this context, a conservative and liberal majority distorted my preparatory report on the broad economic policy guidelines by removing all references to the need to coordinate European economic policies, even though this is required by Article 4 of the Treaty."
"That majority refuses to accept the evidence; the Stability and Growth Pact must be adjusted to the economic cycles and the Commission must also assess the quality of public expenditure by analysing any deficit that a country may have accrued."
"Fortunately, the Ecofin Council is soon set to disappoint these devotees of stability at all costs."
"In order to confirm this ultraliberal pigheadedness, that majority adopted two amendments, one demanding a reduction in the general level of taxation, the other considering that an overall rise in working time is unavoidable."
"For some Members, that probably represents the balance between flexibility and security advocated in the Koch report; more work for the workers and less tax for the wealthy."
"Mr President, let us calmly take stock of the European economy."
"2004 was a vintage year for the world’s economy."
"The volume of international trade has never been so great."
"The new report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) says, however, that despite strong economic growth – more than 5% – unemployment across the world has scarcely gone down."
"Relative poverty has fallen sharply, though."
"The EU has experienced only moderate growth and a very slight fall in unemployment, particularly in the new Member States, yet productivity in the EU of the 25 has, according to the ILO, ‘improved at a faster rate than the world average’."
"This probably explains why the Union is the biggest exporter of goods and services and why Germany alone is performing better than the United States, China or Japan."
"A Europe that is the biggest exporter and the biggest buyer in the world – a Europe that manages to balance its books – cannot be in as bad a situation as the prevailing euro-pessimism would have us believe."
"I am not about to lapse into blissful euro-optimism."
"The Union could do better."
"There is not enough growth and there is too much unemployment, particularly in certain large countries, starting with the Union’s traditional powerhouses, Germany and France."
"For these ultraliberals, the root cause is clear; the problem lies with the constraints of the stability policy and the absence of structural reforms."
"Yet structural reforms have been implemented in a number of countries; the Raffarin Government has pursued pension reforms and Chancellor Schröder has secured the adoption of Hartz 1, Hartz 2 and more recently Hartz 3 and 4."
"Without growth, however, the boldest structural measures run out of steam."
"This is the view of the Economic Policy Committee, whose annual report on the structural reforms clearly states that governments ‘will only enjoy the fruits of their structural reforms in terms of growth and jobs in an appropriate macroeconomic environment’."
"Whilst it is true that the euro zone’s overall deficit has increased, albeit remaining significantly inferior to that of the United States or Japan, the result will astonish the defenders of the faith."
"The Stability and Growth Pact was designed to prevent public debt from leading to spiralling interest rates and thus to prevent the euro from becoming a weak currency."
"As things have transpired, the European Central Bank has been able to set all-time low interest rates, and the euro is performing almost too strongly against the king dollar."
"Despite fluctuations and the oil markets, the inflation rate in the euro zone has remained very low, and the purchasing power of those living in the euro zone is superior to that of residents of the US and the UK."
"According to the evidence, the euro zone’s problem is not a lack of stability but a lack of growth."
"In Germany and France in particular, but also in Italy, internal demand is insufficient."
"All countries have reduced investment in order to limit government deficit."
"Because the Germans and the French are not consuming enough, private investment also remains hamstrung."
"Why invest if demand is so moribund?"
"The rate of saving, on the other hand, is at high levels in the euro zone, particularly in France and Germany."
"This is indicative of a lack of confidence and a fear of the future."
"One major European country, however, is experiencing considerable growth and a less alarming unemployment rate, and that country is the United Kingdom."
"Why is that the case?"
"The UK Government has supported internal demand by means of a more active investment policy and a tax policy which does not become bogged down in blind devotion to the orthodoxy of stability, but which aims for balance throughout the economic cycle."
"Furthermore, the British are consuming, even if they are running up almost US-scale amounts of debt."
"The one disadvantage for the British in comparison with the euro zone is that they pay a basic interest rate of 4.75%, as opposed to 2% in the euro zone."
"The EU, and in particular the euro zone, needs more growth, and that growth can only come from internal demand, from public and private investment and from consumption."
"Some 90% of the Union’s trade is carried out between the countries of the 25."
"Even though the Union remains competitive in world trade, growth cannot come from external demand."
"Whilst certain small countries live primarily off external demand, the large countries always rely primarily on internal demand."
"Furthermore, those clamouring for European competitiveness based on the social lowest bidder and on lower salaries must acknowledge that most trade is with countries with salary levels and social security costs that are similar to those of Europe."
"Accordingly, it is not by slashing salaries, and hence consumption, that the Union will move forward."
"Consumption and, most importantly, investment must be reinvigorated in a coordinated fashion."
"Article 4 of the Treaty calls for economic policies to be coordinated."
"Thanks to the intelligent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, the Union will see a regeneration of growth and jobs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is the job of the two rapporteurs not only to present the position of their parties, but also the report agreed upon."
"That both reports led to a very intense political debate in our committee, given that they are reports on decisions concerning the way forward rather than legislative reports, is evident from the fact that although both reports were approved by very large majorities, one group largely abstained on both."
"This demonstrates the importance of the fundamental policy considerations and questions of overall direction addressed in both reports."
"I will restrict my comments to the report as adopted."
"I have three preliminary observations here."
"Firstly, the European Union is a legal Community, and although we are a legal Community, 12 Member States have breached the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact or of the Treaty since that Pact was introduced."
"Five of them belong to the euro area: Portugal, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Greece, together with the United Kingdom, to which the excessive deficit procedure does not apply, but which is nevertheless bound by the requirement laid down in Article 116(4) of the Treaty."
"My second preliminary observation is that we have, in the euro, a successful common currency, one that has turned the internal market into a home market, but we do not have a common budget policy."
"That is why we need a common policy framework, so that the euro can achieve its full potential and the European Union can achieve its growth and employment policy objectives."
"There is however, a contradiction here: in 2002 only four Member States within the euro area, accounting in total for 18% of the euro area’s GDP, had a more or less balanced budget, rising to five euro area Member States in 2004."
"My third preliminary observation is that the Lisbon strategy provides us with a basis for achieving more growth and employment, and for increasing our competitiveness."
"The reality presented in the report is that over the last decade the EU economy has grown well below its potential, with a decrease not only in private investment but also in gross public investment, which in the euro area has fallen from 4% of GDP in the early 1970s to 2.4%."
"People draw differing conclusions from all this."
"Some people blame the Stability and Growth Pact, because we say that legally binding provisions are not being complied with, and others say that we have not done our homework and that there is a lack of political will."
"We need to embark on structural reforms."
"We need to make demographic trends the starting point for changing our realities."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is a success because it highlights the political debate about the structural reforms that are required, about the failure of budget policies, and about the risks for the euro, and thus leads to political debate."
"A majority of the committee supported this viewpoint."
"This report, the theme of which was that we need a stronger political will as regards implementation, more courage as regards long-term reforms, a more serious approach and less excuses, also states that we need a greater willingness for reform combined with more honesty towards the public."
"Germany’s present contention that the costs of reunification have so far been left out of the equation is an example of how insincere the debate has become, because Germany has complied with the stability and growth criteria since the beginning of this decade; it has gone along with the Stability and Growth Pact and has had no problems with it for 10 years."
"I urge you to support the report before you if you wish to see greater stability, growth and employment, and if you wish to see compliance with European law and with the Treaty."
". Mr President, I would like to begin, on behalf of the Commission and on my own behalf, by congratulating the two rapporteurs for the two reports subject to debate, Mr Goebbels and Mr Karas, and all the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have contributed to producing the text we are discussing here today in plenary."
"I must tell you that I largely agree with the analysis appearing in each report."
"In the case of the Lisbon strategy, five years after its approval by the European Council, we can all agree on the need to reaffirm the objectives and the pillars of the strategy, to ratify our support for them, and to express our regret that the implementation of the policies necessary to move towards achieving those objectives has been delayed."
"In the case of the situation of public finances and the existing framework for monitoring the evolution of budgets and public accounts — the Stability and Growth Pact — we agree with the reference values, with the pillars established in the Treaty."
"Generally speaking, the evolution of public finances in the Economic and Monetary Union since the pact came into force has moved in the right direction, but, as Mr Karas said, there are too many countries, ten at the moment, in a situation of excessive deficit; some Member States of the Union have levels of public debt compared to their gross domestic product above the 60% reference value laid down in the Treaty, and we therefore need to reflect and seek improvements in the application of the pact, and we need to strengthen the instruments we rely on to make this framework for fiscal governance a success."
"With regard to the first of the reports, I would like to explain the Commission’s point of view to you."
"It is clear that the European Union, and the eurozone in particular, has a lower rate of growth than our competitors, than the other economic regions of the industrialised world, not to mention the emerging countries which have rates of growth of 6, 7 or even 10%."
"That low growth creates a situation of high unemployment and lack of jobs and seriously calls into question the sustainability of our social model and the sustainability of our model of society in general."
"Structural reforms are therefore necessary and, from that point of view, as the honourable Members know, in its Communication of 2 February the Commission proposed certain guidelines for moving towards a review and improvement of the application of the Lisbon strategy, establishing a series of priorities based around three key elements: firstly, making Europe a more attractive place for investment and work, extending and developing the internal market, improving regulations, guaranteeing open and competitive markets, extending and improving European infrastructure networks; secondly, improving knowledge and innovation as fundamental factors for growth, increasing and improving research and development, promoting innovation and the adoption of information technologies, and contributing to the creation of a solid European industrial base; thirdly, pursuing the objective of creating more and better jobs, establishing policies capable of attracting more people to the labour market, modernising social protection systems, increasing the adaptability of workers and companies and investing more in human capital."
"On the basis of these elements, we can restore the impetus that the creators, the founders, of the Lisbon strategy — if I may use that expression — had in mind five years ago, and make up for the time lost; at the same time, we will have to act with greater ‘ownership’ at national level, because there is no question that many of the actions necessary to make the Lisbon strategy a success basically fall within national competence."
"In the Commission’s view, the role of macroeconomic policy in this regard is to sustain growth."
"But increasing growth potential is a basic function of structural reforms. We cannot rely on macroeconomic policy to achieve it."
"That task must be entrusted to the structural reforms such as those appearing in the list that the European Commission has presented."
"With regard to the second report — the Stability and Growth Pact, the situation of public finances — which Mr Karas has just presented, I must point out that the negotiations within Ecofin are making very satisfactory progress: further progress was made at last week's meeting."
"There will be more meetings, of the Eurogroup on 7 March, and of Ecofin on 8 March, which are going to be very useful in terms of reaching an agreement."
"I am optimistic about the possibility of reaching an agreement at the European Council of 22 and 23 March which maintains the principles and reference values of the Treaty, as well as the pillars of fiscal and budgetary discipline laid down in the Treaty, which we must all respect."
"That agreement should improve the instruments so that the governance of the Stability and Growth Pact can prevent the failings we have experienced over recent years, contribute to helping the countries with excessive deficit problems to move towards adjustment, to comply with the reference values of the Treaty, both in terms of deficit and debt, to place more emphasis on sustainability and on the long term, because we are going to have to face the challenge of the ageing of the population and, at the same time, to create a better link between the budgetary discipline that continues to be a necessary element for growth and the growth strategy, more employment, sustainability — in other words the Lisbon Strategy — because the two strategies are linked to each other."
"Macroeconomic balance is a condition necessary to growth, but more policies are needed: structural reforms are needed."
"It will be very positive for the two important issues being debated in Parliament today and being debated in the Commission and in the Council to come together at the March European Council, so that we can reach a forward-looking agreement, improving the relationship between the two strategies and, of course, keeping a clear view of the principles of each of them."
"One of them being more sustainability, more social cohesion, more growth, more employment and more competitiveness; the other, better budgetary discipline and greater sustainability of public finances as a necessary basis for economic stability and in order to create the conditions that all investors, all wealth creators, need in order to look to the future with more confidence."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to say that the deficits in the public finances in a number of different countries are symptomatic of the problems in the national economies."
"We shall not solve that problem by permitting increased deficits."
"We should then, in actual fact, be in danger of undermining the stable condition for growth constituted by low interest rates."
"We would risk reducing the boost given to households by low interest rates, and we should weaken that basic condition for long-term growth also formed by low interest rates."
"It is therefore important to emphasise the importance of structural reforms, as the Commissioner also did in his speech."
"It is European economies that need flexibility, not our common rules."
"It is with common basic conditions for companies under construction that we can create new prosperity and new jobs."
"It is unfortunate that the Socialist Group in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs chose to abstain when we voted on Mr Goebbels’ report."
"The report now contains a number of practical proposals for creating higher potential for growth in Europe."
"We believe that improved basic conditions for work should exist, but not by the means mentioned just now by Mr Goebbels, namely through increasing people’s working time."
"We wish to bring about improved basic conditions for enabling more people to be in work and for enabling people to work for longer periods of their lives, as well as, if they so wish, for longer hours at different stages of their lives."
"This requires changes in terms of enterprise, research and the internal market."
"Right now, we are in a period of change that is significant because of the competition we see."
"Now, the important task is to ensure that we make the European economy still stronger through increased competition."
"We are concerned here with the Directive on Services and with making competition keener within a number of areas."
"That is our task, the goals being higher growth, more jobs and the best wages in Europe."
"Mr President, thank you. I think that Mr Karas was right in saying that in this debate, this Parliament is involved in a kind of battle about the direction we should take and in a debate about how to address macro-economic policy in the European Union."
"I often have the strong impression that in this debate, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as well as sections of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are busy fighting the previous battle and are still, while being wedged in old discussions, working out reforms about the Stability and Growth Pact and fail to face today’s challenges head-on."
"Moreover, I often have the impression that we are engaged in national politics and that this House pursues national discussions rather than focusing on the European dimension."
"My group prefers the approach for which the Commission has opted with regard to reforming the Stability and Growth Pact and also the approach that the Luxembourg Presidency has adopted in this regard."
"I would refer to the decisions taken by the ECOFIN Council on 13 September, which clearly favour reform of the Stability and Growth Pact within the context of wider discussions and also in relation to the Lisbon strategy and the global guidelines for economic policy."
"Reform of the Stability Pact should address the preventive aspects, the differences in economic developments in the Member States and the corrective aspects, while also promoting an improvement in the excessive deficit procedure."
"What is of key importance in this, though, and that is something which our group would like to emphasise and which President Bush echoed recently in the context of foreign policy, is that we should pursue true macro-economic policy in Europe and, in this respect, treat Europe as an economic unit, a single entity."
"I think that that should very much be part of macro-economic policy, that we do not in the first instance compete as Member States against each other, and create distinct profiles for ourselves which also need defending in terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, but that we opt for this European perspective and adopt economic policies in line with that."
"That is why close examination of the Lisbon strategy and also of its link with the reform of the Stability and the Growth Pact is necessary; that is also why my group is still keen to underline in that discussion that we should focus on investments and also on how we, within the parameters prescribed in that Stability and Growth Pact, should draw a distinction between current expenses and expenses that are really intended for investment in that knowledge economy that we seek as part of that Lisbon strategy."
"We do not want to do this in a way that Member States can decide how to do their accounts creatively, but by making choices that are clearly intended for Europe and by setting out a strategy at European level so that it is possible, for example, to depreciate investments made in the long term, as is customary in industry."
"We do hope that some of these points will be addressed in those reports and that this discussion will be followed up in the March plenary, when we will be reviewing the Lisbon strategy and preparing for the spring summit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a majority of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed on a largely balanced report, even if Mr Goebbels is distancing himself from that report today."
"I think it is important for us to ask the Commission to take the following four points on board."
"Firstly, there has been a considerable delay in implementing the Lisbon strategy."
"One of the reasons for this is that the strategy includes a large number of objectives."
"In November, the Kok group recommended concentrating on a limited number of priorities."
"That is a sensible strategy and one we support."
"We would encourage the Commission to concentrate its efforts on the priorities proposed by the Kok group, and the statements made by the Commission in this context give us grounds for optimism."
"We are also calling on the Commission to analyse best practice in the Member States and to learn from it."
"This best practice approach will make it possible, on the basis of successful examples in one Member State, to make recommendations to other Member States."
"Secondly, the Commission should concentrate even more on the completion of the internal market, in order clearly to demonstrate to consumers the concrete benefits of the European single market, in the form of better and cheaper products and services."
"There are still barriers to trade in some areas."
"This is indefensible both in terms of a properly functioning internal market and of fair competition."
"The public needs to see clear progress on this."
"Thirdly, we are not against reforming the Stability and Growth Pact, contrary to what Mr Goebbels has suggested, but we are opposed to watering down the pact, which guarantees not only the independence of the ECB but also the stability of the euro."
"We support the Commission’s wish to strengthen the preventive side of the pact, but that does not mean, as Mr Goebbels is perhaps suggesting, that it should be permissible to have a deficit of less than 3% when things are going well but to run up a deficit of over 3% in bad times."
"When the going is good, reserves should be built up so that the deficit criteria can also be complied with or only marginally exceeded in economically difficult times, so that the overall cumulative level of debt can be gradually reduced."
"I now come to my fourth and final point."
"The members of the ALDE Group on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs tabled an amendment on the necessary structural reforms in the Member States."
"Although that amendment was accepted, as the result of an error – on whose part I do not know – it was not incorporated into the final version."
"We would therefore like to table this amendment once again here in the plenary, as an oral amendment."
"The text of this amendment is as follows: the European Parliament recommends that the Member States should implement the long overdue structural reforms required to achieve the improvement in the investment climate that is a prerequisite for economic growth."
"What matters here is that we highlight the enormous importance of structural reforms for economic growth, and make it clear that responsibility for this lies with the Member States."
"It is high time that the EU overcame the problem of the continuing excessive commitment of resources to preserving outdated structures."
"Furthermore, the Member States should take targeted measures to bring the black economy under control, as it is an obstacle to healthy growth and stability."
"Only in that way can we make rapid progress towards achieving the Lisbon objectives."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, a well-respected French economist has recently published a book entitled ‘’ (The politics of powerlessness), and I believe that this is a feeling that many of our fellow citizens can justifiably empathise with. I would add, however, that the politics of powerlessness is in fact a deliberate strategy chosen since Maastricht, since 1992, which is broadly based on three axes: the structural reform of the markets – as we call it in our jargon – the reduction of public deficit and the focus on conquering external markets."
"Furthermore, as regards the institutions and the allocation of powers, the EU has exclusive competence in the area of competition law and monetary union; otherwise, the Member States must cope and must compete with one another."
"I feel that 15 years on – unfortunately, in my view – this institutional choice has been given succour by the Constitutional Treaty, a document that I endorse, even though it contains numerous gaps."
"15 years on, we have seen the results of this – or rather, a lack of results – in terms of growth, particularly the quality of growth, and in terms of job creation."
"Accordingly, Commissioner, our message as the ecologists’ group is that there really must be a change of strategy."
"We have the impression that discussions on the Stability and Growth Pact are conducted on the margins and that if we truly want to achieve the best results, we must pursue a more proactive policy at euro zone level, one in which ministers ultimately share a support framework based on more ambitious objectives and in which efforts are channelled into achieving convergence between the different national economies."
"As I do not have much time, I shall mention three of these objectives."
"The first objective, in my view, is to implement massive reductions in taxation on labour and to seek alternative ways of funding social security systems, taking account of the diverse nature of each country."
"I feel that it is very important, however, to be able to say to the citizens that people who work – people who have the opportunity to work – must be able to make a decent living from their work."
"I believe that this can be achieved by means of massive reductions in taxation on labour."
"The second objective – you will not be surprised to learn – is that we need high-quality growth, which means saving more energy and polluting much less."
"Please look at the Commission’s documents on the assessment of the Community’s sustainable development strategy: the results are abysmal, hence the urgent need for a sea change in this regard."
"Thirdly and lastly, we must support internal demand in the Union."
"There is no need to focus entirely on conquering external markets, as though the economy were made up solely of innovative large companies or small or medium-sized enterprises taking on the Chinese and Indian markets."
"Internal demand must be supported, which entails public and private investment and involves sending a clear message to the public authorities, both at EU and Member State level, that we are proud to be European and that we have established monetary union along with an internal market."
"What we now need is a genuine economic and social union that offers every citizen a future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, where European economic policy is concerned, we could of course continue on the same course."
"We could continue, on the pretext of allegedly necessary structural reforms, to tear Europe’s social structures apart, to force the unions to their knees with threats of high unemployment and ever more low-grade jobs, exposing more and more public services to market forces and thus limiting the services that are offered to those that the private sector can make a profit from."
"And we could also create a situation, thanks to a further round of tax dumping, whereby an employee on average earnings will soon be contributing more to the public purse than many a European company with profits running into billions."
"Although we could, of course, continue along this path and be guaranteed plaudits from those who gain from a policy of this kind, we should not try to fool the people of Europe into believing that this policy will promote growth and employment."
"Who could seriously believe that the extended working hours for which the report calls will create additional jobs instead of destroying yet more?"
"Who could seriously believe that further cuts in public investment will boost internal demand as opposed to sending more small and medium-sized enterprises to the wall?"
"Who could seriously believe, on the basis of our experience to date of privatisation, that it increases employment rather than cutting it?"
"It is true to say that the economic performance of most countries in Europe is unimpressive, but it is a lie to suggest that the cause for this is a lack of competitiveness."
"Labour costs have fallen in many European countries in recent years; this trend has been particularly marked in Germany, where employees have had to accept an average cut in real wages of over 2% in the course of the last 12 months."
"Has this meant that a particularly large number of jobs has been created in Germany?"
"Quite the opposite!"
"The unemployment rate has hit a new record high."
"The same, though, is true for exports, and not just in Germany."
"I say that because the only thing that the political priorities set out in the report before us can achieve is a further increase in the investment returns of European global players and export companies."
"That might please the European Round Table of Industrialists, but for most people it is a disaster."
"My group will never agree to a policy of this kind, but we will do everything we can to encourage opposition to it."
", . Mr President, Mr Goebbels' report is a frank admission of much that is wrong with the European Union."
"He has recognised that high economic growth is necessary to achieve low unemployment, to pay pensions and to achieve what is here called 'social cohesion' or 'social protection'."
"So why is growth so poor?"
"Several speakers have blamed the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Some say it is being interpreted too strictly and that governments are not spending enough."
"Others say the opposite, that we must stick to the Pact more tightly."
"They cannot both be right."
"I suggest that both sides are missing the point."
"Mr Goebbels says we will raise growth by promoting competition, enterprise, entrepreneurship, initiative, and risk-taking, particularly among small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"Let me analyse this."
"I agree that small businesses are important; large multinationals have all the influence, but create jobs outside the EU."
"However, I do not believe there is a shortage of small business opportunities, investment capital, or entrepreneurs who would be prepared to take risks in setting up businesses and taking on employees."
"So why is this not happening?"
"And why, when it does happen, do so many fail?"
"It is because we have gone out of our way to make it hard for them."
"Go and talk to small businessmen."
"You will hear the same story repeated everywhere: too much red tape and too many rules, particularly those connected with employing people."
"These difficulties occur because the whole spirit of the EU is to use centralised direction in a vain attempt to achieve an idealised society by making laws and restricting activity."
"Examples of this include the Working Time Directive and the large numbers of rules introduced to uphold various rights, each of which has the major effects of crushing enterprise and enriching lawyers."
"The whole ethos is biased against the employer."
"We all want high employment and to live in a compassionate, cohesive society."
"However, this is only possible when we have wealth."
"In trying to achieve our ideals by means of coercion, we kill off the source of our wealth."
"The whole model is in drastic need of revision."
"My colleagues in the other British political parties still cling to the idea that they will be able to persuade the European Union to change its ways."
"In the UK Independence Party we have recognised that this will not be possible."
"The only way to preserve some prosperity in Britain is to leave the EU."
"We want our EU neighbours to prosper too, but when they fail to do so because of blind adherence to a flawed model we would prefer not to be dragged down with them."
". Mr President, we have all seen the success of the internal market, where there is free movement of goods, persons, services and capital."
"It is clearly the case that the single European currency system is operating well."
"It commands the confidence both of the citizens of Europe and of the business and investor communities."
"For the European Union to succeed, there must be broad economic coordination from the 25 Member States."
"This is an integral part of the overall strategy to implement the Lisbon process, so as to guarantee that the European Union becomes the most competitive economy in the world by 2010."
"However, EU governments are going to have to hammer out an agreement as to how the rules governing economic and monetary union are going to operate into the future."
"The bottom line is that some countries are running up serious budget deficits, which is clearly in breach of EMU criteria."
"Some countries want the rules governing the operation of the single currency regime to be opened up and made more flexible."
"I feel that this is an issue at which EU governments should look carefully so as to ensure that they can build the necessary infrastructure projects in the transport, energy and telecommunications fields."
"I am not taking a belligerent approach with regard to the operation of EMU criteria, but we cannot allow the situation to go on forever where countries are running up large budget deficits and are clearly in breach of so-called strict rules governing the operation of the single currency regime."
"That undermines the credibility of the overall EMU framework."
"If the broader international investor community is to have maximum confidence in economic and monetary union within the EU, the EU must put its house in order."
"We have all seen how volatile currency markets can be."
"Either all countries comply with the rules and have confidence in the system or we will have a credibility problem with regard to the issue for an indefinite period."
"Mr President, I believe that the report before us is a further sign of the helplessness that has taken hold of the European Union."
"There are signs that things are starting to fall apart because of a wide variety of counteracting trends."
"Although the internal market is in place, we are lacking everything that we know is required for a reasonable economic policy, by which I mean the need for a minimum of common principles."
"The result is the greatest redistribution of financial assets in peacetime history. This does not only apply to this continent, although the situation here is particularly difficult, because we have a large middle class that is breaking up."
"I am therefore sorry to see that this report does not suggest any real approach for counteracting this."
"I believe that enlargement has come too soon, and that consequently we are promoting wages dumping, so that very many things we were warned about are now actually happening."
"The first approach to adopt must be to create genuine transparency, so as to ensure that these discrepancies are at least clear for all to see."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are discussing the Lisbon strategy and how Europe is intended to become the most competitive region in the world."
"We have not managed to achieve that over the last five years, and we have now identified the chief culprit: the Stability and Growth Pact!"
"People are saying that if we scrap the pact Europe will be better off, because that will enable us to make better progress."
"I have not heard anyone talking about the homework that needs to be done at national level, and about where the real culprits are to be found – in the Member States."
"Germany even believes that it is worth making higher net payments to Europe in return for the abolition of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Commissioner Almunia, your predecessor, the Spanish Socialist Mr Solbes, assured this House on several occasions that the Stability and Growth Pact is sufficiently flexible, and I am bound to agree with him."
"What I cannot accept is that we should keep the 3% and 60% criteria and then, as Chancellor Schröder has done, seek to have certain factors excluded in the run up to or even after the procedure."
"This is then sold to us under the Lisbon banner by saying that we no longer can or must take anything growth-intensive into account in the procedure from now on."
"It has to be taken into account."
"And Germany’s economists tell us that we will then end up with an 8% or 10% deficit."
"The appropriate sanctions are not being applied here."
"If we are to take Lisbon seriously, then we first have to take the Stability and Growth Pact seriously, and not use the argument that ten Member States are in breach of it."
"I would be delighted if speed limits were applied by saying that if you get caught too often by a speed trap, we will just raise the relevant speed limit so that not so many people are fined in future!"
"Rules are there to be respected."
"We need to take the Lisbon strategy seriously. We need to take it seriously when framing EU legislation, so that in future every new directive is checked to see whether it conflicts with the Lisbon objectives or promotes them."
"The Member States need to make sure that they do not torpedo legislation on the internal market when it is inconvenient for them, and the Commission must take to task those Member States that are at fault."
"The Commission should introduce benchmarking and announce this in the clearest possible terms."
"We in Europe have to realise that the world is not flat and that we are engaged in global competition."
"We need to finally react to this so that people are aware we are taking this subject seriously."
"– Mr President, Mr Karas is no longer here, but I would like to have said to him that I share the view that the EU is a Community of law."
"Above the Stability and Growth Pact is the Treaty, in which there is an article, which has not been changed, calling on Member States to consider their economic policy as a matter of common interest."
"Accordingly, growth throughout the euro zone is a matter of common interest and I do not feel that the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form is the instrument that we need."
"I would say to Mr Radwan that the question before us is not whether we are exceeding the speed limit, but whether we want to drive slowly in a Mercedes, and it strikes me that, at the moment, this is more or less the case with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I should like to make three comments on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Firstly, I feel that a good reform is one that provides the Union with a macroeconomic instrument with which to implement the Lisbon Strategy."
"Against this backdrop, the question of ‘taking expenditure into account’ will be high on the agenda."
"This is not a matter of opening street market-style negotiations, in which Member States compete to have their demands heard, but of finding where there can be added value for European growth, and only the Commission can tell us this, because the Commission embodies the common European interest."
"Secondly, there are those who say that, for accounting reasons, the manner in which one Member State or another pursues structural reforms in the area of retirement could come under the heading of ‘taking expenditure into account’."
"I feel that this is dangerous, given that, again for accounting reasons, this would lead us into debates that go to the heart of national cohesion."
"The third point I should like to make is that, in terms of the way in which we assess the situation in the Member States, it cannot in fact be said that everything takes place on a level playing field."
"The economic situation, as regards the Stability and Growth Pact, has a different meaning depending on the size of the country; it is inadequate to say that all Member States are alike when it comes to the Pact."
"Everyone in economic circles now accepts – although it remains frowned upon to say this in political circles – that the impact of using the budgetary instrument varies according to the size of a country’s economy."
"At the moment, two countries such as France and Germany are in a situation in which they are both responsible for and the victim of a state of affairs that no Member State, in the euro zone or in the EU as a whole, is taking advantage of."
"It is in nobody’s interest to see the economy of the euro zone weighed down by weak growth in the main economy of the euro zone."
"This runs counter both to the Treaty and to the Member States’ common interest."
"Thank you Mr President."
"I would like to say that at the moment we are debating two documents at the same time, which have in essence been prepared splendidly and which complement each other."
"They must form an economic foundation for the Stability and Growth Pact, for a third group of documents which we are debating and, you see, perhaps it would be worthwhile considering that if we wish to send a clear message to our citizens, the citizens of the European Union, the business community, and ultimately the international community, then perhaps we should devote more attention to some of the provisions in one document, which would lay the foundation for macroeconomic stability, the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It would be naive to think that we can maintain or consolidate the Stability and Growth Pact with some legal provisions or criteria."
"I say this with fifteen years of experience of the reforms which my country has implemented."
"We must not look for differences, if we wish to implement reforms, we must look for consensus."
"I believe that there are four points on which we can agree and our experience of reforms tells us that these may have a positive influence on economics."
"First of all we must devote attention to the investment required for productivity, because we need a particular kind of investment."
"We must devote attention to structural reforms, however these are impossible without fiscal measures."
"As unemployment appears during structural reforms, support is needed, but one cannot devote all one's attention to support alone, as otherwise the budget cannot be sustained."
"We must devote attention to the expansion of new businesses, that is we must try to simplify tax administration, so that minor companies and small business can work successfully in Europe."
"As for the fourth and most complicated point – we must be aware that cheap goods are pouring into Europe, we are surrounded by cheap manufacturing countries and we must begin to think about how we can reduce taxes, of course without upsetting the macroeconomic balance, because much can be achieved, as our experience of reforms has shown, through the implementation of better tax administration."
"It is no surprise that many countries encounter problems with profit transfer and value added tax reduction, however there are many ways to administer taxes better and reduce the burden of taxation, as the experience of our countries shows."
"I believe that this is the most successful way to use the knowledge we have accumulated."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, the reports on public finances in EMU and the state of the European economy do not under any circumstances take account of grass-roots problems which are common to the workers of the Member States in that their cause is the same: the anti-grass roots policy of the European Union."
"The fact that these are common problems is clear from the workers' demonstrations being held in most countries against the cost of living, unemployment, low wages, redundancies, the privatisation of the health, education and welfare sectors, longer working times, insecurity and uncertainty about the future."
"The rapporteurs, instead of replying to the foregoing, support stricter compliance with the Stability Pact, with extortionate tax and anti-grass roots austerity programmes to combat deficits."
"In other words, it is always the workers who pay, never the plutocracy."
"At the same time, they are calling for the anti-grass roots Lisbon strategy to be applied quickly, in order to promote greater exploitation of labour through part-time and temporary work, longer working hours, later retirement, the abolition of government participation in social security and the circumvention of collective agreements."
"This is the new redistribution of wealth, with even greater benefit for big business and even more inequality and injustice."
"They call for the European economy – by which they mean the profitability of the European monopolies – to be invigorated with new, harsher, more anti-grass roots austerity measures and for the workers to make greater sacrifices, for their own good, while demanding that governments reduce even the minimal social spending which remains and make immediate changes to insurance and pension systems which, as they say, are inadequate."
"These are the European Union philosophies and policies which cause the workers to express their feelings by staying away from elections, such as the European elections, for which there was a 40% turnout, or the recent referendum in Spain on the so-called European Constitution, for which there was a 35-40% turnout."
"These are signs which express the workers' feelings of indifference and that is why they are turning their back on the European Union."
"However, the best response is a fight in the form of organised disobedience to this policy and a counter-attack designed to bring about its radical change."
"Mr President, growth in the EU is clearly below what it potentially could be."
"The EU has high unemployment; it has a current account surplus in respect of other countries; and the figure for inflation is lower than that aimed for under monetary policy."
"As the report emphasises, there is a great need for structural reforms."
"The report does not, however, do enough to emphasise quite a few countries’ need for a more expansive policy."
"One cause of the unduly restrictive policy is the way in which the Stability and Growth Pact has been designed."
"In my opinion, it is wrongly constructed, which leads to an unduly restrictive policy in certain countries."
"The mistake lies in focusing too much upon the budget deficit."
"Instead, the focus should be on the debt ratio."
"A country with a debt ratio of less than 60% of GDP and which keeps inflation below 2% will have a decreasing debt ratio if its economy grows in real terms by one percentage point or more and if the budget deficit amounts to 3%."
"If a country’s economy grows by 5% and if inflation is at 2%, the nominal GDP will increase by 7%."
"The budget deficit could, then, amount to 7%, and the debt ratio would be stable in the case of such a deficit."
"Such a country would not put any strain on the eurozone."
"The increase in debt would be stable and therefore defensible in the long term."
"The country ought probably to have a sound credit rating and ought not to constitute any credit risk for the eurozone as a whole."
"Such a budget deficit is defensible in the long term."
"A limited deficit of 3% means that the national debt is continually decreasing as a percentage of GDP."
"Because a debt ratio of 60% of GDP is reasonable in economic terms, there is no reason to force such a financial restriction upon the country."
"It is only natural for new, rapidly growing countries to have significant deficits in their balance of current payments and capital imports."
"Private savings may perhaps not be sufficient; the state too may have a budget deficit."
"The conclusion to be drawn from this is that countries with debt ratios of less than 60% of GDP and with inflation under control should be allowed to grow more quickly and to conduct a more expansive policy."
"In this way, the whole of the EU would be given a boost."
"I recommend that the Stability and Growth Pact be altered along these lines."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the need for reform of the Stability Pact is also clear from the report on public finances in EMU."
"The Pact undoubtedly has an important role in terms of stability, but also needs to act as a stimulus to growth."
"We are aware that Ministers at the Ecofin Council meeting are preparing the text for the reform, but Parliament must not opt out of the debate."
"It would therefore be desirable, prior to the final decision by the Council, for Parliament to have an opportunity to express its views on the procedures for reform of the Pact by holding a debate on the subject."
"Since the debate in September, Parliament appears to have adopted a passive stance, whereas it should instead be exercising a key role in the reform process, above all allowing all Members and groups to give a clear outline of the possible strategies."
"We have to be practical and realistic."
"We cannot state in our documents that we have to become the most competitive economy in the world, while at the same time the figures are clearly showing growth to be stagnating."
"The Pact therefore has to be reformed."
"I refer to more flexible ways of applying the Pact during periods of economic difficulty, to the need to give due credit for the structural reforms undertaken by Member States, and, possibly, to allow expenditure on investments in support of the – still remote – objectives of the Lisbon strategy to be excluded."
"To conclude, I believe Parliament must resume an active role in this debate, as the only institution directly representing the citizens of the Union."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, laments the lack of coordination of economic policies. I agree with that, but I reach a different conclusion."
"Without those coordination rules, making the Stability Pact more flexible would be equivalent to breaking it and breaking the Stability Pact would mean neutralising the Central Bank’s efforts to maintain prices, it would mean rises in interest rates, it would mean a delay in growth, which is what we all want, a delay in the implementation of the structural reforms and, more dangerously, a serious threat to the welfare state."
"The resources we spend on paying interests and paying off public debt will mean less resources for guaranteeing finances."
"What we need at the moment is more employment and more productivity."
"More employment, above all, means paying attention to those sectors of the population with most difficulties and we know that they are women, young people between 15 and 25 years old and people over 55."
"And more productivity means more investment, more effort in investment and development and more effort in education and professional training with a view to increasing the productivity of work."
"The Commissioner’ speech also reminds me – to quote Mr Goebbels once again – of those speeches of the defunct Soviet Union that said that the transition to socialism would inevitably end the following year."
"When they became aware that that transition was possible, they concluded that the transition was complete and that they had already arrived at communism."
"A few years later the Iron Curtain fell."
"There is no need to weaken macroeconomic stability, but it is essential that we continue to insist more strongly, more vigorously, on structural reforms as the only guarantee, the only serious formula, for achieving growth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Karas said earlier that we are dealing here with decisions about our future direction, and he is quite right there."
"However, you can only make decisions about your direction if you can see the horizon."
"To be capable of making decisions about future direction, you have to be up to date in your analysis and your proposals, and I can tell most of the Members in the Conservative group that they, of all people, are not up to date with their proposals in these two reports, and not in a position to see the horizon."
"You know very well that the Economic Policy Guidelines are the most tedious document to emerge from Brussels year after year."
"So what are your proposals in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to modernise this instrument?"
"Where is your contribution to a meaningful debate?"
"Structural reforms, I hear you say!"
"Quite right!"
"Europe and its Member States need structural reforms."
"But you know very well that structural reforms can only work, and can only lead to more growth and higher employment if they form part of an active industrial policy, part of an active policy for small and medium-sized enterprises and part of a budgetary policy appropriate to our economic situation."
"I feel like weeping when I look at your proposals."
"You should read your texts through once before you adopt them, that would be a great help!"
"You want a general reduction in the level of taxation."
"It would be better if you were to discuss a decent policy for SMEs with us rather than putting this sort of nonsense in your reports."
"You want everyone to work longer hours."
"Why not help us to increase the employment rate, so that more people are in work?"
"Europe stands to gain more from that."
"That is why you can only hope to get our agreement if you vote for some reasonable amendments."
"Otherwise we cannot support this nonsense."
"– Mr President, the EU’s economic policy is currently made up of three elements: a platonic ambition – the Lisbon Strategy; a despised constraint – public spending controls; and a demand that has been ignored – support for purchasing power."
"The Lisbon Strategy is a platonic ambition."
"Who could not support the objectives set in Lisbon?"
"Who could not be in favour of a knowledge-based economy, of better training for people, of progress in research and development and of an innovation-based society?"
"Who would not be in favour of these objectives?"
"Who, on the other hand, cannot see that the term open cooperation is an empty shell?"
"Open cooperation is nothing but the free policy of States that, from time to time, make imaginary appointments with the European Union, and the Council, the Commission and Parliament are reduced to institutions of comment and disapproval."
"We will not win the game this way."
"Controls on public spending are a despised constraint."
"Behind a supposed dispute between Keynesians and liberals on the issues of the instruments of short-term economic policy and the use of public spending, for 25 years we have seen public spending spiral out of control and systematic deterioration, in a number of large countries, particularly in terms of debt, which prevents our children from taking control of their own futures."
"This is tantamount to death, or the past, taking away life, or the future."
"The European Central Bank (ECB) stands unjustly accused in this case."
"What do we blame the ECB for?"
"We blame it for excessively high interest rates, yet they have never been so low since the war; and for the policy of an excessively strong euro, a situation that has obviously been brought about by US policies of systematic deficit and not by the supposed good qualities of the Europeans."
"The truth is that the ECB scarcely has the resources."
"Then there is the Stability and Growth Pact, which is an instrument to be reformed."
"What do we blame the Stability and Growth Pact for?"
"We blame it for being stupid and malicious."
"If this is the case, then let us endeavour to make it less stupid, whilst retaining its binding nature."
"I shall finish, Mr President, by mentioning a demand that had been ignored – stimulating purchasing power."
"Who cannot see that we are currently in a system in which employees have less and less money and purchasing power in comparison with shareholders?"
"There are potential remedies, such as spreading share ownership and reducing taxes for workers, yet these remedies are ignored."
"My fear, Mr President, is that the institutions and the EU will be reduced to being the chorus in a classical tragedy in which the actual protagonists are the national governments."
"– In light of the reality of the deteriorating economic and social situation in most EU countries, the Stability and Growth Pact is finally being called into question, albeit late in the day, and only when France and Germany have failed to comply."
"Better late than never, though."
"Unfortunately, the perspectives that have been set out for the 8 March ECOFIN Council will mean more of the same when they come to be implemented."
"The so-called flexible application of the Stability and Growth Pact would depend on a country’s greater or lesser capacity to place at risk public social security, pension and health systems and, as some people have pointed out, public administration reforms."
"In other words, the more a Member State implements policies and objectives enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy that we consider extremely onerous, the greater its flexibility to implement the Stability Pact, and this would be unacceptable."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will not be able to explore the subject in depth in the short time available to me, so I shall merely highlight a number of issues."
"Firstly, the money and energy that are being wasted on excessive and all too often absurd bureaucracy represent a major constraint on the EU’s economic development."
"Secondly, there should be a thorough study of the tax systems in the Member States, with one of the aims of the exercise being to find out whether the VAT system currently in force is the best solution."
"There may well be other more effective taxes, and indeed experience has taught us that this is the case."
"Thirdly, a systematic analysis of the economic situation of the EU as a whole and of the individual Member States must be carried out every three or four years and feedback given, in order both to identify any progress achieved and to make it possible to react quickly enough to any problems."
"Fourthly, there is a severe lack of funding for research aimed at fostering economic development."
"Finally, I should like to turn to an issue that has not yet been touched upon."
"All this intense economic debate and all the ever so clever schemes proposed and which have given rise to such concern will be so much hot air unless real steps are taken to prevent the impending demographic disaster in the EU."
"I am not making empty threats. Members of this House need only stir themselves to look at the population statistics."
"Although these do not make easy reading, there is no mistaking the warning they contain."
"Whereas today there are four persons of working age to support every person of retirement age, in 30 years' time two persons will have to do so, and the question arises as to whether this is feasible."
"We should not forget that the family, which includes both parents and children, is the most basic economic unit."
"The 1992 Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker has gone so far as to say that the family, and work carried out within the family, account for as much as 30% of national income."
"The French economic Jean-Didier Lecaillon has made similar comments, and I could give examples of others, notably by John Paul II, whose voice carries particular weight."
"Charles de Gaulle is recognised by all as a true statesman, and he was entirely serious when he said that if you are poor and have no other options, you must invest in the family. ."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, this report provides a host of proposals to do away with the deficit that was created when the Lisbon strategy was carried out."
"I would specifically like to express my appreciation for paragraph 7 of the report, which underlines the important role that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) actually play in the creation of jobs and prosperity in general."
"It is of major importance that a climate be created which encourages the entrepreneurial spirit among young people, a climate in which the administrative burden and the tax burden are substantially reduced and in which SMEs have easier access to risk capital."
"Another conclusion is that the report does not breathe a word about the Commission’s Green Paper on economic immigration."
"That is just as well, certainly in view of the current level of unemployment."
"The Commission’s plea to admit and stimulate new immigration is blinkered, counterproductive, but also totally misplaced, even though the Commission refers to the Lisbon objectives to table that proposal."
"– Mr President, my fellow members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will certainly be delighted to know, given the nature of this debate, that Mr Goebbels opened up to the Luxembourg press, saying that their amendments adopted in committee reflected the ‘fundamentally reactionary and neoliberal nature of these two groups in Parliament’."
"The outlandish nature of these words has, of course, a somewhat laughable element: it suggests that this House is, at the very least, made up of hardcore reactionaries."
"Yet there is also reason to be concerned about these words."
"In this House, the Socialist Group willingly cultivates a certain degree of ambiguity when it comes to the principles of economic policy."
"With the socialists, this ambiguity turns to actual loathing."
"Personally, I do not think it is superfluous to point out in this debate that the conditions for sound, sustainable development are created by sound public finance and by reasonable compulsory deductions."
"Stability is not an obstacle to growth; it is a prerequisite to growth."
"On our side of this House, we do not succumb to the same weakness for ideological blindness. We show much greater pragmatism."
"There are situations in which more interventionist policies turn out to be necessary in order to reinvigorate the economy, but that is not the point here."
"The current situation in which Europe finds itself scarcely fits into that pattern."
"Having discovered Keynesianism a little too late, Mr Goebbels would like to bring it into all recipes and all sauces, even when it is not called for."
"Increasing supplementary budget deficits does not provide a solution to our current problems."
"If this were the case, the countries known for their financial and budgetary slackness would have long since been held up as the example to follow."
"Lastly, it is not a crime to say that Europeans have a duty to work harder and better in order to guarantee their standard of living in the face of global competition, Mr Bullmann."
"The exemplary nature of the French 35-hour week says more than any lengthy discourse on the subject."
"Of course, Mr Goebbels put forward a number of good ideas in his report – such as encouraging certain types of investment in social services or in sustainable development – but he seems ill at ease with the crux of the issue, which is that economic efficiency follows clearly defined rules and that it is dangerous to overlook them."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like to say how sorry I am that the representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Hökmark, has left the debate."
"I believe that the proposal arrived at by the committee is unacceptable for us Social Democrats for three reasons."
"Firstly, no general increase in working time is required."
"What we need is more people in work, not a general increase in working time."
"Secondly, a comprehensive reduction in tax in Europe would not solve the problems."
"How can it be that the Nordic countries, which have the heaviest burden of taxation, have the highest growth in the EU?"
"This suggests that the PPE-DE Group has completely lost the plot."
"Thirdly, we need a balance in the Lisbon Process."
"Those making the proposal, as it now stands, are even worse than the Commission in the way that, in general, they emphasise only the first pillar of the Lisbon Process when what is required is reciprocity between the pillars."
"I share the view that structural reforms are needed, but what is most important is that, in the process, social responsibility should be accepted and both sides of industry involved."
"Mr Hökmark comes from Sweden, where his party is nowadays cosying up to the Social Democrats."
"In the national debate at home, they do not talk about tax reductions or an increase in working time."
"They do so in this House, however."
"Sweden has had an extremely successful economic policy during the post-War period, with the single exception of during the years 1991–1994."
"Mr Hökmark was one of Sweden’s policymakers at that time."
"It would be regrettable if the PPE-DE Group were to adopt this neo-liberal policy and make it its own."
"The result would be political antagonism."
"We Social Democrats want to see a balanced, rather than a neo-liberal, policy."
"A neo-liberal policy will not solve Europe’s problems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time we have ever been faced with a situation in which a majority of Member States, or in other words 13 out of 25, are outside the euro zone instead of within it."
"Interest rates in Europe are also at their lowest levels since the Second World War, and yet this is not acting as any kind of incentive to investment."
"We need to recognise the fact that the eurozone is experiencing slow economic growth."
"We already know that domestic consumption will remain low for the next two years, and this is true for the EU as a whole."
"At the same time, since enlargement there has been a significant rise in the economic aspirations of citizens, and in particular of those in the new EU Member States, such as my country, Poland."
"These aspirations are at odds with a poor economic situation in which it is impossible to meet consumers’ expectations."
"In political terms this may result in a rise in Euroscepticism over time, and indeed this is made all the more likely by the fact that all projections, including those quoted in the Goebbels report, suggest that unemployment levels will remain high in the immediate future."
"EU citizens expect the real economic growth they have repeatedly been promised in recent years, for example at EU summits."
"Yet they also expect justice and equal treatment for all Member States."
"By condoning large budget deficits in countries such as Germany or France, but coming down heavily on other weaker and poorer countries if they dare to have a deficit, the EU is putting into practice an idea familiar to us from Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’, namely that all men are equal, but some are more equal than others."
"This does nothing to bolster the EU’s authority in the eyes of the other Member States."
"In short, it is a scandal."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues Mr Goebbels and Mr Karas for their work in preparing the reports on public finances."
"As we know, growth in the EU has not been as good as we expected."
"The decrease in the share of GDP used for private and public investments in comparison with the 1970s is drastic, as our colleague Mr Karas described."
"Due to a lack of structural reforms and low investment, growth in GDP is not satisfactory."
"However, we cannot rely only on public investment to stimulate growth: we must give incentives to stimulate private investment, which is the real source of sustainable growth in Europe."
"At the heart of this debate is the future of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The goal of the Pact was to balance the budgets of Member States and to create budget surpluses by 2003."
"The idea behind this was for the Member States to pay off their debts in the good times and to ensure, by reforming the structures of the public sector, that their budgets could be kept balanced in the bad times as well."
"However, it is not easy for us politicians to restrain ourselves from increasing spending in good times."
"Unfortunately this shows in the poor results of many Member States with regard to the Pact."
"I am strongly in favour of the Pact."
"The Member States who have done their share and have kept their public finances in check – especially my country, Finland – have to suffer as a result of the irresponsibility of the Member States that just do not care!"
"Unfortunately it now seems inevitable that some elements of flexibility will be added to the Pact."
"However, we should be wary of watering down the Pact."
"Three issues should be kept in mind."
"Firstly, the rules should be same for all Member States and the criteria should be objective."
"Secondly, no expenditure, such as public investments or research funding, should be automatically excluded from public expenditure: these exceptions would provide an opportunity for Member States to interpret them in a very innovative way."
"Thirdly, the flexibility accorded to the Member States should be bound to reforms they have carried out in good times."
"It is only fair that those Member States that have paid their debts and have reduced their deficits should have some flexibility, but those who have not done anything should not be given any more room for manoeuvre."
"I hope that good common sense will win out and that the Stability and Growth Pact will remain; and, if any changes are made to it, at least let us direct them in a favourable direction."
"Mr President, the proposed changes to the Stability and Growth Pact are intended to make tax rules within the European Union more flexible and practical, whilst upholding the fundamental principle of budgetary discipline."
"I believe these changes are a step in the right direction, but I should like to highlight three related issues."
"Firstly, the Commission proposals mainly focus on current budget deficit, whilst attaching less importance to public debt."
"I believe that the opposite should be the case, as the most important factor determining long-term financial stability is the size of the debt in relation to gross national product, and not the deficit in any given year."
"This means that tighter deficit limits should be set for countries with very high levels of debt than for those with low levels of debt."
"The latter can afford to run a higher deficit on a short-term basis, and should not be punished for having stuck to the rules in the past."
"Levels of debt should therefore be a more important criterion than current deficit."
"Secondly, the method used to calculate deficits must make allowance for the particular situation of those of the new Member States that have embarked upon the difficult task of reforming their pension systems."
"In these countries, expenditure associated with these reforms has risen on a temporary basis because it is necessary both to finance current pensions and to establish pension funds for future generations."
"This expenditure should not be treated as current public expenditure for the purposes of the Stability and Growth Pact, as it does not increase current demand, but instead contributes to national savings."
"New Member States should not be punished for carrying out difficult structural reforms."
"Thirdly, I should like to suggest to the Commissioner that consideration be given to excluding expenditure associated with payments into the EU budget when establishing the principles according to which deficits will be calculated for the purposes of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Although it is true that such expenditure increases demand throughout the EU, it also helps implement the key principle of solidarity."
"Such a solution could also make it easier to reach a compromise on the size of the European Union’s budget for 2007-2013."
"I would note that one of the reasons why certain Member States are calling for a ‘small’ budget is because they are net contributors to the EU budget."
"Many thanks."
"– Mr President, we are talking about competitiveness, but competitiveness relates directly to currency exchange rates."
"We have allowed the euro to become overpriced in relation to the dollar."
"It has risen from 0.84 to 1.30, causing extensive damage to our competitiveness."
"The Central Bank has basically sacrificed competitiveness, where we are lagging behind, in order to reinforce stability, where we are fine."
"In other words, we have protected the point at which we are strong and left the point at which we are weak exposed."
"Thus, the expensive euro has exacerbated the recession."
"The recession has reduced the inclination of companies to take investment risks and adopt innovations."
"In other words, what good is the Lisbon strategy?"
"Look at what the Americans, Russians, Chinese and Indians are doing."
"While all our competitors are focusing on competitiveness and growth, we are focussing on waste and debt."
"All of them are achieving higher returns than us, while we are wallowing in chronic recession."
"Perhaps we should start to question our economic policy mix?"
"As long as the present mix continues, the Lisbon strategy and the Stability Pact will become more and more mutually incompatible."
"Keep the Lisbon strategy, but make sure the monetary policy applied by the Central Bank also helps."
"Keep the Stability Pact, as long as the emphasis is on restraining expenditure, not increasing income."
"The European Central Bank needs to relax monetary policy so that the Member States can tighten up their public finance policy, especially on the spending side."
"Then, whatever active demand loses in public spending, it will gain from increased exports and we shall avoid tax increases."
"This is a policy mix that combines prudence and growth but, if we are to achieve it, the Central Bank also has to cooperate."
"Of course we need prudence, but prudence is one thing and inflexibility is another."
"As long as we confuse prudence with inflexibility, we shall have neither prudence, nor growth nor competitiveness."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the Goebbels report and would like to congratulate our fellow Member on his excellent approach to the topic, with its focus on striking a balance between the obvious need to revitalise economic and growth policy in Europe and the aim of stability and the conditions for achieving it."
"However, during the course of the debate, this balance has been lost and can only be restored if we behave reasonably, as recommended by Mrs Lulling earlier."
"It is not reasonable to approve a report which does not face up to the need for greater coordination of the economic policies of Member States, nor can we agree that a statement of this sort goes against the autonomy of the monetary authorities."
"It is not reasonable to approve a report which makes no reference to reform of the Stability Pact and its link with the Lisbon objectives, at a time when we are patently moving towards an agreement."
"It is not reasonable to state that a general reduction in the tax burden is vital for competitiveness, if we look at the excellent results of countries with both heavy and light tax burdens."
"In any event, I wonder if the European Parliament should really be recommending a general and generic cut in taxes when no Member State would consider such a proposal credible in current circumstances."
"Similarly, no one would reasonably state that a general and generic increase in working hours would be viable or effective."
"Linking the liberalisation and improvement of services too closely with their privatisation only risks increasing resistance to any process aimed at liberalising the market."
"To conclude, I believe the document contains some important pointers and is a creditable effort, but on certain issues the balance needs to be restored, leaving ideological claims aside and thereby making a useful contribution to the debate on the economy now being conducted throughout Europe."
"Mr President, the Member States have committed themselves to bringing their budgets close to balance or into surplus."
"That is a commitment under the Stability and Growth Pact, and countries such as Germany have breached it by running up deficits."
"Although they give cyclical problems as their excuse, they have failed to make the necessary structural reforms."
"What the then German Finance Minister Theo Waigel secured agreement to in 1997 in the interests of Europe was a seriously meant guarantee of stable prices, budgetary discipline and the ability to react to structural changes, such as the need to finance a society with an increasingly elderly age profile."
"This was not about neo-liberal politics of the left, it was also in the interests of the workforce."
"The Luxembourg Presidency announced a modification of the pact, not any easy task."
"Berlin wants to abolish the excessive deficit procedure, while the smaller countries in the euro area are quite rightly insisting that this pact should be observed to the letter."
"They have done their homework."
"Mr Juncker told the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that there was no question of changing the 3% threshold and the excessive deficit procedure."
"I am also in favour of the Commission keeping its powers in this area, from sending ‘blue letters’ to imposing fines."
"You, unfortunately, have announced an ‘intelligent interpretation’ of the pact."
"Does that not represent a watering down?"
"You quite rightly said that Greece must be held to account if it again submits falsified data."
"Please correct me if I am wrong, but, shortly afterwards, you led the Germans to believe that they could treat the cost of reconstructing the East as a special liability that could be taken out of the calculation."
"At that, other countries came along and said that their own investment in education, military installations or infrastructure should also be excluded."
"Once you enter the realms of creative accounting in this way, you can relegate the pact to the waste paper bin."
"You are just juggling figures and not providing any guarantee to Europe’s citizens."
"I support my colleague Mr Karas’ excellent report; we must not play fast and loose with confidence in the euro."
"Mr President, this is a constructive report by Mr Goebbels and the committee that presented it."
"I also wish to thank Commissioner Almunia for a thoughtful contribution and for his commitment to a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, as presented."
"My contribution in this House today will focus upon two of the most important issues for Europe."
"The Conservatives and Liberals here in Parliament focus upon structural reforms – about which we are prepared to negotiate, I should like to say – not only in the European Parliament but also in our individual states."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, of which I am the President, does not oppose reforms. We want to see the correct reforms."
"I would add one thing, however: Europe’s main problems do not only include the need for structural reforms; its second big problem is that demand in our countries is too low."
"I would make a genuine and urgent appeal to the leaders of the right-of-centre European parties."
"My personal experience as a prime minister and as a party president in Europe is that we do not get our people’s support for reforms if there is not simultaneous demand and growth in our societies; or, to put it another way: there can be no successful reforms without economic growth, and no sustainable economic growth without reforms."
"I would therefore make a very urgent appeal for the European dimension to be introduced."
"What is the European dimension?"
"What the European dimension genuinely involves is our learning to do things simultaneously."
"There is a shortage of demand in the internal market, and this is something that we can remedy at the same time if all the finance ministers, together with Mr Almunia, decide to invest in the Lisbon objectives over the next four years."
"In that way, we should obtain the extra growth we need."
"We have documented matters, and it would be fantastic if the right-of-centre parties too here in Parliament could appreciate that we must invest and that we must implement reforms and that we must do these things simultaneously."
"Mr President, I agree with the analyses expressed here this morning insisting on Europe’s need for more growth and more employment."
"More growth to confront the challenges facing us as Europeans: the challenge of enlargement, the challenge of creating jobs for our women and young people."
"More growth so that Europe can play the leading role it deserves in the world economy, since, otherwise, the world economy will not have balanced growth."
"As Mr Rasmussen has just emphasised, that means that European consumers and European investors need more confidence, they need confidence policies, policies, in short, on which to base their consumption and investment decisions."
"In turn, that confidence requires healthy public finances and budgetary balance."
"Budgetary balance means less taxes for workers and for small and medium-sized businesses, less taxes in order to compete more successfully within the globalised world economy."
"Making the Stability Pact more flexible would be a grave error and, Mr Almunia, Commissioner, the press coverage of the debates in Ecofin are not inspiring confidence; the confrontation amongst European governments in relation to promoting the flexibility of the Stability Pact sends a negative message in terms of the confidence of the markets."
"Together with a firm Stability Pact, we need structural reforms."
"We need a more flexible economy, not ultimately one that is good for the few, but a balanced economy which supports our growth on the basis of flexibility and competitiveness."
"Mr President, Mr Rasmussen said that reforms are not possible without economic growth."
"The reverse is also true: economic growth in Europe is not possible without reforms."
"Particularly in Germany and France, which are major states with an excessively high government activity rate, high taxes and overly complex social systems, reforms are a prerequisite for economic growth."
"We are today discussing the Goebbels and Karas reports, in which the difficulties we face with a common monetary policy combined with decentralised budgetary and finance policies become apparent."
"The Stability and Growth Pact was created as a linking mechanism and as a prerequisite."
"The political intention to reform the Stability and Growth Pact will shake the very foundations of the Maastricht Treaty and of European monetary union."
"The budget policy rules are among the cornerstones of Economic and Monetary Union."
"The citizens of Europe were given an undertaking that state borrowing would be reduced, an undertaking that after just six years is being reneged upon."
"The objective of these rules is to maintain credibility and trust regardless of the government in power at any given time. There is, however, a serious design flaw in the Stability and Growth Pact, one on which you, Commissioner, have repeatedly failed to comment."
"Where the monitoring procedure is concerned, the Commission has too few powers and responsibilities."
"The guilty parties are sitting in judgment on themselves, which does not bode well."
"If the ECOFIN Council does not apply the rules to itself, the Commission is powerless."
"If there is no will to apply budgetary discipline, reforms will not help either."
"This is not just a question of rules, but also of political will."
"The Commission wants to introduce new rules for economically good times."
"There may be some justification for that, but it is naïve."
"If the existing means of bringing pressure to bear do not work, how can we expect this to work voluntarily when the economic situation is favourable?"
"The Social Democrats and the Communists have failed to understand the changes that the euro has brought about."
"Before the euro existed, the market punished highly indebted states in an open and easily understandable way, by means of high interest rates for government borrowing, high inflation rates and devaluation."
"As recently as 1992 there were differences of six percentage points."
"Just listen, please!"
"You know I am right."
"Six percentage points!"
"That difference no longer exists."
"There are no longer market forces that compel states to adhere to financial discipline."
"Unless the ECB tackles this problem by means of a system of differentiated assessment of state loans, the euro will not remain stable in the long run."
". Mr President, I would like to thank all the honourable Members who have spoken for their contributions to the debate, which I have found very interesting."
"I would like to conclude by reiterating the Commission’s analysis."
"At several points during the debate, thoughts have been attributed to the Commission that neither I nor the Commission agree with."
"The Commission and I believe that the main challenge in terms of increasing growth in the European Union and in the eurozone is to increase the growth potential."
"That requires structural reforms such as those the Commission has proposed in its Communication on the review and revitalisation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"If we do not increase the growth potential, the medium- and long-term sustainability of our economy and our social model will not be possible and short-term macroeconomic stability and budgetary stability will be seriously jeopardised by the lack of growth."
"So that is our analysis and, on that basis, macroeconomic policy, as the Kok report states — and I completely agree on this point — must support a strategy of structural reforms which increases growth potential in order to sustain that growth and in order to prevent the lack of liquidity, funding and demand from jeopardising our ability to take advantage of all the growth possibilities that we have achieved as a result of the reforms."
"The Commission believes success in the revitalisation of the Lisbon strategy to be a priority and to this end we have proposed ten priorities and we have considered how to improve the capacity of each of the Member States to implement the Lisbon strategy in accordance with their particular situations, so that we can achieve the objectives we all agree on in all of those states and throughout the European Union. These objectives have not been reduced in the Commission's communication, and have been confirmed just as they were defined five years ago."
"With regard to the Stability Pact, Mr President, I would like to make a few clarifications."
"I believe we should understand what is happening over the current few weeks, during which the Council, with the support of the Commission by means of the excellent cooperation with the Luxembourg Presidency, is trying to reach an agreement in order to improve the way we apply our budgetary discipline mechanisms in practice and in order to ensure that the objectives pursued by the Treaty, where it defines budgetary stability as one of the conditions of the Economic and Monetary Union, become a more positive and obvious reality than they are at the moment."
"What are we doing?"
"Firstly, we are reiterating our firm and clear commitment to the reference values laid down in the Treaty."
"3% is laid down in the Treaty and the Commission will ensure that that reference value is respected."
"I would like to make it clear once again, and I will continue to do so whenever necessary, that neither the Commission's proposal nor the currently unanimous position of all the Ecofin ministers, proposes excluding any category of spending from the calculation of the deficit."
"What we are considering, in accordance with Article 104 of the Treaty, is what important factors should be taken into account when analysing why there has been excessive deficit and what should be done in order to recover the situation of balance, the sustainability of the public finances, in order to bring the level of deficit below the reference value."
"It is possible to distinguish, as we are doing precisely in this debate, between not excluding any category of spending and at the same time taking into account economic factors, from the composition of public spending, the situation of the cycle, the structural reforms underway, in order to see how the preventive part of the pact is applied, how public finances stand in terms of medium- and long-term balance or, in terms of the excessive deficit procedure, what recommendations are truly effective in terms of a country in a situation of excessive deficit recovering its budgetary balance."
"To this end, it is extremely important, and this is the second key element in our discussion, to prevent the application of the pact leading in practice to pro-cyclic policies, both in the preventive part and in the corrective part of the excessive deficit procedure."
"One of the most obvious reasons why certain countries have broken the 3% of deficit rule is that, when they were at positive points in their economic cycle, they did not apply pro-cyclic policies, they did not sufficiently consolidate their public finances, and there are instruments in the Treaty such as early warnings, which furthermore are strengthened in the Constitution and directly attributed to the Commission, which must be used more effectively."
"Furthermore, each Member State must establish national rules which supplement the peer pressure on those making decisions at national level on the composition of revenue and budgetary spending and thus the budgetary deficit of each of the Member States, which, I would remind you, is still a national competence, although, as Mrs Berès said, the combined result of those national budgetary policy decisions is of common interest, since we are in an Economic and Monetary Union."
"With regard to the excessive deficit procedure, and this is the most difficult point in our discussion, we are discussing how that procedure should be launched."
"I shall reiterate our position: no spending will be excluded from the calculation of the level of deficit."
"But if you read Article 104 of the Treaty once again, you will see that, once the European Commission informs the Council that a certain country is, in its judgement, in a situation of excessive deficit, the Council has full powers, following an overall assessment — Article 104(6) of the Treaty — to decide ‘‘whether an excessive deficit exists’."
"We are trying to ensure that the criteria the Commission uses when informing the Council that a country is in a situation of excessive deficit coincide with the criteria the Council then uses, in order to prevent any further clashes such as those which have occurred in the past."
"So that while respecting the functions and competences of the Commission — and the Commission is not going to give up any of the competences attributed to it by the Treaty — and also those of the Council — which is not going to give up any of the competences attributed to it by the Treaty either — within the context of that relationship, that cooperation, there are no clashes which paralyse the procedure, leading to conflicts such as those which arose just over a year ago."
"Governance is very important. It is very important that there be national rules which complement the ownership efforts of the Member States in relation to the common budgetary discipline rules."
"It is very important that we have clear, reliable and accurate statistics, as we have seen recently."
"It is very important that there be cooperation between the two institutions, the Council and the Commission, and it is extremely important that there be support and debate in Parliament, such as the one taking place today, and there will undoubtedly be further such debates in the future."
"It is very important that we reach an agreement."
"You have mentioned, and I share this concern, the credibility of the Economic and Monetary Union and, in particular, the credibility of our single currency on the markets."
"The markets will not understand if there is no agreement in the March European Council, and all of us, each according to our respective responsibilities, must make the greatest possible effort to ensure that that agreement is concluded and published on 23 March in the European Council's conclusions."
"For its part, the Commission will make every possible effort in that direction."
"I shall end by acknowledging the excellent cooperation we are enjoying with the Presidency of the Council, which is firmly committed to achieving that success."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading on the common position adopted by the Council on 21 October 2004 with a view to adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 1419/1999/EC establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture event for the years 2005 to 2019."
"Mr President, Commissioner, nearly 20 years ago, on 13 June 1985, the idea of the European Capital of Culture was submitted to the Council of Ministers of Culture at the instigation of Melina Mercouri, the then Greek Minister of Culture, and the relevant resolution was duly adopted."
"Her aim was to make specific cultural aspects of the city, region or country concerned accessible to the European public."
"After 20 years of the European Capital of Culture programme, we can draw some conclusions, as identified in the Palmer study of August 2004."
"There is no doubt that being selected as a European Capital of Culture has a positive impact on the city concerned as regards new cultural initiatives, the expansion of cultural infrastructure, artistic endeavours and trends, its reputation, its international status and the scope for further cultural development. This goes hand-in-hand with an increase in the number of visitors and receipts, but also in expenditure."
"Although the European Capital of Culture has a special attraction for people interested in culture, the European aspect has not totally caught on."
"The cultural dimension is often overshadowed by political ambitions, and the European dimension has not always been in the forefront."
"The Capital of Culture can only be a sustainable project if it is integrated into the development of the city as part of a long-term cultural development strategy."
"A great deal has changed over the last 20 years as regards cultural and artistic development in cities, particularly in the European Union, making it necessary to amend the decision adopted at that time."
"For example, the sequence of cities to be nominated up to 2019 does not take account of the 10 new Member States which joined the EU on enlargement in May last year."
"However, in order not to upset the sequence that has now been established, there is a proposal that for each year a city from one of the new Member States should be added in, so as to create a balance."
"We could not justify making these countries wait until 2019 for their turn."
"The common position before us is deficient in some respects and does not meet all the requirements needed to implement the changes in a more open, democratic and transparent way."
"However, in order not to jeopardise the preparatory work in hand for the cultural capitals in 2009, 2010 and subsequent years – and especially those in Austria and Germany – I would urge you to approve this common position at second reading, on condition that the Commission, which has already promised this and has started work on it, brings forward a new draft by June this year at the latest."
"This new proposal should meet the following requirements: the level of financial resources will need to be adjusted if there are to be two cultural capitals as from 2009; the present level of financial commitment ranges from EUR 200 000 and EUR 1 million per project."
"Clear criteria need to be established in order to provide the highest level of funding possible."
"At present, an average of EUR 500 000 is granted per cultural capital, which in the case of a budget proposal such as that being put forward by Linz corresponds to a contribution of 0.83%."
"The European Union is certainly not making a generous contribution here."
"I would plead for a fixed contribution of EUR 1 million per cultural capital if all the criteria have been met."
"This should be taken into account as regards the financial endowment and in the cultural programme, and in the 2007-2013 financial perspective."
"Furthermore, we regard it as very important for the role of the jury to be strengthened, for tasks to be more specifically defined and for the selection procedure for the applicant cities to be improved in this way."
"Clear and objective selection criteria for the cities themselves and the required added value for Europe also need to be explicitly defined and associated with specific points."
"The decision as to when and why a city should receive EUR 200 000, EUR 500 000 or EUR 1 million also needs to be clearly defined."
"Where competition between several cities is possible, that is to be welcomed, but it should not be an absolute criterion."
"For example, in 2009 Austria and Lithuania will enter the race with only one city each, but they will need to comply absolutely with the criteria of the selection procedure."
"This is very important, and I believe that with Graz, Austria has demonstrated that you can offer very good performance with a single city."
"I believe that the European Union should also support greater publicity for the cultural capitals and should bring forward a stronger programme in this respect."
"According to the 1999 decision on the European Capital of Culture, the objective of the programme is to highlight the wealth and variety of European cultures – as well as what they have in common – and to contribute towards better mutual understanding on the part of Europe’s citizens."
"The new decision is intended to go one step further and to accept and emphasise the challenges of European integration, of European diversity and also that of expanding cultural cooperation within an enlarged Europe."
". Ladies and gentlemen, in November 2003 the European Commission adopted a proposal amending the 1999 Decision establishing the Community instrument entitled European Capital of Culture."
"This Decision covered the years 2005-2019, which is where we are now."
"The sole purpose of the Commission’s proposal, which you have before you now, is to enable the ten new Member States to participate in this cultural activity as soon as possible from a position of parity with the other Member States, thus applying the principle of equality."
"This means that, beginning in 2009, the new Member States will be hosting the European Capital of Culture, both in cooperation and in competition with the other Member States."
"In 2009, as already mentioned, it will be Lithuania together with Austria."
"In the second phase, as requested by the European Parliament, I am proposing a further change to the Council before this summer, which will mean an in-depth analysis or an in-depth review of the selection procedure for this Community activity."
"As was rightly pointed out by Christa Prets, this proposal should include, among other things, the European dimension in cooperation, how to strengthen it, the role of the selection panel, national competition and so on. In actual fact, many of these questions or concerns have already been raised in the first reading and I shall of course take them into account when formulating the next steps to be taken."
"The Commission will also take account of the results of an independent study which has looked at the last 10 years of this cooperative venture."
"As regards the second reading, I am delighted that the report has also been accepted by the Committee on Culture and Education, thus approving the joint position of the Council, which is along the same lines as the Commission’s proposal."
"This means that this decision can be made relatively quickly, but of course on the basis of correct procedure."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on Culture and Education and the rapporteur Christa Prets personally for her close cooperation in these matters and of course I should also like to express my thanks to the Irish and Danish Presidencies over the last year in this matter and to the Luxembourg Presidency for its continuing cooperation."
"I am pleased that this change is bringing real results, since its adoption may significantly assist and directly affect relations between cities and citizens in the enlarged European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we would not be having to discuss the European Capital of Culture at all today if back in 1999 the Council of Ministers had not totally – and quite outrageously – ignored the expected new Member States right up to 2019."
"Only ministers can come up with such ideas: the Members of this House were already wiser back then."
"We therefore have to put matters right today, and we are ready to support that."
"In future we will have two cities, one from the 15 old Member States and one from the new Member States."
"I totally support that, as it will also mean cooperation between two cultural capitals."
"In 2010, for example, that will involve a German city and a Hungarian one."
"Mrs Prets is of course quite right in saying that the financial resources will not be adequate for this."
"Once you have made a mistake, the punishment is that much more severe."
"In short, we will need more money for the cultural capitals in future, and that should also be provided under the financial framework."
"I believe, unlike Mrs Prets, that each country should submit at least two cities to the European jury for selection."
"Taking Germany as an example, I would like to remind you just how much excitement and creativity has been generated in the German cultural world over the last few years because ten cities have been competing to become the European Capital of Culture."
"We have witnessed enormous inventiveness, with the full range of cultural and economic players taking part in seminars and symposia."
"I simply believe that this amazing level of activity will only come about if there is competition between cities."
"Germany will now be presenting two or more cities to the jury, of which only one can be selected."
"But all the others that applied have stirred up an incredible amount of excitement in their city, in their and in the surrounding area."
"That is why I believe this is the right way to go."
"I would simply ask that in future the jury should pay more attention to what might be called the beacon effect of these cities."
"Europe’s cities are the beacons of our history and of our cultural diversity."
"Each cultural capital should particularly highlight this by arranging many and diverse events, not only to support national traditions and tourism, but also to truly highlight cultural diversity."
"I hope that the Commissioner will take account of these points in his new proposals, including those on the selection procedure."
". Mr President, I generally welcome Mrs Prets' excellent report."
"I also welcome the idea of enlarging the European Capital of Culture initiative to include the new Member States."
"Some people perhaps think it would be better to have only one Capital of Culture per year, alternating yearly between the EU 15 of the old Member States and the EU 10 of new Member States."
"In this way, we could ensure that all the events are concentrated in one city."
"That would be a logical solution, but many old Member States have already waited a long time to enjoy the prestige and to have the possibility of having a Capital of Culture."
"This doubling of the possibilities should be welcomed subject to one crucial condition: the two capitals should be equal in every way, including finance."
"It is the responsibility of the Commission, the governments and the city councils, as well as of the media."
"I urge everyone to understand this concern and make every possible step to ensure equality in real terms."
"To have first-rate and second-rate Capitals of Culture could destroy the whole idea and would be a source of frustration and anger."
"In 2010, Hungary and Germany will host and provide a site for the Capital of Culture of Europe."
"In Hungary, 11 cities are competing for this wonderful chance to show themselves off to Europe."
"My home town, Budapest, is one of the candidates."
"Frankly, Budapest, even without a title, is one of the permanent culture capitals with its flourishing cultural life, but this possibility would be a special occasion."
"It is amazing to see that in all 11 Hungarian cities, the local politicians, NGOs, citizens young and old, are very active in the common cause of the contest."
"In this way, the contest itself offers a chance for common cultural activities in all the competing cities."
"Provided there is equality of the two capitals, I welcome the initiative and the report."
"Mr President, I would like to support the previous speakers and stress that the European Capitals of Culture programme has so far been a success story."
"You can always find individual areas where things could be done still better, but all in all we have seen that for all these cities the process of self-understanding – with meetings across Europe opening their eyes to European horizons – has helped to strengthen not only the identity of those cities but also a new understanding within Europe."
"Mrs Pack was quite right to say that we now recognise that it was a mistake not to include Eastern Europe in the decision adopted in 1999."
"So we are right to be correcting that error here now and to provide for a new arrangement as from 2009, on the basis of which not just one country from the old Member States but also a city from one of the Eastern European Member States is also included."
"I am firmly convinced that this tension between Western and Eastern Europe will lead to good cooperative projects."
"We also need to bear in mind that something like a new collective cultural identity is created in the individual cities."
"Europe has not just one soul, but many, and that is what the European cultural capitals should demonstrate in coming years."
"For that reason I agree with the proposals brought forward by Mrs Prets, both as regards resources and as regards clarity about how these cities are to be identified and nominated."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports this Council common position despite its evident shortcomings, because we believe that it lays the foundations for creating a fair system of financing, and because it of course also solves the problem that all the previous speakers have referred to: up to now, no provision at all has been made for the new European Union Member States."
"The title ‘European Capital of Culture’ provides European cities and their citizens with an attractive opportunity to make themselves known across Europe, and also to display their cultural, scientific, architectural and historical merits and achievements."
"Against the background of their application to become a cultural capital, many cities have developed their own development plan, and these development plans, regardless of whether these cities have subsequently been nominated by their countries or not, give a tremendous boost to development."
"It leads to work on their infrastructure and to restoration, modernisation and renovation. Furthermore, it means that opportunities for the development of additional tourism are opened up, opportunities that subsequently also give these cities greater potential for development and a chance to present themselves in an attractive light."
"If you take Germany as an example, where 10 cities are applying for 2010, including Potsdam, the capital of my own , Brandenburg, you can see even now, in 2005, the commitment the are showing in their work to present these cities during the preselection period."
"I would like to make one comment on the proposal regarding the future competition."
"I can very well imagine that it would be possible for each country whose turn it is to nominate at least two cities."
"I would not, however, think it would be a good thing to nominate five, six, seven or eight of them – that would be too much."
"What we do need, though, is identical preselection criteria in the Member States and in the European Union, meaning that the jury would have to work according to the same criteria."
"I think this is extremely important and I therefore think we should pursue this idea."
"The title ‘European Capital of Culture’ is one that really is tremendously important for many cities."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of a capital of culture is perhaps the best idea within the framework of the European Union."
"It is the idea of a famous actress and Greek Minister for Culture who, in her Oscar-winning song 'Never on Sunday', made Piraeus the cultural capital of the world during the 1960s."
"I believe culture is the primary product in Europe, taking precedence over the economy, the army and diplomacy."
"Come and make history with the proposal which I am going to make to you, Commissioner."
"Let us make the 'dead city' of Ammohostos next year's capital of culture, the only dead city on our continent, our continent of grand civilisations, of the Mycenaean civilisation, of the Minoan civilisation, of the Roman civilisation."
"Ammohostos has been a dead city for 30 years and is the only dead city in the world."
"Come and let us make it the capital of culture, come and let us breathe life into a city which barbarity has deprived of life."
"Come and let us make it the capital of culture and win where all the plans have lost including, a few months ago, the Annan plan."
"If we make Ammohostos the capital of culture, you will see a Greek Cypriot student marching in procession with a Turkish Cypriot student and we shall all be proud."
"We shall be proud because we shall bring peace and we shall bring life to the most beautiful city in the Mediterranean."
"It is a good idea: for us to take decisions where diplomacy cannot, for us to take decisions where denial is particularly distressing."
"Come and let us give real meaning to this initiative."
"It is an important matter;"
"Mr Figel opens up this city and the main square will one day be renamed Jean Figel Square."
"Try to help us do honour to this idea."
". Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this particular issue and also to thank the Commissioner in advance for his ongoing work and assistance in promoting a very important aspect of European Union life: the issue of culture."
"Today I speak as the representative of a city in Ireland that is the present capital of culture: Cork."
"Having researched this enormously over the last seven years prior to submitting Cork's nomination, one of the key issues we saw as being important in designating a city as a capital of culture was that it allowed for greater understanding of the diversity of the cultures and traditions which exist within the European Union."
"After the most recent enlargement that diversity is even greater and has expanded across the whole continent."
"That is why I particularly welcome the decision to have two capitals of culture operating in the east and west, as it were, of the continent."
"One key element that is lacking with regard to the overall structure is the financial support available to cities to undertake the necessary infrastructural work required to meet the demands for capital of culture status."
"Of course, governments and local authorities can give monies to their own cities, but there is a wider European dimension which requires extra financing at European level."
"My last point is relation to these capitals of culture is that when we speak about culture we do not just think in highbrow terms of classical orchestras, ballet and music, although of course these should be included, but that we also recognise the ancient cultures and traditions which exist within each of the Member States."
"– Mr President, whilst I share the criticisms of the decision taken by the Council of Ministers as regards the ten new countries’ accession, we must also ask whether the Council of Ministers of Culture still takes decisions by unanimity."
"Given that large countries such as Germany have sought to maintain unanimity for all decisions, we have now chosen a complicated system, which will be – although I hope not – burdened with excessive bureaucracy, and will take no account of the jury’s opinion when deciding between candidate cities."
"We saw the example of Patras, on 6 May of last year, which was named European capital of culture for 2006 by unanimous Council decision, despite the jury’s opinion to the contrary."
"Perhaps this is more a case of an interinstitutional malaise that goes beyond the framework of this debate."
"I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, not least for all the financial benefit that she has brought."
"These decisions are now, of course, in the hands of the Commission, which must incorporate new ideas into its proposals."
"I suggest that the Commissioners should take greater account of the mobility factor, given that the capital of culture also offers an opportunity to display the culture of others."
"The added value to the region, the sustainability of the proposed projects and the groundwork carried out are further factors that should be considered."
"Luxembourg objects somewhat to Mrs Pack’s criticisms, because we have, already for 2007, named the city of Sibiu – a town in another country, Romania, a candidate country – as partner city."
"Luxembourg has expanded its project across the entire region – Sarre, Rhénanie-Palatinat, Wallonie, Lorraine and the German-speaking part of Belgium – in other words, five regions and three different languages."
"Analysis of the achievements of ‘Luxembourg, capital of culture 2007’, based on the concept of culture in a large region and aimed at fostering cohesion among the citizens, will also offer a glimpse of the future."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for all your attention in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the excellent work that has been done."
"During its 20-year history, the Capital of Culture project has proved to be a success."
"In many cities, people have become involved who would not otherwise participate."
"Lowering the threshold and broadening the cultural arena is therefore a positive thing."
"Why do we not broaden the scope of the Capital of Culture idea, however?"
"Currently, 70% of us live in cities."
"The city is our closest cultural environment."
"However, cities have all too often been built mainly as traffic hubs."
"Noise and pollution levels therefore rise to inhumane proportions."
"Most Central Europeans have to put up with permanent noise pollution."
"Noise and pollution have become significant cultural factors."
"Commissioner, cities should be developed into the cultural hubs of a knowledge-based economy, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy."
"We are evolving into a digital network-aided cultural society."
"A Capital of Culture is hardly likely to grow up around a lorry terminal."
"For this reason, I do hope that in future the Capital of Culture will organise development seminars and planning competitions for the cities of today and tomorrow."
"Models should be built showing what a city in the cultured network society should be like."
"Our cities have grown as physical traffic hubs dating from the Middle Ages, but this period ended centuries ago."
"Now we are living in a global digital networked environment."
"A global digital networked environment."
"Should not that mean changing the nature of cities and their cultures, and the models we present of them?"
"What do you think, Commissioner Figel – are we stepping into the future?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, at a point in history when it is becoming increasingly important for Europeans to learn more about one another, in terms of human and cultural diversity, the European Capitals of Culture programme is a highly effective means of achieving this aim."
"Europe’s increased size following the latest enlargement clearly justifies the idea of designating two European Capitals of Culture per year."
"Yet, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has already pointed out, Community financing must be adequate and appropriate."
"The European Capital of Culture is a highly prestigious award, but the city concerned is not expected to use European Capital of Culture funding from the Community for urban regeneration or other works of that ilk."
"The funding specifically earmarked for the programme is expected to help to highlight its role as a European city and as a cultural hub."
"Nor is the European Capital of Culture event expected to turn into yet another international festival, however significant."
"What we do expect is that visitors should be offered a stimulating, accurate and lively image of the city that is awarded the designation and that is opening its doors."
"This image must be one that offers a rich contribution to European culture and to Europe’s relationship with the world, one that provides an insight into the city’s particular values and history, its spiritual and material heritage, its traditions and customs, and the unique character of its people – that is, the city’s human side."
"I support the report by Mrs Prets and, in general, what has been said by previous speakers. I should also like to suggest that these points be taken into account by the Commission in the review that it will carry out in 2005."
"Mr President, the European Capital of Culture is the most readily understood and visible of all the programmes aimed at promoting the idea of a common Europe."
"At a time when we are constantly being told of the public’s lack of interest in European issues, and when the idea of a common Europe is becoming ever more frequently associated only with debts and dull discussions on some technical aspect or other of the way in which the European institutions are organised, the Capital of Culture project is a commendable exception."
"Anyone who was in Lille last year when the city held the title of European Capital of Culture, or who has been in Cracow, which shared the title of Capital of Culture with eight other European cities in 2000, or indeed in many other Capitals of Culture, cannot have failed to notice the public’s enormous interest in Europe and the great enthusiasm demonstrated by the large numbers of citizens who took part in remarkable cultural events."
"Such occasions are an opportunity for all the critics of European integration to see the enthusiasm, joy and expectation with which the public greets outstanding cultural events inspired by the quest for common European roots."
"Genuine and lively dialogue takes place in European Capitals of Culture, and it is here that inspiration should be sought by those who are weary of their job of building a community on our continent from the Rond-Point Schuman."
"The fundamental value of this initiative lies in the fact that it did not come about as a result of an official proposal, and that it was not dreamt up by some Brussels bureaucrat."
"It was mooted in Athens 20 years ago as a spur-of-the-moment idea, and subsequently taken up by other European cities."
"Although there are no plans for this at present, provision should be made in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective for a special and separate budget to support this idea."
"I was astonished to note that the Network of the European Cities of Culture and Cultural Months (ECCM) was the only one of several dozen organisations not to receive funding from the European Commission."
"This specialist organisation brings together experienced managers who are responsible for implementing the initiative in their own countries, and I would ask that this oversight be corrected."
"Given that the initiative has been in existence for 20 years, it is now time for the European Commission to provide significant funding for it in future, and for it to pay due regard to the experience of previous organisers."
"The EU should provide technical and artistic support to assist those who will be in charge of organising forthcoming celebrations of the common Europe and its Cultural Capitals over the next few years."
"I welcome the proposal whereby from 2009 the new Member States of the European Union will also have the opportunity to stand as candidates for the ‘European capital of culture’ event."
"In my own country of Slovenia we celebrate every 8 February as a cultural holiday, and this is also a national holiday."
"On that day visits to exhibitions and museums are free, and numerous cultural events take place around the holiday."
"Nevertheless there is no shortage of people in Slovenia, too, who claim that culture is merely something superfluous and unnecessary, since it brings in no money directly."
"However, during the time of the holiday at least, we are more intensively preoccupied with the importance and value of culture, and we attend events that we would not normally find the time to attend."
"It is precisely due to the preservation of its cultural heritage and language that the Slovenian nation of just two million people survived all the ravages of the world wars and the aspirations of neighbouring nations to erase us from the ethnic map of Europe."
"In a culturally and ethnically diverse Europe it is all the more important for us to establish bridges between us."
"Preserving one’s own culture and enjoying the diversity and richness of other nations must be and must remain our guiding principle, since it is culture that is the least intrusive link between nations that wish to live in peace and mutual cooperation."
"The European capital of culture makes it possible for us to forge such links."
"At the same time it offers the possibility for each host to make greater investments in cultural facilities and in projects with long-term positive effects."
". Mr President, I should like to thank Members for their expressions of either group or individual support."
"This is good for European culture, for the European Union and for the future of Europe."
"Mr Paasilinna asked whether we are going back to the past or forward into the future."
"The 1999 decision needs to be adapted to take account of the situation in the new enlarged Union."
"It is about culture, not so much about geography or economics."
"We also need to prepare for Bulgarian and Romanian accession so as not to create the additional question of whether incoming countries are included in this cooperation or given special consideration."
"We also need to set up mechanisms for the future relating to finance, city selection and jury criteria."
"We must do this to promote the European dimension and many other issues that have either already been raised or will be discussed at a later stage."
"I would like to assure you that we can already see added value: Germany has 10 candidate cities and Hungary has 11."
"Even before a decision is made, this process is generating a lot of cultural activity and a growing awareness that culture is important and that there is a European dimension for it."
"I am glad that there is a high level of understanding for the decision here."
"We will continue to work with the rapporteur, the committee and Parliament as a whole with regard to making further improvements."
"The spirit of cooperation should be rather broader."
"Culture should be seen as a relationship between peoples and nations and all their ancient traditions."
"As Mr Graça Moura and Mr Crowley mentioned, spiritual and architectural heritage and the human dimension should be taken into account."
"Cities should not be seen merely as hubs for transport: they are places for living and for culture."
"I should like to thank Members for their positive responses and support."
"I am looking forward to working on further improvements in the future."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"This item is therefore dealt with and the vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Ries on the European Environment and Health Action Plan."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I do anything else I should like to offer my warm thanks to all of the Members of this House who have shown great interest in this important subject."
"I shall first thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Trakatellis, Mrs Corbey, Mr Staes, Mrs de Brún. I should also like to thank, of course, all of the Members who provided invaluable help while I was drawing up this report."
"The debate in all of the political groups has been heated and, I would say, in keeping with the challenges and expectations."
"89% of European citizens have said that they are extremely concerned about the impact of the environment on their health, and with good reason."
"The figures are revealing and I shall just mention a few of them: one sixth of child deaths and diseases in Europe can be attributed to environmental causes; the incidence of respiratory allergic diseases has doubled over the last 20 years, today affecting one in seven children; almost 10% of workers are exposed to carcinogenic substances; 14% of couples seek help because of difficulty in conceiving."
"I could cite more figures and examples, and, indeed, the Members of this House have not hesitated to do this during the course of the debates."
"The Commission responded to these figures in June 2003 by launching the SCALE environment and health strategy, which stands for Science, Children, Awareness, Legal instruments, Evaluation."
"This initiative gave rise to much hope, which was well summed up by Commissioner Wallström’s statement during the debate in plenary in March of last year."
"She said, and I quote, ‘there are certain areas where we cannot risk waiting until our knowledge is complete, but need to act according to the precautionary principle, and we shall do so’."
"This European strategy ought to act as a launch pad for the Action Plan before us, for which I am the rapporteur, but this is not this case."
"This action plan, as far as I am concerned, does not live up to its name."
"It would be more accurately described as a programme to assess the overall impact of the environment on health."
"It does, of course, raise a wide range of interesting points which are worth mentioning and I would highlight the following: raising awareness of the risks run by the citizens, training experts in health and the environment – of whom there are far too few – and the introduction of biomonitoring at European level."
"It strikes me that an approach that takes the paradigm for the 21st century as absolute scientific evidence goes against the precautionary principle."
"The 52 European environment and health ministers who gathered in Budapest last June for a conference on the theme of ‘A future for our children’ took this on board when they placed emphasis on the delicate yet necessary balance between more research and the urgent need to take preventative action to protect people’s health."
"We should endeavour to strike that balance here."
"This is why we made exposure to dangerous chemical substances one of the priorities of this report."
"More specifically, in paragraph 6, we call for the precautionary principle to be applied to a range of substances that are damaging to health, particularly certain heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium, six products from the phthalate family used in PVC plastics and four insecticides suspected of being, , endocrine disruptors and at the root of serious malformations."
"Reinforcing this European plan is also a matter of drawing inspiration from the ambitious actions already put in place by the Member States, and achieving success."
"I mention these in points 23 and 28 of the resolution."
"I am also delighted that Members of this House support the approach that I have taken aimed at placing children at the heart of this Action Plan, including the request that the Commission should carry out an epidemiological study on children, from birth to 18 years of age."
"A further crucial aspect is the fight against passive smoking."
"The Commission has taken this consideration on board, and this is something that we welcome."
"It is seeking to designate environmental tobacco smoke a class 1 carcinogen."
"Let us be clear on this issue: as far as I am concerned, the message that we send out to the public, covered in point 20 of the resolution, must not be watered down in any way."
"Tobacco smoke kills both smokers and non-smokers."
"In Belgium alone, 2 000 people a year die from the effects of passive smoking, which is as high as the number of victims of road accidents."
"In conclusion, I hope that the Commission proves to be ambitious in implementing this Action Plan for the next six years."
"I have no doubt, Mr Dimas, that you will work in tandem with your colleague, Mr Kyprianou, in order to ensure the necessary complementarity between the Action Plan and the European Public Health Programme."
"You can, of course, rely on our support in Parliament to obtain the appropriate financing to meet the challenges that I have just spoken about, under the seventh research framework programme and in chapter four of the financial perspectives."
"Furthermore, I hope that you are predisposed towards your services drawing up a green paper on pollution inside buildings, from crèches to homes and schools, which remains the poor relation of environmental legislation."
"All of which is to say that Europe must learn the lessons from the scandals of smoking and asbestos, to name but two."
"Europe is involved in a race against time, and against all forms of pollution."
"Commissioner, we have a duty, both the Commission and Parliament, to ensure that the health of the citizens – all of the citizens – takes precedence over other considerations."
". Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I fully endorse what Mrs Ries said at the end, that the links between the environment and health are a particularly important priority for the European Commission and Europe."
"That is why I am grateful for your committee's help in drafting the report which we are debating today."
"I should particularly like to thank Mrs Ries for all her constructive efforts to improve the content of the report, so that the final text constitutes a substantive and useful basis for all further debate."
"I should like to start by reiterating the objective of the action plan adopted last June."
"We should not forget that we are not starting from scratch."
"Indeed, having recognised for some time that environmental protection helps to improve health, we have already done a great deal of work in this sector."
"The forthcoming environmental and other legislation, including the REACH proposals and measures which will be taken within the framework of thematic strategies, will be of even greater help in resolving the outstanding problems."
"As regards current issues, numerous efforts are being made to reinforce European Union policies designed to improve health and environmental protection and this is something that will certainly continue."
"The objective of the action plan is to further promote this work and, at the same time, to determine the agenda for the future."
"Thus, possible weaknesses will be addressed and a future environmental policy will be laid down which is more efficient, more focused and more cost-effective."
"As regards the conclusions of the report, I should like to start by assuring you that the precautionary principle is an important essential element of our policy and we do, of course, intend to continue to apply it in the future."
"As far as biomonitoring is concerned, we agree."
"It can indeed be an essential element in our policy for risk evaluation, as the report suggests."
"We shall study this view in detail."
"Nonetheless, the Commission would like first to carefully examine all aspects of the problem, both technical and financial, in the light of experience gained from third countries, such as the United States."
"The cost, it should be noted, is very high."
"We likewise agree on air inside buildings."
"The possibility of developing a strategy and research agenda on this subject will be examined, so that the relevant problems can be identified and proposals can be made for possible ways of addressing them."
"If the measures in the action plan are to be implemented, the question of financing needs to be addressed, as Mrs Ries has quite rightly noted and emphasised."
"I agree that this is needed in order to safeguard efficient application of the plan."
"For the period up to 2007, the Commission will finance the budgets of the four Directorates-General involved, of the programme in the public health sector and of the Sixth Research Framework Programme."
"From 2007 onwards, new headings will be available within the framework of the new financial perspectives."
"The Commission is engaged in intensive consultations on the detailed arrangements for applying the various measures included in the action plan."
"Another particularly important issue which is necessary for the application of the action plan is the regular submission of reports to the European Parliament."
"Of course, the Commission will report to the relevant parliamentary committee on progress with the action plan as regularly as possible."
"Of course, progress on certain issues, such as efficiency and the cost-benefit ratio may not be possible in the short term."
"Within this framework, all the data and information needed simply do not exist."
"Nonetheless, the possibility for more detailed reports will exist as soon as the integrated information system is up and running."
"As regards the ban on substances, an issue on which Mrs Ries spoke earlier, dangerous substances are an issue which particularly concerns the Commission."
"However, the action plan is not the most suitable framework for debating possible bans."
"We have already laid down procedures for evaluating and reducing the risk of many of these substances."
"These procedures which, as I said, already exist, will continue to progress alongside the action plan."
"The Commission is carefully examining the proposal in the report to increase the number of priorities in the action plan."
"However, increasing the number of priorities will weaken the focus and results of the action plan, which is why it would be preferable to limit the priorities to those proposed in the action plan, which have been defined in close cooperation with 300 experts and involved agencies. That is why, on the basis of the contribution of these 300 experts, we have not limited the focus to children alone, because there are directly related issues and we therefore also have to examine adults."
"To close, I should like to stress that, if the action plan is to be applied effectively, active and close cooperation is needed with all the agencies involved."
"That is why I should like once again to thank Mrs Ries and the European Parliament for their important contribution in this sector."
"Our common objective is to promote stronger European measures to improve health and environmental protection for all Europeans, for Europe and for the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 before us today, combined with the proposals from our rapporteur, Mrs Ries, is equal to the heavy demands we are making of it."
"Its numerous projects are capable of significantly improving our knowledge about environmental impacts on health, and thus provide stronger scientific foundations for our legislative process."
"Furthermore, it could enable our legislation to become preventive, which is perhaps even more valuable."
"Maybe I am somewhat optimistic about that point, but we all need to have some dreams!"
"Some projects will certainly be completed by 2010."
"I have in mind, for example, improved coordination between the Member States in the field of environment and health, something that should have been sorted out long ago in the European Union."
"Most of the actions will, however, extend beyond 2010."
"The relationship between humankind and the environment is subject to constant change and often requires new actions and reactions."
"I believe that we should be taking steps now to ensure that this action plan does not come to an end in 2010."
"The action plan will, however, be successful only if we do not implement it in isolation from the necessary economic processes and pressures and from people’s lifestyles."
"It will be successful only if we monitor research results as regards their general validity instead of treating the world like a laboratory."
"Our actions must be based on risk analysis and not on ideology."
"Paragraph 5 of the resolution contained in the report is doubtless well intentioned, but even the precautionary principle can only be applied if there is an appreciable risk and firm findings."
"Legislating on the basis of panic mongering is surely not the way to go and I cannot take this seriously."
"Much the same applies to the substances listed in paragraph 6, which are to be replaced by other substances."
"I agree with the Commissioner on this: this would breach the principle of the action plan, because we should not be concentrating on things that are covered by EU regulations, such as the REACH programme."
"Apart from the fact that available substitutes are costly, we also know little about the risks of exposure to them."
"So things need to be weighed up carefully."
"As regards smoking, I am in total agreement with the Commissioner: it is not for us in the European Union to be enacting laws in this area; we should instead be encouraging the Member States to proceed in the right direction here."
". Mr President, I should first of all like to thank and congratulate Mrs Ries."
"She has done important work in fleshing out the Environment and Health Action Plan more effectively."
"The action programme itself is disappointing."
"Whilst I do, of course, recognise the need for research, an action programme also requires strong measures to tackle health problems, and those measures are lacking."
"In recent weeks, our discussions have centred around dangerous substances and the conditions under which they can, or must, be removed from the market."
"Softening agents in toys are the most prominent, but there are also other substances at issue."
"Although our group accepted the text as approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we did actually want a stricter approach."
"If a substance is dangerous, it should be removed from the market without delay and without waiting for safe alternatives."
"A second subject of discussion was smoking."
"Tobacco smoke has a devastating effect on the health of passive smokers."
"We would therefore call for active policy to ban smoking in public places."
"We urge all Member States to draw inspiration from the Irish and Italian examples."
"The environment and health report is topical."
"Air pollution, in particular, is an important problem in Europe."
"According to calculations and studies commissioned by the Commission, every year, more than 300 000 people die prematurely in Europe as a result of air pollution."
"In the Netherlands, the figure is 13 000."
"Little imagination is required to assume that deaths occur more frequently among people living near motorways and industrial areas than in people living in leafy and exclusive residential areas."
"Over the past 20 years, Europe has, of course, taken measures that have brought about major reductions in emissions."
"The use of catalytic converters in cars has been successful, but too little effort has been made to date, and the statistics are alarming."
"What is to be done?"
"First of all, we should, of course, better observe existing legislation, but more can, and must, be done."
"Where, for example, are the soot filters in cars?"
"Also, we should question whether the limits and limit values in legislation are adequate."
"In the report ‘Signals 2004’, the European Environment Agency noted that there is increasing evidence to suggest that dust and ozone concentrations impact on health below current health protection values."
"A European approach is required to protect the environment, health and the consumer."
"In the framework of the Lisbon process, ambitious environmental policy is an incentive for technological development and for boosting European competitiveness."
"If we do not commit to environmental quality, then not only do we do public health, but also European industry, a huge disservice."
"At the Detroit car show last month, a zero-emission passenger car was launched, the like of which we have not seen at European car shows."
"Over here, we remain stuck in the question as to who should pay for soot filters."
"I prefer an ambitious Europe with adequate measures to protect public health, and we should make those soot filters compulsory without delay."
"That is vital."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you can hear me above the mounting background noise."
"Speakers deserve to be treated with a bit of respect in this Chamber!"
"This report on the European Environment and Health Action Plan concentrates too much on chemicals."
"Too little attention is paid to many other things that have an adverse affect on human health."
"It is clear that there are risks associated with chemicals, but there is little point in drawing up blacklists and thus stigmatising certain substances such as phthalates."
"The report is based on an exaggerated interpretation of the precautionary principle."
"It talks about direct and total bans on certain substances without basing them on scientific findings, or without taking account of known scientific findings, as is customary with the precautionary principle."
"This report represents another attempt at a zero-risk policy, at what I call the ‘green disease’ prevalent in many western societies."
"We are trying to apply a comprehensive insurance mentality to environmental protection, forgetting that there are always risks associated with the development of an open society."
"The mere existence of a risk and widespread fear of chemicals are used to justify demands for total bans."
"Fear is nothing more than uncertainty arising from ignorance."
"If you want to counter fear, you must combat ignorance."
"To do that you need to promote science and research, and to draw the correct conclusions from your findings."
"We should not confuse risks with dangers that are actually present."
"The priority objective of environmental policy should not be to exclude risks, but to identify and eliminate dangers."
"The report also overshoots the mark when it comes to dealing with tobacco smoke."
"As long as tobacco is a legal product, we should hold back from demanding a total ban on smoking."
"It is not for Europe to determine where you can and cannot smoke."
"In the report we call for tobacco smoke to be designated a class 1 carcinogen, indicating that it has a proven and direct effect."
"I would like to remind you that there is as yet no scientific proof for that."
"I am not suggesting that the health dangers of tobacco smoke should be played down, but putting tobacco smoke in the same category as substances such as benzene or asbestos is nothing short of environmental populism."
"I also believe that we should be holding this debate in Brussels, not in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I would prefer to speak this evening, or in the continuation, because you cannot hear yourself think here."
"I do not think that you can make a speech here now."
"Your request is accepted."
"We shall interrupt the debate to proceed to the votes."
"The debate will continue after the oral question on the financing of nature protection policy, so the debate on this item will resume at 4.00 p.m. and the first speaker will be Mrs Breyer."
"The next item is the vote."
"Thank you Mr President, I would just like to briefly give all the Members of Parliament some information."
"Statistics are a boring matter, but business people in your countries will now have to write many new reports, if you vote for this."
"I say this in advance, so that you can tell them what Parliament has done to make many of those statistical reports unnecessary."
"Business people will have to compile new statistical reports and most likely you and many of your voters will have questions."
"Therefore I simply wanted to let you know what Parliament has done in cooperation with the Council and the Commission in order to reduce that statistical load."
"We vote with you for the introduction of so-called European sample schemes, where only some companies present reports; small countries, whose GDP is less than 1% of the European Union's GDP, will not be required to supply some of the indices at all; moreover, we shall give governments the opportunity to use administrative resources, that is, social insurance registers, and then companies will not be required to write additional reports."
"It is also anticipated that the European Commission and Member States will have to prepare a method of evaluating whether it is worthwhile introducing new statistical reports and whether these would be of value to European business and the people of Europe."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I do not have a great deal to say about the content of this report; this fraud prevention agreement fulfils a request this House has been making for many years, and I hope we will approve this agreement by a large majority."
"We are actually dealing here, for the first time, with part of the series of Bilateral Agreements with Switzerland, and I feel that the rapid way we have dealt with this in this House demonstrates that we want to see the positive results achieved finally transposed into legislation."
"We have repeatedly supported the Commission in its efforts to achieve an outcome on the fraud prevention agreement."
"We are therefore all the more surprised that when it comes to an amount that Switzerland wishes to transfer to the new Member States as a contribution to cohesion, the amount of CHF 1 billion, the Commission has suddenly come up with the pettifogging idea that this ought to be the subject of an international treaty, and that a memorandum of understanding is not sufficient."
"I would like to point out to the Commission that we have not been negotiating with a banana republic, but with one of the oldest and most stable democracies in Europe."
"So, to make no bones about this, what you have been doing here plays into the hands of those in Switzerland and in the EU who are opposed to closer relations between Switzerland and the European Communities."
"I call for this House to adopt a position on this and for you, on behalf of the Commission, to take this message from Strasbourg back home with you."
"Mr President, just for technical information with a view to giving consistency and coherence in the final document: if Amendments 19 and 21 are adopted, the other paragraphs which deal with the same issue should be brought into line."
"This has been discussed with representatives from other groups and is a technical rather than a political matter."
"Mr President, to add to what Ms in 't Veld said, that Amendment 20 should have added at the end: 'or by way of an official act that, depending upon the legislation in the Member States, may take the form of one or more legislative or regulatory act or a contract'."
"That is part of the arrangement that Ms in 't Veld is referring to."
"Following on from that are oral amendments to Modifications 10 and 17 and recital Q."
"Mr President, to be completely clear, it means that we have oral amendments on recitals Q and paragraph 19 of this document."
"They were not written amendments and they completely follow the text proposed in the Purvis amendments."
"These have to be introduced on recital Q and paragraph 19."
"Mr President, concerning this problem, I tabled an amendment referring to 'public authority provide'."
"I notice that other amendments - in particular Amendment 3 by the PSE Group - make a distinction between 'run' and 'monitor'."
"In my intention, 'provide' is a verb 'monitor' or 'run'."
"So I put an oral amendment to all the amendments referring to the tendering process. Where Amendment 29 by the Green Group, Amendments 32, 33 and 27 state 'to provide' a public service."
"It should read 'to provide (run or monitor)'. Provide is to run or monitor."
"We will take that oral amendment before we start voting on that section."
"Colleagues, I am aware that this is a very sensitive report and that it is a pre-consultation offered by the Commission."
"It is only fitting that we take time to get it right."
"Mr President, here we had to vote on one of the compromises of this set of four so this is a bit confusing."
"I assume that we have now voted on Mr Purvis's oral compromise amendment?"
"In fact, it was the rapporteur's oral amendment that there were no objections to."
"We will get to that when we come to Amendment 19."
"Mr President, no, because it deals with this paragraph 19 it should come before the other votes."
". Mr President, it is very complicated because during the whole process the structure of the report became rather complicated."
"I apologise for that."
"This concerns three amendments and five paragraphs."
"Amendment 20, with an addition, has just been read out by Mr Purvis."
"As far as I understand that is what we have been voting on."
"The other two amendments are Amendments 19 and 21, also by Mr Purvis, but the contents of those amendments also relate to recital Q, paragraph 19, modification 10 and modification 17."
"I can read out the text concerned, because I would suggest that rather than reading it out every single time, I should read it out once, we all adopt or reject the principle and then adapt the four paragraphs concerned."
"The text of Amendment 21, which is almost identical to Amendment 19, reads as follows: ' The public service task must be assigned by way of an official act that, depending on the legislation in Member States, may take the form of a legislative or regulatory act or a contract."
"It may also be laid down in several acts."
"The act or series of acts should specify among other things:'."
"This is the same principle as in Amendment 19."
"Therefore, if the plenary adopts that principle, it will also apply to the four paragraphs I have mentioned."
"I propose that we vote on that rather than reading it out every single time."
"– Mr President, there is no objection over the substance, but I should not like there to be any confusion over the facts."
"This oral amendment is tabled four times: it relates to Amendment 20, Amendment 19, Amendment 21 and Amendment 15."
"In order to avoid any ambiguity, I would suggest, Mr President, that, each time we vote on these amendments, you indicate that they are amendments that form part of Mr Purvis’s oral amendment."
"I feel that this would clear up any potential confusion."
"Mr Purvis’s oral amendment relates to four amendments."
"If you would be kind enough to remind us of Mr Purvis’s oral amendment at each vote, I believe that it would be clearer for the House."
"Mr President, I think that will be complicated."
"The point here is that there are paragraphs where no amendments have been tabled, but they would be equally concerned because after the amendments had been tabled I think we all discovered when we went through the amendments that there were more paragraphs concerned with the same issue."
"Now we can simply vote on the amendments, but then there will be a certain inconsistency in the document."
"What Mr Savary is suggesting will not work because it is not about the amendments - it is about the paragraphs to which no amendments have been tabled."
"If, when voting on Amendment 19 and Amendment 21 plenary twice adopts a principle or rejects it, then it will apply equally to those paragraphs."
"That is what I am saying."
"Mr President, I do not wish to complicate matters, but Mrs in 't Veld is asking us to vote once and for all on Mr Purvis’ amendment."
"You will not know where it will be in the text, but it will be there."
"Quite frankly, as there are four crucial amendments, Amendments 20, 19, 21 and 15, I would prefer it if we were asked each time whether we were adopting them subject to the oral amendment by Mr Purvis."
"I think that would be clearer."
"I understand what Mrs in 't Veld is saying, but I would like her to tell me exactly where she is going to put Mr Purvis’ amendment, as she has said that it appears throughout the text."
"I think this is confused and I do not want us to make a mistake with this vote, because, as you said yourself, this is a sensitive text."
"Mr President, I hope I can help you."
"I agree with Mr Savary that it should be applied to those four amendments, but I also agree with Mrs in't Veld that wherever else in the report there are inconsistencies as a result of passing those amendments, then appropriate adjustments should be made by sessional services."
"If that is acceptable then we can go ahead."
"Mr Savary, I can assure you that appropriate adjustments will be made."
"I will indicate when the oral amendment applies."
"I now propose to put the oral amendment to the vote."
"Mr President, in case we have the same problem as previously, this one is also affected by the oral amendment and therefore my voting list should say in favour."
"Mr President, this is a slight modification of the amendment proposed by the PSE Group and it would read as follows: 'whereas with a view to evidence-based policy making the Commission should present a sound and exhaustive evaluation of the liberalisation process, taking into account the point of view of all stakeholders involved (users, local authorities, undertakings etc.)'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the debate on the Goebbels report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled an amendment that was accepted by a majority of the committee, but due to an error was not incorporated into the final version of this report."
"I would therefore like to table it once again as an oral amendment."
"It relates to the need for structural reforms."
"I shall read the amendment in English."
"'Recommends that the Member States carry out the structural reforms which have long been needed."
"In particular, the deregulation of labour markets, the adjustment of social systems to demographic needs, the simplification of tax systems, combining tax cuts and a change in the bases of tax assessment and the abolition of subsidies, so as to bring about an improvement in the investment climate as a prerequisite for economic growth."
"Stresses finally that the development of quality jobs will be accompanied by an improvement in labour productivity in Europe.'"
". Mr President, I am amazed by the way Mr Klinz is acting."
"He claims that his amendment was accepted."
"If that were the case, he should have made a complaint to the secretariat of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which normally does a good job."
"Otherwise, he had every right to table an amendment, which he did not do."
"Having listened to him, it is a new report that he is proposing to us, and I invite my fellow Members to reject this oral amendment, which is not an oral amendment, but a novel."
"Mr President, I merely wish to inform the House that a meeting of the coordinators was held yesterday at which the coordinators of all parties, including the committee chairs, confirmed that the amendment just read out had been accepted, but had not, because of a drafting error, been included in the report."
"So in the interests of fairness we should vote on the amendment now."
"If the amendment was adopted in committee and there were no amendments to it, then it is in the text."
"I can only ask the services to check this."
"Mr President, I am sorry that your services did not indicate to you that I had requested the floor at the beginning of Mr Wolf Klinz’s speech, as I wanted to report to you the discussion that we had last night at the meeting of the coordinators of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I will be very clear: the amendment to which Mr Wolf Klinz is referring was mentioned and we reported the procedure that was followed, which is the procedure that we are still following."
"The Secretary of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did his job: he consolidated the votes after the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and sent the result to every political group to be verified."
"The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has not, so far, deemed it necessary to table this amendment again or to point out a material error in it."
"Therefore, and out of respect for the meeting of the coordinators last night, I would ask you, in accordance with what this House has already decided, given that several Members have stood up, not to take on board this amendment."
"We have to stand by the decision of the House, which was to not accept the oral amendment."
"I apologise to Mr Klinz if there was a fault on the part of the secretariat, but Mrs Berès is absolutely right that the position was clear in committee."
"Mr President, as rapporteur, I have to say that a large proportion of my report has been ‘mutilated’ by a rightwing majority in this House, which has voted contrary to Article 4 of the Treaty, which requires coordination of economic policies."
"You have voted against the efforts of the President-in-Office, Mr Juncker, to make the Stability Pact into something decent, in other words a Stability and Growth Pact."
"I therefore invite my friends to vote against my report."
"That concludes the vote."
". Switzerland is a pocket-sized European Union, entirely surrounded by the EU but itself divided up into 23 states which each have major autonomy and can, consequently, pursue their own tax policies."
"That has so far prevented the conclusion of agreements in the area of direct taxes between the EU and Switzerland as a whole."
"The separate Swiss cantons are in this respect not unlike Liechtenstein or other small tax havens where postbox firms are based."
"Zug and Schwyz, in particular, offer services of this kind."
"The responses to my written questions have shown that the former Commissioner Bolkestein preferred to ignore this and wanted to continue to do business with Switzerland as a whole."
"As long as those further steps cannot be taken, it is useful that agreements be made in the areas of VAT, smuggling, corruption and money-laundering practices."
"It is also important that banking secrecy can no longer be quoted as a reason for turning down investigation requests from other countries, and that direct contacts with legal bodies become possible instead of having to take the route of diplomatic representation."
"The rapporteur is right in stating that further steps are required, but it is unfortunate that he fails to mention the most pressing one."
". I endorse the report by Mr Di Pietro, which supports and seeks to strengthen the Commission’s initiative aimed at making improvements of a technical nature to the legislation relating to the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record, and suggests practical ways of remedying the shortcomings in the current systems, which are based on the 1959 Council of Europe Convention."
"This is undoubtedly an urgently needed measure, because it has been demonstrated on a number of occasions that the system is not working properly."
"It is therefore essential that a computerised system be set up whereby such information can be exchanged between Member States and accessed rapidly throughout EU territory."
"This is a further step towards genuinely effective, independent and transparent criminal justice."
"I also endorse his proposals regarding shorter time limits, given that the proposal’s effectiveness will depend on speed of access and of updating information,and regarding the need to impose conditions on access to personal data, because a balance must always be maintained between the need for speed in this type of exchange of information and the need to safeguard and protect personal data."
". In a Europe characterised by free movement and free trade, security must be shared."
"Without prejudice to the various Member States fully exercising their sovereignty, it is widely acknowledged nowadays that different countries must work together to fight crime."
"In addition to traditional forms of crime, there is now crime which does not respect national borders and which operates wherever it is most advantageous to do so. As such, when the law of one Member State is broken, the security of all Member States is put in jeopardy."
"Accordingly, I broadly agree with the content of this report, and therefore voted in favour."
"We, Mrs Segelström, Mr Andersson, Mrs Hedh, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen and Mrs Westlund voted in favour of the report but wish now to indicate our differing position on one issue."
"We cannot support paragraph 1 f, indent 2, which recommends to the Council that it go some way towards harmonising national legislation governing the gathering and assessment of evidence."
"The principle of the free sifting of evidence is basic to the Swedish criminal law of procedure."
"Quite a few other Member States have rules to the effect that certain evidence is not permitted."
"It is thus extremely important to us Swedish Social Democrats that our national system be kept intact."
"What is more, it is doubtful whether there is any legal basis at all, be it in current treaties or in the forthcoming Constitution, for harmonisation in this respect."
"Strengthening mutual trust in decisions by European courts by setting up an evaluation system may appear commendable, even if there now already exists a common framework of reference for the Member States in terms of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and the case law of the European Court of Justice, which lays down minimum standards governing the right to trial by the courts."
"The proposal is, however, one more example of the creeping extension of the EU’s competences and constitutes a stage in the attempt to create a harmonised European system of criminal law and of laws relating to judicial procedure – a legal system that, in practice, will be outside people’s direct control."
"To recommend, moreover, before the draft Constitution has come into force, that use be made of provisions of the Constitution on the grounds that current treaties do not go far enough is unacceptable, as it flagrantly pre-empts the democratic process."
"The June List is therefore voting against this report."
". I voted for this report because it makes important steps forward in addressing a key issue deemed important by EU citizens, namely the need for some monitoring of the quality of criminal justice as it is implemented in Member States."
"This in no way imposes changes on the way each Member State conducts its criminal justice system."
"It does, however, take a step forward in ensuring that important matters such as the effective dealing with criminal gangs, or the way EU citizens may serve their sentence in their own Member State, can be progressed."
"EU citizens expect some degree of mutual trust between Member States and a view on the quality of criminal justice, particularly in relation to some new Member States working to improve their criminal justice systems."
". Justice is, with good reason, one of the areas that Member States traditionally keep within the sphere of their own sovereignty."
"This is particularly true of criminal justice, which should reflect a society’s concerns in light of its present and its past."
"Similarly, Member States are hesitant to allow their nationals, and even mere residents in their countries, to be tried by other Member States."
"Nevertheless, we now have the phenomenon of global crime, which is of a cross-border nature, such as terrorism, drug-trafficking, smuggling, sexual exploitation and pornography. This calls for cooperation in order to ensure that crime is tackled effectively, and harmonisation in order to prevent certain countries from becoming destinations for criminals."
"These various factors highlight the need for cooperation, for recognition of legal decisions and for some harmonisation, without overlooking the fact that legal systems must reflect the situation in different societies. A single European legal system is therefore not desirable."
"A European standard of justice, on the other hand, which fully respected the particular nature of the judicial system, would be desirable."
"Consequently, I feel that a vote in favour of this report is justified."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Costa’s report on the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal law in the Member States (A6-0036/2005)."
"We are, however, aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not, therefore, apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark’s Position."
"We completely support the view that cultural diversity is a fundamental right."
"The EU is, and must remain, a mosaic of minorities and cultures."
"As Liberals, we always put the individual at the centre of all political decisions."
"We therefore believe that it is of the greatest importance to strengthen the policy of international cooperation and solidarity with respect to cultural issues and to establish in international law that every city, state or group of states is entitled freely to determine its cultural policy."
"We therefore believe that the issue of capitals of culture is not an issue in which the EU should become involved."
"The matter of cultural capitals is one that individual cities and states should cooperate on and decide about without the EU’s interference."
"In view of this, we choose to vote against Mrs Prets’s report (A6-0017/2005) - the ‘European Capital of Culture’ event for the years 2005 to 2019."
"We are well disposed to its being possible from 2009 to choose two cultural capitals at a time."
"The report’s explanatory statement notes, however, that how this project is to be funded is unclear, and reference is made to the forthcoming financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"We cannot, as matters stand, support something entailing financial commitments in the forthcoming financial perspective."
"In this situation, there is no reason for hurrying through a decision concerning future cultural capitals."
"Firstly, the financial perspective for 2007-2013 must be debated in its entirety. Subsequently, this report can come up for debate."
"The idea of a European capital of culture is a good one."
"It is so good, even, that it can be funded in a host of other ways, for example through local sponsorship."
"Financial resources from the European Union should not be necessary to enable this project to survive."
"We are therefore voting against this report in itself, but are not opposed to the actual idea of the action."
". The ‘European Capitals of Culture’ programme was launched in 1985 with the aim of bringing European citizens closer together."
"The programme seeks to highlight the wide diversity of European culture, while at the same time there is the supreme contradiction of pursuing a European policy of economic, social, political and cultural uniformity."
"This programme is just an entertaining expression of your desire to impose a cultural and social model on the European people that they have not chosen themselves."
"You want to manufacture a European feeling purely to benefit trade."
"As culture is a powerful channel for education, the European Union not only favours anything that can brainwash and demean mankind, but also anything that encourages people to forget the timeless religious values that are the foundations for our membership of European civilisation."
"In addition to this policy, there is now another problem, as Europe enlarges and moves further away from its main founders."
"In the future, will your attitude mean that Istanbul will have to be chosen as the Capital of European Culture?"
"This clearly shows the danger of this European construction, which, by forgetting its past, is preparing a difficult future for us."
". If we wish to defend a capitalist-style economic model, which stimulates effort, rewards merit and recognises efficiency, we need to have an efficient and effective system of monitoring compliance with competition regulations."
"Without competition there is no market, without a market there is no capitalist model and without a capitalist model there is no economic success and development, as history clearly demonstrates."
"Consequently, the Community’s role in regulating competition is of major importance."
"Without prejudice to the economic need, or, in some senses, the geographically or sectorally localised need, to safeguard certain activities, in general defending competition is, above all, a matter of protecting the interests of consumers, who do not usually have unions, employers’ federations or other movements to look after their legitimate interests."
"I therefore believe that we must applaud and endorse attempts to defend competition, even though we may from time to time disagree with some of the Commission’s decisions."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"I want to see a more proactive competition policy, but do not want to see supranationalism or competition policy’s forming part of the Constitution."
"I therefore chose to abstain, which is the corrected vote following errors in the Minutes."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"Regulating the financing of services of general interest without defining those services, or even the general framework applying to them, is incoherent."
"Regulating it while leaving it up to the Member States to define for themselves what they consider to be services of general interest amounts to leaving it up to the Court of Justice to harmonise the definitions and replace the legislator."
"Basing the regulation on an assessment in purely financial and competition-related terms is a negation of general interest."
"Making the financing of public health or social housing subject to the authorisation of technocrats is immoral."
"In short, we are not happy with anything in the texts before us today."
"They are entirely in line with the policy of the Eurocrats, in collusion with the governments."
"Previously, it was about competition between all network public services, electricity, postal services, etc., destroying State monopolies and imposing privatisation."
"In the future, the Bolkenstein directive, a local version of GATS, will allow social dumping in services to be introduced into our countries."
"Because we reject this vision, which will be worsened by the European Constitution, and because, although we agree that we need to put an end to some blatant abuses, we nevertheless defend the legitimacy of certain public services, we will vote against this report."
"The June List is well disposed towards the implementation of the internal market and supports both common rules concerning subsidies to services of general interest and demands for fair tendering, including where services of general interest are concerned."
"Aid for public activity should, as a matter of principle, also be accounted for and be easily accessible."
"The only exception to this rule is in the event of a Member State’s having chosen only to make the service available through a monopoly and of its not intending to permit private actors at all (for example, in the event of a Member State’s only permitting public health care)."
"The June List believes, however, that responsibility should mainly lie at Member State level."
"If it emerges that one Member State or another is abusing its position and distorting competition, it is important for the party that may have been treated unfairly to be able to have its case examined by the courts."
"The June List has therefore chosen to vote against the proposal that the details should be reported to the Commission."
". I congratulate the rapporteur."
"I should like to highlight the proposed amendment to Article 1 of the Commission’s draft decision, on the application of Article 86 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"I would be in favour, however, of extending the range of beneficiaries to cover the outermost regions."
"In this connection, I recall that the Commission’s communications entitled ‘A stronger partnership for the outermost regions’ and ‘A stronger partnership for the outermost regions: assessment and perspectives’ provided for the introduction of simplified rules for awarding public service contracts in the area of maritime transport serving small islands, with a volume of fewer than 100 000 passengers a year."
"I also wish to point out that in the outermost regions the liberalisation of services and use of infrastructures were made conditional on the introduction of public service obligations, in order to offset the handicaps due to the physical and other characteristics of the outermost regions."
"I should also like to highlight that there are other services of general economic interest of importance to the outermost regions, such as postal services and telecommunications."
"Hence the importance to the outermost regions of these two Commission documents. I therefore feel that the unique situation of these regions must be taken into account in those legal instruments."
". Without funding and planning by national, regional and local authorities, we would not have proper public transport, or generally accessible education and health care."
"The idea of an authority withdrawing and admitting free competition is pernicious to such vital activities."
"If that happens, there will undoubtedly be small privileged groups who consider that they have more freedom of choice and their individual needs are better catered for, but the large majority, and society as a whole, will be worse off."
"This report defends the neo-liberal vision, and even wants to set down an interpretation of the Altmark ruling about the possibility of the underhand assignation of concessions in public transport."
"The Commission and Parliament have waited for this legal judgment for years, because there was an abundance of contradicting interpretations about authorities’ provision of services, about funding and competition."
"There is now a legal judgment that leaves intact local authorities’ right to offer public transport."
"The Commission intends to table an amended proposal following on from my proposals adopted by this House on 14 November 2001."
"I reject neo-liberal interpretations that stand in the way of this."
". Although some very good ideas were expressed, it was particularly important for the European Parliamentary Labour Party that the impact on social housing and health services was taken into account."
"This is why it was very important for the Purvis compromises to be included in the various articles mentioned during the vote."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejects the report, as it does not stand up to the pressure emanating from the Commission to privatise services of general interest, but, if anything, intensifies that pressure in parts."
"It is made even more difficult for municipalities, regions and Member States to offer the services to the public that they are often legally required to provide."
"Public undertakings will have to compete even more with global operators in the field of service provision."
"From the public’s point of view, the provision of public services will further deteriorate: the market functions according to neither social yardsticks nor need, but simply lucrative demand."
"We are particularly critical of the fact that compensation for services of general economic interest will continue fundamentally to be treated as ‘state aid’ and will therefore still come under the state aid regime."
"In addition, only a few public undertakings will continue to receive compensation in any case."
"The report also strengthens the Commission proposal as regards hospitals and social housing."
"Instead of extending the exemptions provided for, to cover at least care services, education, culture and the public media, bureaucratic procedures are now being called for across the board."
"The report totally fails to mention those employed in undertakings providing services of general interest and the general interests of social welfare, such as the protection of the weaker members of society."
"For the big service providers, privatisation initiatives in the field of services of general interest mean profitable business."
"Anyone helping them to achieve those objectives should be conscious of what they are doing."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"Mass unemployment, lack of growth, repeated budget deficits, the explosion of public debt, stifling taxation, relocations ... unfortunately everyone is aware of our sad economic situation."
"Your recipes for dealing with these problems are always the same."
"According to you, the reason that everything is going badly is that there is not enough European standardisation."
"Not enough competition between the European economies, not enough competition in services, not enough openness to global competition, with no regard for whether or not it is fair, not enough immigration of qualified workers, too much social protection."
"Overloaded bureaucracy?"
"That is purely a national problem."
"Your regulations, which are unconsolidated, dense, sometimes incoherent if not absurd, are not responsible!"
"But the monetary policy, which is causing an over-valuation of the euro and draining our economies?"
"It is perfect."
"Neither Brussels nor Frankfurt could get it wrong."
"We think, however, that the Europe of Brussels is getting it wrong."
"Despite 20 years of standardisation, and Europe entering into global free trade, our problems are only getting worse."
"And the reason for that is precisely this policy, your policy."
"Sometimes, one is forced, as an MEP, to make a choice between two bad alternatives and choose the least bad."
"In this case, I voted in favour of Amendments 9 and 22, although I did not agree with everything they said. In spite of everything, they were better than the original wordings and would thus, if accepted, improve the report as a whole."
"We have voted in favour of the report on public finances in EMU – 2004 and also in favour of Amendment 7 about distinguishing between loans for investments and current expenditure."
"It is our view, however, that the ability to provide loans for public investments and thus exceed the ceiling for budget deficits should be reserved for those countries that fulfil the national debt criterion."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"The next item is an oral question to the Commission on the policy for financing nature protection and especially Natura 2000."
". Mr President, Commissioner, both Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a large number of NGOs believe that the European Union’s Natura 2000 programme is in grave danger."
"The decisions taken last year by the previous Commission on the financing of this programme were extremely vague, meaning that it is already a foregone conclusion that there will be a major dispute between farmers and those in favour of Natura 2000 within the Committee on Agriculture and among those in charge of the Regional Development Fund."
"We therefore believe that Mr Dimas must devote a great deal of energy to finding a simple solution to the problem of how Natura 2000 is to be reinforced in future."
"What matters is not the level of funding, or even the individual programmes; what matters is that the ideas associated with the Natura 2000 programme are translated into real-life policies."
"It is for this reason that funding must not be tied up in negotiating structures to such an extent that it disappears when the crucial debates are finally held."
"We have used the Habitat Directive for many years to encourage the Member States to designate appropriate sites in their territory, whilst assuring them that funding would be guaranteed."
"If we were to stop this funding now, or even to take it out of the budgets for agriculture or regional development, it would be a pretty poor show on our part."
"It would inevitably lead to arguments, and this is why we are asking you today to take proactive measures to prevent this problem."
"If it turned out at some point in the future that funding were to be taken out of the agriculture or regional development pillars, we would have hundreds of thousands of mayors lined up here to complain, and there would be little hope for the NGOs or for you as Environment Commissioner."
"There is no need for me to remind you that a strong agricultural lobby exists, to which I, as a farmer, also belong."
"It is therefore inevitable that disputes will arise."
"I should like to encourage you to ensure that your Commission lays down clear rules, and I would be very grateful to you for doing so."
"I hope that we will be able to adopt this regulation."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that the protection of biodiversity is a priority policy for the Commission and that the successful application of the Natura 2000 framework is the cornerstone of the European Union's efforts to achieve this objective."
"Securing adequate financing for Natura 2000, as Mr Florenz stressed, is therefore one of our top priorities, and I fully endorse the objectives and priorities of the European Parliament."
"I should also like to point out that this priority is shared by many of my colleagues in the Commission, who have agreed to adjust the Regional, Agricultural and other Funds in order to include Natura 2000 in financing."
"The Member States have a legal obligation and are committed to effective management of Natura 2000 areas."
"Safeguarding the financial resources for such management comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States but, precisely because of the specialised character of Natura 2000, the Commission helps by providing Community cofinancing."
"Use of these Community resources is the responsibility of the Member States but, for our part, we are prepared to offer all possible help in order to facilitate access to them."
"If, therefore, it is found that management of these areas is not being adequately supported, the Commission is prepared to refer the Member State in question to the Court of Justice."
"Bearing this in mind, the Commission, as Mr Florenz said, adopted a communication on financing for Natura 2000 on 15 July 2004."
"It examined all the possible permutations, including the creation of a separate fund, and concluded that the most efficient approach is to incorporate financing for Natura 2000 in existing Community funds."
"The new Structural Fund regulations, which are currently being discussed in the Council, will be applied by the Member States and the regions on a decentralised basis."
"Consequently, there is no facility to determine a specific sum within any one fund."
"For the time being also, we cannot know what sums it will be possible to make available each year for cofinancing of Natura 2000 areas during the period from 2007 to 2013."
"This is because, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, it is incumbent upon each Member State to decide on the requirements of these areas when preparing their national programmes."
"In all events, the Commission has the means to safeguard priority for Natura 2000 within these national programmes."
"I shall come back to this point at the end of my intervention."
"To start with, a few comments on the new regulations being debated."
"As regards the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, I must say that it contains a reference to cofinancing for Natura 2000 and for biodiversity, which are included in the objectives of convergence and competitiveness."
"There are also cofinancing facilities under the Cohesion Fund and European Social Fund regulations, especially in order to strengthen management capacities in relation to Natura 2000."
"Natura 2000 is also included – and this is important – in the second land management axis in the new rural development regulation, which will account for 25% of its total."
"The Commission is proposing a total of EUR 22 billion for land management during the period from 2007 to 2013."
"It is necessary – and here, Mr Florenz, I need the support of the European Parliament – for this sum to be secured and, if possible, increased."
"The support of the European Parliament on this issue is therefore of prime importance."
"The new regulations contain mechanisms which allow the Commission, as I said earlier, to provide guidance and to control to some degree the content of the programmes submitted by the Member States."
"Immediately after the adoption of the proposed regulations for the Structural Funds, which will possibly happen towards the end of spring, the Commission will define its specific priorities for financing all the funds in detail in one set of strategic guidelines."
"As is standard practice, consultations will be held on the content of the guidelines with the participation of all the interested services, including the Environment DG."
"Care will be taken during these consultations to ensure that cofinancing for Natura 2000 is included as a priority."
"Once the strategic guidelines have been issued, the Member States will need to prepare national strategic frameworks during the second half of 2005 or in early 2006, together with operational programmes, which they will submit to the Commission."
"All the interested Commission services will be included in the consultations held on the content of these programmes."
"Of course, suitable action will be taken on the part of the Environment DG to safeguard the priority of Natura 2000 actions."
"In particular, as far as national rural development programmes are concerned, which Mr Florenz said earlier would be in a competitive relationship, every programme submitted will be examined in detail in order to ensure that account is taken both of the Community legislative framework and the priorities of policy on issues such as biodiversity, Natura 2000 area management, climate change, the application of ideas on water resources and other issues."
"If, of course, it is found that a national programme does not include adequate financial coverage for all this, the Commission services always have the right to reject it."
"This is another safeguard to ensure that Natura 2000 maintains its priority in the Member States' programmes, although it is not an absolute guarantee."
"It is therefore the main obligation of everyone interested in financing Natura 2000 to exert pressure so that the Member States not only propose ambitious objectives in their national and operational programmes, but also safeguard permanent and continuing action to prepare valid Natura 2000 programmes."
"Thank you for your attention."
". Mr President, we are all pleased that the Commission has dealt with the issues of the Natura 2000 Network, which relates to the LIFE Programme, for which I am shadow rapporteur."
"Nevertheless, I believe we are finding the situation very frustrating because the issue has been dealt with without taking account of the concepts which are essential to sustainability and, furthermore, we have made the old mistake of seeing Natura 2000 as a crystallised territory, with no life or activity."
"Since the first declaration of protected areas, Natura 2000, rather than bringing society pleasure, has become a problem."
"Nowhere wants to be declared a protected area, because there is no parallel support policy."
"It has become a constant battle."
"There has been no education about the exploitation of natural resources, nor of the true added value of the Natura Network, which generates and awakens enthusiasm."
"Furthermore, there has been hidden expropriation, since the use of land is much more restricted than before and, in many cases, the value of the land is reduced."
"It has therefore become a burden."
"So what is the problem with the document we are dealing with?"
"Firstly, it does not recognise typologies."
"We cannot introduce the concept of Natura 2000 without looking at the great families of biodiversity, because each of them requires a different financial instrument."
"For example, how are the marine funds, which do not appear, to be managed by means of rural development?"
"A separate Natura will have to be created."
"Neither are rivers treated as significant, while I believe they should be treated as an essential project."
"Neither is there any proper distinction between the different forest areas."
"There should at least have been an indication of an intention to produce a diversified policy."
"Finally, I would like to say that, if we did not introduce Natura into the market economy, we will not have achieved anything, because nature means life, economy and sustainability."
". Mr President, some years ago a leading EU official visited a small village in eastern Hungary."
"The village was close to a wetland – a real bird paradise."
"As we got out of the car he asked me to stay silent for a while."
"He wanted just to listen to the concerto of the birds and the cicadas."
"In our region in the west, he told me sadly, we have lost these untouched nature sites forever; you should preserve yours at any price."
"The goal of the Natura 2000 initiative can be defined by scientific criteria, but the basic motivation is simple: to save at least some parts of European natural sites for ourselves and for future generations."
"The biggest challenge for our future is the decrease in natural resources such as clean air, pure water and a healthy environment."
"A high grade of biodiversity is crucial for a healthy living environment, for food security and for quality of life in general."
"In addition to these goals, Natura 2000 is also an effective tool to support European villages and the people living there."
"It is an important way of promoting organic farming and ecotourism."
"It provides jobs and revitalises rural areas."
"Natura 2000 can help redefine the role of rural areas in Europe."
"I hope we came here to praise Natura 2000, not to bury it, as Shakespeare might have said."
"The future of our natural heritage needs and deserves at least the EUR 6.1 billion per year set aside for these brief projects."
"Natura 2000 can be funded in different ways, either by what is known as 'earmarking' a share of existing funds, or through an independent Natura 2000 fund."
"There are many technical details we have to resolve, but we should be united on one thing: the level of funding for Natura 2000 cannot be even one cent lower than was proposed earlier by the Commission."
"I ask every political group and everybody in leading positions to rescue the original proposal and to improve it in order to ensure that, one way or another, the given amount will be spent entirely on Natura 2000 purposes."
"Mr President, we have known for a long time that less and less land is needed to produce food, which means that we can indulge in more extensive agriculture and can create more nature as a result."
"As far as I am concerned, agriculture is a specific component of rural development, and as far as I am concerned, so is the Natura 2000 programme."
"Nature plays an essential role in the development of the countryside and cannot be see in isolation from other aspects of agriculture and of other employment initiatives in the countryside."
"For years, Europe has promoted this by means of legislation."
"We are familiar with the Bird and Habitat Directive, which has been transposed into the Flora and Fauna Act in the Netherlands, and we have created special payments systems for all those regulations."
"We are also familiar with the mountain farmers’ regulation, the Natura 2000 additional payments, and such like."
"As for the future, I have already said that I see all those programmes as forming part of rural development, and I think that we should therefore ensure that a special fund for Natura 2000 is set up within the framework of the rural development fund."
"The big question then is: how should the money be spent?"
"As the Commissioner already indicated, we are familiar with the system of cofinancing, which, in my view, can take on special forms."
"In some countries, this cofinancing is clearly a problem – probably a bigger problem for poorer countries than for the richer ones."
"Perhaps the Commission could look into the possibility of having different cofinancing systems running parallel in the framework of this programme?"
"Following on from what I said about agriculture being, by nature, a form of rural development, another question which the Commission might be able to look into is whether subsidies to agriculture are generally more expensive than subsidies to nature development in Europe."
". Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your answer, but we are not satisfied with it."
"I am not satisfied with it, because, if you will allow me to be particularly direct and straightforward, at the end of the day the question we might ask ourselves today, following your proposals, is whether the European Union really wants to preserve its biodiversity."
"If so, it is like a cathedral, we need to provide the resources to manage the Natura 2000 network."
"Without money, without a budget that is actually set aside for this expenditure, I do not think it is worth us deluding ourselves."
"Commissioner, we are all well aware, and most of my fellow Members in this room know this from their experience on the ground that if it is not clearly stated that funds can be obtained in the regions through the Rural Development Fund, the ERDF Structural Fund or the ESF, then all the money will go to everything but Natura 2000."
"Natura 2000 will be in direct competition with all the other projects."
"Of course, agriculturally there will be possibilities for integration, which will be the proof that Natura 2000 has been integrated."
"But we are not deluding ourselves, Commissioner."
"We really need to go further."
"And because we have absolutely no confidence in this proposal, as rapporteur for Life+, I am proposing, as the Council and the Commission have not decided on the 3 billion euros per year needed for management, that in Life+ we should include a Life section, which was formerly ‘Nature’: Life management Natura 2000."
"We are waiting for all the guarantees that the Natura 2000 network can be put in place, because, Commissioner, both here and on the ground, we have fought hard for it."
"On the ground, we only wanted …"
"Natura 2000 is an important step in protecting and developing biodiversity in the nature reserves of the European Union."
"The policy must be guaranteed by mainstreaming Natura 2000 and integrating it into the main EU funding programmes."
"The financing regulations for these programmes need to reflect this integrated approach."
"Regulations for the 2007-2013 financial perspective now need to be strengthened for the integrated approach to work."
"As you know, there is no interpretation of Gaelic, but we understood part of your intervention."
". Mr President, is there anything the EU does not seek to control?"
"Are there any issues at which most Members of the European Parliament will not try to throw taxpayers' money?"
"Sadly, it seems not."
"Not content with single legal frameworks, tax harmonisation and the rest, the EU apparently wants to control nature."
"That is patently stupid."
"The Habitats Directive of 1992, which established Natura 2000, states the EU's intention to define a common framework for the conservation of wild plants and animals."
"In the bold new Europe, even nature has to be standardised."
"Wiser counsels know this is impossible."
"When man seeks to play God, nature has an uncomfortable habit of reasserting itself."
"As a member of the IND/DEM Group, which has Danish and English co-chairmen, I am reminded of the story of King Canute: tired of the flattery of his courtiers who told him he could control anything and everything, he took them to the beach and commanded the sea to turn back."
"The waves, of course, continued to lap at their feet and the King had proved his point."
"It strikes me that Canute had more sense than Europe's rulers have today."
"If the EU is not power crazy and really is just an economic bloc, perhaps someone could tell me why it is necessary, for example, to list and protect all species of bat?"
"Has anybody asked the bats?"
"No, of course not."
"Once again, I can only conclude that if the EU is the answer, it must have been a silly question."
"You could even call it batty!"
"All people have their own dreams and aspirations and politicians have their ideals and visions, which they subsequently embody in various projects."
"The Natura 2000 project is exceptional simply because it incorporates ideals and also people’s aspirations."
"It is based on the protection of Europe’s cultural and natural heritage, on the preservation and protection of biodiversity."
"Apart from these rather grand ideas, the Natura 2000 project is also exceptional in that it could be a driving force in the development of rural areas."
"It is of great socio-economic significance with respect to employment and tourism and also to the protection of the population’s health."
"Today, just as the Constitutional Treaty is being adopted and ratified in the different states, it is very important that, on this matter too, we are able to say what is the position of Parliament in the development of such projects and what is the position of the Commission, which has to facilitate such projects and which has to provide the resources for the project to achieve its goals."
"The question of cofinancing has often posed problems for many Member States of the European Union, particularly the new ones, since, under the terms of decentralisation, the authorities in the different regions have taken direct responsibility for schools, hospitals and also the protection of this heritage."
"It is therefore important and essential that you provide help in the implementation of this project, that you directly release financial resources to assist those regions which do not have the money for cofinancing."
"Commissioner, you have spoken about subsidiarity with respect to this very matter."
"I should like to ask you, however, to bear in mind that the natural environment has no borders ‘birds don’t need passports’."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for having initiated this debate on Natura 2000."
"In comparison to other European countries, Poland can boast of significant achievements in the field of environmental protection."
"The designation of protected areas is a Polish tradition that goes back to the 19th century, with such areas now covering 32% of the country, up from 9% just 20 years ago."
"Yet Poland is concerned at the fact that whilst the concept of the Natura 2000 network in Europe has evolved, this has not been backed up by an appropriate guarantee of funding for the creation and maintenance of this network."
"The country has therefore put its name to the declaration submitted by a majority of EU Member States in October and December, in which they express their disappointment at the European Commission’s proposal concerning the cofinancing of the Natura 2000 network."
"No clear details are provided regarding the principles according to which funding can be obtained for protection measures for Natura 2000 sites between 2007 and 2013, and this will undoubtedly mean shortfalls in funding for the Natura 2000 network."
"It will then be impossible to implement many much-needed protection measures."
"The majority of areas designated as Natura 2000 sites in Poland will not be covered by the funds indicated, for example, land that is part of national forests, or swamps, natural grasslands, dunes, moorlands and scrublands that are not used for agricultural purposes."
"In the context of the European Commission’s letter of 6 January 2005 to Poland, which suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of extending the list of Natura 2000 sites in the country, a guarantee of separate funding for the establishment of the Natura 2000 network has taken on even greater significance for Poland and other countries."
"Poland therefore expects that in the course of work on the new Financial Perspective, appropriate levels of funding will be safeguarded for the establishment of the Natura 2000 network."
"I would suggest that the LIFE+ Regulation also contains separate provisions for LIFE+ and for Natura 2000."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by saying, by way of an introduction, that I am fully aware that when acting in your capacity as Environment Commissioner you are following in the tradition of the Commission, a European institution."
"The comments I am about to make will therefore relate to the Commission, and not to you personally."
"Firstly, it is my opinion that the reason why this House is having to deal with the problem of Natura 2000 is that the Commission has not had the courage to propose a suitable financial instrument."
"This is the first point I should like to make; in the Habitat Directive we committed ourselves to cofinancing and to the provision of funding, yet no corresponding provisions have been made in our various funds."
"Neither, secondly, has the Commission had the courage to ensure that the existing regulations – the Structural Funds Regulation and the Rural Development Regulation – contain appropriate stipulations."
"They are full of ‘can’s’, ‘should’s’ and ‘could’s’, which is by no means adequate, or at least not in our opinion, and indeed we are all aware of where such language gets us."
"The intention is that regions in the Member States submit operational programmes, and the Commission then assesses and approves them."
"We are well aware of this, but there is no guarantee that what is written down will actually be read."
"In the current programming period, for example, the advancement of women’s concerns has been included as a goal in the Structural Funds Regulation, and indeed this was something for which Parliament fought strongly."
"The Member States, however, have reacted by doing next to nothing, and this is intolerable."
"It is for this reason that we need a separate instrument to finance Natura 2000, and indeed this House has already agreed that a separate financial instrument is needed; one need only look at the individual committees’ opinions on the Financial Perspective."
"The Committee on Agriculture has already said that the protection of biodiversity is not a primary or genuine rural development policy."
"We all know what that means; our agriculture experts do not want to have to use money from rural development funds to pay for Natura 2000 either."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"With a single exception, we are all agreed that Natura 2000 is incredibly important, and we are also all agreed that the money must be obtained."
"I do not know if everyone is aware of how much money is involved – at least EUR 6 billion per year."
"This means that at least EUR 3 billion must be obtained from Natura 2000."
"This could not ever possibly be obtained using just one fund."
"Irrespective of ways and means, we must have this project integrated into the other funds, and that is something on which we agree."
"We shall support the Commission in this matter, and I must also say that the green movements, Bird Life etc are in favour of our having the funding of Natura 2000 integrated."
"The problem is that I could not glean from the Commissioner’s answer how he is to ensure that this will in actual fact happen."
"Mr Florenz provided an engaging description of the conflicts that will arise."
"If it has not been ensured that the money is earmarked and tied, nothing will come of matters."
"Purely for the sake of funding, we therefore need a clearer answer from the Commission than we have received so far."
"Allow me also to say, however, that it is not only an issue of obtaining enough money."
"It is also an issue of getting the whole of our rural districts policy in tune with the natural environment, so that agriculture is carried on, and development pursued, in these areas in ways that respect the vulnerable natural environment instead of, as now, in ways that include driving large road systems through vulnerable areas."
"I have seen how, in Poland, exemptions are granted for brutal pannage in an extremely vulnerable and very rich, but therefore fragile, natural environment."
"We therefore need also to take account of the way in which we develop rural districts and to ensure that Natura 2000 is incorporated and that there is enough money."
"If the money cannot be found within the existing funds mentioned, allow me to point out that we have just obtained a majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in favour also of beginning to examine the first pillar, where almost all of the EU’s money is, of course, to be found."
"There are such large sums allocated to direct agricultural aid that it is time we began to look at this aid."
"Mr President, Mr Florenz said that Natura 2000 is in grave danger because confusion reigns over the financing of the programme."
"I believe that the problem is a great deal more serious; not only is there no guaranteed funding, there is also an increasing lack of knowledge and growing uncertainty on the ground over what it really means when a Natura 2000 site is designated."
"In view of this, I should like to raise a number of points."
"Firstly, Natura 2000 programmes must not be financed at the expense of farmers, and under no circumstances must farmers be the only ones to suffer; otherwise, as Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines clearly stated, property owners will be deprived almost entirely of what is due to them."
"Secondly, it is intolerable that infrastructure and economic development in large parts of the EU should languish due to delays and a lack of clarity over the designation of sites."
"In many rural areas, investment programmes that would be useful and compatible with the nature of these areas cannot be carried out because questions remain unanswered."
"It is also intolerable that the Natura 2000 programme, the real aim of which is to improve the EU’s standing by sending out a clear signal that we wish to be an environmental union, and not just an economic union, should be perverted in such a way."
"Finally, it is unacceptable that we are reaching a point where no one knows what they are doing any more, and that the reason for this is to be found, above all, in the bureaucratic procedures in Brussels and the Commission."
"Brussels bids us designate sites everywhere – no one is entirely sure where the money will come from, but that can be dealt with later."
"Countries have been told they will be brought before the Court of Justice if they do not designate any sites, something that the Commissioner has now, indeed, confirmed."
"This programme is not about the environment; it is designed to make a public nuisance of itself."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Natura 2000 is one of the major issues that often allow doubts to persist about European construction."
"Our fellow citizens share our ambition of protecting biodiversity and see that we are producing texts, but when it comes to obtaining funds, Europe does not deliver the goods."
"Our fellow citizens accept the idea of sustainable development, thinking that it is possible to reconcile protecting the earth with economic development and employment, but when they need the channels and resources to do this, Europe does not deliver the goods."
"We therefore need to find some new instruments for maintaining Natura 2000."
"I would like to make three demands: first of all, we need a specific fund, because objectively there is a contradiction between expectations for funds to promote economic development, rural development, and sustaining the land in accordance with Natura 2000."
"We therefore need a specific fund, which is the first demand."
"My second demand: the implementation of Natura 2000 needs to be favoured in the criteria for all European funds."
"I will give you an example to illustrate the contradiction."
"In the current ERDF regulation that you are in the process of negotiating, the areas are limited to wooded or cultivated areas."
"Natura 2000 needs natural, untouched land that is not wooded or cultivated, in other words wetlands."
"Thirdly, we need an instrument for innovation, so that practices on the ground are more in line with what we could provide for in the future."
"Therefore in Life + we need a specific instrument and we need to maintain two pillars: a general environmental pillar and a pillar for Life Nature, as we had before."
"As you have understood, Commissioner, as they stand, we do not think that the Commission’s proposals will convince our fellow citizens on the ground."
"We believe that protecting biodiversity is a step forward, which is compatible with the development of rural areas and the economic future of our country."
"We therefore now need proof of this conviction, in the form of three billion euros at least from the Structural Funds."
"I would like to thank Mr Florenz for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important topic."
"It is in all our interests that Natura 2000 should become a workable system."
"This is why we questioned your colleagues during the sitting of the parliamentary committee and that is why we ask you too what assurances and what guarantees you can give us to ensure that the entire network will be financially viable."
"Unfortunately, we have learned that the answers received from the Commission have been meaningless and that they could not promise any kind of solid guarantees behind the attractive facade of an integrated approach."
"But there is a need for guarantees."
"I have come from Hungary, where the government has been able to contravene the earlier agreement made with the European Union, and redirect 8 billion Forints from agricultural-environment protection into direct subsidies for farming."
"Because of this and similar reasons, farmers are demonstrating with their tractors in the capital of my country even as we speak."
"In Hungary there is a saying that if someone burns their mouth once with hot water, then later they will blow on cold water too."
"This is how we feel now the empty responses of the Commission and the stance of some Member States have burned us and are forcing us to be more careful."
"Therefore, I, together with my fellow representatives, ask the Council and likewise the Commission to create a separate budget item serving the goals of Natura 2000, that is within the financial projections in preparation, in parallel with the significant upgrading of the LIFE+ programme and within the farm budget – to which I would immediately add that we can only imagine this together with real increases in the farm budget earmarked for this purpose – or on the other hand, with steps being taken to create a completely separate fund."
"I further ask the representatives of the Commission to take into account the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and also Croatia – which has not been considered in the draft in its current form."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join previous speakers in congratulating the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I see this as a very important debate, and as one that shows that pressure must be brought to bear by this House to ensure that a separate instrument is created to finance Natura 2000."
"One of the previous speakers said that Natura 2000 is seen in some quarters as a programme for annoying the public."
"In a great many other quarters, however, it is viewed as providing real assistance in the struggle to protect biodiversity."
"I believe that it is our task to support those who view it in this way, and, in common with many of my fellow Members, I am therefore in favour of there being a separate financial instrument in future."
"I also believe that it is not entirely accurate to say that it is not the amount of funding made available that matters."
"Many of the NGOs working in this field have told us that the Commission’s estimate of an annual cost of EUR 6.1 billion can only be considered an absolute minimum."
"We will therefore have the task of ensuring that not only a separate instrument, but also sufficient funding, is made available."
"I can see the attraction in an integrated approach, but I share Mrs Haug’s views, who said that the situation is similar to what we have seen in the case of policies on women’s issues; for years anyone who did not wish to give any consideration to women’s issues said that there was no need to do so because of gender mainstreaming."
"Everybody then waited for progressive policies on women’s issues and equal opportunities to miraculously appear."
"If an integrated approach is to be adopted, then what is needed is a dual strategy; integration into existing funds, but a separate financial instrument in future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in Germany we have a rule that is no less clear for being unwritten, namely that he who places an order foots the bill, and indeed it is a well-known fact that very little happens in this EU of ours without money."
"The European Union ordered, or rather instigated, the establishment of the Natura 2000 network throughout Europe."
"Yet the EU has still not provided a precise definition of what kind of measures must be taken, what kind of regulations must be adopted or what kind of arrangements must be made with regard to the sites that have been designated, and indeed this fact was pointed out a short time ago by Commissioner Dimas."
"The annual cost of Natura 2000 has now been estimated by the Commission to be EUR 6.1 billion."
"This is a great deal of money, yet at the same time it is very little for all 25 Member States, depending on the final scope of the programme."
"At present management plans for SACs have to be drawn up on a national and regional basis, and it is not hard to see that each area will have varying requirements when it comes to a field as complex as environmental protection, and that different measures will therefore need to be put in place."
"Questions still remain, such as the instances in which greater expenditure will become necessary, and whether there should be changes to land use, given that this would mean a shortfall in income and financial losses for agricultural undertakings."
"The Commission is now proposing that money spent on these commitments should come from existing EU funds."
"This is a source of some concern to me, and it would mean that a struggle for funding of the kind referred to by Mr Florenz would be inevitable."
"A separate financial instrument must be created that allows compensation to be granted in every instance where restrictions have been imposed as a result of Natura 2000 sites being designated."
"That, Mrs Haug, is what the farmers are calling for."
"It is intolerable that an increase in funding for SAC compensation should occur at the expense of agricultural and environmental measures or of other rural development programmes."
"Sufficient funding must be provided by the European Union for any additional tasks and costly obligations it imposes."
"This would then safeguard the substance of Natura 2000."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this question by Mr Florenz is appropriate because the Natura 2000 Network is the most important initiative undertaken by the European Union in the field of protecting natural areas and the Member States have understood this."
"My country, which represents 16% of the European Union’s territory, contains 40% of the entire Natura 2000 Network: 25% of Spanish territory is included in it."
"Natura 2000, however, has a cost that has not so far been calculated precisely."
"The EUR 6 100 million calculated by the Commission could be very far from accurate, because this figure does not take sufficient account of the spending on compensation which could have been paid to landowners and farmers who, in reality, are deprived of the use of their land and the rights over it."
"Furthermore, we should remember that, as well as for managing natural resources, we should compensate them for loss of revenue, as laid down in Article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, included in the European Constitution."
"The Natura 2000 Network is a Community initiative, and the European Union must therefore take responsibility not just for the cost of managing the areas, but also for the loss of revenue for the farmers."
"Commissioner Wallström’s proposal to fund part of this cost by means of the rural development policy indicates that the Commission is not taking the Natura 2000 Network seriously or that it undervalues rural development, or both."
"The Member States must choose between these two objectives; one always at the expense of the other."
"If the proposal being presented on the new European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, with a funding of EUR 11 000 million per year, is accepted, we would have to deduct 20% of that sum in order to fund a substantial proportion of the cost of Natura 2000."
"Furthermore, the reform of the CAP in September 2003 extended the list of actions to be funded from rural development, adding to it improving quality, food safety and the welfare of livestock."
"The Natura 2000 Network is therefore very important and requires an instrument for funding, either exclusively or by improving the sum for rural development."
"Mr President, the question asked by my colleague, Mr Florenz, is a legitimate one."
"There is a political gulf between the priorities set for the Community and the lack of clarity regarding financing."
"It is worthy of you, Commissioner Dimas, that you should express a wish, as you did at the start of this debate, to safeguard the financing of Natura 2000."
"In addition, we also need effective tools to make your wish a reality."
"We need a special fund."
"A key challenge for the European Union is to protect the diversity of nature in the area we all share."
"Diversity is an all-important issue and for that reason it does not need to be justified separately here."
"Every Member State has committed itself to this by drawing up a list of its conservation areas in accordance with the Habitats Directive."
"From the point of view of nature conservation policy, the Natura 2000 network is unique, because it protects the environment of approximately 200 habitat types and 700 species, and will soon cover more than 17% of the EU’s territory."
"The Natura 2000 network requires considerable input on the part of the Member States."
"The areas must not see any significant reduction in the natural resources which qualify them for inclusion in the Natura network."
"The authorities must likewise draft an appraisal of the environmental impact in all projects and plans that may have an effect on the natural worth of the areas concerned."
"As this wide-ranging impact of the Natura 2000 network on all current and planned conservation area activity will demand a good deal in the way of resources and financial investment from the EU Member States, we really must ensure that sufficient, comprehensive funding is assigned at EU level to the administration of the Natura 2000 network by means of a separate financial instrument."
"Mr President, the Commission’s Communication on the financing of Natura 2000 lists various possibilities for dealing with the needs that will arise during the 2007-2013 period."
"It concludes, as the Commissioner pointed out, that the creation of a new financial instrument is not the appropriate formula."
"I completely agree with this point of view, even though it has not been expressed a great deal here this afternoon."
"The Natura 2000 areas proposed by the Member States are eligible as priorities, in the majority of cases, for the Cohesion and Structural Funds, and could be priorities for benefiting from Life funds for the costs of managing and monitoring the programmes."
"Why, therefore, should we want to distinguish the funding of Natura 2000 programmes from the funding of regional or rural policies?"
"The actions in both cases are very much linked, whether the objectives are related to local development, protecting environments or maintaining biodiversity."
"There would be a huge risk that Natura 2000 would become completely disconnected from everything that was done elsewhere in the areas concerned."
"The obstacles encountered during the long – or even very long – period of defining the Natura 2000 areas would be multiplied, and the isolation of this mechanism, which is supposed to be exemplary, would be even greater."
"The other risk would be that it would be excessively complex to implement and manage programmes."
"This would result in an increase in operational costs and create the impression of a monumental technocracy that would be rejected by the populations concerned."
"Finally, it should be pointed out that the forecast costs of the programmes are very variable depending on the country and the Natura 2000 areas chosen."
"Intelligent use of the Structural Funds, to which additional funds under Life could possibly be added, would, in my view, enable us to respond to them much better than with a specific financial instrument."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, historically many habitats which elsewhere in Europe have vanished have survived in the new Member States."
"This is why priority was given at the national policy level to setting up the Natura2000 network."
"Today, now that the inventory of territories to be protected and their importance for preserving biological diversity are fully understood, the resources for maintaining them may be lacking."
"The Commission has announced that it supports funding Natura 2000 from the Rural Development Funds and the Structural Funds."
"It has not, however, planned to create a specific financial instrument designed for the network."
"I believe that particularly in the new Member States, where there is intense competition at the local project level to obtain resources from Structural Funds and the rural support funds, the European Union nature protection network does not have much prospect of obtaining match funding: this state of affairs should not be permitted."
"First, we ought to create a new, unified environmental funding instrument."
"Second, we should welcome proposals to supplement the activities supported in the draft regulation with the following – allocating funding for the management of those habitats which will not find support within the framework of the Structural Funds and the Rural Development Funds, allocating funding for pilot projects in the field of environmental technologies, planning preparatory measures for future allocation of money from the Structural Funds."
"Only in such a way will accessible sources of funds complement each other in order to maintain Natura 2000, and will we achieve what we intended when creating the Natura 2000 programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there can be no one who does not believe that nature and the environment need to be protected, and Natura 2000 is an outstanding idea and a positive initiative."
"When it comes down to brass tacks, however, and the time comes to provide money for initiatives of this kind and to get them off the ground, a large number of those who had previously expressed their enthusiasm beat a pretty hasty retreat."
"The number of people who put themselves out in any way, or who are at least willing to do so, is small."
"A number of teething problems have been experienced with regard to the implementation of Natura 2000 that could potentially have been avoided."
"For example, the Netherlands has taken the opportunity to ban hunting in many parts of the country, using Natura 2000 as a pretext."
"I believe that this has given rise to a great deal of opposition, and in fact Commissioner Wallström stated clearly during the previous parliamentary term that Natura 2000 is entirely compatible with hunting."
"It is also important that knowledge be shared and that uncertainties over application be resolved."
"I am firmly convinced that the officials in Mr Dimas’ DG have done splendid work in the past, yet no matter how much effort is expended, work of this kind cannot be carried out unless the groundwork has been laid."
"Natura 2000 must not be implemented at the expense of landowners or agriculture, and compensation must be granted instead of depriving people of what is due to them."
"Natura 2000 must not be implemented at the expense of the common agricultural policy or rural development."
"Natura 2000 sites cover 15% of the old EU, and funding measures for the remaining 85% – not including cities and built-up areas – come under rural development and agriculture."
"No further reductions should be made to this large area, and I therefore believe that separate and ample funding would be the best solution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Natura 2000 is an extremely ambitious programme that has been in existence for a great many years."
"It sometimes imposes restrictions upon landowners, yet this is the first time that the Commission has turned its attention to financing for the programme at European level."
"The Commission is proposing that the programme be cofinanced, and I support this proposal."
"At the same time, however, it is proposing that the money should come from the Rural Development and Structural Funds, and there are a number of reasons for thinking that the primary source of funding is intended to be rural development, as no separate fund exists for Natura 2000."
"As rapporteur for rural development, I must stress the need for a guarantee that either a new fund will be created to finance Natura 2000, or that new provisions will be made to allocate more money to rural development."
"Another point I should like to stress is that as a result of the decisions taken by Brussels to cap the agriculture budget until 2013, and following CAP reform, which moved modulation funds from the first to the second pillar – or in other words to cofinancing for rural development – it is inevitable that landowners and farmers will receive compensation for their efforts from this pillar."
"Something else that is quite clear is that there can be no question of the budget available being any less than that proposed by the previous Prodi Commission."
"It is impossible to have more Europe for less money when there are 25 Member States, and I am entirely opposed to property being encroached upon without appropriate compensation being granted."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, today’s debate focuses on the question: ‘How does the European Commission, when applying its integrated approach, intend to ensure that the aims of Natura 2000 are met in practice?’"
"No satisfactory answer has so far been put forward, since neither the European Rural Development Fund nor the Structural Funds enable all the aims of Natura 2000 to be met, or cover all the necessary cofinancing requirements."
"Therefore, I consider it important that an opportunity be given to use the Life+ Programme to cover the deficit."
"I believe the present proposal should be amended to include an opportunity to make available EU cofinancing for the protection and restoration of habitats of European importance that lie outside agricultural or forested areas."
"This is why Natura 2000 should be added to the Life+ regulation as a separately funded activity; also, it would be expedient in the case of Life+ to direct most of the funding for projects through the Member States."
"Here the actual contribution of each Member State to the EU Natura 2000 network should be taken into account, including the area of designated bird and nature protection areas."
"One current problem is that neither the Structural Funds nor the Rural Development Fund take this Member State contribution to the Natura 2000 network into account, but rather, give preference to projects in more densely populated areas."
"Coming from Estonia, I can testify that one of Estonia’s unique assets is the existence of relatively extensive natural areas."
"Estonia’s projects encompass 16% of the country’s land area."
"The preservation of these areas is simpler and cheaper at the moment than the restoration of former natural areas in Central Europe."
"It is not, therefore, logical that a fund to support nature protection activities uses population density, but not the current preservation status of natural resources, as a criterion for funding."
"Mr President, I support the concept of integrating care for the environment into other policies such as the structural funds, agricultural funds and so on. However, anyone who cares for the environment knows that the Member States cannot necessarily be trusted to make integration work."
"We have heard much about that this afternoon."
"I would like to draw the Commissioner's attention to the following point: some states have been very slow to designate Natura 2000 sites at all."
"Four countries – the Netherlands, France, Italy and Finland – have Court judgments against them for inadequate designation of special protection areas for birds."
"Only one country in the EU – the Netherlands – has completed its designation of special areas for conservation."
"These sites make up the Natura 2000 list, so how can we possibly be happy to leave the financing to Member States when they cannot be trusted to nominate the sites?"
"It is a triumph of hope over experience to suppose that Member States will provide adequate funding for Natura 2000, unless the incentives of specific co-financing for it are on offer via the EU budget."
"If and when Mr Dimas replies to the debate, I would like to ask him to give us some up-to-date news on exactly how Natura 2000 is progressing."
"Are a number of Member States still not in contact with the Commission on the designation of sites, or is the network now complete?"
"Second, those who want EU funding for all the Natura 2000 sites have to guard against overbidding."
"We need the assurance that care will be integrated into Natura 2000 via the structural funds."
"We also need funding via the annual bidding process for the special needs of certain Natura 2000 sites, possibly through the establishment of a biodiversity programme within the LIFE+ Programme."
"The Commission has never liked the LIFE Programme."
"It involves very few officials doing a lot of very hard work trying to track down what is happening to very small amounts of money."
"There is no doubt that it would be administratively convenient for the Commission completely to wind up the LIFE Programme But it would be wrong to do this, Commissioner."
"You might say that what you are trying to do is effective, but my colleagues and I believe it is wrong."
"Commissioner, the inclusion of the Natura 2000 Network in the Regulation on rural development, as proposed by the Commission, is equivalent to throwing away this very ambitious nature protection initiative."
"We all know that, following the current discussions on the financial perspectives, there may not be sufficient funds even to cover the lines that until now have been funded by means of the rural development fund, let alone the new actions planned following the reform of September 2003, on improving safety, food quality and livestock welfare."
"It is, therefore, a fantasy to believe that, in this context, there will be money to pay for the enormous cost of Natura 2000."
"Less and less is known about the funding of this network, but we must acknowledge that we have never really known."
"Evidence of this is the designation of the areas for the Natura 2000 Network, which has been delayed by at least twelve years, since the adoption of the directive on habitats."
"When the European Commission originally consulted civil society, all the actors — from the farmers to the ecological organisations — expressed their support for funding that initiative by means of a separate and single fund, since that would be the only way to oblige the European Union to make a funding effort."
"The Commission, however, took no notice of any of the actors involved in that initiative."
"Funding a substantial proportion of the cost of Natura 2000 by means of rural development is not just a fantasy, but its inclusion within the context of agri-environmental measures could jeopardise the efforts of European farmers to respect the ecological conditions imposed on them by the recently implemented reform of the CAP."
"The European Commission says that nature conservation is one of its priorities, but at the end of the day it is miserly with the money and expects the farmers and landowners to take responsibility for its financial cost."
". Madam President, thank you very much for that constructive debate."
"The Commission is fully aware of the importance of securing adequate Community cofinancing for Natura 2000, for which the lists have been approved for five of the six regions, with few gaps in the lists."
"All the new Member States have submitted their lists."
"The integration approach as proposed is consistent with the intention of Article 8 of the Habitats Directive, which calls for cofinancing from existing funds."
"It also builds on existing practice, which is that the rural development and structural funds are already the most important sources of Community funding for the network."
"It is estimated that EUR 500 million is spent each year from rural development funds in support of agri-environment measures for Natura 2000 sites."
"The Commission has taken note of the concerns with regard to the great limitations of the rural development and structural funds."
"In response to this, the latest proposals recognise the need to expand the funding opportunities for Natura 2000 compared with the existing situation."
"In both the rural development and structural fund regulations, funding for Natura 2000 is made more explicit and its scope extended."
"Of particular significance is the extension of funding for forestry areas in the new rural development regulation."
"The importance of this cannot be underestimated since forestry areas represent 30% of the Natura 2000 network."
"The Commission will ensure that the integration of Natura 2000 into existing funds is made more effective by including it as a priority in the strategic guidelines that will be issued to Member States when they commence the preparation of their structural fund programmes."
"In its negotiations with the Member States on the content of these programmes, the Commission will seek to ensure that the allocations for Natura 2000 match this declared Community priority."
"The Commission will also have to approve the national and operational programmes presented to it."
"In respect to the proposal for LIFE+, I wish to stress that it is intended to continue to support Natura 2000."
"The Member States have the flexibility to set their own priorities and decide the amounts provided for Natura 2000."
"It may, therefore, be the case that Natura 2000 will attract a far higher percentage of the LIFE resources than is presently the case."
"Designating a precise amount for Natura 2000 in LIFE+ also risks giving the impression that it would be a dedicated fund capable of covering all the needs of the network."
"Our proposal is in line with the general principle of integration and simplification of all the other Commission proposals in the context of the Financial Perspectives."
"There are now ongoing discussions in the Council and in Parliament on the Commission draft regulation for LIFE+."
"If the European Parliament makes a proposal for an amendment during the legislative process, I will of course be prepared to examine it seriously."
"In conclusion, the Commission proposals, without offering explicit guarantees, are still able to cover the financial needs for the Natura 2000 network."
"I encourage you, therefore, to give your support to the various Commission proposals currently before Parliament."
"I welcome your interest in Natura 2000 and look forward to working with Parliament to ensure its effective implementation as a current central pillar of Community biodiversity policy."
"Thank you very much for your attention."
"Madam President, this is a debate, or it should be."
"If we are simply going to read speeches to each other, we might as well exchange our views by post."
"I asked Commissioner Dimas one question: is the Natura network of sites complete, or is the Commission still taking Member States to court for failing to designate those sites?"
"There is no point in us talking about funding for sites if the Commission does not know what the sites are."
". Madam President, I shall repeat what I said before: lists have been approved for five out of six regions, with few gaps in the list."
"All the new Member States have submitted their lists."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A6-0008/2005) by Mrs Ries, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 (2004/2132(INI))."
". Madam President, what the Commission should really have done in this Action Plan was to put forward legislative proposals."
"The latter are an essential part of any action plan, and I hope that Mr Dimas agrees that the central focus of this Action Plan ought to have been the protection of children."
"Yet if we ask ourselves what Mr Dimas has turned the Commission’s SCALE programme into, the answer must be that SCALE is now short for ‘stopping caring about legislating for the environment’, and this, Mr Dimas, is the major criticism that must be levelled at your proposal."
"It is true that you inherited it from the previous Commission, but an action plan cannot consist merely of research, research and more research, with not a single genuine measure to reduce environmental pollution and impact on health, in particular children’s health."
"An action plan should also not be something that uses a lack of scientific consensus to put off action indefinitely, as that would be to turn the precautionary principle completely on its head."
"What we expect from you, Mr Dimas, is action, and I am delighted that this House has sent a clear signal in this respect today; we cannot lend our approval to your Action Plan, which in reality is nothing but a plan of non-action."
"After all, we agree that the protection of children must be an absolute priority for the European Union;"
"I therefore find it incomprehensible that you can dare to submit a plan of non-action of this kind to this House, and not only that, but that you can dare to call it an action plan."
"I believe that this not only insults the intelligence of Members of this House; it flies in the face of our expectations and indeed of the Commission’s previous proposals."
"I should like to say to Mr Schnellhardt and the Group of the European People’s Party that I take a dim view of those who bow to pressure from the tobacco lobby and say that passive smoking does not cause cancer, as this is very far from being the truth."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Ries on her report."
"The recognition that health is interconnected with our physical and social environment must become a consistent aspect of mainstream policy and debate."
"Mrs Ries is correct in her criticism of the significant gap that exists between the Commission's initial health and environment strategy and this action plan."
"The gap can be seen in the small number of concrete actions proposed."
"We also need to look at the success stories in Ireland and elsewhere in relation to the smoking ban in workplaces."
"There has been an 18% drop in cigarette consumption in Ireland and many who opposed a complete ban on tobacco smoke in workplaces now accept it as normal."
"We need to move beyond the notion that health is simply a lifestyle choice and the action plan fails to do this."
"For the most disadvantaged in our society to be empowered to break free from ill health and poverty, we need defined and concerted action by Member States and the Commission."
"Such action must also be adequately resourced."
"More action is needed in working with health professionals and NGOs to empower communities to play an active part in building a better environment; we need more action on the protection of children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups, from hazardous environments and products; we need more action on removing hazardous chemicals from the market; and we need adequate labelling on the environmental and health implications of products and materials."
"It is also vital that we have recourse to the precautionary principle because of the possible serious risks to health if we fail to act."
"I wholeheartedly agree with Mrs Ries and her assertion that in order to ensure the coherence and effectiveness of the action plan, it is necessary to establish adequate funding now for the 2004-2007 period."
"I would like to thank her for her work and commend her report to Parliament."
"I should like to point out to Mrs de Brún and to the other Members of the House that interpretation can only be provided for speeches made in an official language of the European Union."
". We believe that the European Environment Action Plan for 2004-2010 has significant shortcomings, and that it does not deal with the root of the problems."
"The fact that the warnings issued by many experts have been ignored for years is not only a result of ignorance and thoughtlessness, but also of the activities of wealthy and influential interest groups that profit from other people’s misfortune."
"Risk analyses have already demonstrated that a clear risk exists, so research similar to the National Children’s Study is not what is needed in many Member States."
"That would amount to no more than another risk analysis."
"What are actually needed are immediate corrective measures that both reduce and, ideally, eliminate sources of harmful emissions, as such measures would genuinely make it possible to protect people’s health and save their lives."
"An effective monitoring system is also required, comprising regional screening panels and local prevention programmes."
"The Action Plan should focus more on protection of the environment, including the local environment, and on the setting up of a European Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry."
"Like its American prototype, this Agency’s remit would be to offer a service to citizens of EU Member States by making use of scientific advances, providing reliable information and reacting to public health threats."
"In my opinion, the European Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry should come under the umbrella of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and work together with the European Environment Agency. I thank you."
". Madam President, we live in an internal market community, comprising 25 Member States and encompassing a population of over 475 million people."
"This creates a system where there is free movement of people from one Member State to the next."
"It therefore makes a lot of political sense for the European Union to take a lead coordinating role to promote better health within the European Union."
"The EU is in a very strong position to see exactly which Member States are exercising the best techniques to tackle diseases, such as acute respiratory infections, which is the main cause of death for children under the age of five."
"The EU must learn from the best practice techniques available within the European Union to tackle health disorders, such as asthma, childhood allergies and neuro-development disorders."
"We should recall that it was the European Union that took the initiative recently to ban the use of particular chemicals in the manufacture of plastic tiles."
"On a separate matter, the European Commission has already stated that the reduction in the use of tobacco products will be a key political objective of this European Commission."
"Great strides have already been taken from an Irish perspective and this is a model which could be used in other Member States of the Union."
"The bottom line is this: if we are to improve the public health of the people of Europe, we must ensure that adequate budgets are put aside to deal with such problems."
"That is why I fully support the recommendation in this report that at least EUR 300 million be put aside under the 7th Research Framework Programme (2007-2012) to promote a higher standard of health within the European Union."
"Finally, the European Parliament has extensive powers of codecision to deal with environmental and public health issues."
"I can assure the Commission and the Council presidency that we will use these powers rigorously in the future."
"Madam President, our way of life is having an ever-greater impact on the environment."
"It would be all too easy to paint a black-and-white picture of nightmare scenarios, but we should not forget that we have succeeded in making enormous progress in various fields relating to environmental quality."
"One need only think of the Auto Oil I and II programmes which we used to improve the quality of petrol, in so doing combating the problem of acid rain, or the European legislation that has been used to achieve certain levels of air and water quality."
"In spite of this, however, I do not believe that we can rest on our laurels."
"The figures are alarming; one in six deaths or diseases suffered by children in Europe is attributable to environmental factors, the incidence of allergic respiratory diseases having doubled over the past 20 years, with every seventh child now affected, and nearly 10% of workers being exposed to carcinogenic substances."
"This means that the Action Plan that is currently before us is urgently needed."
"We must ensure that the precautionary principle gains acceptance, not least for budgetary reasons."
"Public health should be regarded as our top priority in any case, but it is also true that poor public health is an excessive burden on our state budgets."
"Although the Commission was right in its decision to prioritise the need to combat four environmentally-related diseases, the approach it has taken leaves much to be desired. No consideration has been given to a large number of recently published studies, and there are no provisions relating to the application of legal instruments, in contrast to the SCALE initiative."
"There is also a lack of measures aimed at informing the public about the causal connection between environmental pollution and health, and no provision has been made for a long-term evaluation that would make it possible to examine whether the measures are helping to reduce environmentally-related health problems in a cost-effective manner."
"Priority should therefore be given to research into the production and use of everyday products that contain allergenic or carcinogenic chemicals."
"Madam President, the risk of dying of cancer is four times greater for women hairdressers than for women in general."
"A third of work-related illnesses are due to the use of chemicals dangerous to people’s health."
"As we write in this report, damage to the nervous system caused by mercury, pesticides and other chemicals has increased markedly in recent decades."
"The work on discovering and phasing out dangerous chemicals is, then, a decisive factor in improving people’s health."
"This fact, although emphasised in this report, must also form the basis for this House’s forthcoming discussions concerning the future chemicals policy, REACH."
"Diseases and ill-health affect different groups in society in different ways."
"Children are very sensitive to environmental influences."
"People on low incomes are affected more often by disease than people on high incomes, and there is a difference between ill health in men and ill health in women."
"The committee has borne these factors in mind, and it has been very important to us Social Democrats to have them included. We have had the report include both the fact that there needs to be more focus upon particularly vulnerable groups and the fact that data must be collected in such a way that more information can be obtained about the ways in which different groups in society are vulnerable and are affected by various forms of environmental pollution."
"For example, we want to see statistics broken down according to gender so that we can discover and combat differences between men and women where health and disease are concerned."
"It is not only our environment that causes illness."
"Lifestyle-related illness also constitutes a great threat today."
"We Social Democrats have therefore chosen to emphasise the need for increased efforts to combat disease caused, especially, by alcohol but also by tobacco, poor diet and lack of exercise."
"Madam President, many thanks are due to Mrs Ries for her hard work on this report."
"Human health, both physical and mental, is directly related to the environment we live in."
"Most disease processes are the result of interactions between our bodies and various environmental factors."
"This is common sense."
"An environment and health action plan should have two main goals: firstly, to identify quickly the main environmental health risk factors and, secondly, to eliminate or minimise their effect on human health as soon as possible."
"This is also common sense."
"The action plan proposed by the Commission is, unfortunately, more planning and less action."
"It is principally concerned with improving information and research relating to environmental pollutants and disease causation, and enhancing environment health communication procedures between Member States."
"It eventually aims to help improve human health."
"Is this common sense?"
"On one hand yes, because information, research and cooperation in environment-health interaction matters are always a good thing, , we do not necessarily need more time- and money-consuming, research-related mechanisms in order to act fast and save lives now."
"We already know which main environment hazards kill people, so it would be common sense to concentrate first on these and try to eliminate them quickly and efficiently."
"An obvious example is smoking."
"We know that both active and passive smoking kills hundreds of thousands of people in Europe every year."
"We also know that the only effective way to reduce the deadly habit of smoking is to drastically increase the price of cigarettes, to ban cigarette advertising completely and to stop our farmers from producing tobacco."
"Is this what we are doing?"
"Not quite!"
"A packet of cigarettes is still relatively cheap in many EU Member States; cigarette advertising, in particular indirect advertising, which is more effective because it acts subconsciously, is still happening and we are still subsidising many of our farmers to grow tobacco."
"This is definitely not common sense."
"In conclusion, I say 'yes' to research and information for combating long-term environment-related diseases we do not know much about, but I urge the Commission to say 'yes' to immediate drastic action to prevent the diseases we already are very familiar with today."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many people are concerned about the impact of the environment on their health, and these are very specific concerns."
"It has now been adequately proven that fertility is decreasing and the number of miscarriages is rising as a result of environmental influences."
"It is becoming increasingly clear that people suffer from allergies."
"The number of children suffering from asthma and having to go through life with inhalers is on the up."
"The influence of tobacco smoke on the health of non-smokers has become abundantly clear to us all."
"The action plan thus fits into the scale approach which focuses on five key concepts: science, children, awareness, legal instruments and evaluation."
"I have to say, though, Commissioner, that when the action programme was presented, there was a great deal of disappointment and scepticism."
"Allow me to mention three points."
"Firstly, there is the significant gap between the ambitions in the general strategy and the action plan itself."
"Secondly, the action plan is not really an action plan, but rather a research plan, and one that will probably fail to actually reduce the disease burden that is caused by environmental pollution."
"As various Members have told the House, Commissioner, we do not need more research or studies; what we really do need, though, is action."
"Thirdly, there are no concrete financial proposals from the Commission as to how all this is to be funded."
"Without funding, you cannot get the show on the road; that, Commissioner, is impossible and not feasible, that much we know."
"This leads to much scepticism, much concern, although fortunately there is satisfaction about Mrs Ries’ report and the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I should like to focus on two more points that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to introduce by way of two amendments; we would like to emphasise that no targets have been proposed for the proposed actions, and that, out of the 13 actions, only three pertain to specific measures to reduce the disease burden."
"Secondly, we would like to emphasise that there is no system of biomonitoring in place with a link to environmental medicine."
"I urge you, Commissioner, to take Parliament’s remarks into consideration and would be grateful if you turned your action plan into a real action plan that does credit to its name."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was high time that account was taken of the direct impact which environmental factors may have on man. This is something that we oncologists know about and, unfortunately, frequently come up against."
"Environmental pollution plays a huge part in the development of cancer, a disease which will attack one in three Europeans during their lifetime."
"Allow me to give you a prediction, Commissioner: at the rate at which cardiology, both interventional and surgical, is progressing today, do not be surprised if, in a few years' time, cancer becomes the primary cause of death in the Member States of the European Union."
"However, the prevention of cancer and other diseases is necessary and clearly more economical than their further treatment."
"I would like to emphasise here that smoking, against which Commissioner Kyprianou is campaigning, is the basic but not the only environmental factor which plays a huge part in the development of cancer."
"Unfortunately, the Commission confines itself in the REACH plan to pronouncements alone, while it delays the definition of legislative measures and special headings for their application with the excuse that more research is needed."
"As Mrs Ries also said, the plan is an evaluation plan rather than an action plan."
"There are numerous valid scientific studies on substances which are harmful to the environment and human health, which makes us wonder what interests the Commission is protecting: the interests of the European citizen or of the big industries?"
"There is an urgent need for certain specific dangerous substances referred to in the report to be withdrawn from the European market, especially as safer alternatives are available."
"In this case, among other things, the supposed lack of information should not be put forward as an excuse for the lack of action."
"Similarly, it is absolutely necessary for resources to be found both for research, which naturally needs to be intensified, and for the prevention of diseases with an environmental cause."
"Nowhere does the plan propose taking recourse to the precautionary principle."
"Nor does it stipulate where the money will come from."
"In addition, resources are needed for informing the public and professionals, with a view to cleaning up workplaces and indoor and outdoor spaces frequented by children from active and passive smoking, which the report provides for, as well as from other factors."
"I should like to emphasise here the vulnerable position of low-income social groups which, because of their economic and social position, are exposed to a disproportionate degree to environmental risks, such as workers in unhealthy professions."
"I close with the hope that both the European Commission and the European Council will take serious account of the report by Mrs Ries, whom I congratulate on her work."
"Madam President, if we are ill, health is our most desired object."
"If we are well, it is hopefully one of our most valued."
"In Ireland we have a saying that illustrates the priority we give to health."
"If someone fails an exam or dents his car bumper or something like that, we put the calamity in perspective by saying 'at least we have our health'."
"I want to congratulate Mrs Ries: she has not minced her words."
"The health of people, especially of children, is being put at risk in our countries in Europe and the health action plan in its present form is not equipped truly to protect us."
"Mrs Ries has also strongly continued the important process of naming and shaming toxic chemicals and seeking their eradication."
"I would like to support her in this and, if anything, express the hope that we can soon add to the list more chemicals such as antimony, dioxins, and fluorosilic acid."
"I would like to mention that the last toxic chemical, fluorosilic acid, which is used to fluoridate water supplies in my country, has the invidious effect of making other toxic substances, such as lead, mercury and aluminium, exponentially more dangerous."
"It is a chemical usher that leeches these other poisons into the water and then transfers them to body tissue and bone."
"I am glad that mercury, which is probably the most neurotoxic pollutant of them all, comes under scrutiny in Mrs Ries' report."
"I would also extend the awareness of the dangers of mercury to include the fact that it is used as a convenient industrial preservative that needs to be replaced."
"I am also especially concerned that the action plan should be improved to include truly efficient and responsive health monitoring systems."
"Another saying we have at home is 'at least no one died', but this is no longer true: people are dying."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a proverb in my part of the world to the effect that the healthy have one hundred wishes, whereas the sick have only one – to become healthy."
"There is a great deal of wisdom in this proverb, and we must therefore support every effort made to maintain the health of society and the individuals within it."
"Yet without wishing to disparage the Commission’s efforts, this Action Plan is an investigation – and not only that, but an investigation for which the latest findings could unfortunately not be used – rather than an effective, detailed and far-reaching measure aimed at rectifying a situation that has been recognised as a problem."
"Unlike many of the previous speakers, my aim is not to see the glass as half empty; I should like to see it as half full, and to congratulate you on your efforts."
"At the same time, however, I should like to encourage you to do more and to be more courageous in the conclusions you draw. By way of an illustration of the precautionary principle, I should like to cite the following example."
"The Italian Government recently banned smoking in virtually all indoor spaces in Italy, and a wave of indignation swept through the country; yet there can be no doubt that the ban has had a positive impact."
"If the EUR 1 billion spent today on growing tobacco were, gradually and in due course, to be reallocated to health, a courageous step could be taken towards improving it."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"When the European Parliament through the report of Frédérique Ries sets out specific measures for implementing the programme of the common environmental and health policy for the period 2004-2010, we may be aware that these are areas in which the European Union is becoming a world leader."
"After all this is not just a free trade zone, it is also a political, economic and even social project."
"The fight against social exclusion is one of its key elements."
"Following enlargement, environmental and health policies have acquired new frameworks."
"The European Union of 25 members is registering an increase in regional and social differences, something that is directly reflected in people’s quality of health."
"Counter to expectations, 55 million people are living in poverty."
"The most vulnerable groups are older people living alone, single mothers and the unemployed."
"The profiles of these groups, which are at risk as a result of exclusion and therefore also in terms of health, clearly illustrate how societies have developed, how production methods have changed and how economies work."
"The new Member States are not a homogeneous whole, but certain indicators are similar, since they are the result of similar conditions in the transition period."
"There is an especially large gulf between the old and new Member States regarding the extent of funds invested in health care."
"I trust that by means of the common strategy it will gradually be possible to reverse the negative trends we are seeing at present."
"Like the environment, the health of the population is an interdepartmental issue."
"Less development means less health."
"Timely investments in health reduce the costs to the economy as a whole."
"– Madam President, this plan proposes to implement actions through existing initiatives and programmes to which resources have already been allocated under the operational budgets of the services concerned, in particular the Public Health Programme and the Sixth Framework Programme for Research."
"Forgive me for being sceptical."
"It is inevitable that new initiatives will be required to move the action plan forward."
"I would stress the importance of identifying gaps in knowledge and ensuring that any initiatives necessary to fill such gaps are well thought out and capable of delivering the required outcomes."
"These must be based on EU risk evaluation procedures and the opinions of relevant scientific committees, which also allow for peer review."
"The integrity of the legislation we adopt in this House continually and increasingly depends on scientific rigour, and I have increasing concerns about that."
"All impact assessments must be attributable to their authors."
"They should not be merely the result of in-house navel gazing."
"The authors' names must be on every impact assessment, so that we know where they come from and whether we believe vested interests are involved."
"In our Member States there is a need for much-improved coordination between public bodies carrying out activities related to food monitoring, drinking water monitoring, air quality monitoring, and so on. In relation to health impact assessment, it seems to be internationally accepted that the methodology is evolving rather than settled, and that there is considerable difficulty in establishing and collecting the statistical data needed scientifically to underpin health impact assessments."
"We cannot protect people from themselves, nor should we legislate for all life's risks."
"We have to be frank about this."
"I would like to see a definition of public health."
"We continue to use that term across a swathe of legislation; it means different things in different countries."
"The Commission is talking about the health of the European public, not delivering public health services."
"In conclusion, I would like the Commission to ban mass medication of the public water supply."
"From an ethical point of view, it can no longer be accepted by the EU institutions."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking you all for your constructive remarks in both the report and during the debate today."
"The contribution of the European Parliament is very important."
"Through the close cooperation between Parliament and the Commission we will be able to provide the European Union with an effective and efficient way of addressing the possible consequences on human health of environmental concerns."
"I wish to comment briefly on your observations and try to answer your questions."
"The gradual setting-up of an integrated environment and health information system, in which human bio-monitoring will play an essential role, is the added value of the Action Plan."
"It is a long-term and ambitious plan, but this will not prevent us from taking action."
"Indeed, many actions have already been taken on the major environment and health issues."
"Just to give you some examples, I wish to draw your attention to clean water and sanitation, which are dealt with through the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Drinking Water Directive and the Bathing Water Directive."
"Respiratory diseases will be tackled even more through CAFE the Clean Air for Europe programme."
"Diseases related to chemical and physical stresses are already addressed through the legislation on pesticides and biocides."
"The new chemicals policy REACH will be an essential cornerstone in this area."
"We need to bear in mind how far we have come and ensure that we build on existing efforts rather than duplicate them."
"There is already a great deal of legislative action forthcoming which will have an impact on the protection of human health."
"This relates in particular to the thematic strategies of REACH and CAFE."
"We must continue with our efforts before coming up with additional elements and it is for this reason that the environment and health strategy focuses on preparing the next generation of environmental legislation."
"The environment and health strategy contained a specific focus on children and during the stakeholder consultation process to prepare the Action Plan, experts highlighted that concern."
"Firstly, that parental exposure should be included to cover the unborn child and, secondly, that we should look at adults in order to cover diseases caused by childhood exposure."
"For these reasons the Action Plan has widened the focus to include adults as well, taking into consideration the various categories of vulnerability."
"The precautionary principle is at the core of environment policy and it will continue to be the cornerstone of our action."
"It will be applied according to the conditions set out in the relevant legislation."
"The Commission fully agrees with this line."
"I want to be extremely clear to avoid any possible misunderstanding. The Commission will not use this lack of information in the field of environment and health as an excuse for inaction."
"Regarding the financial plan, we very much welcome Parliament's support in its role as budgetary authority for the funding to implement the Action Plan."
"We are constrained by the existing budgetary initiatives until 2006 and we will make the best use of all available funds."
"We are currently making the case within the Commission for a very substantial increase in the amount of research funding devoted to environment and health."
"Parliament's request for funding of EUR 300 million for 2007-2010 provides us with extremely useful political support."
"However, the Member States must also play a role."
"A European Union version of the United States' National Children's Study, which the Parliament has requested, would cost about EUR 100 million per year."
"This amounts to a massive increase of our current environment and health funding."
"We hope to provide as much support as possible at European Union level, but major commitment must also come from the Member States."
"The Commission greatly values Parliament's cooperation and its constructive efforts in this area."
"In order to make the most of this the Commission will regularly inform the relevant parliamentary committee on the progress made in implementing the Action Plan."
"Finally, I would like to underline that by 2007 we will have made significant progress in establishing the information system and we hope to have the first results of the effectiveness of cost efficiency measures to address health problems."
"At this point we will report back to Parliament in substantive terms on whether existing policies are working and what new policy initiatives will be required."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday."
"The next item is the report (A6-0016/2005) by Mr Grosch, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on driving licences."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 21 October 2003, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on driving licences, which you will debate in a moment."
"There are currently more than 110 different models of driving licences, some granting different rights, that are valid and in circulation in the Member States."
"In an open area in which freedom of movement of citizens is the rule, the consequences of this situation are clear."
"It is difficult to carry out checks on the licences, the public authorities have problems making sense of them, and citizens often have problems with their driving licences not being recognised."
"This situation is no longer acceptable."
"The directive proposed by the Commission has three main objectives: protecting against fraud, freedom of movement and road safety."
"In terms of protection against fraud, the Commission proposes eliminating the paper model."
"From the date of application of the directive, the only Community model that can be used will be the plastic card."
"This will also help to reduce the number of models in circulation."
"The Member States will be able to insert a microchip into the driving licence that will, of course, only contain the information on the plastic card and will not be able to be used for other purposes."
"This will help to increase protection against fraud."
"The Commission also proposes introducing a period of validity for the licence that is limited in time."
"This administrative period of validity, which will be ten years for car and motorcycle licences, will mean that each time it is renewed, the fraud protection elements can be updated and that a recent photo can appear on the document."
"This is the real way to avoid a similar situation to the one we have now."
"The introduction of the limited period of validity will enable us to remove the final obstacle to free movement in this area."
"Citizens who settle in another Member State will therefore no longer be faced with validity periods that vary from one Member State to another."
"This is the element that, along with the harmonisation of the licence model, will enable us to remove obstacles to free movement."
"The Commission’s proposal also aims to improve road safety."
"For this purpose, the Commission proposes introducing a new category of driving licence for mopeds."
"Moped drivers are the youngest people on the road driving motor vehicles."
"They are also particularly vulnerable, as all the statistics show, as they have a proportionally much higher involvement in accidents than other road users."
"The Commission also proposes regulating access to driving the most powerful motorbikes on a progressive basis, doing the same for HGVs and the most powerful coaches, harmonising the frequency of medical examinations for professional drivers and introducing minimum requirements for initial qualification and continuous training for driving licence examiners."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, here is an ambitious proposal for improving road safety, ensuring freedom of movement and combating driving licence fraud."
"It will have a clear impact on many citizens for whom a driving licence is a guarantee of mobility and freedom of movement and an identification document for everyday life."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking all those involved – not only the Commission and Parliament’s administration, but also my fellow Members. Over the past few months, work on the directive on driving licences has been marked by a desire to achieve coherence and to engage in extensive dialogue."
"The reason for this is that the varying opinions that have emerged on this issue have resulted from differences in outlook between the individual countries, rather than from party politics."
"This is why, Commissioner, I wish to thank the Commission for its clear advice, as well as everyone who has worked very hard on this subject."
"While seeking consensus and coherence, we also considered it important that this whole instrument should be of public benefit, affecting as it does, after all, almost two thirds of the adult population of Europe."
"This is precisely why we chose to go a little further: instead of 111 driving licences plus a European model, the proposal tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism envisages a reduction to one single European driving licence within a reasonable time frame of about ten or twenty years."
"This naturally has a certain symbolic value, but it also offers the advantage of simplifying roadside checks; simplified checks, of course, are consistent with the fight against crime and fraud – and we are all familiar with the problem of licence tourism in Europe; the Internet is full of pages devoted to it, which is why this is a matter for the Member States too."
"The point is that, if we have a single driving licence and can therefore simplify and centralise data in the Member States, and if the latter are also willing to cooperate in exchanging these data, this will surely go some way towards curbing fraud and improving mobility in Europe."
"The public also gain added value from legal certainty."
"Far from wishing to encroach upon acquired rights, we seek to reinforce them."
"We also want to ensure that those who drive for a living do not lose their rights when they move home, for example, as we have seen from some of the complaints lodged with the Commission."
"The proposal would also benefit people who travel from one country to another as tourists and who would like their rights to be recognised wherever they go."
"We have also opted to refrain from any age discrimination and have therefore left it up to the Member States to introduce medical or other purely preventive tests as they see fit. I firmly believe, however, that the rules already established in several countries will spread to others."
"Another benefit is increased road safety; in this respect, the draft directive follows the Commission line in its reliance on basic training."
"Basic training is the fundamental element, but it does not interfere in any way with systems of advanced training."
"In this respect we have sought consistency with the Directive on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers, be it for bus drivers or for HGV drivers."
"Another example is our solution to the problem of campers and caravans, which lies in appropriate training rather than the introduction of a complex B+E licence; in this way, we take due account of tourism, which plays an important part, as we all know, in the development of the European economy."
"A step-up approach with regard to motorcyclists is also a feature of the underlying philosophy, and in your introduction, Mr Vice-President, you referred to the universally recognised fact that more efforts can and must be made in this direction."
"There are still more than 40 000 deaths on our roads, and while the number of deaths in car accidents is falling, the same cannot be said, regrettably, for motorcycle accidents, which continue to claim an alarmingly high number of lives."
"This is why we have adopted the step-up approach, but we do not intend to base this on theory tests."
"We have opted for training, and accordingly we intend to enable those Member States which prefer to set a younger minimum age to guarantee legal certainty in this respect for their citizens, but their systems would have to be graduated as prescribed in the draft directive."
"We do not wish to challenge the traditions of a number of countries in this domain, traditions rooted in factors such as mobility requirements and economic conditions, but we do wish to pursue a general strategy based on a European average age and a system of progressive training."
"There are equivalence problems, and these will not go away."
"What we have done is to launch an initial attempt to cover three- and four-wheeled vehicles too, but we are also aware that the inherent problems cannot be resolved overnight."
"For my own part, I still believe that it would be ill-advised to cover cars and motorcycles with the same licence, because they require two very different sets of driving skills, even though it might be a means of improving mutual understanding between motorists and motorcyclists."
"To sum up, then: simplification, legal certainty, road safety and the suppression of fraud are the main elements we sought to emphasise in our proposal."
"Finally, let me reiterate my thanks to all my fellow Members for their great goodwill and cooperation over the past few months."
"Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, on his excellent report on the Commission’s proposal for a third Directive on driving licences."
"He has presented detailed proposals for improvements relating to the future introduction of a uniform European driving licence and, most importantly, has drawn up people-friendly provisions, such as those dealing with caravans and campers."
"He has also tabled clear proposals for improvements in the realm of so-called driving-licence tourism."
"The cause of road safety is not served by allowing someone whose licence has been revoked with good reason to obtain a new one immediately in a neighbouring country."
"In this respect, Mr Grosch has made an excellent job of fleshing out the principle of eliminating licence tourism."
"There are, however, two points in the report which my group rejects."
"Like the Commission, Mr Vice-President, we oppose the compulsory exchange of existing driving licences."
"Road safety is not improved in any way by making people go to a public authority, have a new photograph taken and be issued with a new licence document."
"At best, such an arrangement facilitates police checks, but it does nothing to improve road safety."
"If the benefit of simpler police checks is compared with the trouble and inconvenience to which drivers would be put – tens of thousands of them, if not more, who will never drive in another EU country would still be required to obtain a new licence – the inconvenience outweighs any benefits, and my group joins the Commission in opposing such a provision."
"The second point we reject in the report relates to the compulsory limitation of the validity of licence documents."
"This does nothing to enhance road safety either."
"It only means that people have to go to the authorities, have a new photograph taken and be issued with a new licence document, even though, as the rapporteur rightly recognises, the authorisation resulting from the original driving test remains valid."
"I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to help us by supporting our position for the sake of the people of Europe."
"We do not want the compulsory exchange of driving licences, and we do not want any limitation of their validity."
"Madam President, Commissioner, firstly, I wish to thank Mr Grosch for his excellent cooperation and his very constructive method of working on the process of producing the committee’s proposal."
"All the political groups participated, and we are grateful for their having done so."
"It is a matter, in this case, of shuttling between traditions and differences in the various Member States, but without losing sight of the objective, namely that of increasing people’s mobility in the EU and promoting road safety."
"It is now a question of embarking upon the long road towards a driving licence for the whole of the EU."
"This will take many years, but it is important for old driving licences to be replaced."
"The reason for this is the need to put a stop to driving licence tourism whereby driving licences are lost and new ones bought."
"We now have 110 varieties of licence, and the police cannot check whether a driving licence that might be confiscated, or one that they see, is genuine."
"In Sweden, a situation existed a few years ago in which you could go into a back-street printer’s and buy a driving licence from your old country of origin and then go to the relevant Swedish authority and exchange the licence for a Swedish one."
"That is unacceptable, and we cannot have such a situation."
"I therefore think that the Council of Ministers needs to approve the replacement of old driving licences."
"It will take 60 years before we have an acceptable situation if we have to comply with the proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"That is not to be tolerated."
"Change is vitally important for us as fellow road users, for we too are out and about on the roads and we want to know that the driving licences that exist are genuine."
"Where doctors or pilots are concerned, we should never accept a situation in which we did not know whether their papers and knowledge were genuine."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the greater part of the committee’s proposal."
"We do not think that endless doctors’ examinations of healthy drivers, as proposed by the Commission, are a good idea."
"Europe’s doctors must be used to treat people who are ill and for work in the health sphere, not for checking up on every driver."
"It is of course self-evident that doctors’ examinations and sight tests should be required when driving licences are issued."
"Where mopeds and motorcycles are concerned, we in the PSE Group wish to encourage training and tests in a situation where drivers begin with mopeds and then advance through the classes of driving licence."
"We also want the Member States to be able to introduce rules concerning people’s having direct access, within those Member States, to heavy motorcycles when they reach the age of 21."
"National exemptions are accepted for cars and mopeds, and we therefore believe that this should also be the case for motorcycles."
"Where caravans and motorised campers are concerned, we share Mr Grosch’s position."
"Finally, the development we anticipate is one in which more and more cars are equipped with safety devices such as alcohol locks and reminders to drivers to fasten their seat belts and switch their lights on."
"This is encouraged by the European Commission and by safety organisations."
"We must, therefore, also help produce a basic document entitling people to drive vehicles: a driving licence that is genuine, reliable and up-to-date."
"."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I have to congratulate the rapporteur, whose task was incredibly difficult and who was dealing with something that affects nearly all citizens but was at the same time very technical, with many details and large differences between Member States."
"His task was made all the more difficult because, although everyone may accept the principles and agree that the system should be simplified and better monitored and such like, no one is actually prepared to give up national differences."
"We use each other’s roads more and more, which means that we must trust each other to a greater extent in the documents we issue to drivers, but the issuing of those documents is still considered a kind of strategic, almost military secret within every Member State, where the seals must therefore be closely guarded."
"I think, Mr Grosch, that this must make your assignment all the more difficult, and it has not made our job any easier either."
"My group agrees on the evident need for the introduction of a European model, and we believe that this should be done as quickly as possible, with regular administrative updates."
"We are, however, opposed to the introduction of additional tests."
"They are administrative updates, after all, and it would not be fair on the elderly."
"Besides, the statistics do not bear out the need for them."
"There is no evidence anywhere to suggest that the elderly are particularly unsafe drivers."
"Moreover, we should not make it more difficult for them to drive cars, which are, for very many older people, simply a lifeline."
"The same must apply to those in poor health."
"Ideally, the decision to drive a car or not should be a joint decision taken by a patient and his GP, with the GP judging in good conscience whether or not that person is still able to drive a car, and the patient should respect that decision."
"I think that the principle we need to adhere to is not to draft European rules that are too detailed, to impose general principles as is the case in your report and take the decision as close to the citizen as possible."
"The Committee of European Experts can continue and do their work by all means, but I think that the work should ideally be done as closely to the public as possible."
"Our group has tabled a few amendments to bring driving licences for mopeds and motorcycles into line with the tradition in the Member States and not to be too restrictive in this. We support the general thrust of Mr Grosch’s report, which we see, at any rate, as a major step forward."
"We are moving towards better scope for control within the European Union."
"In time, we will explain to the citizens that they have licences allowing them to drive a car or motorcycle, or such like, across the entire Union. In the Union, we will be able to rely on the tests set in the different Member States."
"Therefore, we have certainty that anyone who is given such a licence is a good driver of a moped, a motorcycle, a car or a lorry."
"I think that the public will come to realise that the European Union also serves very concrete purposes."
"I think that your report is a step in the right direction, and for that I should like to thank you."
"Madam President, I should firstly like to thank Mr Grosch for a really constructive piece of work and to congratulate him on this."
"We have listened to each other, and I think we are now in a situation in which it is also apparent that arguments have played a helpful role."
"I think that some sterling work has been done, and I also think it splendid that Mr Grosch has shifted attention away from some rather abstract fight against terrorism, or whatever it was to begin with, to the issue of road safety and of the real terror we have in Europe whereby the number of people killed and maimed on our roads is equivalent to the number of casualties that would occur if one jumbo jet per week were to crash, killing everyone on board."
"It is really important that we get something done about this, and a prior condition – or one of the prior conditions – for getting something done is, of course, that we have driving licences that can be checked up on and that are recognised throughout Europe."
"I think it excellent that we have not subjected our elderly people to more tests."
"It is good that, in this House too, we recognised that most of them are, of course, outstanding motorists who compensate for their reduced reaction times by driving carefully."
"If only fit and healthy people would put careful driving before over-confidence."
"There was one point we found it very difficult to understand."
"There are countries – and I do not believe that the whole of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fall into this camp – that apparently attach inordinate value to their driving licences."
"I think they should take a much more relaxed attitude to their old driving licences instead of cherishing them as if they were things that cannot be exchanged. In that way, we should obtain a driving licence we can use in the rest of Europe."
"There is no sign of driving licences being exchanged."
"We tried it in Denmark, and it worked."
"The world did not come to an end."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his work, which I believe will continue to pay dividends for a long time to come."
"At the same time, however, there is another point I should like to make."
"This House frequently favours unnecessary regulations and a surplus of details, thus making issues that are simple and obvious needlessly complex."
"One of the reasons for this may well be that the European Parliament is an EU institution."
"Many European countries, including my country, Poland, already issue perfectly good driving licences equipped with a great many security features, and paper driving licences are in any case being gradually replaced."
"Training for learner drivers is also constantly improving, and countries are learning a great deal from each other."
"This is why I am concerned to hear that many citizens in EU Member States will have to undergo the ordeal of exchanging their driving licence yet again."
"In my opinion the inclusion of microchips and the frequent exchange of driving licences as proposed by Mr Grosch entails unnecessary expense."
"It would also be a waste of time for the citizens, who would prefer to do anything else rather than stand in a queue waiting for a licence to be issued."
"Finally, I should like to point out that, in my view, official restrictions that determine whether foreigners may apply for and be issued with driving licences are incompatible with the principle of the free movement of persons."
"A distinction should be made between those who have committed an offence in their own country and are attempting to acquire a new driving licence in another country, and those who live in border regions and prefer to choose a better and cheaper driving school on the other side of the border."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to begin my speech by thanking Mr Grosch for his fine leadership of this project under difficult circumstances."
"As a representative of a new Member State, this situation with driving licences actually came as a big surprise to me since in Latvia, my country, we started issuing plastic licences of the size of a credit card two years after regaining independence."
"Speaking personally, ten years of using my first plastic licence have already expired, and I replaced it last year with a new one displaying the European Union symbol."
"Because of this it is relatively difficult for me to understand why the representatives of some states find it politically impossible to say that paper licences should be replaced with plastic licences."
"If Latvia was able to do this then in my view other states can do it too."
"And if we have a common internal market and free movement of the labour force, it is difficult to understand why we cannot adopt a unified system for obtaining driving licences, health requirements and similar matters, since any European Union driver may cause problematic traffic situations in any other European Union state."
"It also seems to me that on the issue of microchips and their use, both the Commission and Parliament could have been stricter and could have retained an obligation to introduce them in the foreseeable future."
"I very much hope that tomorrow we will vote in favour of this commendable draft directive at first reading."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating in plenary an issue on which much time has been spent by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, whom I thank for his diligent and timely report, with which I am largely, although not wholly, in agreement."
"Mr Sterckx stated that we all agreed with the aim of having a single EU format, although some differences undoubtedly exist."
"He was referring, in particular, to administrative renewal of licences for the elderly."
"In my view, this is an area which, in general, requires greater attention."
"By way of example: I fly a totally harmless machine, one which does not even have an engine."
"I believe that in the event of an accident, the only victim would be myself and, at most, one other person."
"Despite that, I am required, in Italy, to take out compulsory insurance, undergo a medical examination every two years and submit to a raft of administrative and other requirements which, frankly, appear excessive when compared to the level of danger to society represented by a motor vehicle which, in the event of an accident, can cause carnage."
"Accordingly, we have to be very careful."
"The issue is, therefore, to harmonise an area with significant consequences on the lives of citizens and with obvious social implications for motorists’ behaviour."
"Thus, we need to harmonise not only a document – it is not just a question of switching from a paper licence to a plastic one – but also people’s performance at the wheel."
"To this end, we need to ensure that police are able to identify with certainty a driver who may be infringing the Highway Code."
"I should also like to mention particularly the amendments submitted jointly with some fellow Members concerning the introduction of the AM licence for mopeds."
"I believe we should be grateful to users of 2-wheeled means of transport because, particularly in countries in southern Europe, they contribute to resolving serious traffic problems, help our environment and improve the quality of life in towns and cities, particularly those with an older, more traditional urban fabric."
"All dangerous behaviour must be punished and prevented, and there is no shortage of ways of achieving this."
"However, penalising two-wheeled traffic, which this directive does in part, will, in my view, damage not only our economies but also the quality of life in general."
"– I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Grosch on his report and by saying that my main concern in this debate on the future adoption of a European driving licence is that a good idea should not be spoiled by excessive regulation leading to more obligations and obstacles for drivers in the EU."
"The idea is a good one."
"Given that European citizens are enjoying increasing freedom of movement, it is necessary to harmonise basic rules intended to foster safety on the roads, to prevent fraud due to the improper use of false licences and to prevent drivers who have been penalised in one country from easily obtaining a new licence in another."
"Presented in this way, this is a simple message, which will be easily understood by those it is intended for and will be heeded by the public without any difficulty."
"The problem arises when a good idea, an obviously welcome political initiative, is undermined by the temptation to regulate. What we must avoid, when it comes to beneficial measures such as this one, is an increase in regulatory and bureaucratic constraints and in financial costs for EU drivers, when such steps are always debatable."
"Otherwise, the subsidiarity principle – and respect for practices that have been legitimately established by the authorities in the Member States – will not be duly taken into account. This would then result, in one way or another, in obstacles – sometimes imperceptible ones – being in the way of all European citizens seeking to enjoy their right to drive, regardless of all of the statements to the contrary that we shall all no doubt make."
"These were the underlying reasons why I supported a range of amendments to the report before us, all of which were drawn up with the aim of making life easier for the public and for the various road sector operators and, at the same time, with the aim of promoting safer road transport."
"I shall conclude by saying that the most significant of the four European freedoms is freedom of movement."
"Madam President, I am pleased that you are chairing this sitting, because I know that you are a very careful and safe driver and that you are greatly interested in the whole question of road safety."
"It is a regrettable fact that skulduggery, cheating and forgery take place in the EU in connection with driving licences."
"These activities are made easier by the 110 different licence models that are currently in use in the European Union, and let us be honest: we need look no further for an example than Germany, where many drivers still have the collector’s item we call the grey rag; some of these have even paid the occasional visit to a washing machine."
"The limp grey card with its youthful photograph may be a cherished memento in the eyes of its owner, but it is certainly an inadequate form of identification for roadside checks."
"As you know, I started my working life as a police officer; what is a poor policeman in Palermo, Bordeaux or Madrid to do when he stops a vehicle and is shown a tatty piece of scrap paper that is no longer of any use to anyone?"
"If we expect young people to be issued with a plastic-card driving licence today, it is absolutely reasonable to expect other people to exchange their droopy old paper documents within the lengthy transition period that the rapporteur’s very sound proposal prescribes."
"Let me say to Mr Jarzembowski that to call this compulsory exchange in German is a very emotive thing to do, for the term is associated with the dictatorial regime in the German Democratic Republic, which compelled visitors entering the country to exchange deutschmarks for East German currency."
"We have to mind our terminology when we discuss European rules; a little care will keep the communication process on an objective level."
"As I said, the rapporteur has presented a very good proposal, and for that I thank him."
"My final point has already been mentioned. We must put an end once and for all to driving-licence tourism."
"If a person has his or her licence withdrawn in Germany today and does not pass the subsequent medical and psychological test, known colloquially in Germany as the idiots’ test, that person can go to the Czech Republic or elsewhere and obtain a new driving licence at little cost by pulling a residence trick."
"This situation cannot go on indefinitely here in Europe."
"We want to put an end to it with this directive, which is why I hope that, in tomorrow’s vote, Mr Grosch will be given a large majority, including the backing of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have already welcomed the Commission’s initiative and Mr Grosch’s report aiming at harmonising the rules regarding driving licences, and I welcome them again."
"We agree on the objectives of preventing licence fraud and above all of implementing a measure that will facilitate free movement for the citizens of the Union and contribute to improved road safety."
"Nowadays, it is very easy for Europeans to move around and to share Europe’s roads."
"It is no longer acceptable to conceive of Europeans who have been granted their driving licences under different rules, having fulfilled very different requirements, driving on the same roads."
"This is a classic case where the principle of subsidiarity is substantially inapplicable."
"I am referring in particular to the roads in my country, Italy, throughout the summer."
"We cannot have rules that are applied in different ways just because they apply to different individuals and contexts."
"The Europe of motorists and of road haulage is today one of the most successfully integrated aspects of Europe, and it requires harmonised, if not uniform measures."
"In relation to road safety and the target that the Union has set itself of halving the number of road accident deaths by 2010, if the driving licence issuing and renewal system were to contribute even just minimally to improving people’s driving knowledge and skills and to keeping a check on drivers’ mental and physical conditions, if it were even to make the tiniest contribution to improving road safety in Europe, it would definitely be welcome."
"It is for that reason – and certainly not for love of pointless red tape – that we should emphasise and support the idea of making the new licences subject to regular renewal and calling for existing ones to be gradually replaced as well; it is for that reason that we should agree on the idea of combining compulsory training with equally compulsory testing to ensure that driving skills are acquired and maintained; and it is for that reason that we should agree on the idea of making the issuing and renewal of licences subject to checks that potential drivers meet minimum standards of mental and physical health."
"While common sense demands that we should be moving towards uniform rules in all such areas, one area where differences could possibly be allowed on the basis of subsidiarity might be motorcycle licences, which are issued in varying numbers in the various countries of the Union."
"In that respect, I believe it should be noted that in some countries people are allowed access to small motorcycles at a younger age than in others."
"That factor helps to improve people’s mobility in historic city centres and may favour the development of a system of progressive access to increasingly powerful motorcycles, which is one of the most valuable aspects of the directive in question."
"That is why I think that we could also let category B licences be equivalent to category AM licences, so that car drivers could always ride motorcycles as well in major historic city centres."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me also begin my speech by thanking Mr Grosch once again, in particular for the well-balanced nature of his proposals with regard to the prescribed amount of regulation, because this provided a platform from which we were able to reach a very broad consensus on many points."
"I find it hard, on the other hand, to understand the attitude of the conservatives or that of Mr Jarzembowski, who wants to burden the changeover to a European driving licence with a transition period of seventy years."
"I ask you! If we were talking about a rule concerning the single market, a transition period in excess of ten years would not be contemplated for a single minute."
"In this matter we are seeing far too many signs of movement towards a rather cheap form of populism."
"There is, however, another point I should like to add. We should bear in mind that basic and advanced training will have to be a central and important objective."
"Madam President, when people have acquired the right to drive a motor vehicle, they should, normally speaking, retain that right for as long as there are no physical or legal objections to them doing so."
"I do not think that this House is in any doubt about that."
"What we do question is the form in which the citizens are faced with this, more specifically, the standards for acquiring and retaining that right in the form of driving licences."
"In addition, driving licences often function as a form of identification, which means that verification aspects are important."
"I take the view that we should be very careful about establishing someone’s identity, certainly in the case of unknown people."
"The improper use of ID does not always prove conducive to a sustainable society."
"That is why it is vital that ID cards should be up-to-date, both visually and technologically speaking."
"In my view, driving ability can considerably contribute to reducing the number of road victims."
"Since reduction starts with prevention, it is of vital importance for drivers, both physically and mentally, to be able to take part in traffic effectively."
"It is quite acceptable for this to be subjected to requirements, for all drivers."
"These requirements should guarantee the holders’ capability."
"Mr Grosch’ report puts my mind at ease on that score, and for that I am grateful."
"Madam President, if the Germans have a problem with their driving licences, what is to stop the German Government from sorting it out?"
"Equally, if we are talking about road safety, what is to stop the Portuguese and Italian Governments from improving road safety on their roads?"
"We in the UK have some of the most crowded and some of the safest roads anywhere in western Europe."
"Yet we are now faced with the prospect of harmonising driving licences, and this report makes clear that harmonising penalties for driving offences cannot be far behind."
"When you look at the disgraceful treatment of legitimate tourists in Greece on a plane-spotting holiday, we now know just what pan-European Union justice can mean!"
"That affected only a few unfortunate individuals, but almost everyone in Britain drives a car."
"If national courts are given powers to impose penalties on drivers' licences issued in other countries, the prospect of a Greek court banning, or attempting to ban, a British driver from driving in Britain will cause a row the like of which even you have not yet experienced from Britain!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we have to hold Question Time now."
"I must therefore adjourn the debate at this point."
"It will be resumed this evening at 9.00 p.m."
"The next item is questions to the Commission (B6-0009/2005)."
"We shall take a number of questions to the Commission."
"The services covered by the Commission's proposal for a directive on the harmonisation of services in the internal market include construction, technical and architectural services, and audiovisual services which are not covered by the multiannual Community audiovisual programme."
"Given the importance of the country of origin in cases where cross-border services are provided without the provider being established in the Member State where the service is performed, and the directive's objective of establishing an open internal market and enforcing the principle of non-discrimination, can technical, architectural and construction companies provide services or take part in public works contracts in the country of establishment when they might also participate as shareholders in companies providing audiovisual services in the country of origin, which is not a reason for excluding them from providing services in the private sector?"
". I wish to say at the outset that this is really a question on public procurement and not on the Services Directive."
"The first point to note is that, as regards the participation in procedures for the award of public works contracts, it is not contrary to Community law that technical, architectural or construction companies holding shares in other companies which provide audiovisual services in one Member State, including the Member States of establishment, participate in such procedures in any of the Member States, including the one in which they are established."
"Under Community public procurement law, there is an exhaustive list of criteria to exclude companies from public procurement contracts."
"Examples of these are when a company is being wound up, when its managers have been involved in proven misconduct, or when tax or social security obligations have not been fulfilled."
"Member States may not add criteria to this list."
"As regards the proposed directive on services, the Commission can confirm that all these services fall within its scope."
"It is the case that certain Member States impose restrictions on multi-disciplinary activities that may restrict either the freedom of establishment or the cross-border provision of services."
"In order to deal with these kinds of potential barriers, Article 30 of the proposal stipulates that Member States shall ensure that providers are not made subject to requirements which oblige them to exercise a given activity exclusively, or in a manner which restricts the exercise of different activities either jointly or in partnership."
"However, exceptions are made for regulated professions and providers of certification, accreditation, technical monitoring, and test or trial services."
"For activities where multidisciplinary activities are authorised, Member States shall ensure that conflicts of interest and incompatibilities between certain activities are prevented, that independence and impartiality – when required – are secured, and that rules on professional ethics and conduct for different activities are compatible."
"These requirements will be subject to mutual evaluation by the Member States and the Commission."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the clear answer he has given to the question which I raised and to add that the restrictions imposed under Greek legislation on the basis of the basic shareholder will not only hit construction companies, as stated in my question; all economic service sectors, wherever they move and are proposed, will be affected by the Services Directive on the part of the Commission, such as food, advertising companies, the tourist industry, architectural firms, private individuals and companies."
"I therefore consider that the adjustment needs to be made in this direction."
"Thank you very much."
". I thank the honourable Member for her addition."
"What is in the Services Directive does not change in any way the problem to which the honourable Member has alluded, and the Commission is indeed aware of the relevant legal framework in Greece."
"The Commission is in contact with the authorities there and is currently examining the whole situation."
"On the EU internal market, there is unequal treatment of Polish companies and workers, who encounter unjustified barriers in carrying out their activities."
"Does the Commission know of examples of discrimination or of regulations which contravene the treaties (the Treaty of Accession, Annex XII, Freedom of movement for persons, paragraph 13, and in particular the transitional regulations on the freedom of movement of persons) found in the national laws of the EU Member States of Austria, the Netherlands and Italy, which allow such practices, or is it aware of any breaches by Germany of Article 49, first paragraph, of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 1 of Directive 96/71/EC(1) relating to the posting of temporary workers through temporary employment agencies?"
"What steps has the Commission taken or does it intend to take to address these?"
". As far as the freedom to provide services is concerned, the Commission has been made aware of problems encountered by companies from the new Member States who post their workers to the Netherlands."
"A number of complaints have been received."
"The Commission is presently looking into the matter to ensure that the freedom to provide services as provided for under Article 49 of the Treaty is respected and any unjustified obstacles are removed."
"The Commission is not aware of instances in which Polish firms operating in Italy, Germany or other Member States may have been discriminated against."
"No such complaints have been lodged with the Commission."
"However, the Commission is in the process of writing to the relevant Member States to request further information to establish whether breaches of EU rules may have taken place."
"In light of the information provided, the Commission will assess the situation in each Member State and decide upon the appropriate steps."
"( Many thanks, Mr President, thank you, Commissioner."
"I should like to inform the Commissioner that according to the reports to which Poland has access, which include government reports, three EU Member States still have in place legislation that makes no allowance for enlargement of the EU that took place on 1 May 2004."
"Under this legislation, rules that were in force before that date continue to be applied to entrepreneurs from the new Member States."
"At the same time, seven other Member States employ practices that do not comply with principles such as the free movement of persons and services and the freedom of establishment on the common EU market for companies from the new Member States, including Poland."
"I would be more than happy to provide the Commissioner with relevant examples. I thank you."
". EU citizens and businesses must have confidence in the EU's legal framework if they are to maintain a positive view of the Community."
"The free movement provisions of the Treaty are fundamental to the EU and are amongst the major benefits of EU membership."
"Accordingly, the Commission places the highest priority on maintaining the integrity of the internal market and carefully investigates all complaints in exactly the same way, irrespective of where they come from or which Member State they concern."
"The Commission is aware of the fact that some Member States have adopted national measures that do not conform with the transitional provisions relating to the free movement of workers under the Accession Treaty."
"The Commission is looking into these matters and will contact the Member States concerned in accordance with its role as guardian of the Treaties."
"In the light of the question from our Polish colleague, I would like to ask Commissioner McCreevy whether he would agree with me that this is exactly the sort of problem that will be fully addressed by the proposal for a directive on the internal market for services."
"Perhaps he could take the opportunity to confirm something I read in an independent report this week: this directive will apparently reduce prices, raise output across the European Union, create 600 000 new jobs and increase the trade in services."
"Will the Commissioner therefore finally confirm his unequivocal support for this directive and his willingness to work with us in Parliament for its speedy and smooth transition?"
". It is undoubtedly correct that any impulsion that could be given to the area of services in the EU would have a major economic impact."
"As Members are aware, approximately 70% of the Union's GDP comes from services."
"Therefore, any way of giving a major boost to this particular area would have a major impact in terms of jobs."
"The Services Directive is an attempt to open up this particular area and to achieve that major economic impact."
"I am aware of the various studies carried out on the number of jobs that could be created."
"However, as the Member is also very much aware, the draft services directive has provoked a considerable amount of discussion within Member States and in all areas throughout the EU."
"As the Member is further aware, I am working with MEPs and I hope we can ensure that, when the Services Directive passes through its various processes, it will have a very positive economic impact, having taken on board the legitimate concerns of parliamentarians and others."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the gist of my question is whether the Directive on the posting of workers actually applies to temp agencies which send clients on job placements or whether there is a danger here that sham contracts or contracts designed to circumvent obligations might be used in the future."
". The position that was agreed when the accession countries were joining must be adhered to."
"If some Member States are invoking other procedures which do not conform with the accession provisions, then the Commission will follow these up and action will be taken."
"It is true that some Member States negotiated special provisions and if they are operating in accordance with those, there will be no difficulties but if others are not, action has to be taken."
"PET (plastic) bottles are made from 'preforms'."
"In the European Union, a general import duty rate of 6.5% applies to such preforms."
"The EU grants certain countries, such as Ukraine, a preferential rate of 0% if a certificate of origin (Form A) can be produced for the preforms."
"In the case of Ukraine, the form means that the preforms have been made from material originating in Ukraine or at least elsewhere in Europe."
"I have established that preforms are currently being imported into the European Union from Ukraine under cover of Form A (certificate of origin) at implausibly low prices, bearing in mind current European commodity prices."
"This must therefore involve dumping and/or fraud in the completion of the certificates of origin (material from Asia being used) in order to evade import duty, to the detriment of other suppliers."
"Is the Commission aware of this?"
"Will it investigate the matter and take the necessary action?"
"Will it raise the matter with the Ukraine authorities and, if appropriate, refer it to OLAF?"
". The information in the question could refer to at least three different possible problems, each of which has to be addressed differently."
"If there is circumvention via Ukraine of anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures imposed in a number of third countries – such as Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and several others – then Community producers should lodge a request to initiate anti-circumvention investigations in line with the relevant provisions of the basic anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations."
"If the product is of Ukrainian origin and is imported into the Community market at dumped prices thus causing injury to Community producers, the latter are encouraged to lodge a request for the initiation of a new anti-dumping investigation in line with the relevant provisions of the basic anti-dumping regulations."
"The Commission's trade defence services are at the disposal of producers to explain the relevant requirements and procedures for anti-dumping measures to be exposed."
"If it is a case of the falsification of certificates of origin, the customs authorities and the EU anti-fraud service – OLAF – should be called upon to act."
"OLAF's responsibility to protect the financial interests of the European Community include the investigation of irregularities and illegal trade in the framework of existing Community legislation."
"That would include any irregularities identified in the Community's anti-dumping and anti-subsidy legislation."
"I want to add that no investigations are ongoing in this field for the time being and OLAF does not have any records on this situation."
"However, OLAF has good working relations with the Ukrainian customs authorities."
"In conclusion, I should like to reiterate that the Commission is grateful for the information provided by the honourable Member and it will examine any relevant information provided by European industry."
"On the basis of that information, it will take appropriate action."
"Thank you, Mr President and thank you, Commissioner, for the very extensive response."
"Since submitting this question, I have indeed received confirmation from various quarters that this is fairly systematic practice to such an extent that European manufacturers of PET bottles suffer huge losses as a result."
"It does therefore seem important to me that the Commission should ask OLAF to launch an inquiry."
"I can, moreover, inform the Commissioner that the European manufacturers, in line with procedures, have submitted a request to review anti-dumping legislation."
"My question is therefore very specific, Commissioner."
"Are you, given the seriousness of the situation and the implications this may have for our industry, prepared to follow this up promptly?"
"As the honourable Member knows, that comes under Commissioner Mandelson's portfolio, so I cannot give a detailed answer to the supplementary question."
"However, I can promise that I will duly inform my colleague and, if he thinks it appropriate, then he will certainly start an investigation into the matter."
"As the author is not present, Question 44 will not be taken."
"What measures does the Commission intend to take to promote the further development of the trans-European high-speed rail link from Paris via Strasbourg to Munich and Budapest?"
". I would like to respond in the following way to this first question regarding the implementation of the trans-European high-speed rail link."
"I would like to answer Mr Posselt as follows."
"The Paris-Strasbourg-Munich-Budapest trans-European rail link is one of the thirty priority projects of the trans-European network decided upon by the European Parliament and the Council on 29 April 2004."
"In fact, it is priority project no 4 (Eastern high-speed rail link) and no 17 (Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Brastislava rail link)."
"Some of the common interest projects on this line are at an advanced stage of preparation or implementation, in particular the Eastern high-speed train between Vaires and Baudrecourt, and the improvement of the Danube rail link between Salzburg and Vienna."
"Others, however, in particular the cross-border sections between Member States (France and Germany, Germany and Austria) are experiencing considerable delays, particularly for financial reasons."
"Mr President, in order to better coordinate the efforts of the different national and regional, public and private partners involved in this project, the Commission intends to appoint a European coordinator."
"I dare to hope that I myself will be able to propose the nomination of this coordinator to the Commission very soon."
"For some years the Commission has already been making significant contributions to the funding of these projects."
"EUR 315 million have been allocated to the project on the trans-European link in Germany and Austria, under the budget heading for trans-European transport networks, an additional EUR 66 million are planned for 2005 and 2006 and, for the 2007-2013 period, the Commission has proposed raising the budget for the trans-European transport network to EUR 20 million."
"Obviously, Mr President, the adoption of this proposal at budget level is the very minimum requirement in order to be able to speed up a project such as the trans-European rail link."
"I fervently hope that the financial perspectives as proposed by the Commission will be approved by our Member States."
"Mr President, let me begin by saying that I am glad the Commissioner has answered the question so explicitly and intends to have a coordinator appointed."
"This, I believe, is important, because this major link, which could subsequently be extended to Prague and other cities, would otherwise remain a mere pipe dream."
"In my opinion, we must press for the speedy implementation of this project."
"I also have two very specific supplementary questions for the Commissioner."
"Firstly, what is the present position regarding the plans for the Rhine bridge between Strasbourg and Kehl? As we all know, this is a single-track bridge, and its upgrading is a matter of the utmost priority – a small but crucial part of the project."
"Secondly, what can you tell us about the transverse axis from Brussels to Strasbourg via Luxembourg which is also under discussion?"
". I thank the honourable Member for the relevance of his questions."
"When the guidelines were reviewed in April 2004, the sections of the Eastern part of the main line between Stuttgart, Munich, Salzburg, Vienna, Bratislava and Budapest were added, which were the Baudrecourt, Strasbourg and Stuttgart sections and the Kehl bridge over the Rhine, priority project no 17."
"The work between Baudrecourt and Strasbourg should start around 2010."
"The Kehl bridge, which, as you pointed out, is planned between Strasbourg and Appenweier, is a major bottleneck, so the planning priorities for Germany and France were previously different."
"According to a joint declaration from the German and French Governments, it appears that at present plans could be made so that the project will be finished by 2010."
"I hope that this major priority can be achieved in order to link the two Member States of France and Germany, and therefore many other Member States."
"The whole of Europe has an interest in this project, including, of course, Strasbourg."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you, Commissioner, whether you think that border crossings between Member States might be eligible for special support, and is there actually a need for this line to be constructed definitively as a high-speed link?"
". Certainly according to the financial resources that the Union receives, we will make interconnections a priority."
"I am not ruling out a much more favourable subsidy rate for this type of operation."
"Commissioner, you mentioned the rail link from Paris to Budapest via Berlin, Bratislava and Prague."
"Are there plans for a similar rail link to eastern and northern Europe, from Paris via Berlin to Warsaw or a more distant location?"
". Of course the whole point of trans-European projects is that they are corridors."
"It is quite obvious that the reason why I wish to propose to the Commission that a coordinator be nominated is precisely in order to see how all the sections involved will be gradually dealt with along the corridor."
"Is there any evidence that drivers from left-hand-drive countries are more likely than residents to be involved in road accidents in right-hand-driving countries and similarly right-hand-drivers in left-hand-driving countries?"
"Are European road accidents increased in number and severity because some countries drive on the right and others on the left?"
". In answer to Mr John Purvis, I would first like to say that we do of course pay a great deal of attention to these problems of road accidents and that all of these problems, as we saw earlier when looking at the report on driving licences, are very important."
"Having said that, neither the Commission, nor the Member State that is most affected, the United Kingdom, have statistics to directly prove a risk associated with driving on the left or the right."
"In general, the number of accidents involving continental drivers in the United Kingdom and vice-versa is too low for us to draw statistical lessons from it or draw any conclusions."
"This is my answer to Mr Purvis"
"Mr Commissioner, you may not have the statistics but I certainly see in my newspapers in my constituency of Scotland all too often that our tourist guests are killed and injured on our roads in Scotland, and most particularly on roads that convert regularly from two-lane to four-lane and back to two-lane."
"Could not the Commissioner institute the gathering of statistics on this to see whether something should be done about it – possibly to encourage the Member State concerned to ensure that as many as possible of our main trunk routes are four-lane – for example, the Perth-to-Inverness trunk route?"
"I should also like to know whether there is any plan to consider harmonising the side of the road on which we are to drive in Europe."
". I have no hesitation in saying to Mr Purvis that this is a matter of subsidiarity, and it is really up to the Member State to see whether there need to be improvements to infrastructures."
"What I would like to say to Mr Purvis is that we have no intention of harmonising the side of the road on which we drive in the European Union, given the exorbitant cost and the major foreseeable increase in the number of accidents during the transitional phase."
"However, making improvements as you have suggested makes sense, and I think that the Member State in question should make the effort to respond to that."
"Anything that provides additional information on the causes of accidents in Europe will in any case be welcomed by the Commission, which has set itself the task of proposing any measures that will help to halve the number of people killed on the road."
"Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to come back to the Commissioner’s answer to the last question from Mr Purvis."
"We all know that every death on the roads is one death too many."
"Particularly because I come from a Member State where subsidiarity is writ large, I believe that, with regard to the uniform provisions that we need to govern road traffic, speed limits and the like, the question we really have to ask the Commission is this: are any discussions or studies being conducted with a view to assessing what action it would actually be wise to take?"
"Mrs Schierhuber, we have a deadline. In other words, 2005 is the half-way point in the programme of ten years that the Union set itself to halve the number of deaths."
"Obviously this is going to be the year of general evaluation."
"At the moment we are in the process of collecting all the data, so that in the second phase we can step up our measures in order to achieve this ambitious but essential objective of halving the number of deaths on the Union’s roads."
"Thank you for sharing this concern, which everyone should be aware of."
"In its proposal for a directive on port services (COM(2004)0654/final), the Commission provides its clearest definition to date of the term and application of 'self-handling'."
"Despite this, major organisations, such as the European Transport Workers' Federation and the European Sea Ports Organisation, are concerned about the likelihood of social unrest in ports, the discouragement of potential investors and the ensuing decline in competitiveness."
"What is the Commission's response to the concerns of the trade unions and how does it intend to ensure that workers already registered with trade unions will not suffer any discrimination, resulting ultimately in a reduction in their employment prospects and income?"
"Furthermore, how does the Commission respond to the charge by the above trade union organisations that the 'self-handling' provision is incompatible with ILO Convention 137 on cargo handling in docks?"
". Mr President, I would like to say in response to Mr Papadimoulis that, with regard to the directive on port services, the text proposed by the Commission defines the expression ‘self-handling’ and its application in a more detailed way than had been previously done."
"But the debate has scarcely begun on this proposal for a directive on port services."
"The hearing planned in June in the Committee on Transport and Tourism will be the perfect opportunity to look in more detail at the fundamental elements, including the social aspects, and to hear the opinions of all the parties involved."
"In the proposal, self-handling is subject to authorisation, the criteria for which cover salary and working conditions."
"The aim of introducing an authorisation is to ensure, among other things, that self-handling suppliers comply with the salary and working conditions that apply in a port."
"Consequently, the Commission does not think that its proposal, and in particular the clauses on self-handling, will have negative consequences for the employment and income of people already employed in the port sector."
"Moreover, the Commission considers that the application of the principles and rules listed in its proposal for a directive will result in a transfer of the volume of additional traffic towards maritime transport, which will inevitably create excess business and will result in jobs being created in European ports."
"When it presented its proposal for a directive, the Commission invited the Member States to ratify the conventions adopted under the aegis of international organisations, and in particular the relevant conventions of the International Labour Office, including the ILO Convention on cargo handling in docks that you refer to in your question."
"I hope that at the hearing in June, your examination of the proposal will be fruitful and that we will arrive at a balanced text that will enable us to revitalise the sector while, of course, preserving the working conditions which are personally very important to me."
"– Allow me to insist, Commissioner."
"I am here, opposite you."
"Apart from the reactions of the trades union, in December 2004, when the Commission presented its proposal to the Council, several Member States voiced negative criticism."
"Of them, France, Germany, England, Sweden and Belgium criticised the Commission for failing to hold adequate consultations on the matter, for failing to investigate the consequences of application."
"Taking account of the negative prehistory, when the Commission tabled a proposal which was thrown out by the European Parliament, do you intend to re-examine the content of the proposal or do you propose to proceed despite the reactions?"
"Mr Papadimoulis, the proposal was rejected at the end of the legislative process when work had already been done."
"In view of that, the Commission did not completely rewrite the text, but it wanted to take account of the worries and concerns expressed during the discussions."
"I believe the Commission was right to take its time and give itself the opportunity to hear all the parties. I shall see to it personally that this debate is carried through with great care."
"In view of the forthcoming accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the upgrading of relations between the Balkan countries and the EU to higher levels of cooperation (Stabilisation and Association Agreements, Pre-Accession Strategy) the question arises whether there are any plans to unify the Southeast Europe economic area, mainly from the point of view of road and railway infrastructures."
"What specific initiatives has the Commission already taken, or does it intend to take in future, to establish vertical and horizontal crossborder (international) links and corresponding infrastructures to facilitate crossborder trade between Greece, the candidate countries and the other States of Southeast Europe which have their sights firmly fixed on Europe?"
"I would like to say in answer to Mr Papastamkos that, during the accession negotiations and in agreement with the countries concerned, the Commission identified the future Trans-European networks, both road and rail, of Romania and Bulgaria, where the main connections will be with Greece."
"In April 2004, the European Parliament and the Council decided on priority projects for Trans-European networks."
"There are two projects that will help to connect Greece with its northern neighbours and with Central Europe: the Athens-Sofia-Budapest motorway and the main Athens-Sofia-Budapest-Vienna-Prague-Nuremberg railway line."
"On 11 June 2004, the western Balkan countries and the Commission signed a protocol of agreement to promote the region’s strategic networks as previously identified in a Commission report in 2001."
"The Commission is therefore also actively involved in what the countries concerned are doing to develop the pan-European transport corridors, four of them in particular."
"Corridors 4, 8, 9 and 10 involve Greece and its links with the countries of Southwest Europe."
"Recently, on my suggestion, Mr Papastamkos, the Commission set up a high-level group chaired by the former Commission Vice-President, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, which will by the end of 2005 identify the priority routes or projects connecting the enlarged European Union with its neighbours to the east and south."
"Greece’s links with its western Balkan neighbours are also being examined in this context."
"In the last few years, the Commission has allocated large amounts of money to road and rail projects relating to Greece’s main links with its northern neighbours from the Trans-European networks budget, the structural financial instruments or the Phare and Cards programmes."
"The Commission also intends increasing its efforts in the 2007-2013 financial perspectives with all the details I gave just now and do not want to repeat."
"It is up to the countries concerned to take the initiative of preparing and proposing projects that could be supported financially by Community funds and European Investment Bank loans."
"– Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his detailed reply."
"My interest arises from the fact that the economic area in the region continues to be fragmented and isolated and its regional and European integration continues to be hampered."
"My supplementary question is this: does the Commission really intend to place greater emphasis on those transport networks which, on the one hand, promote the unification of southern Europe and, on the other hand, by connecting them with the trans-European networks, help the interconnection of these countries – the countries of Southeast Europe – with the European Union and the integration of the economic area as a whole."
"Mr Papastamkos, it is true that it is a priority."
"We have enlarged Europe and with the imminent prospects of enlargement with Romania and Bulgaria, the neighbourhood policy is beginning to take shape."
"I therefore think that in this new context we shall have to give priority to those corridors and transport routes to which you have drawn our attention."
"I would also like to say that I am expecting much from Mrs Loyola de Palacio’s report; she is obviously putting a lot of thought into it and I am sure she will be consulting all the Member States."
"The liberalisation of Spain’s railways, in accordance with European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/51/EC(2), entered into force on 1 January 2005."
"Opening the railways up to competition is very important in order to attain the Lisbon objectives and to guarantee competitiveness in Europe."
"However, certain measures can sometimes serve to hinder the process of full liberalisation."
"For example, this can happen as a result of a lack of harmonisation with regard to safety certificates."
"What steps does the Commission intend to take to ensure that all the practical effects of liberalisation are addressed and to prevent certain Member States from setting up internal mechanisms that could hinder liberalisation?"
"Mr Guardans Cambó, the Commission is ensuring that the Member States implement the in the area of rail transport."
"By now, the Member States should have transposed the directives relating to the ‘railway infrastructure package’ and the directives on railway interoperability."
"So far as the opening up of the rail freight market is concerned, the Member States ought to have transposed the ‘infrastructure package’ directives, in particular Directive 2001/12, by 15 March 2003."
"The Commission brought infringement proceedings for non-communication of transposition measures, or at least some of them, against Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece and Luxembourg."
"The Court of Justice found against those countries in October-November 2004."
"Infringement proceedings for incomplete or incorrect transposition have been brought against the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain."
"The Commission will continue to ensure that the Member States fully comply with their obligations to transpose Community law."
"It will do that in particular for the directive to which you refer, which must be transposed by 31 December 2005."
"The Commission is following the actual implementation of the new regulatory framework for railway infrastructure access very closely through a working group made up of the Member States and market participants’ representatives, who are invited to exchange their analyses and experience of the development of the competitive market with the Commission."
"There are also other bodies whose task is to observe and evaluate non-discriminatory access to the market, such as the regulatory and consultative committee set up by Directive 2001/12 on the development of the Community’s railways, which I have already mentioned, and a large number of working groups, such as the railway regulators’ working group or those of the authorities that issue railway licences and safety certificates."
"May I say to you, Mr Guardans Cambó, that I for my part believe this is a very important question because it is essential that we have a strong rail transport industry if we are to avoid Europe always having to use road transport; that would be harmful both to the environment and, by creating bottlenecks, to the European mobility we need if Europe is to be competitive; it would also be detrimental to the comfort of its citizens."
"Mr President, as you have said, a lot of hopes have been placed in this liberalisation of rail transport."
"As you know, however, as happened in their day for goods, it is the case that safety certificates in particular – to give you an example involving a country you perhaps know better than others – prevent genuine liberalisation."
"It is what, in goods transport, are called measures of equivalent effect, restrictions having an effect equivalent to genuine restrictions."
"I would therefore like the Commission to check not just that liberalisation as such has been implemented, as a principle, but also to ensure that there are no concrete obstacles to its actually being put into effect on the ground."
"Mr Guardans Cambó, I can tell you that I fully share your concern."
"We must see to it that there are indeed no more or less hidden barriers to this opening up of the rail market."
"You mention safety certificates in particular."
"There is clearly a need for an independent authority that is able to issue safety certificates on a completely objective basis."
"You also refer to a number of Member States which I know well."
"Let me assure you that I ask just as much of them, and you will see that presently."
"Different provisions exist across the EU for the use of headlights during the daytime, and in some Member States daytime running lights are mandatory on all roads, Sweden for example."
"The experience from these countries illustrates the great safety benefits these provisions deliver."
"Studies have found up to 24% reduction in daytime road fatalities due to mandatory daytime running lights(3)."
"I understand the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council wishes to oversee progress on a directive on daytime running lights and has therefore requested the Commission to adopt a proposal that has been in preparation."
"However, suggestions have been made that the Commission would prefer to delay adopting this proposal until publication of the mid-term review of the third road safety programme due in June."
"Can the Commission confirm that it is preparing such a proposal and that it will adopt it with the utmost urgency rather than awaiting completion of another dossier?"
"Waiting a further six months, when mandatory daytime running lights are known to be very effective in saving lives and have a low cost, and the Council Presidency wants progress, would not be fulfilling the Commission’s own approach to road safety of accepting a shared responsibility."
"Thank you for also coming to ask me about one of the important questions which will, I hope, enable us to improve road safety in Europe."
"The Commission confirms that it is looking into the feasibility of an initiative to introduce daytime use of dipped headlights on all motor vehicles."
"As you point out, this measure appears in several national highway codes and has in any case been recommended in other Member States."
"If the examination proves positive, the Commission intends submitting its proposal after the publication of the mid-term review of the European road safety programme I mentioned just now and which is expected in the second half of this year."
"We shall see how to respond to this suggestion."
"In the meantime, the Commission will continue its consultations with the circles concerned, in particular the motor industry."
"We need, for example, to look at the possibility of introducing, for new vehicles, special lights that would be switched on automatically when moving off."
"These new lights will use less power than dipped headlights, because one of the objections made to us is about the energy used by having them on during the day."
"When we come to update the road safety programme, we will try to answer this question in the light of all the experience and of all the lessons drawn from that experience."
"Thank you very much for your answer, which I found encouraging."
"We must make use of every option for promoting road safety: all the various existing options and those which are becoming available in the different Member States."
"There is naturally concern about having to wait for a review and about not being able to take initiatives."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he thinks that the Commission will present more than one proposal for a directive following the mid-term review, because that possibility was in actual fact mentioned in the road safety programme we have now."
"Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I do not intend to delay the taking of decisions."
"I believe the technical documents will be available in the next few months and then of course the Commission will have to shoulder its responsibilities and make proposals."
"I would like to thank you in advance for your support because this is an area where, as you know, some Member States will always have reasons for rejecting certain measures even though we know they will cut the number of road deaths in Europe."
"Could I ask the Commissioner if he would circulate the research that has been done to show that cars running with daytime lights significantly reduces road accidents."
"Can I also ask his view in relation to this being an issue best applied by Member States?"
"If the Commissioner is interested in the issue of safety there are many areas in which the Commission could involve itself – for example, I note that in France, taxi drivers do not have to wear seatbelts but once they cross into Germany, they do."
"Is this not a matter best left to Member States?"
"There are already Member States where the use of dipped headlights is compulsory: the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Hungary and Sweden."
"France introduced them as a recommendation during the winter of 2004/2005."
"We will be able to begin talks with the motor industry to get new vehicles fitted with devices that automatically switch dipped headlights on as soon as the engine is started."
"Then we will see how to introduce the use of dipped headlights during the day on all motor vehicles."
"As you pointed out following Mrs Hedkvist’s question, a recent study has shown that using dipped headlights during the day will help to reduce the number of road accidents appreciably: by between 5 and 15%."
"There was also a problem with motorcycle drivers, but I think all these problems are being resolved."
"That is what I can say with things as they are at present."
"I am asking Parliament to be a little patient so that we can really prepare this package of additional measures for improved safety on Europe’s roads."
"The Commission’s work programme refers to the ‘Commission Communication on the rights of users in the transport sector’ 2004/TREN/052."
"To what extent is the Commission willing to include in this Communication, and explicitly support, the right to safety for passengers and goods using road infrastructure, by making it compulsory for maintenance work to take into account the needs of users and ensuring better designed road access and protection from the dangers of the road network in the Member States?"
"First, let me go back a bit: the Commission is making the study on dipped headlights available to you."
"I did not have the information, but the study is available to you."
"Now I will answer Mrs Vincenzi’s question. As set out in its White Paper, in its Communication of 16 February on strengthening the rights of passengers, the Commission promised that in 2005 it would look at the best way of improving and guaranteeing passengers’ rights in the different modes of transport."
"This Communication approaches the question of passengers’ rights in the road sector from the point of view of international coach services."
"So far as road safety is concerned, Mr President, and we have already spoken about it at some length, the 2001 White Paper proposed cutting the number of casualties by half by the year 2010."
"In the countries of the present Union, the Union of 25 Member States, 50 000 people were killed in 2001; there must be no more than 25 000 in 2010."
"The European Parliament and the Council have adopted this ambitious target."
"In 2003, the Commission adopted an action plan concerning the vehicle, user behaviour and the road infrastructure: three aspects."
"As I said, and I want to stress this, we will have to make new legislative proposals, one of which will be concerned in particular with road infrastructure audits and inspections."
"I would nevertheless like to add, for Parliament’s information, that motorists’ behaviour will also have to be taken into account, and we shall have to see what we can do to bring some harmonisation to the rules in force throughout the Union in this field as well."
"– Thank you, Commissioner."
"I would, however, ask you to be more explicit about the interpretation of Article 16 of the EC Treaty, from which it seems to me that one can infer that users have a right to mobility and hence to having minimum safety standards drawn up in the field of services."
"I ask you, therefore, whether we can begin to class motorways, or at least toll motorways, as a service in the public interest."
"The reason would be, in part, to prevent the legitimate call for safety – which has resulted in the Charter of Passengers’ Rights being drawn up for the airline sector and also in future for the railways – from making such carriers less competitive in comparison with the motorways."
"I believe that putting all those involved on a level playing field and increasing safety for everyone should be an explicit objective."
"What we must do is draw up rules for the road that will apply along the length of the major routes, rather as we have done for air and rail transport."
"So far as possible, we are in fact going to demand that the same rules be applied for Trans-European networks."
"As you know, we are touching here on problems that come under the third package of Justice and Home Affairs measures."
"It is the whole problem of sanctions; it is the whole problem of controls and offences."
"Clearly, all this now needs to be harmonised; it will no doubt be rather difficult to achieve, but it is necessary. In any case, so far as Trans-European networks are concerned, we are very definite that we want this improvement."
"We are thinking of presenting a proposal for a directive on greater security and safety in Trans-European transport networks before the end of 2005."
"Could the Commission explain the lengthy delay in tabling the ‘Regulation on the rights of passengers with reduced mobility when travelling by air’, which was originally scheduled for submission in the first quarter of 2004?"
"Will the Commission undertake to defend a final version of the Regulation which does not contain an opt-out clause for airlines?"
". I would like to thank Mr Howitt for his question."
"Thank you Mr Howitt, because this gives me the opportunity to reiterate how important the Commission believes it is for persons with reduced mobility to be able to count on being treated fairly by being guaranteed appropriate assistance so that they can travel throughout the European Union with confidence."
"Only three months after taking office as Commission Vice-President responsible for transport, I submitted to the College a regulation which gives real and tangible rights to persons with reduced mobility travelling by plane."
"It seeks to ensure them fair treatment by preventing carriers or tour operators from refusing to carry them because of their reduced mobility except for justified safety reasons."
"The proposed regulation therefore asks airport managers to provide the necessary assistance at airports free of charge and asks carriers to make the necessary assistance available on board aircraft, also free of charge."
"The regulation would apply to cases of departure, arrival or transit in airports located in Member States."
"It goes without saying, Mr Howitt, that I am very much counting on Parliament’s support and I am confident that, with the Council, you will work on this dossier diligently so that it can be adopted quickly."
"The contacts I have had with disabled persons’ organisations have enabled me to gauge the hope to which this regulation, which is the start of a policy of non-discrimination towards the disabled, gives rise."
"I can tell you that I will continue to treat this as an essential concern, since I am convinced that guaranteeing accessibility and mobility for all is for us a European ideal."
"That is the reply I wanted to give you, Mr Howitt."
"You are right, there has undoubtedly been some delay, but today we are hard at work and we must now press on resolutely."
"Commissioner, you can count on my support, and, I hope, that of Parliament."
"We criticise the Commission when we need to, but you have put forward an excellent regulation and I hope it will be passed swiftly."
"I hope you will be pleased to hear that one low-cost operator, Easyjet, which serves Luton airport in my constituency, has said that prices need not go up because of this draft regulation."
"That comment removes some of the scare stories about the regulation."
"Could the Commissioner answer one question which was put to me: why, if this is right for air travel, should it not apply to other modes of transport?"
"In its communication, the Commission gave an undertaking, in accordance with the White Paper, that during 2005 it would examine the need for legislation to extend the rules on the protection of passengers with reduced mobility to other modes of transport, in particular shipping and international coach transport."
"Having said that, Mr Howitt, you have clearly understood, so far as rail transport is concerned, that the third railway package contains a legislative proposal introducing minimum rules for assistance to persons with reduced mobility."
"I know that Parliament feels strongly about this third railway package and that it does not want the package’s various measures to be broken up."
"I believe this is very important and that the measure concerning persons with reduced mobility will be added to those that came into force on 17 February 2005, that is last Thursday, on denied boarding, cancellation and major delays to a flight."
"All this has shown Europe’s citizens that the Union, its Parliament, its Council and its Commission are also there to make everyone’s daily life easier and to make things safer for everyone."
"In any case, I thank you for having underlined the importance that should be attached to persons with reduced mobility."
"Questions 53 and 54 will be answered in writing."
"The Less-Favoured Areas (LFA) system is an important mechanism providing funding for the regions concerned."
"In the case of Ireland € 230 million is paid out to 100 000 farmers under the regime."
"Given that in the future national handicaps, as opposed to socio-economic criteria, will be used to define LFAs, can the Commission guarantee that the same level of payments will continue to be made to those farmers currently in receipt of LFA funding?"
". One of the main issues in the proposed Council regulation laying down general provisions of support for rural development from the EU rural development fund is the review of intermediate less-favoured areas."
"The Commission proposed a revision of the existing classification based, to a large extent, on socio-economic criteria which change over time."
"It seems that, decades after their designation, some of these areas would not qualify as LFAs due to the evolution of their socio-economic features."
"This was the reason for the critical observations made both by the Court of Auditors in its special report on Less-Favoured Areas, and by the European Parliament."
"Our own evaluation studies also confirmed these observations."
"The Commission cannot ignore these observations and this explains its proposal."
"From the new period onwards, LFAs should be addressed on the basis of objective natural criteria which do not change over time, thereby corresponding to a permanent handicap, such as low soil productivity or poor climate conditions."
"As a result of the application of the new criteria, areas may no longer qualify for LFA status and farmers located in these areas may no longer be eligible for the intermediate LFA payment."
"The level of compensation is a distinct issue from the delimitation of a Less-Favoured Area."
"Support is granted per hectare and should compensate farmers for the additional costs incurred and income foregone due to the handicap to agricultural production in the areas concerned."
"In its proposal for the next programming period, the Commission will introduce a distinction between mountain areas and other Less-Favoured Areas with regard to the maximum compensation payable."
"Since mountain areas are affected by the most severe handicaps, the Commission proposes setting the maximum amount to EUR 250 per hectare, while the maximum amount for other categories is set at EUR 150 per hectare."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your very direct and clear answer."
"There will probably be no winners, but there will certainly be losers."
"Could you outline when people will know whether their area will receive less, or more, funding under the reclassification?"
". We are now working on the conditions for the new less-favoured areas."
"We will settle upon them very soon – during the first half of March."
"You are right, there will be losers, but I am quite sure there will be winners as well."
"How can the Commissioner justify bringing forward these proposed changes at a time when there has been a major review of the common agricultural policy?"
"In my country, Ireland, where we have just introduced full decoupling from 1 January 2005, Irish farmers feel that they face a very uncertain future as regards their income."
"Furthermore, would she consider postponing decisions until people have had an opportunity to find their feet under the new system?"
". This is part of the ongoing political discussions in the Council and Parliament on the new regulation for rural development policy."
"To take out the discussion on less-favoured areas and keep it for another decision would, in my view, be out of the question."
"However, you will have every opportunity to make your statements during the discussion here in Parliament on the new legislation for the rural development policy."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the Commissioner’s honest answer to Mrs McGuiness’ question."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, continuity of regional development, including the development of mountain areas and less-favoured areas, is in your interests too, because it enables these areas to go on sharing in the general prosperity and social development of the European Union, which is why there must be no abrupt cessation of these compensatory payments in any cases where they are due to expire."
". One of the reasons why this discussion is on the table now is that the Court of Auditors has pointed out the difficulties of maintaining the present situation."
"Things have changed over the last few decades, and those areas that were less-favoured areas 20 or 25 years ago may no longer be fulfilling the same criteria."
"That is why things are going to be changed."
"Article 18 of Regulation (EC) 1257/99(4) provides a definition of mountain areas with a view to their receiving aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) under the heading of support for rural development."
"However, since that definition is not sufficiently comprehensive, calls have been made for many years now for mountain areas to be redefined."
"In September 2002, I was informed that a revision would be carried out."
"Since then, however, nothing has changed."
"Can the Commission indicate when the revision of the definition of mountain areas and mountain forests will be carried out and published?"
". The definition of mountain areas is based exclusively on natural handicaps such as altitude and slopes or a combination of the two."
"Unlike the delineation of other less-favoured areas, the delineation criteria for mountain areas have not been contested in the recent special report of the European Court of Auditors on support for less-favoured areas, which I mentioned in my previous answer."
"Evaluations of rural development programmes show the relevance of support for the less-favoured areas to maintain mountain-farming populations and for the land management in mountain areas, including landscape and environmental protection."
"Under these circumstances, the Commission did not propose to modify the classification criteria for this section of the less-favoured areas."
"In its proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development for the next programming period, the Commission introduces a distinction between mountain areas and other less-favoured areas as regards the maximum amount of compensation."
"Since mountain areas are affected by the most severe handicaps, it is proposed to increase the maximum amount for those areas from EUR 200 to EUR 250 per hectare."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your clear answer and for letting us know that the Commission is introducing this distinction for the next programming period."
"Something else that would interest me is whether it would not make sense – and whether you could not examine this option – to introduce parameters for mountain areas which would define them as areas above a certain altitude and with a certain degree of steepness, in other words to lay down objective criteria that would prevent overlapping and concurrent support."
". I understand your great interest in this very specific area because it is so important to keep rural areas populated."
"I have listened to your proposal."
"For the time being it is not in the recommendation and I think it would be difficult to include it."
"I understand that you would regulate based on the steepness of the mountains."
"I think regulation in this way would be extremely difficult and would encounter many problems in the Court of Auditors, because definition of these mountain areas would be open to interpretation."
"The Commission will be aware that, on 12 January 2005, the closure of one of only two remaining sugar factories in Ireland was announced."
"It is highly likely that this move is the result of the negative scenarios that have been circulating about the future of the sugar industry."
"Does the Commission accept that this closure will have a profound effect on the local economy of the catchment area concerned, and, furthermore, will it clearly state that it will not allow – under any circumstances – the transfer of national sugar quotas under the new regime, since that would, in effect, cause the total destruction of the sugar industry in a Member State, as would be the case in Ireland?"
". The common organisation of markets in the sugar sector fixes sugar production quotas by Community region."
"The authorities of the Member States allocate these quotas to their sugar-producing undertakings."
"It is for each undertaking to decide and organise its production between one or more processing plants according to its own criteria."
"The fact that an undertaking closes one of its factories and concentrates its production in only one processing plant – as is the case in Ireland – does not modify its quota or decrease its total production."
"Irish farmers will therefore be able to continue producing the same quantities of sugar beet as before the closure."
"Concentration and rationalisation of production is a common feature of industrial restructuring and, for sugar, reflects the trend over the last ten years, where the number of factories almost halved within the EU of 15."
"The quota transfer across Member States was presented by the Commission's communication on the sugar reform in July 2004 to increase the competitiveness of the European sugar sector."
"It would allow the more competitive undertakings to acquire the quotas of those undertakings that decide to close after the reform, and thus to adjust to the lower price in the market."
"The inefficient producers would be able to sell the quotas and thereby reap some of the value of the quotas."
"If nobody is interested in buying the quotas in the same Member State or other Member States, the undertaking can apply for conversion aid, which should help to cover the costs of restoring good environmental conditions for the factory site and of redeploying the labour force."
"Discussions in the Council and Parliament show very strong concern on the part of a number of Member States and stakeholders with regard to the possibility of trans-national quota transfer."
"In this connection, the Commission needs to underline that the competitiveness of the European sugar industry has to be increased in order to ensure a sustainable, long-term basis for sugar production within the European Union."
"Transferring quotas between Member States is one way of ensuring this."
"Alternative and complementary solutions are not to be ruled out and are also being analysed."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner."
"Unfortunately, since my last exchange with you, my worst fears have been realised with the closure of one of our two sugar factories in Ireland and the loss of the jobs that the factory provided."
"Can I ask you for one assurance, one guarantee at least, that when your proposals finally come before us, you will not allow the sale of quotas across national borders?"
"It has never been allowed before, and it would certainly mean the end of the Irish sugar industry."
"Secondly, in formulating these proposals, have you also looked at the use of alternative industry or energy, particularly with respect to the use of sugar beet in biofuels/bioenergy?"
"If not, would you give an undertaking to look at it?"
". Concerning the question of the transfer of quotas, at this stage we are discussing a new sugar reform."
"It is, therefore, much too early to start this discussion in Parliament."
"We will have many opportunities later on to discuss in detail the different tools in the sugar proposal."
"It is obviously not possible for me to give you the guarantee that you want today."
"On your other question concerning bio-ethanol, yesterday I decided to form a core group to discuss the possibilities of growing renewable energy crops in European fields."
"It is an interesting area and we need to dig deeper into the substance of the matter to see what the possibilities for them are."
"Thank you for your advice in this important area."
"The EU’s agricultural aid does cause great damage to the world’s poorest countries."
"Sugar is also one of the most crucial export products for many of those same poor countries."
"That is why the recently implemented sugar reform we are now talking about is extremely important, even if I think it should have gone still further."
"I think, in actual fact, that it is quite embarrassing that the EU, which otherwise has free competition as its motto, should go to such lengths to favour its own agriculture."
"I want therefore to ask the Commission what further measures it intends to take to reduce the EU’s agricultural aid and thus make it possible for the world’s poor countries to do something themselves about their at present very difficult situation."
". Thank you for the question."
"The reason why we are now talking about sugar is that we have been making progress and undertaking reforms in many different sectors of agriculture, but sugar has been untouched for the last 40 years."
"Therefore, we must reform the sugar industry."
"We must do so also because we are now granting access to the EU market to the 49 poorest countries in the world through the 'Everything But Arms' Agreement."
"From 2006 to 2009, these countries will have progressive access to the European market at a price higher than the world market price."
"In that way they will have a special chance to escape from poverty."
"This is also an element of our proposal on sugar."
"In general, the suffering of poor people in the Third World is not always eradicated by free trade – sometimes quite the opposite."
"For example, Brazil has huge concerns about the proposals because the poor and landless there will suffer if sugar production expands massively, as is predicted."
"I should like the Commission's view on that."
"Secondly, if greater efficiency is to be achieved by freeing up the movement of the beet quota, what are your intentions for the milk quota?"
". We are now leaving the original question on sugar production in Ireland."
"However, I would like to give you ..."
"Commissioner, let me interrupt you."
"This supplementary question is not on the same topic."
"Just to refer to the Commissioner's response to Mr Aylward's original question with regard to the transferability of sugar quotas."
"The reason we are discussing this now is because the issue is part of a Commission proposal, and not because it is something that Member States were looking for."
"The difficulty and danger is that once you transfer the right and entitlement to a quota, then all production stops and sugar production is amalgamated into big multinational interests, rather than into individual national interests as at present."
"These ensure a solid product growth that allows competition and ensures the diversity of supply and production afterwards."
". I will not enter into a deep technical discussion on the sugar proposal."
"I will just say that I am very much aware of the different opinions on this matter."
"I can assure you that I am listening to all stakeholders at this stage."
"There are different opinions on how far and how fast we are moving with the new sugar proposal."
"However, I am happy to say that all members of the Council, and the Members of the European Parliament, realise that something has to happen with regard to sugar."
"If we sit on our hands and do nothing, we will spoil the opportunity for European sugar production to be competitive in the future, and that is not the way to go."
"It is estimated that forest to a value of a little over € 8 billion has been destroyed in the severe storm which recently swept through northern Europe."
"Employment in the timber, forestry and farming industries is threatened as well as future forestry."
"Forest is crucially important in the EU's strategy for biological diversity, Natura 2000 and in the EU's work to promote renewable energy and reduce the greenhouse effect."
"Work is also currently in progress on drafting a common forestry policy for the Union."
"Will the Commission assist the forestry industry in this difficult situation and ensure that no unnecessary red tape stands in the way of measures to make use, as far as possible, of the trees which have been blown to the ground?"
"Given the forestry industry's great economic, social and environmental importance, what measures will the Commission take in support of that industry in those areas of Sweden affected by the storm?"
"First of all, I want to state that I completely agree with the honourable Member that forestry is of crucial socio-economic and environmental importance in the EU, especially in rural districts."
"The Commission has just completed an analysis of the measures taken as part of the European forestry strategy over the last five years, and we shall shortly present the results of this analysis, both to the European Parliament and to the Council."
"The investigation has been carried out in close cooperation with the relevant interested parties and the Member States, and statements have been collected, for example via an Internet-based forum."
"In my view, the Council Resolution of 15 December on a forestry strategy for the European Union forms a suitable basis for the forestry-related measures and initiatives in the EU."
"With regard to the damage that occurred in connection with the latest storm, which also caused a lot of damage in other northern European countries too, I should like, in this House too, to express my sincere sympathy with those who were affected by this disaster."
"We are ready as quickly as possible to look into what we can do to remedy the consequences."
"Within EU legislation, there are various possible ways of providing aid."
"At the request of a country affected by a disaster, the Community action programme for coordinated civil protection in the event of a disaster can form the basis for both facilitating and coordinating aid for other Member States."
"On 1 February, the Swedish authorities also asked for aid from other Member States in the form of electricity generators for use in the hardest hit parts of the country. It was, in actual fact, possible to comply with the wish within a time frame of less than two days, and both Germany and the Czech Republic in actual fact sent 170 generators to Sweden."
"Aid can also be provided from the EU’s Solidarity Fund, which contributes to the initial emergency measures."
"Aid from the structural funds can be provided within the framework of the current programmes and, if the production potential both of agriculture and of forestry has been damaged, aid can also be provided for re-establishing and introducing preventive measures within the framework of what is possible in terms of rural district policy."
"I can tell you that my department is already in contact with the Swedish authorities and is very sympathetic to the possibility of investigating whether the proposals presented by the Swedish authorities can be implemented in practice."
"If the Swedish authorities wish to request aid from the Solidarity Fund, I would recommend them to approach my colleague, Commissioner Hübner, who deals with this specific area."
"Thank you very much for your detailed answer."
"As you said, a lot has happened since I put that question, and I just want to express my gratitude to the Commission for showing such great understanding and for having been so accommodating towards both Sweden and the Baltic countries, which have been hit hard in the way described."
"I would say a big thank you for taking the action you have described."
"I look forward to receiving the report the Commissioner talked about on the development of our forestries."
"In the meantime, can she give us an assurance that the single farm payments that are going to come about as a result of decoupling, and which we know will have an environmental element, will have a strong tree-planting element as well?"
"Will she ensure that these payments are used to encourage farmers to continue to plant trees – and a variety of trees, not just one species?"
"This does not solve the forestry problem, but it would increase the number of trees across the European Union and bring the environmental benefits to which she has referred."
". I completely agree that it is very important to ensure that the number of hectares covered by forest increases."
"Within the rural development policy, there are different possibilities currently under discussion on sustaining or supporting the possibility of planting new forests."
"It must be said that it is ultimately up to the Member States to decide whether they want to use the different tools and the cofinancing in the rural development policy."
"As the time allocated to Commission Question Time is at an end, Questions 59 to 103 will be answered in writing(5)."
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on driving licences."
"Mr President, I welcome the proposals on driving licences because they represent a huge advance in combating fraud, improving road safety and, most importantly, providing legal certainty for the free movement of people."
"I especially welcome proposals for higher standards for driving examiners."
"I did not like the Commission's original proposals because I thought they were too bureaucratic and too complex."
"They would have done unnecessary damage to certain groups such as caravanners, so I congratulate the rapporteur on producing a simpler and more practical proposal."
"However, we still need to look further into the question of motorcycles, where national practices and problems vary so much in the Member States."
"In the UK, our problem is not so much young motorcyclists, but middle aged men – like me – having a mid-life crisis, buying a very powerful motorcycle and then killing themselves."
"We do not have major problems with young motorcyclists because of our requirements for testing, particularly for the moped test."
"Other countries have different problems relating to motorcycles and mopeds, so I will argue that the proposal made by the Commission and Parliament for a 'one size fits all' solution will not work."
"That is why, in conjunction with some of my colleagues in the PSE Group, I have brought forward amendments which will allow for a two-track approach that will respect the principles of progressive access."
"On one track there will be a practical test for mopeds and then two further stages of progressive access."
"The other track will have no requirement for practical tests for mopeds, but then three stages of progressive access to the most powerful motorcycles."
"In both cases, with regard to decisions on direct access to larger machines, it should be at the discretion of Member States to adopt a minimum age anywhere between 21 and 27."
"I would hope that we can resolve this problem of motorcycles during the vote."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, on the report he has produced."
"The driving licence directive is very complex and intricate."
"Overall, I think that it is a great step forwards in terms of freedom of movement, of reducing the possibility of fraud and of attempting to improve road safety."
"More than 40 000 people die on Europe’s roads every year, a worrying statistic which requires serious and urgent attention."
"One of the most vulnerable categories of victim is motorcyclists."
"Italy has one third of all the two-wheeled vehicles in the whole of Europe, and 60% of the scooters."
"That is why I followed the debate on age limits with concern, but fortunately it resulted in the acceptance of a certain amount of flexibility."
"In Italy, for instance, youngsters can ride mopeds from the age of 14, and several studies have shown that that is not the age group at greatest risk."
"In our country, especially in the major cities, scooters and mopeds are extremely popular forms of transport and are valid alternatives to cars."
"The way to improve road safety is certainly not to take them out of circulation but to teach people how to ride safely, by introducing training and preparation courses in schools."
"In general, the step-up approach is worthwhile, but the report introduces excessive regulation which does not improve the Commission’s proposal and does not lead any closer to the goal of harmonisation."
"What sense is there in granting a motorcycle licence at the age of 24 and allowing for the possibility of a car licence at just 17?"
"Lastly, introducing tests for access to every category does not allow users and much less the authorities to manage and monitor the system, and there is not the slightest guarantee that safety will be improved."
"The issue needs to be addressed boldly, without penalising motorcyclists more than drivers of other categories just to ease our consciences."
"I call on all my fellow Members to think carefully about these two points, so as to raise safety standards and achieve the goal of harmonisation by introducing sensible, feasible and manageable rules."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to deal with two points in this report that strike me as especially noteworthy."
"Firstly, I am pleased that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has departed from the Commission draft by taking the view that compulsory medical examinations from a certain age should not be imposed by the Directive, because I believe that such a provision would have amounted to unwarranted discrimination."
"There are no statistics of any kind to suggest that age-related health impairments are a disproportionately frequent cause of accidents."
"Moreover, it must be remembered that all of us throughout Europe are confronted at the present time with closures, particularly in rural areas, of groceries, banks, post offices, and so on."
"Many elderly people live in these areas, and it would surely be wrong to take away their licences and thereby effectively put them at risk of not being able to meet many of their basic needs."
"The second point I wish to address is the question of the ten-year time limit."
"I was initially sceptical on this point, but I realise that, if we are to create a uniform rule, it has to be accepted that there are countries in which the driving licence serves not only as a certificate of authorisation but also as an identity document."
"Let me turn this on its head and suggest that, if this ten-year limit is to apply, as I believe it should, it might be worth ensuring that this driving licence serves everywhere as a means of identification."
"The benefits this brings would make up for the disadvantages the time limit imposes on some countries."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his important work, because this afternoon and evening have made it once again apparent that it was not easy."
"I should like to elaborate on a few key points."
"First of all, we must be really serious about combating European fraud, and thus pave the way for it, but that is impossible with 110 different driving licences in Europe."
"I do think it vital therefore that driving licences be renewed every ten years and that we move towards one fraud-proof driving licence in credit-card format in another ten years’ time."
"We cannot leave this to subsidiarity."
"This Parliament would not take itself seriously if we took a decision and subsequently needed 80 years to introduce it."
"Secondly, the Commission proposal was too restrictive for owners of caravans, boat trailers and horse trailers which, in accordance with the proposal, must obtain an additional category E driving licence to add to their regular category B driving licence. I am pleased with a majority backing for my proposal so that the current situation can be maintained."
"Since there is no evidence that this should be unsafe, we should not make the rules unnecessarily complicated."
"Thirdly, with regard to driving licences for heavy goods vehicles, if we were to follow the outcome of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, gradual access to heavy goods vehicles would even apply up to the age of 24 years."
"And that is going too far."
"An 18-year old is allowed to drive a big Landrover but you must be 24 years of age to be able to drive a heavy goods vehicle straight away."
"That is really too crazy for words and very unfair."
"That is why, with Mr Bradbourn’s backing, I have tabled an amendment along with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which, as is currently the case, makes it possible to drive a heavy goods vehicle straight away from the age of 21."
"I should like to urge this House to support this amendment, which is a very important revision."
"The 10 years are vital to establish a uniform driving licence in Europe and combat real fraud."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too feel strongly about the aspect of promoting road safety, particularly for motorcycles."
"In this respect, I think it would be useful to harmonise four general principles, which are already included in the directive."
"I am referring to the principle of progressive access and the fundamental role of training; the need not to discriminate between car drivers and motorcyclists in the issuing of licences; the awareness that speed and the power/weight ratio must be regarded as one of the main causes of accidents; and the fact that the situation across Europe is highly diversified."
"This diversity should, however, give rise to a strong demand for greater safety and a greater sense of responsibility on the road, but not the establishment of a four-wheeled monoculture over a two-wheeled one."
"Within this framework, other colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and I are tabling some amendments."
"On the one hand, they are designed to limit the speed of motorcycles that can be driven at the age of 18 and to recognise the differences among the various countries in the types of vehicles on their roads."
"On the other, they reaffirm the principle of progressive access, rewarding driving experience and practical testing when people step up from mopeds to faster motorcycles and considering that, when they move up from one category to another, people have already acquired the skills of driving in urban traffic and behaving correctly towards other road users."
"With better harmonisation of these aspects, I believe that the motorcycle issue, which has been raised by many speakers, can be reconciled into a single scheme within the framework of this proposal, on which I congratulate the rapporteur."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on driving licences brings more Europe into the everyday lives of our citizens."
"Legislation is becoming more accessible, more transparent and more efficient in sectors which are basic to our freedom of movement within a single European market."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Mathieu Grosch, has come down a long road and has made a huge effort to reconcile various sore points and different practices and has, in his way, contributed to the improvement of this proposal and we thank him for that."
"Indeed, a harmonised, but not necessarily homogenised system for issuing driving licences will, to begin with, help combat the fraud and confusion which can easily arise today, due to the variety of different licences which exist in the European Union."
"Issuing licences in the form of a plastic card, replacing old licences within 10 years and the facility, albeit optional, to introduce a microchip facilitate controls and reduce the risk of fraud."
"The mutual recognition of sanctions will help this, thereby promoting an area of security and justice in the European Union."
"This proposal for a directive also helps to strengthen road safety, which is the basic objective of the European policy."
"The right criteria for selecting examiners, their continuing training, periodic medical examinations of drivers, extending the principle of gradual access to driving licences for more powerful types of vehicles are elements which govern the protection of our life, the quality of our life and, finally, our democracy."
"They are at the heart of the European social model and we should protect them."
"Mr President, I strongly support the rapporteur's approach to this issue."
"In fact, I wonder why we cannot consider moving more quickly to the credit card-size licence."
"Considering we transferred from 15 different currencies to the single European currency in a matter of weeks, it seems to me that transferring from 110 different models of licence to a single licence must be a far easier process."
"One of the points that concerns me is the cost of licensing for young people in particular."
"It must be a disincentive for them, having also to pay for training and in many cases repeating their tests."
"This must result in a large number of young people around Europe driving without proper licensing and, therefore, presumably without proper insurance."
"I know that in Ireland, the Automobile Association estimated that a fifth of the drivers on our roads have provisional licences."
"These are licences issued on the basis of paying a fee and getting a licence over the counter."
"There is at least a 12-month waiting list to get a test, and if people then fail that test - as a high proportion do - they drive on the roads without adequate training and proper knowledge for a period of at least two years."
"Whilst it is a very good idea to have common standards across Europe, we must address the question of whether Member States are ensuring that the people who get these provisional licences in particular, are capable of driving safely."
"Road death statistics seem to prove that they do not."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the directive on driving licences has been a particularly hot potato in my country."
"I am very pleased that many points in the initial proposals which people rightly criticised no longer apply now, such as health checks for older drivers, on which much has already been said."
"As far as the question of time limits is concerned, we should certainly take into consideration that individual Member States have very different cultures and traditions."
"In Germany there have been driving licences for more than a hundred years; no other country in the EU can lay claim to such a long history of driver licensing."
"We have our own tradition; others have theirs. It makes no sense for European legislators in general or the European Parliament in particular to go beyond what the Member States have hitherto agreed."
"As for the introduction of the credit-card type of licence, this option has been available for five years now, and it is the Member States’ own fault if they have not yet taken it."
"Its introduction remains, however, a task for them; it is not our responsibility to impose it at this level as a binding obligation on everyone."
"Allow me to raise another point of criticism."
"The new driving licence is supposed to contain a microchip; this will cost money and achieve nothing."
"Why did we spend time discussing digital codes and the like during the penultimate legislative term?"
"It was so that the driving licence could be understood in every country."
"We do not need a chip, which will only cost money and serve no useful purpose."
"I am delighted that the trailer problem has been resolved."
"I had very intensive discussions on this point with the rapporteur, and I believe we arrived at a good, practicable and people-friendly solution."
"Let us also please come up with people-friendly solutions to problems such as compulsory exchanging of licences and the like. We annoy people more than we help them by bestowing these unsolicited favours."
"I therefore address myself to you, Commissioner, since yours is the honourable task of taking the final decision on the 129 amendments that have been tabled."
"These are very close to the Council’s position, and that is what best serves the public interest."
"Mr President, I hasten to add to Mr De Rossa's contribution that most of those driving around on provisional licences in Ireland are doing so legally such is the crazy system we have in case people think that a fifth of the drivers are outside the law."
"That is not the case."
"I fully support the third directive on driving licences that is before us and I thank Mr Grosch for the work he has done on it."
"We are trying to ensure greater freedom of movement for our citizens, to combat fraud and above all to promote road safety."
"The slaughter on our roads in every one of the Member States needs no underlining from me, and this is but a very small contribution."
"A plastic credit card-type driving licence would be ideal."
"The current paper licences lend themselves to fraud."
"We could have a credit card type with an optional microchip to reinforce further anti-fraud measures."
"I agree that it should be regularly renewed, again to reinforce anti-fraud protection and to renew the holder's photograph."
"It would also put an end to driving licence tourism by ensuring one holder, one licence."
"At the moment, as we euphemistically say in the English language, if you 'lose' your licence you can go and get a European driving licence or get a licence in another country."
"'Lose' means having it withdrawn for some major transgression of the law!"
"Harmonising the scheduling of medical checks for professional drivers has to be good and so too having minimum requirements for training for our driving examiners."
"This area has never been harmonised and it is most important that we go down that route."
"I would support all driving licences being replaced by the credit card type when they come up for renewal."
"I know that there is some debate around this and that there are two options."
"The big problem at the moment is that we must not diminish the holder's right to drive."
"I think there is a subliminal fear of renewing all paper driving licences, as they come up for renewal."
"People, particularly the more elderly amongst us, are afraid that their right to drive will in some way be threatened and that they will not get their licence back."
"We should give assurances that there will be no diminishing of the right to drive and that all driving licences will be transferred as they come up for renewal."
"I also strongly support the right to pull a trailer or a caravan under 3½ tonnes with a car licence."
"Mr President, much as I regret it, I must start by replying to the comments made earlier by Mr Piecyk, who said that anyone who fails the German theory and attitude test known appropriately as the can resort to various tricks to obtain a driving licence in another country such as the Czech Republic."
"I should like to assure Mr Piecyk that the requirements for obtaining a driving licence in both the Czech Republic and Poland are a great deal more stringent than merely passing the ."
"High standards are required not only of drivers, but also of welders, doctors and nurses, who are so highly sought after in the old EU Member States."
"I should now like to turn to my main concern."
"The Grosch report combines two issues we know from experience to be extremely complex."
"The first of these is the drive towards standardisation, or harmonisation, and the second is the desire to ensure respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"There is no question that driving licences need to be standardised, as we cannot expect any policeman anywhere in Europe to be familiar with all their various permutations."
"Yet although there is a great temptation to do so, standardisation should not be followed up with measures that interfere with the sovereign laws of individual states, for example those relating to the age of drivers, medical examinations or systems for training learner drivers."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Grosch on having resisted this temptation."
"What is absolutely crucial, however, is to set up a European network of databases."
"Until such a network exists it will be impossible to reduce forgeries, and hence to increase road safety."
"The reason for this, as is well known, is that those who cannot obtain driving licences legally resort to illegal means, and pose a threat to themselves and to others because they do not have the necessary skills to drive a vehicle."
"It has come to my attention that the European Commission has experienced problems with the implementation of this database, and I have to admit that I find this perplexing."
"Given that nowadays one can easily purchase items on the Internet, reserve tickets for flights or carry out complicated banking operations, why should the Commission regard the setting up of such a system as a near-Herculean task? I thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common European driving licence is long overdue, not as some sort of supplementary version but as the one and only valid one."
"While it may be fascinating to flick through the catalogue with the 110 models currently in circulation and study the various periods of validity and security features, it is not practical to operate with such a catalogue."
"Exchanging old driving licences will not make licence holders observe the highway code any more diligently, nor will it result in vehicles being equipped with better safety devices, but it will improve freedom of movement and considerably enhance people’s security and safety, whether on or off the road."
"Updating driving licences brings more security without additional red tape and will be effected in full compliance with the subsidiarity principle."
"Exercising their sovereignty, the Member States should find a host of ways to administer the exchange, for example when vehicles are licensed or undergo their regular roadworthiness test."
"Both of these take place far more often than the updating of driving licences, involve considerable red tape and are far more expensive too."
"All vehicle users who drive abroad will enjoy a higher level of safety by virtue of the fact that, when they are stopped for roadside checks and even when they hire cars, their up-to-date readable driving licence will make irritating and nerve-racking complications a thing of the past."
"Evidence shows that such complications lead to stress, which puts these drivers at risk on the road."
"In the context of the fight against terrorism, I believe that a verifiable driving licence is an entirely legitimate requirement."
"The licence-holder must be identifiable beyond any shadow of doubt."
"In this way, the scope for fraud is reduced, licences become more forgery-proof, and we may be sure that the driver of a bus or of a vehicle carrying hazardous materials is qualified to drive that particular vehicle."
"If we want to take serious action to combat driving-licence tourism, we need a registry of issued driving licences as part of a network of national registers."
"If the Committee’s assumptions turn out to be justified, we shall achieve this goal in the year 2030."
"We should certainly not defer our target dates any further."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament who have taken part in this debate, which I believe has indeed been an important one."
"I would also like to thank Mr Grosch very much for a report the quality of which has been unanimously recognised."
"I thank him, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, warmly for their support and, I would say, their improvement of the Commission’s text."
"Congratulations, Mr Grosch!"
"It is a very sensitive subject for Europe’s citizens and you have therefore succeeded in finding the right balance."
"I have of course heard some of you warning the Union against excessive regulation, but I have to say nevertheless that this new driving licence, a few of which I have already seen here and there in some Member States, will in my opinion bring greater safety for everyone, simplicity for its users and a subsidiarity that leaves a number of decisions to the Member States."
"I would therefore say that it is a very well balanced text."
"It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that we are legislating on a very sensitive subject."
"The driving licence, Mr President, is now the most widespread qualification in the European Union: almost 300 million holders often depend on it for their mobility, for their everyday lives."
"On the other hand, of course, the diversity of responses shows that there are as many experts as there are holders of driving licences and that each expert has his or her own opinion on the subject."
"However, in the light of the agreement reached in the Council last October and in the light of the vote in committee – your committee – there is a very broad consensus, which confirms that the other institutions largely share the Commission’s objectives."
"Clearly, given the number of amendments and the variety of reactions, I cannot respond on every point."
"I can tell you, Mr Grosch, that the Commission is able to accept virtually all your amendments; on the other hand, however, it feels obliged to suggest that you reject a number of amendments which, while reflecting laudable intentions, would in a way unbalance the text and make it more cumbersome."
"This is one stage, and we know there will be other improvements yet."
"I am thinking for example of Amendments 97 to 129."
"Obviously, Mr President, I will arrange for the detail of the Commission’s response to all the amendments to be forwarded in writing, but I would like in particular to answer a few questions and, first of all, to explain my position on the replacement of licences that are already in circulation."
"Your report, Mr Grosch, proposes replacing all existing licences within a period of 10 years for paper models and 20 years for other models."
"It is true that the Commission did not originally propose replacing all the licences already in circulation."
"However, recent revelations of document fraud and the fraudulent obtaining of driving licences – which a number of you have mentioned, referring to ‘driving licence tourism’ – have led to a change of attitude on the subject in the Member States."
"In view of this, ladies and gentlemen, replacing every licence will allow databases to be updated, and forged licences and the duplicate and triplicate licences many citizens hold to be withdrawn."
"This operation will make a direct contribution to improving road checks and create an additional means of reducing impunity."
"The creation of a computer network will also serve this objective."
"With this in mind, I would like to inform Parliament that the Commission is cooperating with the Member States on the creation of a driving licence network to be known as Resper."
"This database will connect the national databases and the relevant work will be completed in 2005."
"That is therefore why all the amendments are acceptable to the Commission, and I have no doubt that the formulation proposed by the Grosch report opens up the prospect of a fruitful debate in the Council on this replacement of licences already in circulation."
"Obviously, the Commission cannot accept amendments that are not consistent with this and which might in future even prevent the problems I have already mentioned being resolved."
"I would also like to say a few words about limited administrative validity."
"The Commission has proposed an administrative validity of 10 years for future driving licences."
"This document in evidence of rights to drive will have to include a recent photograph and incorporate the most advanced possible anti-fraud protection."
"This will enable checks to be effective and road safety to be improved without excessive cost."
"It is nevertheless true that the Commission did not propose linking this regular renewal with a medical examination because we still have to leave the Member States some responsibility in this field in the name of subsidiarity."
"So much for limited administrative validity, which nevertheless looks interesting to us in that it will help to prevent fraud and to update the licence without undue formality."
"As I said, the Commission has not proposed regular medical examinations, and limited validity is not automatically linked to such checks, which remain the responsibility of the Member States."
"I would like to thank everyone who has raised the problem of motorcycles, bearing in mind in particular the young, and sometimes not so young, people who use them."
"One of you stressed that at a particular age people might want a motorcycle without necessarily being ready for one."
"It is true that we must be very careful."
"Motorcycle drivers are 16 times more likely to be involved in accidents than motorists."
"If the present trend continues and we do nothing, two-wheel drivers will account for as much as one third of fatalities in 2010."
"I have been Minister for Health in a Member State and I can tell you that the number of deaths, and also the number of accidents that leave young people quadriplegic will affect me for the rest of my life."
"I therefore believe we must be extremely careful."
"That is why, Mr President, I now want to express my warmest thanks to the honourable Members who, with their rapporteur, have done a quite remarkable piece of work."
"I am sure that our fellow European citizens will be very sensitive to the progress we have made, even if, of course, we still have some way to go."
"I am aware that the problem of the cost of the driving licence and of the need to train examiners has also been mentioned."
"That is another matter for action and investigation in the Member States, because the younger generation in particular must not be faced with difficulties in obtaining a driving licence, since for many young people it is a way of obtaining employment."
"That is what I wanted to say."
"On behalf of the Commission, I therefore accept your amendments, Mr Grosch."
"I am obliged to reject a few of them, but I nevertheless thank those who tabled them for their contribution to this debate, a contribution which must not be underestimated when we see its importance for the everyday lives of Europe’s citizens.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0015/2005) on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of sanctions for infringements (Rapporteur: Mrs Corien Wortmann-Kool)."
". Mr President, we are discussing the directive on criminal penalties to combat illegal oil discharges at sea, and as your rapporteur, I am delighted with the agreement reached with the Council at second reading."
"It required a great deal of intensive consultation, and the agreement we have reached with the Council guarantees a firm but fair European approach to illegal oil discharges and oil disasters."
"I should like to underline to the House the social importance of this directive."
"The immediate motivation for the present legislative proposal was the oil disaster involving the ."
"Hundreds of kilometres of coastline were seriously polluted and the present package of measures really does not only pertain to those accidents but also aims to combat illegal discharges in European coastal waters."
"Those illegal discharges may not make newspaper headlines, but they do constitute a seriously underestimated and underexposed problem, for every year, some 90 000 cases of illegal discharge take place in European waters."
"Beaches are polluted year in and year out, and oil pollution accounts for no less than 40% of the dead seabirds along the North Sea coast."
"The Council has taken a long time to reach a common position, and it proved inadequate for Parliament."
"We do not want a paper tiger but sound European tracing and penal agreements."
"The Council has accommodated Parliament to a large extent, which benefits the European citizens and the environment."
"I should like to enlarge on the key points."
"Firstly, there are tough sanctions to combat illegal discharges."
"The Council accepted a framework decision in December in which the penalties are incorporated in the third pillar."
"The Council has thus paved the way to reach this agreement."
"This third-pillar proposal is also firmly anchored in the directive by including a criminal offences clause."
"Moreover, the Council has guaranteed the parallel adoption of both legislative proposals."
"In this way, and in advance of the new Constitution, Parliament has strengthened its institutional position."
"Secondly, illegal discharges are to be traced."
"Most countries can only just act against illegal discharges, if at all, but by lowering the threshold for combating these to serious negligence, we can guarantee that infringements can be tackled fairly and squarely."
"However, we should not veer to the other extreme, namely to the disproportionate criminalisation of captain and crew, a subject which has been hotly debated."
"Parliament values the protection offered by international conventions in the event of illegal discharges, but this is more complicated in the case of accidents."
"The Commission and Council do not want any additional Marpol protection within the territorial waters, believing that this would then make it virtually impossible to act, a view endorsed by a majority in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Nevertheless, I have noticed that this topic is continuing to be discussed, for it was only yesterday that I received a letter from the International Maritime Organisation on this very subject, a letter with which the Commissioner is also familiar."
"Can you, Commissioner, remove the fear that is still being felt by some that, in the case of accidents, the crew is being criminalised from the word go, because that is not the intention?"
"Thirdly, this House has cherished the dream of a European coastguard for a long time."
"It is necessary for oil pollution to be prevented and traced effectively."
"This wish has so far not been recognised by the Council, but that is now the case with this agreement."
"I am therefore delighted that the Council recognises the principle of a European coastguard."
"It has been agreed that the Commission will present a feasibility study before the end of 2006, and we are looking forward, Commissioner, to the outcome of your study and also to your proposal for a European coastguard."
"Finally, we should, naturally, do everything in our power to prevent pollution, and that is where the Directive on port reception facilities comes in, although it is still woefully inadequate."
"What will the Commission do to improve it?"
"My thanks go to my fellow Members for the trust they have placed in me and for the good cooperation, as well as to the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I should also like to thank the Commission warmly for all the support and cooperation."
"Last but not least, I should like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for the dynamic way in which it steered the negotiations, which was not an easy task."
"I am pleased with the result, for which I would thank you, particularly from the perspective of the public interest and that of the environment along our coasts and in our coastal waters."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Mrs Wortmann-Kool for her outstanding review of the context, explanation of the issues and description of the content of this compromise solution, which I very much hope will be endorsed by Parliament tomorrow."
"I would simply like to add a few words."
"Negotiations on this proposal for a directive began nearly two years ago."
"We had obstacles to overcome, we did not always agree with some of you, and I would like to pay tribute and offer my warmest thanks to the three rapporteurs, who in turn took part in those negotiations, and more particularly to Mrs Wortmann-Kool, who is the real author of today’s success."
"With this future directive, the European institutions will at last be responding in a concrete fashion to the expectations of our citizens, who want to see an end to the degassings and other disasters of the past."
"I have heard it said, and you have just said so yourself, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that we wanted to turn masters and crews into criminals."
"Well, I really must make it clear that such is certainly not our intention."
"On the contrary, we want to serve the industry with this directive."
"Our target is the rarest of cases, those which are intolerable and unacceptable; we want to make all operators upstream in the long maritime transport chain aware of their responsibilities."
"I must say I was rather taken aback by the reaction of the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organisation, whom I met last week."
"As I pointed out to him at the IMO headquarters in London, the text that Parliament has before it is perfectly consistent with international law, that is the Marpol Convention on the prevention of pollution and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"Our text is in keeping with them and we are quite simply making use of the option available under the Marpol Convention of bringing in stricter provisions."
"Obviously, we are acting at European Union level and not at the level of each Member State, but I do not honestly believe that the IMO can read into this measure the least desire to criminalise masters and crews."
"I say that emphatically and with conviction, and I would like to reassure all honourable Members who, to judge by a letter I have received, may have felt they did not entirely understand our intentions."
"I would say, Mr President, that the adoption of this text will be a success."
"It is true that in its proposal for a directive the Commission did have in mind to establish a proper system of criminal sanctions."
"From that point of view, the text before Parliament is less ambitious, since the elements of a criminal nature have been transferred to the third pillar, that is a framework decision."
"I regret that, it is true, the Commission regrets it, but we accept it because none of the other aspects of the proposal have been watered down, and we have managed to get pollution offences defined in the same way and made subject to similar dissuasive sanctions throughout Europe."
"That is very important and I would like to say that all the Members of the European Parliament who have witnessed oil slick disasters at one time or another understand that we have to take action; otherwise, sooner or later, we will be faced with another disaster and the finger will point at us."
"This directive means that, in future, the Commission, assisted by the European Maritime Safety Agency, and all the competent authorities of the Member States will have to join forces to increase surveillance, detect offences and punish those at fault."
"In this connection, I have to say for my part that we fully share Parliament’s desire for European coastguards."
"Mr President, without taking up too much time, I would like to say something about Amendments 19 to 23."
"The Commission recommends that Parliament reject them for two reasons."
"Firstly because they call the compromise package into question, while conciliation could complicate things, and also for reasons of substance."
"Amendments 19 and 22 seek to draw up an exhaustive list of all operators who, in the long chain of maritime transport, might be held responsible in the event of an accident and of pollution."
"In fact, that list already exists in shorter form in the seventh recital to the common position, which is not threatened by any compromise."
"Amendment 20 concerns the system of responsibility for compensation for places of refuge."
"This is a very important question and the Commission is looking at it very closely; I must refer here to a study on the subject that I shall be sending to the European Parliament in the next few days."
"Amendments 21 and 23 seek to call into question something the Commission considers a real step forward."
"The European Union is going to set up a really operational system of deterrence and sanctions in its territorial waters: all polluters will have to be sanctioned if they are guilty of serious negligence."
"That is an improvement on international standards, the Marpol Convention in particular, and they need to be amplified."
"Penalties can only be imposed on those who have acted deliberately or have made an inexcusable error."
"Our text is therefore a step forward, made possible by the Law of the Sea Convention."
"That Convention allows coastal states to strengthen their pollution prevention and control regimes in their territorial waters."
"The opportunity is open, we have taken it, and that is why I do not believe there can be any question of going back."
"That is why the Commission does not agree on the substance and why it is glad that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has been wise enough not to accept Amendments 21 and 23."
"Finally, a word on Amendment 2, which relates to recital 7."
"This amendment concerns the revision of the international compensation regime for damage caused by oil pollution, the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF)."
"This amendment was not accepted by the Council; it is true that its aim goes rather further than the scope of the directive."
"At the trialogue meeting, Parliament’s delegation agreed to withdraw this amendment."
"May I remind you that at the invitation of the Council and Parliament, the Commission agreed to make a three-point statement."
"First of all, the Commission reaffirms its determination to help the Member States to find middle ground on revision of the international IOPCF system."
"Secondly, the Commission stresses that the international conventions on liability and compensation in the event of pollution must be implemented."
"Thirdly, the Commission wishes to present a legislative proposal, as part of the third ‘maritime safety’ package, on mandatory insurance for all vessels entering a Community port."
"In conclusion, Mr President, if you will forgive me for taking so long, the Commission supports the package of 13 compromise amendments and looks forward with confidence to the position Parliament will take on this package."
"Please be vigilant: it is essential that the Council abides by its commitments and adopts the directive and the framework decision quickly and concomitantly."
"For my part, I will do my best to ensure the framework decision is put into effect."
"All this is necessary if the compromise is to be meaningful and if European public opinion is in future to feel much better protected against all the marine pollution, to the extremely disastrous effects of which on our natural heritage and all the wealth of the sea Mrs Wortmann-Kool has drawn our attention."
"May I, Mr President, impress on Parliament that it should not be tempted to pay any attention to what I believe to be mistaken comments suggesting that we are criminalising seafarers."
"On the contrary, we are trying within reasonable and proportionate limits to make them more responsible."
"I have to say that the text is balanced and, since the trialogue resulted in an interinstitutional agreement, I think we are well on the way to getting it implemented; I can assure you it will be very well received by all who dread another oil slick happening sooner or later."
"I therefore thank Parliament, Mr President, for the attention it has given to this text, which is very important for our fellow European citizens."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened to you very carefully and to our rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, because the issue we are debating this evening is particularly important and encompasses numerous aspects relating to the sustainable development of our economy and the creation of jobs."
"The policy of the European Union aims to develop maritime transport and, at the same time, to protect the marine environment and this is an objective we all share."
"Unfortunately, however, the common position and its amendment by the Committee on Transport and Tourism do not respond to these challenges, despite the efforts of the rapporteur – and we thank her for that – during the processing of the proposal in committee."
"The basic reason for this finding is that, with the provisions being introduced, the MARPOL international convention is being surpassed as regards the basis for responsibility for accidental pollution and the maritime zones in which it is applied."
"This issue may have important repercussions from a legal and economic point of view."
"In such a case, Community law will violate international law and, at the same time, will undermine the authority of the International Maritime Organisation, which is the only agency which can apply measures to protect the seas at international level because, we must not forget, shipping is a global activity which cannot have numerous standards."
"Experience has shown that regional measures cause confusion, legal inequality and administrative difficulties."
"Moreover, our international statistics tell us that, while international trade by sea is increasing, cases of pollution are decreasing."
"Another important element of this proposal is the criminalisation of work at sea because, in essence, the proposal also concerns this aspect."
"Seamen already have a hard and dangerous life."
"This sort of penal approach discourages young people from going to sea, especially those with technical know-how and a good education, and they are precisely the people that European shipping needs."
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to approach this matter with a sense of responsibility and perspective and for us to vote for the amendment tabled by the New Democracy MEPs and their colleagues from other political groups and countries which aims to bring our proposal into line with the MARPOL international convention."
"I thank you and I believe that, irrespective of the outcome of the vote, we need to look at a long-term strategy which goes beyond restrictive measures and criminal sanctions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all due respect, environmental pollution does happen, one way or the other."
"The rapporteur has pointed out that we behave in a rather schizoid manner, because whenever there are environmental disasters we are all appalled; this turns to outrage, and the media come running."
"But the daily – and I repeat daily – pollution scandal in European and international waters seems not to attract widespread public attention."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"The Commission proposal referred at the time to 390 illegal oil discharges in the Baltic in the year 2001 alone and 596 illegal discharges in the North Sea."
"The environmental organisation Oceania estimates that there are three thousand illegal discharges a year in European waters."
"This is three thousand too many!"
"Discharging pollutants must no longer be treated as a minor infringement; it is high time that it was made a criminal offence, with those who commit it being prosecuted and receiving stiff penalties."
"Investigation and prosecution depend on the availability of appropriate instruments."
"As has been said, the Member States do, of course, have their responsibilities, but in the longer term we shall need an efficient European coastguard."
"We shall not have it today or in the immediate future, but I believe it must come in the medium term."
"The prosecution and sentencing of marine polluters must not be thwarted by nations jealously guarding their rights of jurisdiction."
"Tomorrow, Parliament, the Council and the Commission will decide on a reasonably fair compromise, and the rapporteur can claim a great deal of the credit for its coming to pass."
"I should like to congratulate her and thank her for a very, very good piece of work, which has ensured that we are able to discuss this today and complete the process tomorrow, in other words that we do not need to activate the conciliation procedure but can proceed straight to adoption."
"It its framework agreement, the Council undertakes to impose severe penalties for criminal marine pollution: fines, imprisonment and prohibition of economic activity."
"The Commission and the Council intend to pursue the matter in the IMO."
"It defies comprehension, for example, that shipowners can still insure themselves against fines for marine pollution."
"Such rules need to be amended in the IMO framework."
"By agreeing to a feasibility study, we shall be taking an important first step towards a European coastguard."
"I will also, therefore, compliment the presidency on its fruitful cooperation with us on this issue."
"Luxembourg does not readily spring to mind when you think of countries with long coastlines, but at least it does have a very large fleet, which also imposes responsibility on this presidency, to which my thanks are also due."
"I believe all of us bear a great deal of responsibility for the natural world, including the seas and oceans."
"This is why tomorrow’s decisions must be very quickly implemented."
"Our coasts, our seas and our marine life will thank us for it."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, oil is dumped at sea every six minutes and more than 20 000 tonnes of oil is dumped into European seas each year as a result of maritime traffic, enough to fill 10 000 Olympic-sized swimming pools."
"That is what is stated in the OCEANA report on sea pollution, which has also been mentioned by Mr Piecyk."
"However, this report says more. For example that each year 3 000 illegal dumpings of oil are detected each year, but there may be many more deliberate discharges because, for example, in the busiest port in the whole of the European Union and one of the most important in the world, Rotterdam, just 7% of the ships which dock there deposit the waste from their bilges and tanks in the port collection installations."
"Where do they dump the other 93%?"
"Most of it in the sea, probably."
"We must approve more effective control legislation as soon as possible in order to prevent the more than 77 000 deaths per year of birds as a result of oil impregnation and the unknown number of deaths of cetaceans, turtles, fish species and marine fauna and flora in general, as well as rules which also put an end to pollution of coasts and beaches everywhere."
"Patented on-board monitoring instruments are in the process of being approved, a kind of inviolable black box which can reliably verify whether a ship has carried out illegal dumpings."
"In the implementation of the accompanying measures laid down in Article 10 of the Directive we are debating today, all ships must be required to install these black boxes, all ports, without exception, must have installations for collecting waste and State and Community systems for registering controlled illegal discharges must be established, and there must be public information on illegal dumping and the penalties applied as a result of it."
"The States must be obliged to comply with the legislation requiring them to provide refuge ports for ships in trouble and a European coastguard service must be created to control dumping, illegal immigration and drug trafficking."
"Furthermore, it is essential that sanctions be applied to all those involved in the sea transport chain without exception, including the owners of the cargo and contracting agents, charterers, consignees, shipowners, classification societies and insurers, captains, crew members and others, regardless of whether they carry out their duties on land or at sea, if they are responsible for those accidents or dumping."
"The International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage must also be periodically increased and updated and brought into line with the real damage caused and more appropriate account must be taken of the contributions of shipowners, owners, charterers and receivers of oil cargo."
"All of this must be applied immediately in Europe and we must demand that it be extended to the rest of the world by means of the International Maritime Organisation, because if we wait for it to be agreed there, we may find that the North Sea, the Baltic or, in particular, the Mediterranean have been damaged beyond repair."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, very warmly for her wonderful report and for all the work she has done, both with a view to agreeing on common positions amongst the parliamentary groups, and within the trialogue with the Council and the Commission, and with a view to completing this legislative procedure at this second reading."
"I can inform you that our group has just accepted the thirteen compromise amendments and has also agreed to withdraw the three amendments we had presented."
"We have done all of this so that we can approve this report tomorrow and so that this crucial Directive can enter into force as quickly as possible."
". – Mr President, the large majority of my political group supports the proposal and rejects the amendments which seek to weaken it."
"The large majority of citizens call for stricter measures to prevent pollution from ships, which affects not only the environment and public health but also fishing and tourism."
"The package of measures which we are debating today endeavours to complete a task which started years ago and which has been delayed on account of reactions from three Member States which were against the Commission's original proposal for a directive."
"How can you be against such a directive, when you calculate the ecological cost?"
"The cost to the fishing industry and the cost from the blow to tourism and from the unemployment which plagues areas hit by oil pollution."
"In 1999 alone, in the area of the Mediterranean – and the Mediterranean is a closed sea – 1 638 cases of illegal dumping were reported."
"Think how many there were which were not reported because they were not identified."
"A similar number of oil slicks was identified in 2001 in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea."
"For reasons of the protection of the marine environment and the need for a positive step to be taken at long last, we accept the points of the compromise amendments, even though they do not fully satisfy us."
"Finally, I should like to call on the Greek Government, the government of my country, to abandon its policy of stonewalling."
"Greece, as a world shipping power, should not be acting as rear guard; it should be at the vanguard in combating pollution from ships and, with its constructive stand, should not leave room for criticism to be levelled at the Greek fleet."
". Mr President, we are currently discussing not only the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, but also the agreement she has reached with the Council."
"There are two aspects of importance for me in this debate."
"First of all, we should realise that seafaring is a global industry which only functions properly when legislation is laid down globally."
"I thus welcome the fact that both the Council and the rapporteur endorse the Marpol Convention."
"Also, legislation without adequate monitoring and penalties is meaningless."
"I am therefore pleased that the rapporteur has managed to prompt the Council to make a specific pledge with regard to this dossier’s criminal dimension."
"Finally, I should like to note that I am looking forward to the Commission’s study on the setting up of a European coastguard."
"I hope that this report will help me appreciate the usefulness of such a body."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I am disappointed that Amendment 7 of this report was rejected by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I must stress that I am fully in favour of the principle that ship-source pollution must be combated."
"However, we must be more sensible in applying this principle."
"We seem to have forgotten that the hazards of the sea can at times cause accidents in spite of all the precautions that one can take."
"It is, therefore, unjust that shipowners, masters and crew members who have taken all reasonable measures to prevent pollution resulting from an accident should be treated in the same way as people who have committed intentional pollution, or pollution resulting from reckless or negligent behaviour."
"There are two reasons why I believe this approach is illogical."
"Firstly, because it goes beyond, if it is not contrary to, MARPOL."
"We should be making an effort to improve the effectiveness of international conventions and not seek to compete with them or work at a tangent to them."
"Because of the very nature of the maritime sector, international conventions have proved to be good and effective tools."
"Let us continue to use them."
"Secondly, it is illogical, because it places shipping in the European Union at a disadvantage when compared to shipping from outside European Union waters."
"At a time when we are striving to improve competitiveness and create jobs, we have to be careful not to legislate in a way that creates a disincentive for the important maritime sector to stay here in Europe."
"I am aware that a lot has been done to reach a compromise on this issue and I thank the rapporteur for this."
"However, I suspect that there remains an insufficient appreciation of the real impact of these provisions."
"We all agree on the need to regulate ship-source pollution, but in doing so we must, and should, adopt a practical approach that can help us reach our goals in an effective yet pragmatic manner."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for his interesting remarks."
"This is, as others have said, an important piece of legislation for maritime safety and for forcing ships to act responsibly."
"As Mr Piecyk, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, Mr Papadimoulis and others have said, most oil pollution does not come from the disasters which get the headlines, but from deliberate discharges."
"It is vital that we combat these illegal acts together in a vigorous way, and this compromise is a positive step forward."
"Cooperation on European issues to counter criminality or carelessness is important and I yield to no one in my determination to do all that we can to prevent pollution and protect the environment."
"We will also achieve far more if we work together as a European Union rather than as individual countries."
"Therefore, as Mr Blokland has said, we will await the feasibility study on the issue of a European coastguard with great interest."
"At present, as I understand it, the functions of national coastguards vary considerably from country to country."
"Some are concerned with border protection and countering illegal immigration; others to counter pollution along the lines we have described."
"In some countries their responsibilities include search-and-rescue operations, which might be the responsibility of the military in others."
"From the UK's point of view, its coastguard functions include search-and-rescue and its borderline of responsibility, the zone, abuts those of the United States and Canada."
"Therefore the area of responsibility for UK coastguards is somewhat larger than that of some of the other countries. I therefore look forward to this feasibility study with interest."
"We can reflect on this after the report has been adopted tomorrow and then move forward."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, experience has shown that preventive and repressive measures for imposing sanctions for pollution-related infringements on shipowners, ship's operators, managers and persons and authorised agencies in general responsible for the state, operation and seaworthiness of vessels are woefully inadequate."
"With court rulings, shipowners, ship's operators, managers, agents, insurers, charterers, cargo owners and others who constitute the chain of the material and technical shipping infrastructure, responsible for crimes at sea and environmental disasters, exploit national and international law to escape punishment while, with great strictness and contrary to international legislation, seafarers are used as scapegoats and hostages in order to allay the concerns of the workers and oppose the fights of the mass grass-roots movement for environmental protection."
"It has been proven that the policy defined on the basis of the incentive of reinforcing competitiveness and increasing the profits of industrial operations at sea and on shore, in other words of the monopolies, is highly dangerous to the protection of human life at sea and environmental protection."
"The relevant directive on pollution at sea, which introduces sanctions for infringements, comes within the framework of this anti-grass roots policy of reinforcing the competitiveness of companies and increasing the profitability of big business."
"It shifts the blame for accidents to ships' crew members, perpetuates the unaccountability of industrial companies at sea and on shore and leaves shipowners, ship's operators, managers, charterers, shipping registers, insurance companies and others untouched."
"It maintains and reinforces the joint responsibility of ship's operators and seafarers."
"If time were not in fact so short, I could cite thousands of examples which show that there is no connection whatsoever between the responsibilities of the master and crew and those of the ship's operators and shipowners."
"Pollution at sea and the destruction of the environment are questions of huge political importance."
"To close, allow me in response to the reference to Amendment 19, which we tabled, to note the following: we really do not understand as regards Amendment 19, given that the Commissioner, the rapporteur and the Council accept that the content does not change, why they do not accept terms under which the persons responsible for pollution-related infringements really are determined with greater clarity ..."
"Mr President, there is a very well known English saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"I hope that this directive is not one of them."
"Obviously, pollution is a maritime catastrophe and we all agree on that."
"My country, Malta, is highly susceptible because it is dependent on tourism, and our maritime philosophy has always been appreciated, especially as we were one of the forerunners with relation to certain theories regarding the common heritage of mankind, especially with regard to the sea bed."
"So, no one can accuse us of putting our national interest before that of the European Union – and I will explain why."
"I do not think in all sincerity that this directive will reduce pollution."
"Why?"
"Up to now, I have not been given a direct and concrete answer as to whether this directive will affect ships that are not registered in countries within the European Union."
"If it will not, what will the effect be?"
"The effect will be that ships currently registered in Greece, Cyprus and Malta will migrate to other flag countries."
"I would appreciate it if this could be clarified because, as far as I have been informed by my Government, the law as it stands discriminates between flags of European and non-European states."
"If this is the case, this would go against the International Convention."
"How will you, Commissioner, enforce it?"
"I would appreciate it if this could be answered in the conclusions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the marine environment is vitally important to us all and to future generations."
"That has been said many times in this House today, and I can only agree."
"It is also the case that pollution in the seas and in the marine environment is a genuine cross-border problem and a genuine cross-border challenge."
"As I see it, the decision we shall take tomorrow will lead to an improvement in the situation in the seas and in the marine environment."
"I also think that a European coastguard – an issue that must of course be looked into – could be a good contribution to this work."
"It could be helpful in combating oil pollution in its various forms."
"It would be important to define the coastguard’s tasks and roles so that it could also operate in relation to national responsibilities."
"I shall therefore be brief and simply conclude by supporting the proposed agreement."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a proposal for a directive which is the direct consequence of a tragic incident."
"I refer to the sinking of the in November 2002, which resulted in massive loss of marine wealth and seafarers from a European country."
"The investigations which ensued in the wake of this tragic incident proved that responsibility in such cases is apportioned between numerous agencies and agents involved."
"Unfortunately, we had to suffer a major ecological disaster in order to understand that, although the overwhelming majority of those engaged in shipping act responsibly, there are a few whose irresponsibility can have a tremendous adverse impact on the marine environment."
"Greece, a country with a long shipping tradition, has not so far suffered any major accidental pollution, thanks to the conscientiousness of workers in the shipping sector and, of course, of shipowners and Greek seafarers and everyone else involved."
"As Greek socialists with a real awareness about both environmental protection and protection of the people who work in the shipping sector, we support the proposal and believe that the present proposal for a directive is a positive step in combating both operational and accidental pollution and intentional pollution, as the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, rightly stated."
"We need to stand firm against unaccountability and irresponsibility."
"In a big pond like the Mediterranean, with heavy shipping traffic which increases day by day, as a Greek from a country which is the biggest shipping power in the Union and a country in which tourism is a basic sector of the economy, a country with a huge coastline and hundreds of islands, I consider it our duty to lead the fight against pollution at sea and protection of the marine world."
". Mr President, I will try to be brief, but I should nevertheless like to answer a couple of questions."
"Firstly, I cannot allow it to be said that a conflict exists between this proposal for a directive and the Marpol Convention, as this is entirely untrue."
"The Marpol Convention provides only for sanctions against those who have acted deliberately or those who have committed inexcusable errors, but it must be read in conjunction with the Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"The latter allows coastal states to step up measures to prevent and combat pollution within their territorial waters, and it is this clause of the Convention on the Law of the Sea that we have invoked."
"Given that this clause can be invoked by any Member State, it can also be invoked by the EU, and this is an issue I have discussed with the Secretary-General of the IMO."
"I therefore find this criticism puzzling, as the directive complies with both the Marpol Convention and the Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"I would also note, as the rapporteur rightly mentioned, that the sanctions are proportionate; the aim is to impose penalties for gross negligence, and to ensure that these penalties fit the crime."
"What we want is not to turn people into criminals, but to make them aware of their responsibilities."
"I may be speaking with a little too much passion on this matter, but that is only because I believe in this cause, which is the protection of our common heritage."
"I should therefore like to answer Mr Attard-Montalto’s question as politely as possible – is Mr Attard-Montalto present, by any chance?"
"Sanctions can be imposed on ships flying flags of third countries when these ships enter a Community port."
"Flags of European States will therefore not be discriminated against in that respect."
"That was the point I wished to make."
"I would add that not only do we believe this approach to comply fully with that of the International Maritime Organisation, it is also our aim to cooperate with this organisation, as I have told the IMO Secretary-General."
"We are using the work carried out by the IMO as a basis, as it also wishes to promote the use of black boxes, and has even drawn up a detailed timetable on this issue."
"Mr President, the point I having been trying to make is that we have reached a unanimous political agreement within the Council."
"I should therefore like to warn this House that this agreement is backed by a majority that is emerging throughout Europe, and which took shape during the trialogue held with the Council."
"Finally, we must not wait for the next disaster to happen before suddenly realising what is happening and becoming aware of our responsibilities."
"Until now, progress has only been made with marine protection legislation when disasters have hit, yet we now have a great opportunity to prevent this from happening."
"This is why I personally believe that this text is balanced and that its aim is not to turn anyone into a criminal, but to make everyone aware of their responsibilities."
"This is why, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, I should like to thank this House in advance for voting in favour of this text with as large a majority as possible(1)."
"Many thanks for your answer, Commissioner, and for the passion with which you delivered it."
"Mr President, on a point of order, the Commissioner has misquoted me."
"He has no right to misquote me."
"My intention was clear: I did not refer in any way to discharges, whether negligent or intentional, within home ports or home waters, and he knows that."
"He quoted me as saying that the discrimination that would be created between ships of a third country and ships flying Member States' flags was applicable to discharges in home waters, when he knows very well that I did not say that."
"I asked, and I still await his answer, whether, with regard to discharges made outside home waters, there is discrimination between ships flying flags of European nations and those flying flags of third countries."
"I should like the Commissioner to answer that question, and not a question that I did not ask."
"Mr Attard-Montalto, strictly speaking that was not a point of order; I believe instead that your comments related to a personal accusation."
"Commissioner, would you like to provide a further answer?"
"I apologise. My aim was to give an entirely honest answer, and I have every respect for the opinions of all those present, even though I may have been a little too passionate in defending this text."
"I should like to make it very clear that I have absolutely no intention of accusing Members of this House in any way, and indeed accusing anyone was the last thing I wanted to do."
"My point is that ships flying flags of third countries are subject to regulations when they enter a Community port; I believe that you agree on this matter, even though I may not be answering your question in full."
"If you wish, Mr President, I should like to suggest to Mr Attard-Montalto that we hold a face-to-face meeting to clear up the matter."
"All I have done is to explain which legislation I believe applies to the current situation."
"He may have other situations in mind, and so I would suggest that the two of us meet to discuss the issue in more detail."
"The presidency of the sitting would like to thank you for being so accommodating, Commissioner."
"I believe that that would in fact be the most sensible solution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0055/2004), by Mrs Renate Sommer, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on harmonised River Traffic Information Services on inland waterways in the Community."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to present this proposal for a directive on river information services to you today."
"Its aim is to harmonise information services on inland waterways in the Community, and indeed Parliament called for such a directive in its resolution on the White Paper on European transport policy."
"The Commission has acknowledged for many years that inland waterways offer enormous potential for substitution, given the problems of overuse experienced by other transport sectors."
"To put it another way, inland waterways transport is frequently more economical, more reliable and more environmentally friendly than other modes of transport."
"River information services, which are based on modern information and communications technologies and which allow improvements to be made to the planning and management of traffic and transport, represent an outstanding opportunity for inland waterways."
"The services involved include the provision of information on inland waterways, conditions of navigability, the traffic situation and port and terminal capacities, as well as calamity abatement services."
"River information services allow journeys to be planned more accurately and make it easier to adapt to traffic conditions and conditions of navigability, which means that they result in reduced fuel consumption, and hence in a reduction in emissions."
"They also make it possible to monitor the transport of hazardous goods, and, as a result, to react appropriately in the event of accidents or potential damage to the environment."
"The use of information services will help to modernise the river network, as well as increasing its safety, reliability and efficiency."
"The directive serves a dual purpose."
"Firstly, it seeks to provide the governments that supply the services, the people who use them and the businesses that manufacture the relevant hardware and software with the security they need to invest in this field. Its second aim is to ensure that applications are interoperable and compatible at national and European level, and of course to ensure that continuity can be achieved with the services used by other modes of transport."
"The directive does not force private users to use river information services, but we are convinced that the benefits of these services will encourage users to take advantage of them."
"We are also convinced that businesses will perceive RIS technology as a market opportunity, and offer it at a reasonable and affordable price."
"The fact that the internal waterways sector is made up mainly of small and medium-sized enterprises makes cost a key factor, and the Commission intends to monitor developments in this area closely."
"The Council has reached a broad understanding, and I am delighted that the rapporteur and the committee responsible for the issue, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, have sought to reach agreement at first reading."
"The Council and Parliament have adopted a constructive approach that should enable us to adopt the directive without delay and to embark on the implementation of river information services."
"I should like to express my wholehearted thanks to Mrs Sommer and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for having supported this approach."
"There are three issues that are worth emphasising; the interoperability of services, deadlines for implementation and correlation tables."
"Parliament was entirely right to place particular emphasis on the interoperability of services and the compatibility of equipment, as these matters lie at the very heart of the directive, and I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for this."
"A compromise has been reached whereby a deadline of 30 months will be set for implementation, and I believe this to be a reasonable deadline."
"Turning to the correlation tables, the Commission obviously regrets the fact that the obligation to provide such tables has been included only in a recital, and not in an article."
"Yet in spite of this difference of opinion, which must be settled at institutional level, it is our opinion that we cannot risk this directive not being adopted. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to repeat that this directive will facilitate the flow of traffic on rivers, as well as making it safer and increasing its functionality."
"I believe that it is crucial for us to be able to exploit this transport and mobility potential, and this is why I should like to thank this House in advance for welcoming this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council."
". Mr President, contrary to what we hear promised in political speeches and announced in policy statements, the interests of inland navigation are often neglected in practice by politicians in many Member States."
"As Commissioner Barrot has said, it is the Commission that has focused most sharply on the potential of this mode of transport, and a few years ago now, back in September 2001, its White Paper on European transport policy for 2010 formulated the aim of reinforcing the position of inland navigation as an alternative mode of transport to which a considerable volume of road traffic could be switched."
"At the present time, however, we are very far from achieving that aim."
"Many people evidently find it difficult to recognise the real significance of inland navigation, and yet such great importance attaches to the potential role of inland waterways in the EU."
"It was therefore high time that the Commission fleshed out the statements of intent from the White Paper, which it did in May of last year in this proposal for a directive on river-traffic information services."
"It is about applications of modern information and communication technology that should make it easier in future for Member States to manage traffic flows and transport operations on inland waterways."
"The European Union has 30 000 kilometres of canals and rivers linking hundreds of major towns, cities and industrial areas."
"What we might call the core network connects the Benelux countries, France, Germany and Austria with each other."
"Despite the enormous potential of the whole network, only 7% of all inland traffic, excluding air traffic, is carried on our inland waterways – yes, only 7%!"
"On the other hand, in view of the increasing volume of traffic – which has been due in part to the welcome eastward enlargement of the EU – Europe’s roads, railways and air space have long been working close to maximum capacity."
"This makes it all the more important to promote at long last the only mode of transport that still has significant spare capacity."
"The present draft directive makes it possible to harness the potential of inland waterway transport more effectively and to include it in the intermodal transport chain."
"Let me briefly outline some of the core points of the agreement we reached at the informal trialogue."
"Besides the fact that the work already done by such recognised international organisations as the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine is to be taken into account, we have now also agreed that these organisations will continue to be involved in the establishment of the harmonised river-traffic information services."
"They can advise the RIS Committee, which will ensure that a patchwork of differing systems does not develop in the European Union."
"Commissioner Barrot has listed the potential applications of this RIS approach: fairway information, traffic information, traffic management, disaster-relief support – especially important, because we intend to include hazardous materials in the cargos shifted from roads to waterways – and information for transport management, statistics and customs and for waterway charges and port dues."
"Other service applications are possible; this list is not exhaustive."
"These types of information must be made accessible to all RIS users without discrimination."
"Besides the legitimate public interest in details such as the precise location of vessels with cargos of hazardous materials, the equally legitimate economic interests of the interested parties – cargo shippers, fleet managers, port operators, among others – must not be forgotten either."
"For this reason, we have clearly re-emphasised that data protection law does, of course, apply without exception to trade secrets such as these."
"Bearing in mind the structure of the sector, which is composed predominantly of small and medium-sized businesses, we have barred the fees charged for RIS information from exceeding the cost price, thus protecting the sector from excessive costs resulting from use of the system."
"It has to be said, though, that there was no chance whatever of getting the Council to agree to additional support for the sector, for example through supplementary aid or loans at reduced rates, which I would have thought would make perfect sense."
"That the Council should so abominate such things is extraordinary in view of the importance of this sector to so many Member States, but, as river traffic information services of this kind are needed without delay, we agreed to this compromise."
"Let me conclude by thanking the Council, the Commission, and particularly my fellow-Members the shadow rapporteurs for the cooperation between them, which has been extraordinarily good."
"I extend the warmest of thanks to them, for without the cooperation of all parties the compromise we have here would not have been possible."
"I would now like to appeal to the whole House to vote in accordance with my list of the original 34 amendments from the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and also to accept the 32 amendments tabled in the plenary, for these are the outcome of the informal trialogue, on which we have all agreed."
"As we all want to support the inland shipping sector, I think the first reading tomorrow will also be the last."
". Mr President, on behalf of my committee I would like to indicate support for the general aims of this proposal on river information services."
"I shall offer the insights gained from my own experience as an amateur rowing man and yachtsman to bear witness to the importance of information for safe and successful navigation."
"Our committee was concerned about two aspects."
"I am grateful that the Commissioner has already mentioned one of these: our concern about the interests of SMEs and the impact this measure will have on them."
"Regulation and legislation always weighs more heavily on small businesses than on large organisations."
"I am grateful for the references to this in the main body of the report."
"The second point we make concerns the general issue of comitology and the advisory committee that is proposed."
"It is very important that all those involved should be able to make some contribution to this advisory committee."
"This is a matter we have addressed in other reports on other topics in our committee and I particularly welcome the rapporteur's Amendment 29, which calls on the Commission to consult representatives of the sector regularly."
"SMEs and consulting are very important."
". Thank you, Mr President, I am delighted with the agreement at first reading on River Information Services, and on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I should also like to thank this rapporteur warmly for all her efforts and congratulate her on the result that has been achieved, for this is an important proposal for improving safety in inland navigation."
"Skippers will have extensive information at their disposal on water levels, lock levels and other sailing information across the whole of Europe, and thanks to this system, port and terminal businesses will be able to work more to their potential."
"As such, it is an important proposal to promote European inland navigation."
"I think it is important that the costs of this system, both for inland navigation and the government, should be kept down."
"The inland navigation sector consists of independent, small enterprises with limited investment capacity, which should not be forced into expensive systems when cheaper alternatives are still available on the market."
"It should be possible for skippers to use one and the same system to register with the River Traffic Information Services (RIS) in all countries, and I am pleased that this has been provided for effectively in the agreement that the rapporteur has reached on Parliament’s behalf."
"Furthermore, it is also very important that it be recognised that the systems used should be proof against leaks of all kinds of company-sensitive information."
"I would like to support the rapporteur’s result wholeheartedly, because this directive has created a framework for River Information Services."
"However, much of the technical detail is yet to be worked out before the system can actually be launched."
"I am therefore keen to endorse Mr Chichester’s appeal that this technical detailing be practical and should tie in with the skippers’ work processes."
"Consultation is necessary, and I should like to urge the Commissioner to involve the inland navigation sector in this technical process."
"Especially now that the European Union is becoming increasingly involved in European inland navigation policy, consultation with the sector is vital with regard to this directive but also in other areas."
"Can you deliver on this, Commissioner?"
"After all, successful inland navigation is essential for sustainable European transport."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for her truly excellent cooperation with us."
"Inland navigation is making headway, and RIS will do a little more to dispel the image of a romantic but outdated form of transport."
"An interoperable cross-border information and communication system will help to realise our vision of making inland navigation as strong as any other link in the transport chain."
"It would be a wise move to strengthen inland waterway transport in this way, given all the infrastructural developments that are required in other areas of the transport system."
"RIS brings added value in environmental and economic terms, while also contributing to the overall efficiency of transport policies."
"Firstly, the improvement of traffic and transport management makes it conceivable that something like the ‘just in time’ approach could be extended to supplies transported on our rivers."
"RIS provides up-to-date information that can be used in the planning of journeys and the compilation of reliable timetables."
"It will make individual transport operations safer and more efficient."
"Secondly, ports will be upgraded to intermodal interfaces."
"RIS will make it easier for port and terminal operators to maximise the use of their capacities."
"Thirdly, this directive will finally give us a standardised identification number too, a number plate for inland vessels."
"Efficient inland navigation makes such a standardised registration number necessary, since it makes vessels identifiable, makes it possible to track consignments and promotes safety."
"All of these factors will enhance the competitiveness and appeal of inland waterway transport."
"What remains to be done?"
"The real challenge lies in the interfaces."
"Ports, of course, are often focal points of economic development, but many of them are not designed and equipped for trimodal operations."
"There is a great deal to be done here."
"Further improvements are also needed in the links with short sea shipping, a very fast-growing mode of transport."
"In this case there are administrative obstacles to be removed."
"Last but not least, there is the creation and application of the European intermodal loading unit."
"As you know, we have had the first reading of that draft, and we now await the Council’s common position."
"I see this as another indispensable step towards the goal of a truly competitive intermodal transport chain."
"There is still, however, one fly in the ointment, and that is the relatively non-binding nature of this directive."
"It is for this reason that we now need to adopt without delay the various technical provisions and standards for the implementation of RIS in order to preclude the emergence of a patchwork of divergent RIS applications, if this has not already happened."
"First, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, who did a great job."
"There is one issue I would like to raise, which has already been mentioned by Commissioner Barrot."
"Over and over again, all European institutions and Member States have publicly declared that they will make every effort to improve the transparency of EU decision-making."
"That is something we in the European Parliament and, in particular the ALDE Group, fully support."
"In line with the inter-institutional agreement and a number of other action plans, the Commission decided that all its proposals for directives should contain a specific provision to make it compulsory for Member States to establish tables illustrating the correlation between the act in question and the transposition measures."
"This should include the communication of these tables to the Commission."
"However, during recent informal inter-institutional negotiations with the Dutch and Luxembourg presidencies on proposals for a Directive on River Information Services and a seafarers' certificate, it became clear that the Council is not willing to maintain that provision."
"As the Commissioner said, the Council's solution is a recital which refers to the agreement on the subject and deletes the obligation imposed on Member States in the text of the Directive itself."
"The ALDE Group is very concerned by the Council's approach, as it is not only limited to this Directive."
"Our Group therefore decided to single out this issue and to request a split vote on Amendment 53."
"I am aware that not all of you are happy about resolving this political issue with the Council through specific dossiers."
"However, I think it is time for this House to act."
"I can only hope that the other Groups make every effort to improve the transparency of EU decision-making and follow our line in this matter."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor. Above all, may I add my emphatic and sincere thanks to the rapporteur."
"The talks were conducted in a pleasant atmosphere, and the majority of the Members who examined this proposal were women, a point that is worth re-emphasising."
"We dealt with a subject that offers scope for further development, a process that is far from completed."
"We shall have to ensure that the agreed measures are actually implemented, and of course there is that fly in the ointment to which the previous speaker referred."
"There are also two key concerns on which we need to be extremely vigilant here."
"Firstly, due account must be taken of the need for interoperability, because general acceptance of this new facility and its impact depend to a great extent on its interoperability."
"If we do not manage to ensure that the interfaces between the various modes of transport actually work, we shall see very little freight haulage being shifted onto our rivers."
"The second point is that waterway vessels must be made environmentally safer."
"Much remains to be done in this respect."
"Finally, I am grateful that RIS will help to satisfy my concerns regarding the safety of waterway transport operations involving hazardous goods."
"I intend to keep my remarks brief, Mr President, but I should like to start by thanking Mrs Sommer and the Committee on Transport and Tourism once again for their outstanding work, which I hope will result in the proposal being adopted at first reading."
"The Commission should be able to agree to the compromise reached during the informal trialogue held with the Council."
"We accept the 15 amendments adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism that support the Council’s position, and we accept the 34 new amendments Mrs Sommer has tabled that reflect the compromise reached during the informal trialogue with the Council."
"I hope that the House will be able to lend its support to this approach."
"I should also like to pay tribute to Mr Chichester and to thank him, and to tell him that other interested parties cannot sit on comitology committees, as institutional comitology procedures only allow representatives of the Member States to do so."
"Nevertheless, I agree with his remarks to the effect that the Commission must ensure that industry is duly consulted before proposals are presented. This is necessary if businesses are to be able to perceive RIS technology as a market opportunity, and if they are to be able to offer it at a reasonable and affordable price."
"Like Mrs Sommer, you stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises must not be saddled with excessive costs as a result of the introduction of RIS."
"That was the point I wanted to make."
"A number of Members have stressed the need for intermodality, and they are entirely right to do so, as this is a key issue."
"If we wish to increase the use of rivers for transport purposes, we really must succeed in putting intermodality into practice."
"This will be one of the main thrusts of my work."
"I should also like to say that I agree entirely with Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert’s comments on correlation tables, and it is true that we need to act."
"The whole point of the EU is that the Member States agree to transpose directives, and, on a gradual basis, to account for the way in which they have done so."
"That said, I would warn Members against jeopardising this proposal."
"Mr President, I believe that interinstitutional dialogue will be needed in order to ensure that correlation tables become a ‘good habit’, and something we use for all texts."
"I would repeat that if this text, which Mrs Sommer very ably improved on behalf of the House and with its help, were not to be adopted without delay at first reading I would be disappointed, especially because I believe there is a real possibility that it could be."
"Mr President, I should therefore like to thank this House in advance for closely monitoring the implementation of this directive, which I hope will allow us to enhance river navigation in Europe(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0057/2004) by Mr Robert Evans, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the recognition of seafarers’ certificates issued by the Member States and amending Directive 2001/25/EC."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that certain Member States are currently experiencing a growing decline in the number of Community seafarers means that maritime know-how could be lost."
"Training for seafarers is particularly important in terms of the prevention of maritime accidents."
"What we need are ways of enhancing the profession of Community seafarer by facilitating the free movement of seafarers within the EU and by promoting excellence and quality in their training."
"The proposal before you responds to these two concerns by providing for recognition at EU level of seafarers’ certificates issued by any Member State. The goals pursued by the Commission with this directive are threefold."
"The first is that there be a prompt and efficient procedure for the recognition by Member States of seafarers’ certificates that are issued within the EU. The proposed system will put an end to the delays that are a feature of the current recognition system."
"The second goal is to ensure compliance with Community requirements relating to training, certification and watchkeeping."
"The proposal provides for full and ongoing compliance with existing training and certification standards, and the Commission will regularly evaluate maritime training and certification systems in the Member States, with the assistance of the Maritime Safety Agency."
"The third and final goal relates to the fight against fraudulent practices associated with certification. Provision has been made for additional measures to prevent and combat fraudulent practices associated with the obtaining or issuing of certificates."
"As you are aware, the Transport Council reached a broad understanding on the proposal in December 2004, and I am delighted that Parliament has made such a positive contribution on this matter."
"I am counting on the support of this House to ensure that this key text, which will facilitate the certification of seafarers from other EU Member States, is adopted without delay."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for your attention. I hope that we will be able to send out a very clear signal to our fellow citizens that in the European Union the profession of seafarer continues to be particularly attractive, and that it is a profession that young Europeans should be proud to exercise."
". Mr President, my report amends the current legislation on the recognition of seafarers' certificates, making the legislation more appropriate and ironing out the anomalies that currently exist."
"I had a number of meetings about the report with the Commission, the Netherlands and Luxembourg presidencies, Parliament's Secretariat, the United Kingdom Government and my colleagues, and I am grateful to everyone for their contributions."
"I can confirm that the Council has given me an understanding, in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, that if we vote according to plan tomorrow, we can adopt this without further ado."
"The starting point of this legislation is safety."
"The safety and security of seafarers is important not just for those involved in the industry, but also for consumers, whether they are travellers on ships or buy the products of the sea."
"As the Commissioner said, the maritime industry is in general decline."
"Going to sea is no longer the attractive career that it might have been."
"The decline of the shipping and fishing industries means that wages are usually low and opportunities are few."
"Against this there will still always be a demand for travel by sea, both for industry and passengers."
"In spite of diminishing fish stocks in the waters, there will always be a demand for fish."
"Therefore the industry will always need workers."
"However, as Mr Barrot has said, there is a shortage of workers at the moment."
"As countries and companies strive to balance supply and demand with regard to ship crews, the role of the European Union becomes more important."
"We need to provide for a common European system of freedom of movement."
"The current lack of availability of local staff means there is a vacuum which, as in other industries, will be filled by migrant labour."
"These workers need protection and standards that are equal to those enjoyed by existing workers."
"My report is a timely measure, updating the existing European directive that dates from 2001."
"It aims to reduce the current administrative burden, combat discrimination and promote the mobility of workers in the maritime sector."
"European rules should, as far as possible, be in line with existing international agreements."
"In this case, the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers Convention gets rid of European red tape."
"This has been an important point and one that the trialogue has shared as a joint objective, which is how we have been able to reach this informal agreement before the debate."
"The training and certification requirements for seafarers are laid down by the International Maritime Organization, which also contains agreements on the recognition of certificates."
"At the moment, the system of recognition for certificates from third countries has been simplified, which leads to a rather unsatisfactory situation in which it is easier and simpler to get recognition for certificates from outside the European Union than it is to get recognition for certificates from within the European Union."
"This is discriminatory, restricts the free movement of seafarers and is an anomaly which needs to be removed, especially as we are dealing with a diminishing number of workers."
"I would like to stress, however, that the mere possession of a certificate of any sort does not in itself give a guarantee of employment, no more than a driving licence gives you the right to a job as a driver."
"On language proficiency, which has been a thorny issue, we have agreed that a satisfactory command of language is necessary."
"In this case, English is the language involved."
"This will also apply to workers from third countries who might be affected by accidents if no provision for language proficiency was established."
"The prevention of fraud is a very important issue."
"All 25 Member States will be required to pursue their efforts in the context of the IMO towards the worldwide combating of fraud so as to ensure that safety standards are as high as possible."
"It is beholden on all of us to get our own fleets and regulatory processes in order, to ensure high standards throughout the IMO."
"Finally, my report states that the Commission should prepare an evaluation report after five years."
"We heard in an earlier report of shipwrecks off the European coast, and the European Parliament has repeatedly put safety at the top of its agenda."
"We will be setting high standards on safety, high standards for workers and for certification."
"I am sure my colleagues will be able to support this report in the vote tomorrow."
". Mr President, I would like to begin, in particular, by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Evans, on his magnificent work and in particular on the consensus reached both with the Council and with the Commission."
"I would also like to thank the Commission and the Commissioner for their dedication and commitment to combating fraud in relation to certificates issued to seafarers."
"As you are well aware, in order to speed up this report, it was decided to bring together the Council and the Commission with a view to presenting an agreed draft."
"Both institutions have made interesting and enriching contributions and there was no great disagreement between the parties during the debate, and agreement prevailed at all times."
"We can state that, following months of hard work, the proposal, which falls within the framework of the conventions of the International Maritime Organisation, will be one of the regulations that makes the greatest contribution to combating fraud in relation to certifications."
"As a result of my special relationship with the Balearic Islands, in Spain, I must express my personal satisfaction at the adoption of these measures, which will contribute to guaranteeing the safety and lives of seafarers, and also to protecting the marine environment."
"The islands require special attention in the field of maritime protection since they receive a large amount of merchant sea traffic."
"As a result of this experience — and this is why I am telling you about it — I know that the work of Mr Evans has not been insignificant."
"Amongst all of us, we have now increased the quality and quantity of work for our seafarers and, above all, we have safeguarded their reputation in society, which on occasions has been damaged by past cases of fraud."
". Mr President, I should like to start by extending my sincere thanks to Mr Evans and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as they have not only lent their support to the Commission proposal, but also improved it."
"I believe that the comments made a short time ago by Mr López-Istúriz White are ample proof that the image of seafarers needs to be boosted in order to ensure that young people view this splendid profession as an attractive option."
"It is paradoxical that the maritime industry is in decline even though enormous potential exists in Europe for transport by sea."
"It is therefore absolutely essential to improve training for seafarers, and to eliminate the existing shortcomings in order to attract enough young Europeans into these professions."
"As Mr Evans mentioned, free movement and the recognition of certificates will be additional tools to help us achieve this goal."
"The proposed amendments further the Commission’s goals."
"As I just said, any measures that promote the free movement of seafarers, as well as any measures that make it possible to carry out strict checks on existing rules and to combat illegal practices associated with seafarers’ certificates, are steps in the right direction."
"The amendments seek to make the proposal clearer, whilst complying with the Council’s broad approach."
"I can therefore tell you, Mr Evans, that the Commission accepts all of Parliament’s amendments."
"I should like to draw your attention to Amendment 32, however, which does away with the need to issue correlation tables listing the national measures implementing the directive, and adds a recital in its place."
"This position is in line with the approach taken by the Council, yet in view of my earlier comments I am sure that you will understand my misgivings."
"Although I am delighted that Parliament and the Council have decided to put forward similar texts in order to reach agreement at first reading, that does not mean that we should forget that correlation tables are needed for better lawmaking."
"As I said with regard to the previous text, Mr President, we must reach an interinstitutional agreement in order to implement this provision, as it will make it easier to apply anything that is decided by your Parliament, in agreement with the Council."
"The Commission will issue a declaration to this effect when the directive is finally adopted."
"I am counting on Parliament’s support for this key text, which will promote the free movement of seafarers between Member States, and which I hope will give rise to fresh enthusiasm for this much-needed profession(1)."
"Commissioner, the House would like to thank you for having joined it at the helm of this particular ship."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0022/2005) by Mrs Elspeth Attwooll, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the Common Fisheries Policy."
". Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable Member for her report on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy."
"The Commission views the establishment of the agency as a crucial element in the implementation of the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"You will recall that the creation of this agency is a clear signal that more uniform and effective enforcement of the rules is a priority for the reformed common fisheries policy."
"We believe that a well-functioning agency will be critical not only in enhancing the control capacity of Member States but also in further committing ourselves to combating illegal fishing."
"In addition, it is our firm belief that, as our control capabilities are enhanced, so too is the reliability of the data that is available to scientists, thus contributing to sounder scientific advice on which to base our policy for sustainable fisheries."
"It is for this reason that the Commission is committed to an effective and reliable agency."
"On an operational level, we see the agency as a means of strengthening the tools and methods of control undertaken by Member States."
"The Commission is very pleased with the close cooperation it has had with the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Fisheries during our work on this important proposal."
"I am happy to be able to inform you that we accept more than half of the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries which greatly reinforce our proposal and which we will readily defend in the Council."
"Let me now turn to the amendments proposed in the report before us."
"The Commission can accept Amendment 1."
"The Commission has difficulty in accepting Amendment 2."
"It is not advisable to prioritise tasks in the regulation since priorities may change in future years as a result of tasks fulfilled and objectives attained."
"The Commission does, however, note the merit in including controls of illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries in the work programme of the agency."
"The Commission can accept Amendment 3."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 4, 25 and 27."
"Voting arrangements must take into account the specific characteristics of this body, which is charged with control tasks."
"The proposal is based on the need to strike a balance between the part played by the Member States and the necessity at Commission level to ensure that the agency develops in conformity with the stated objectives of the common fisheries policy."
"The Commission has difficulty in accepting Amendment 5."
"It involves an increase in the scope of the agency into areas beyond its inspection and control remit."
"The Commission is convinced that the scope of its proposal is adequate as it stands and should remain focused on its core tasks – that is, those of control and inspection."
"Research activities directly related to control can, of course, be considered."
"The Commission can accept Amendment 6."
"As far as Amendment 7 is concerned, the Commission has difficulty in accepting the substance of this amendment as currently worded."
"It is too restrictive in that not all fisheries agreements currently include an enforcement arrangement."
"Although the Commission cannot accept Amendment 8, the scope of the agency can, of course, include the control of vessels involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing as long as it is within the framework of schemes adopted by regional fisheries organisations."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13."
"However, the Commission has a difficulty with Amendment 14 concerning the provision of information on the applicability and cost-effectiveness of the rules of the common fisheries policy with regard to control and inspection, since it would substantially modify the mission and tasks of the agency."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 15 since Article 7 refers only to the obligations of Member States."
"It should be noted, however, that the Commission has a right to request that the agency provide services relating to the obligations of the Community under Article 5 of the proposal."
"I can certainly agree to the important role that the agency will play in training; however, I have difficulty in accepting Amendment 16 since the agency should not be obliged to create a training centre."
"Member States may, for practical and operational reasons, prefer to have training courses and seminars provided locally."
"The remit of the agency should not lead to a curtailment of this eventuality."
"The Commission can accept Amendment 17."
"As for Amendment 18, the Commission has difficulty in accepting the substance of the amendment as currently worded."
"The suggested role of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA) cannot be accepted, as it would put this body, which is of an advisory character only, in a position that is similar to those of the Community institutions such as the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Therefore, as much as the Commission welcomes those proposals by which Parliament can be better informed about the works of the agency, it is not in favour of giving the same standing to advisory bodies such as ACFA and the RACs."
"For the same reason the Commission cannot accept Amendments 22, 42 and 43."
"While the Commission cannot accept Amendment 19, it accepts that there is a need to amend the text of the second recital so that it refers to activities both within Community waters and outside Community waters."
"The Commission has no comment to make on Amendment 20 as the location of the agency falls within the competence of the Spanish authorities."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 21."
"The Commission has difficulty with Amendments 23 and 24."
"Firstly, ACFA is an advisory body and should not be involved in management."
"Secondly, concerning the appointment of the fishing industry representatives, the Commission proposal follows the pattern of other agencies wherever stakeholder representatives are present in administrative boards."
"In such cases it is usually the Commission that nominates the representatives of the sector."
"The Commission has difficulty in accepting Amendment 26 as the administrative board must be able to examine specific items on its agenda without the presence of industry representatives where there is an issue of confidentiality or conflict of interest."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 28, 29, 30 and 31."
"The Commission has difficulty with Amendment 32."
"The Commission believes that it is in the Community interest that it retains the power to propose the dismissal of the executive director and that this should be on the basis of a simple majority; otherwise, the position of the Commission is weakened."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 33 as it is felt that three years is too short a period within which to have an external evaluation."
"The Commission has difficulty in accepting Amendment 34 as the text of the Commission proposal is consistent with standard agreed drafting rules whereas the amendment is not."
"While the Commission understands the principle of Amendment 35, it cannot accept it since it would be contentious and difficult to implement in practice."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 36, 38, 39, 40 and 41."
"They have the effect of weakening the proposal."
"As I said at the outset, we must succeed in establishing a fisheries control agency that is effective and that can function well."
"In any case, I understand that the Committee on Fisheries voted against similar amendments at its meeting of 2 February."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 37 – as I have stated previously, RACs have an advisory role and should not be involved in management."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Fisheries warmly welcomes the proposal to establish a Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"We believe that it can make a major contribution to the uniform and cost-effective implementation of control and inspection programmes."
"In the view of the committee, the Agency should also play a significant role in the fight against illegal unreported and unregulated fishing, including in appropriate circumstances its occurrence outside Community waters."
"Other amendments seek to establish that the Agency can provide appropriate information and assistance to the Commission and to Member States, for example in relation to health and safety at work, the development of technical inspection solutions and the cost-effectiveness of the common fisheries policy rules on control and inspection."
"The committee also, as the Commissioner has mentioned, calls for the Agency to be able to establish a training centre for inspectors, rather than just develop a core curriculum."
"Where the report differs significantly from the Commission proposal is in the belief that the fishing industry, not the Commission, should nominate its own representatives to the administrative board and that these representatives should have the right to vote."
"I turn now to the amendments tabled by the ALDE Group."
"Two concern the role of regional advisory councils."
"We believe that there is merit in their being consulted in the course of drafting joint deployment plans, and certainly that they should be informed of the Agency's assessment of the effectiveness of such plans."
"The remaining amendments centre on joint deployment plans."
"This, Commissioner, is not an attempt to weaken the proposal."
"There appear to be differing interpretations of what is meant by operational coordination."
"On one interpretation the Agency will be concerned only with providing for the practical deployment of resources which have already been committed by Member States and ensuring that these resources are actually deployed in the manner determined by the plan."
"This seems to be the model envisaged by the Commission in the flow chart that it provided."
"Unfortunately, this model is not adequately reflected in the current wording of Article 12, nor does it square with Article 11(1)(b) of the proposal which, and I quote: 'gives the Agency power to identify the means of control and inspection to be pooled according to the criteria in Article 11(2)'."
"Similarly, Article 13 specifies that Member States, and I quote again: 'shall commit and make available those means of control and inspection that are identified in the joint deployment plan'."
"This is a much more extensive interpretation of the tasks involved in operational coordination and from reading the Commission's flow chart, although not the legal text, it appears to result in considerable control over the actual commitment of resources being placed in the hands of the Agency's executive director alone."
"The ALDE Group amendments are designed to reconcile these differing interpretations and to ensure that the rules and the practice march hand in hand."
"I hope very much that Parliament will accept the amendments but whether it does or not I believe that the Commission and the Council will themselves have to find a means of resolving these issues."
"I wish to reassure my colleagues again that I am not engaged in any kind of subversive activity."
"Indeed, I actually favour the more extensive interpretation of operational coordination, subject to the appropriate safeguards."
"My fundamental concern is that bad law will not make for a good Agency."
"For this reason, I shall be recommending to my own Group that we abstain on the report unless Amendments 38 and 39 at least are passed, although we shall of course support the legislative resolution."
". Mr President, I thank you, and also the rapporteur for her efforts."
"It may be symbolic that after the ‘yes’ for the Constitution in Spain, the Fisheries Control Agency will be based in Vigo, which appears to me to be a just reward, given also the major political efforts made by our fellow MEPs to achieve this positive outcome with regard to the Constitution."
"At the same time, I am somewhat disappointed with the response from the Commissioner, who claimed that many of the amendments that the Committee on Fisheries had approved were either unacceptable or impractical."
"I do think that the Commissioner lacks a certain degree of ambition in those areas."
"If I apply this to the Constitution, if this report were to be discussed in five years’ time, it would not be so easy for the Commission to get away with saying that this is unacceptable or impractical."
"In that respect, it would be good if the Commissioner were to display a little more ambition, also with regard to the implementation of the amendments, including those tabled by my group."
"One of my group’s key concerns is that we have noticed that in the whole of fisheries policy, there is a growing lack of trust between the fisheries sector and Brussels."
"This gap must be closed, and the sector’s own commitment and contribution, as well as those of the fisheries organisations in the board of this Fisheries Control Agency, could very well help close that gap between the European Union and the fisheries sector."
"There are, outside the European Union, fine examples of how things do work well."
"Just look at Iceland or Norway, where the fisheries sector has more influence on policy and is more involved in it being adopted and controlled effectively."
"In that respect, the Commission could display slightly more ambition and show more understanding, including for the PPE-DE Group’s commitment to closing that gap."
"Once again, I would urge the Commissioner to act as if the new Constitution were already in place and also to take Parliament’s commitment more seriously."
"Then I am convinced that the new Commissioner and the new Agency will as yet find their feet."
"Mr President, control is already an important component of the common fisheries policy, and it will become even more so in the future."
"It has been and remains a priority aim of this House to make controls more effective in the fisheries sector."
"For this reason, we support the proposal for the establishment of a European Fisheries Control Agency."
"There are, however, wide disparities between the various fishing regions in the European Union."
"We therefore believe it would be wise to ensure that the organisational structure of the agency takes account of regional differences."
"The common fisheries policy has undergone further development over the past few years, but the international obligations of the European Union with regard to fisheries remain a major element of the CFP."
"All of this requires not only effective but also uniform control procedures or coordination of control activities, as appropriate."
"The establishment of a European control agency should guarantee this."
"The aim must be the improvement of national control structures, with the Member States continuing to determine how they use their own control instruments."
"We assume that the establishment of organisational structures at the Community level could result in more consistent compliance with existing statutory provisions."
"In our view, some of the rapporteur’s amendments do not contribute to the pursuit of these aims and are too broad in their scope."
"The competence of the agency must remain clearly visible."
"For this reason we are opposed to the inclusion of regional advisory councils in the organisational structure."
"Although the rapporteur has done a very good job, we are unable to support amendments that would take us down that road."
". Mr President, around the world, fish conservation is only effective when it is under national control."
"I have spoken to dozens of fishermen in Devon and Cornwall who know precisely how to conserve fish stocks, but nobody ever asks for their advice."
"I suggest that the current common fisheries policy, with its totally unworkable quota system designed by office-bound bureaucrats, should be scrapped immediately and replaced by a new fisheries policy designed by the fishermen themselves."
"The problem for Britain has been the strict enforcement of the CFP to the nth degree, first of all by MAFF and then by Defra."
"One example was their insistence that a fisherman called Ken Bagley – whom I happen to know very well – should rub his thumb on the underbellies of five tonnes of sprats to ensure that there were no immature herrings in the catch."
"In the UK we say 'it takes a sprat to catch a mackerel'."
"Perhaps we should be saying 'it takes a sprat to catch a herring'!"
"Little wonder that Britain's GDP for fishing has gone down from GBP 561 million in 1964 to GBP 520 million in 2003, despite inflation."
"In Norway, which controls its own fisheries policy, the figures have increased from NOK 7.5 billion to NOK 10.1 billion over the same period."
"The environmental crisis in the North Sea is man-made."
"It is a classic stratagem of the European Commission to exploit such a crisis in the cause of closer European integration."
"This is known as a beneficial crisis."
"Europe's solution to something which is not working is to put even more Europe into it, thus a new fisheries agency is created, based in Vigo, Spain."
"Surprise, surprise!"
"In future, British fishing boats will be policed in our own territorial waters by patrol boats operating under the control of this new agency and sent out on the authority of the EU's inspectorate based in Madrid."
"Poor old Francis Drake must be turning in his grave."
"Perhaps we should get ready to light the beacons!"
"Mr President, to believe in a Community fisheries control agency, one has to believe in the common fisheries policy."
"Northern Ireland's experiences of it have been dire."
"Courtesy of the CFP, we have seen our fishing fleet drastically reduced by over-regulation and punitive closures."
"I cannot support the common fisheries policy, and therefore I will not support a Community control agency."
"In my view, fishing is properly a matter for national control, not EU control."
"Therefore all inspection mechanisms should be initiated and operated nationally."
"This agency, alas, is but another part of the empire-building that Brussels so readily takes upon itself."
"Faced with the probable reality of the Community fisheries control agency, I will use my vote in this House, as I did in committee, to seek to restrict its ambit and enhance national input."
"Commissioner, I, on the other hand, do support and applaud the creation of the Fisheries Control Agency and I would therefore simply ask that it become operational as soon as possible."
"Furthermore, the amendments introduced by the Committee on Fisheries considerably improve and supplement both the Commission’s initial proposal and the rapporteur’s report in terms of the genuine responsibilities the Agency should have and without prejudice to the competences that currently fall to the Member States."
"This report confirms my conviction that it is not possible to have sustainable resources and restructure fishing practices unless the control policy is dealt with in an honest and unhypocritical way and, unfortunately, this proposal has once again highlighted that some of the countries that talk most about control are then the most reticent, rejecting serious and effective proposals."
"This Agency is a step in the right direction in terms of increasing the prominence of those attitudes and, although there is still much to be done, in particular, in relation to the transparency of the criteria for inspections by Member States and European harmonisation on legislation and penalties, having it will be the best guarantee that this can be resolved in the near future."
"The Committee on Fisheries has also improved the way the proposal treated the sector and in that regard, Commissioner, I do not agree that the Commission should not accept the proposals, because the sector is given a genuine voice and representation in an area that affects it so much and in which it would be crazy not to have its support, and the responsibilities of the Agency have been increased in order to try to make the Commission take its responsibilities seriously in relation to non-declared and non-regulated illegal fishing once and for all."
"I would also like to acknowledge the efforts the rapporteur has made in order to seek areas of compromise, and I would like to end by expressing my pleasure at the fact that this Agency is going to be based in Spain, in the city of Vigo, a city which is so significant in terms of world fishing."
"Mr President, I hope that the amendment establishing the Agency in Vigo is one of the long list of amendments the Commissioner has mentioned, since I was one of the people who proposed that city for its headquarters."
"Commissioner, I believe that the role of the Committee on Fisheries has been very evident during the work on this report, both that of the rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, who has worked extremely hard and who I believe has done laudable work and, from what I know is an entirely Europeanist point of view, that of those of us who have tried to amend her report in the best possible spirit from two points of view."
"On the one hand, our committee has worked quickly so that the Agency can be set up and become operational as soon as possible and, furthermore, it has tried to improve the text of the Commission’s proposal, because it is true that we have always believed that the initial proposal, which was not yours but which was from the European Commission, was too modest, and our amendments have sought to resolve that."
"It is true that this Agency is the first to be created with exclusively fisheries responsibilities and we have therefore looked at other agencies which perhaps were also set up with rather modest roles but which nevertheless were soon required to play increasingly significant roles."
"I am thinking, for example, of the European Maritime Safety Agency."
"Extending its responsibilities, Commissioner, and please do not forget this, would help to endear it to the fisheries sector."
"Because it is true that the proposal to create it stems from the debates on the reform of the common fisheries policy as a method for improving coordination between Member States on certain very specific monitoring and control aspects, but it remains the case that our intention is to extend those competences so that, furthermore, the Member States and the Commission can receive technical and scientific assistance to help them in the correct application of the common fisheries policy rules."
"Mr President, I am sure that by now Commissioner Borg will have come to recognise the uncertain pleasure of addressing an empty House on the subject of fisheries late on a Tuesday evening, but at least he has the privilege of talking for more than two minutes."
"It was also refreshing to hear Commissioner Borg say that he could accept almost half of the committee's amendments."
"That must be without precedent in the last decade of statements from fisheries Commissioners."
"My party, the UK Conservative Party, has a manifesto commitment to withdrawing Britain from the CFP and restoring fisheries management to national and local control."
"Nevertheless, I recognise that even in circumstances in which Britain is no longer a participating member of the CFP, we will still have many vessels fishing outwith the UK 200-mile limit and in EU and international waters."
"In these circumstances, and accepting that this proposal is a , it is therefore important that we support a workable proposal for the creation of an EU fisheries control agency."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the great work she has done on this report."
"There is no doubt that the different approach to fisheries control in different Member States has caused widespread ill-feeling in the past."
"I have often heard fishermen in Scotland saying that fishermen in Spain get off far too lightly."
"Then you go to Spain and hear fishermen there saying that fishermen in Scotland get off too lightly, so we clearly need a level playing field."
"There is also a need for the even-handed application of the rules."
"The Commission's proposals seek to achieve that objective."
"I believe, however, that we should try not to gild the lily by embellishing the Commission's plans with amendments which vest even more power in the new agency."
"On that basis, I am alarmed that the Commission has rejected the consultation of regional advisory councils, which form a very important pillar in CFP reform and give meaningful stakeholder involvement to fishermen, scientists and others involved in the industry. I hope the Commission will reconsider that."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to join in the words of congratulation for Mrs Attwooll on her excellent report."
"As Mr Kindermann has said, we do have our differences of opinion, but the quality of this report should certainly be highlighted."
"I should like to start by pointing out that there are now electronic devices that make it possible effectively to control the entire Community fleet and to provide rapid access to scientific data that is extremely important to sustainable fishing."
"It is for this very reason that I find it utterly incomprehensible that although we have an exclusive power that the Committee on Fisheries rightly called anomalous and unjustified, there is a failure by the Community to exercise any concrete power, particularly in areas where it is most needed and it would be most effective, which is in this field of remote control."
"In connection with this, I should like to raise the following points."
"Firstly, it is obviously to be welcomed, as has been said by many of the Members of this House, but welcomed from an operational point of view; in other words, it should become an operational instrument and not merely a paper factory and a way of keeping the bureaucratic world ticking over, resolving nothing and doing nothing."
"My second major concern is that this agency should not mean that Community policies are at the mercy of power play and vested interests, because the outright losers in such situations tend to be the smallest regions, along with sustainable fishing itself."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was the European Council of December 2003 that, on the proposal of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, took the initiative to create a European Fisheries Agency."
"It was a good idea."
"The European Commission presented a proposal which clearly needed improving."
"Our committee produced a draft report which also clearly needed improving."
"We can therefore say that the draft now being presented to Parliament is considerably better than the initial drafts."
"Of the substantial improvements, I would emphasise the inclusion of the sector with full rights of participation, the extension of the competences to IUU fishing and the inclusion of training responsibilities."
"Nevertheless, I regret that the competences only include researching and developing technical solutions in relation to control and inspection, and that the Socialist Group has opposed amendments aimed at giving the Agency genuine competences in the field of scientific fisheries research which could contribute to improving the reports on the basis of which the Commission produces its legislative proposals on technical measures, the conservation of resources, TACs and quotas, since that would mean that the Agency and its experts would participate more actively in the common fisheries policy, thereby giving it greater credibility in the eyes of the fisheries sector."
"The Agency was strengthened as a result of the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries and I hope that it will be strengthened tomorrow in Parliament, although not in the way I would have liked."
"I trust that the Council can improve the situation."
"Mr President, I am sure we can all agree that the establishment of a Community fisheries control agency should be welcomed in principle."
"We hear a lot about the importance of having a level playing field for the application of rules under the common fisheries policy."
"The creation of the agency in Vigo has the potential to help create more uniform, more effective control and inspection procedures and so increase compliance."
"It might also reduce overall expenditure on control and inspection measures."
"A feasibility study published after the drafting of the regulation suggested that such potential will only be fulfilled if certain organisational and operational criteria are met."
"This led the rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, to propose a number of amendments clarifying the text."
"Many members of the Committee on Fisheries argued that the rapporteur's amendments watered down the role of the agency."
"I disagreed with this and supported the draft report in committee."
"The draft report seemed, to me, to clarify the role and responsibility of the Member States, the Commission and the agency and to improve regional involvement."
"Joint deployment plans, involving a pooling by Member States of their inspection and control resources are crucial to the success of the agency's work."
"The amendment retabled by the rapporteur aimed to make sure that the role of the agency as a facilitator is clear."
"I have consistently supported a meaningful role for regional advisory councils in fisheries management."
"For this reason I believe it would also be appropriate for RACs to be consulted during the drafting of joint deployment plans."
"That would help ensure compliance."
"Information about the activities of the agency should be widely circulated and an annual assessment given to the European Parliament, the Commission, the Member States, the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture and the regional advisory councils."
"I have had some differences with PSE Group colleagues in defining the role of the agency, but I can certainly join with them in welcoming its creation and looking forward to more effective compliance in our fisheries."
". Mr President, in my concluding remarks I shall try to reply very briefly to all the speeches made."
"In reply to the rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, I repeat that, with regard to illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, it is important to have these in the work programme, but the Commission does not agree that they should be indicated as a priority task since priorities can change and, therefore, it would be an unnecessary curtailment of the priorities with regard to the agency's functions."
"As regards the agency having the remit to set up a training centre: again, the Commission does not believe that this function should be centralised in the hands of the agency, but that there should be flexibility and it should be retained as it is."
"We consider the changes to the wording – I am referring here to Amendments 36, 38, 39, 40 and 41, from 'preparing', for example, to 'drafting', working 'through its executive director' or the need for 'the endorsement of Member States' and the change from 'instructions' to 'operational guidance' – as a weakening of the text, in spite of the good intentions of Mrs Attwooll."
"Accepting Amendment 39, for example, would lead to an intergovernmental process."
"Let me turn to the comments made by Mr Maat."
"The five-year period is necessary as the Commission considers that three years is too short a period in which to carry out the necessary evaluation."
"On the lack of trust between representatives of the fishery industry and the Commission, I would like to say here that the Fisheries Control Agency is a start."
"As regards the composition of the administrative board and its functions – here we are speaking of control and not simple administration – the fishing industry is a stakeholder and, therefore, giving it voting rights would make it, so to speak, ."
"With regard to the comment made by Mr Kindermann– if I understood him correctly – that the competence of the agency must remain clear and that, therefore, RACs should not be included, the Commission agrees with this position."
"As regards the comments made by Mr Booth and Mr Allister with regard to the present CFP, that it should be scrapped and that the new policy designed by fishermen, in other words, the nationalisation of the fisheries policy: my own comment is that this is a much wider debate and, therefore, goes beyond the scope of this proposal."
"Mr Allister again made the same comments as Mr Booth."
"As regards the comments by Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mrs Miguélez Ramos that the amendments improved the thrust of the proposal: a number of them do, as I said, and in fact we were in a position to accept over half of them."
"As regards the others, the Commission's view is that they do not, because they tend to go beyond the scope of the proposal and of the agency, or else destroy the necessary balance of the control mechanism."
"As regards the points regarding the industry, again I refer to what I have just said with regard to the comments made by Mr Maat."
"Concerning Mr Stevenson, who is willing to support a workable proposal, the Commission, with the amendments accepted by it, attains exactly this."
"The Commission rejects obligatory consultation of RACs because the RACs have, so far at least, an advisory and not a management role."
"As regards Mr Casaca's point that this has to be a real control agency and not another bureaucracy: the Commission agrees, and the proposal tries to give an effective role to the agency."
"Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna said that a list of competences is not enough: this is noted."
"At this juncture I can say that not mentioning a specific technological development, for example, that could be used for control purposes does not mean that such would not be possible."
"With regard to Mrs Stihler's point on the watering down or otherwise, I can only repeat what I said to Mrs Attwooll."
"As regards the RACs, I would not exclude voluntary consultation of RACs and redrafting the deployment plans, but I would not advise an obligatory inclusion of consultation of RACs, at least at this juncture."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the oral question (O-0005/2005 - B6-0010/2005) to the Commission on the International Plan of Action on by-catch reduction."
"Commissioner, the debate that has just been held will have given you some indication of the keen interest my fellow Members and I have in the credibility of the common fisheries policy, whether this interest stems from a desire to strengthen it or, as in the case of a number of Members, to do quite the contrary, namely to challenge it."
"One of the arguments we hear put forward most frequently by those who challenge the need for a common fisheries policy relates to the volume of fish which the existing regulations encourage EU fishermen to discard, and which will not survive their capture anyway most of the time."
"As you are well aware, this problem has been a source of concern to our committee for many years, and has prompted your Commission, with our agreement, to arrange for several hundred studies to be carried out, with the aim of finding a solution if possible."
"It is also the reason behind my oral question to you, which I ask on behalf of the committee that I have the honour of chairing."
"As I stated in the question, by-catch is a global problem and remains one of the principal fisheries issues not to be addressed at present by an International Plan of Action by the FAO or by any other body."
"There is an urgent need to adopt an International Plan of Action on by-catch reduction, which could play a pivotal role in reducing by-catch internationally."
"A great many leading marine scientists and NGOs advocate the adoption of such a plan, and several member nations of the FAO have already committed to supporting such a proposal at the next meeting of the FAO Committee on Fisheries in March 2005."
"As yet, no nation has pledged to take a lead in proposing this initiative."
"Given that the European Union is a major fishing power, is the European Commission therefore committed to taking a lead in proposing an International Plan of Action on by-catch reduction?"
"Does the Commission recognise that if an International Plan of Action is not put on the FAO agenda in 2005, it will be necessary to wait for the next session in 2007?"
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for having agreed to be present to answer both this question and the other questions my fellow Members will ask."
". I thank Chairman Morillon and the Fisheries Committee for bringing this matter up for debate."
"It is fitting that we have an exchange of views in Plenary in advance of the opening of the FAO Committee on Fisheries, which is meeting on 7 March."
"I note that this issue has already been raised in the question submitted by Mrs Attwooll and Mr Davies on behalf of the ALDE Group, to which a written response has been provided, and that I have had the opportunity of replying to a recent letter from Mrs Attwooll in the same vein."
"I would like to reiterate that I share your concerns on the severity of the by-catch problem and on the need to take action, both at Community and international level, to address it."
"There is already a considerable on specific by-catch issues dealt with in various international agreements and other instruments, including standing international action plans."
"The Community contributes actively to the development and implementation of this , which particularly concerns species that are caught in the course of fishing operations, such as seabirds, sharks, marine mammals and sea turtles."
"However, I agree with you that to reduce by-catch and discards of non-target species, there is considerable room for improved international co-operation, and the figures mentioned illustrate the magnitude of the problem and the urgency with which the matter should be considered."
"Within the scope of its powers, the Community is already taking action under the common fisheries policy on a number of fronts."
"Specific measures were reported in the Commission’s reply to the written question submitted by Mr Davies in November 2003 on the by-catch associated with shrimp fisheries."
"These include: the Action Plan on discards; financial incentives for the use of selective fishing gear under Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999; a specific three-year research project under the 6th Framework Programme to develop low-impact, species-selective fishing gears, and to formulate alternative fishing tactics; the setting of by-catch quotas in bilateral fisheries partnership agreements; the obligations to monitor discards for specific stocks set forth in the Data Collection Regulation."
"Regular efforts are also made to integrate by-catch reduction measures in Community regulations establishing fishing limits through TACs, effort limitations and technical measures."
"The Commission is thus convinced of the need to promote a global, comprehensive strategy to deal with the problems posed by by-catch and discards, since such an analysis lies at the core of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management."
"It is important that an internationally agreed set of principles is established that should not only build on the existing international , but go on to integrate and further develop the ecosystem approach in worldwide fisheries management."
"Therefore, the Commission is ready to support the development of an international action plan on by-catch and will seek Member States' agreement to convey this position to the FAO and its members during the forthcoming Committee on Fisheries (COFI) meeting, in particular at the time that COFI’s work programme in the short and medium term is discussed."
"The Commission would be prepared to take the lead in the formulation and development of such an initiative if the necessary extra resources required to tackle such a work-intensive task can be made available to it."
". Mr President, few things have come to symbolise the failure of the common fisheries policy more than the spectacle of by-catch."
"As we see from this oral question, the situation is not unique to the EU."
"It is a worldwide problem and the Commission can offer leadership on the issue by proposing an international plan of action."
"I am delighted that this evening the Commissioner has said that he is willing to do that."
"First, we need to take action within the EU."
"It is estimated that fishermen discard up to 2 million tonnes of dead fish into the sea every year within EU waters as a result of high grading or simply because the fish are undersized or out of quota."
"We have forced fishermen into this destructive and unsustainable behaviour in the name of conservation, so one of the first policies we have to pursue is to insist on all fish being landed."
"There should be tough penalties for anyone caught discarding fish."
"This is the policy in Iceland, Norway and the Faroes."
"By insisting on everything being landed, the scientists get a much more accurate picture of the size and nature of the catch, enabling more accurate stock recovery measures to be put in place and more rapid action to be taken to close areas where juveniles are being caught."
"I am well aware that to implement such a dramatic reversal of policy will require sticks and carrots: sticks to hit those who offend and continue to dump dead fish, but carrots by way of financial compensation to the fishermen who land fish they would otherwise have thrown over the side."
"The Commission should not panic: it will not have to pay."
"The fishmeal and fish oil industry are desperate for more raw material."
"I hope that the unjustified ban on feeding fishmeal to ruminants will soon be lifted, thereby increasing demand."
"The expanding aquaculture industry is also a major user of fishmeal, so the fishmeal industry will be happy to pay for this material at prices of perhaps up to EUR 70 per tonne. I understand the Commission is keen on this idea and has already identified two trawlers to try out the policy."
"I applaud Commissioner Borg for this initiative."
". Mr President, scientists publish figures on a regular basis showing that the world's fish stocks are at risk and that currently popular fish stocks may face extinction unless drastic action is taken to allow stocks to recover."
"In the context of declining fish stocks, the problem of by-catch is all the more regrettable."
"According to the most recent figures from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 7.3 million tonnes of non-target marine species are discarded globally each year as a result of unselective fishing practices."
"This figure is truly shocking, and is not far below the EU 15's entire landed fish production in 2002-2003."
"Discarding fish has various consequences: biological consequences because the majority are dead or moribund; and economic consequences because small fish produce less profit if sold, and no profit at all if they are discarded and therefore never grow because they are dead."
"In stock assessment and fisheries management, where discards are an unknown quantity, fishing mortality rates are also unknown quantities."
"In 2003 the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report, drafted by Nils Busk, on the Commission action plan to reduce fish discards."
"The report made many useful suggestions to improve on the Commission's strategy for dealing with the problem of discards."
"These included calling for adequate data collection to obtain a better, more precise picture of the extent of the problem; finding ways of rewarding those fleets employing more selective fishing gear, resulting in lower discards; and monitoring research findings on alternative fishing gear with a view to improving technical measures such as net mesh sizes and windows."
"It also asked the Commission to examine how regional advisory councils might be involved."
"I welcome the initiatives taken by the Commission on technical measures in recent years."
"Over the past 10 years the EU budget has contributed EUR 8 million annually to over 400 research projects aimed at increasing gear selectivity, reducing discards or quantifying the impact of fishing on the environment."
"It is vital that the focus now shifts to by-catch reduction measures."
"I believe the Commission recognises that by-catch is a global problem."
"The next meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organization's committee on fisheries in March 2005 offers a valuable opportunity to propose an FAO international plan of action."
"I welcome the Commissioner's desire to work on this issue and take a lead."
"Commissioner, I urge you to not allow the opportunity to slip away, because the next meeting is not until 2007."
". Mr President, on behalf of the ALDE Group, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very supportive response, which recognises the severity of the by-catch problem and the importance of addressing it internationally as a matter of urgency."
"We are particularly grateful that he is willing to raise the issue at the meeting of the FAO Committee in March."
"For, as has already been said, without agreement there in principle, the formulation of any international plan of action would have to wait for another two years."
"By-catch is a global problem that requires a genuinely global solution, a genuinely global commitment to tackling it."
"As Mrs Stihler has said, the FAO data estimates the extent of the problem at 7.3 million tonnes a year."
"An international plan of action would not, of course, be the first or only attempt to tackle the problem."
"Much valuable work is already being done both within and outside the EU."
"This tends to involve a piecemeal focus on specific fisheries or specific by-catch species."
"An integrated approach would help support and extend the success of such schemes and crucially prevent displacement of the problem from one area, or species, to another."
"It makes real sense for the EU to be at the forefront of promoting such an integrated approach."
"After all, our vessels fish far beyond EU waters."
"Our actions impact on others as, of course, do the actions of others on us."
"I believe, too, that our citizens, like so many citizens across the globe, feel a real sense of responsibility for the stewardship of natural resources."
"Putting the EU at the forefront of action to prevent this particular kind of wastage would be welcomed by them."
"I look forward to hearing of the progress made at the meeting and whilst I cannot make any promises as to the outcome, am ready to try to persuade my colleagues to give favourable consideration to any substantiated request from the Commission for a temporary transfer of budgetary resources to allow them to participate fully in the drawing up of such an international plan of action."
"I would thank you for your answer, Commissioner Borg and wish you luck with your fight in the FAO."
"No one gains anything from by-catches, and we are obliged to find methods of reducing them."
"When it is caught as by-catch, fishermen are forced to discard splendid cod caught in quantities over and above given quotas."
"The rules must be laid down in such a way that no fish may be caught before it has had time to reproduce itself at least once."
"In the case of certain species, an increased minimum size can bring about a win-win situation in which, in the long term, we increase reproduction, the biomass and catches."
"We must therefore ensure that, where nets are concerned, mesh sizes are adjusted in accordance with these minimum sizes."
"Moreover, it is time to devote more attention to by-catch of non-commercial fish."
"Internationally, there is growing opposition to these catches, especially of cute marine mammals, but also of other species."
"The rules have been focused upon commercial species but, in the interests of the biosystems and of the commercial species’ health, we must conserve and protect the non-commercial species too."
"Greater selectivity and research into ways of reducing these by-catches are necessary."
"In this context, it is important to remember that trying to avoid a species should not lead to increased by-catch of another species."
"If we do not find solutions to these problems, our oceans will soon be as empty as this House is at the moment."
"– Mr President, I, too, was naturally pleased with Commissioner Borg’s positive response to the clear issue that our committee and, in particular, our chair, have brought before this House at a most opportune moment."
"I should like to say, however, that, to my mind, so-called by-catch is, more than anything, a problem of civilisation."
"I find it utterly barbaric that millions of tons of wild animals are fished for no reason whatsoever. This is death for death’s sake, death by bureaucratic rules and by the industrial mindset that finds it cheaper to kill more and use less, on the grounds that nature has no value whatsoever."
"The crux of the matter is that we must respect nature."
"Like every other living being, we naturally use nature and what we do is legitimate, but we must respect nature."
"There can be no sustainable fishing without respect for nature and this is perhaps the greatest demonstration of the negative side of our common fisheries policy."
"Furthermore, as has been mentioned in this House, all we have to do is to look at our neighbours in Norway and Iceland, where this practice is in fact banned, and I am appalled that we do not follow their lead."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission is taking this position in the FAO, but, as has been said here, we must not forget the two million tonnes that are discarded every year."
"I should like to remind you, Commissioner, of the following: not long ago this House adopted a ban on bottom trawling, which is an extremely unselective method – the Commission itself acknowledges this – it is a highly predatory method and causes the highest by-catch rate."
"There has been such a ban in the Azores for a very long time, where the practice had never previously existed."
"The Commission did not wish to know about this and imposed – or, was in favour of re-imposing – liberalisation of this kind of fishing in the waters off the Azores."
"This is a practical demonstration of an attitude that flies in the face of what was said earlier, because before we speak at the FAO, I believe it essential that we ensure good practice within the EU."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the Members for all their comments and remarks."
"I will group the interventions into four points."
"First, the by-catch problem being a worldwide problem and the question of the Commission taking leadership."
"As I said in my original response, we are willing to do so but we have to have the necessary resources made available to us because this will be a mammoth task."
"We will be taking the matter up with the Council in the very short term."
"With regard to the forthcoming FAO meeting, the Commission, as I said before, is ready to support the development of an international plan of action on by-catch and again we will seek Member States' agreement to convey this position to FAO and its members during the forthcoming Committee on Fisheries meeting, in particular when the work programme for the short and medium-term will be discussed."
"With regard to discards, we are actively considering this problem and hopefully we will be coming up with specific proposals soon."
"Another point concerned declining fish stocks and by-catch being all the more regrettable as a result."
"Here I would like to say that one way in which the Commission tries to reduce discards is by improving selectivity by technical measures such as enforcing minimum mesh sizes or closed areas which can limit the catches of juveniles."
"Other measures such as the use of separator trawls or separator grids can reduce the by-catch of non-target species."
"Well-applied technical measures can be effective but they are not without problems."
"For example, it is difficult to find the appropriate mesh size in mixed fisheries."
"The minimum mesh size needed to protect juvenile cod, for example, would be too big to catch adult haddock and whiting."
"Nevertheless technical measures have a part to play."
"The Commission intends to revise completely the technical measures regulation in 2005 to follow up its communication on environmentally-friendly fishing."
"To deal with mixed fisheries the Commission tries to propose TACs to take into account associations between species."
"This is difficult to do but steps in this direction have already been taken."
"The Commission has asked ISIS to give its advice on a fisheries basis rather than on a single stock basis."
"These are the first steps in adopting an ecosystem approach to fisheries management."
"Another approach advocated by the Commission is to manage the fisheries through effort control rather than rely on individual TACs."
"In principle it could be used instead of TACs, with fishermen allowed to land all catches, but in practice effort control will usually complement rather than replace TACs."
"At the end of 2002 the Commission presented a discard action plan which discussed the problems of discards more fully and the ways in which the problem could be tackled."
"Following up this plan, the Commission will consult with Member States and the industry during 2005 with a view to initiating a number of pilot projects to eliminate or at least reduce discards in selected fisheries."
"My final point concerning RACs is that they can be involved and certainly we find no problem in involving RACS in giving advice on the formulation of such plans."
"Many thanks, Commissioner."
"That brings us to the end of the agenda."
"I hope that everyone enjoys what remains of the evening."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 53, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 72, 75, 77, 78, 79 and 83."

"The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9."
"Ladies and gentlemen, most of you have probably already heard the news I am about to give you. It is my sad duty to inform Parliament of the death of our much-loved colleague Mr Imbeni."
"Mr Imbeni was a Member of this House and served as Vice-President for ten years, between 1994 and 2004."
"He was a committed parliamentarian, and I had the honour of working with him in COSAC."
"Throughout his parliamentary career, Mr Imbeni was always eager to share his values and his European ideals with fellow Members."
"He threw himself into his daily work, gaining the respect of his colleagues for his approach to conciliation and for his contribution to the many working groups in which he took part. Mr Imbeni was also involved in the Mediterranean Forum and in COSAC, where, as I just mentioned, I was privileged to work alongside him."
"The House is proud to have had him as a Member."
"Mr Imbeni’s work as Vice-President for a whole decade deserves particular recognition. We remember his wealth of knowledge, his generosity and his friendly smile."
"This was how he earned the respect of political friend and foe alike."
"Mr Imbeni served as Mayor of Bologna for many years, and he made a point of remaining in touch with his electorate and the citizens."
"I have sent a telegram to Mr Imbeni’s family, expressing condolences on behalf of the whole House."
"I trust you will now join me in observing a minute’s silence in memory of Mr Imbeni."
"Before turning to the agenda for today, which relates essentially to relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean region, it is my duty as President to provide the House with information on the meeting that took place yesterday in Brussels."
"As you are aware, ladies and gentlemen, members of the European Council met in Brussels yesterday, although this was not a Council meeting as such."
"Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, and I were both present at the meeting, which was held in order to discuss with Mr Bush some of the most important aspects of relations between the United States and the European Union, and the problems we need to face together."
"Many, but not all, of the Heads of State or Government who attended were able to take the floor."
"I am sure the House will appreciate that the fact that the President of the European Parliament represented the House at this meeting marks another step towards securing the political recognition Parliament deserves. I should like to thank Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso once again for appreciating the role of this House and making it possible for me to attend."
"As I said, not all Heads of State or Government took the floor, but when they had finished speaking, the President of the Council invited Mr Barroso and me to take the floor briefly, and we did so."
"I spoke last, and had very little time at my disposal, as the time allowed for the meeting had already been considerably exceeded."
"Nonetheless, I believe we should warmly welcome the fact that the European Parliament was also able to make its voice heard, even though this had not been planned."
"In my view, this sets a precedent, further strengthening the role of the European Parliament."
"In the short time available I felt bound to refer to the resolution on transatlantic relations voted through by the European Parliament last January. I took it upon myself to convey what had been discussed and voted on in the House."
"I welcomed President Bush’s visit to Europe, and urged him to see it as a turning point, marking a new era when transatlantic relations would be based on multilateralism so as to ensure improved cooperation."
"In view of the time constraints, I was unable to mention all the issues I would have liked to refer to. I chose to focus on the situation in the Middle East and the Kyoto Protocol."
"As to the former, along with the Heads of State or Government who had spoken earlier, I emphasised that there was now a window of opportunity that had to be exploited."
"I stated that fortunately we shared the same vision of the problem, namely guaranteeing the security of the State of Israel whilst providing for the establishment of a Palestinian State that would be geographically, politically and economically viable."
"I confirmed that the European Parliament supported what President Bush had said, and that we hoped to work with him to put his ideas into practice."
"With regard to the Kyoto Protocol, I emphasised the importance the European Parliament has always ascribed to that international agreement, and the need for the United States to play its part in the essential effort required to fully implement it."
"I stated the need for us to continue working together, or at least, talking together, to ensure we each made our contribution to solving this global problem. I suggested that if it proved impossible to do so by means of the Kyoto Protocol, as the United States had decided not to sign it, then we use all the tools available in the field of technological development to counter global environmental problems."
"That was all I was able to convey, focusing on two issues to which the House has devoted a good deal of political energy and debate."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Before starting work on today’s agenda it is my pleasure to welcome Mr Sam Rainsy to the House. Mr Rainsy leads one of the opposition parties in the Cambodian Parliament, and is seated in the public gallery today."
"It is appropriate to recall at this time and in this Chamber what I have already stated in writing to the President of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia. I made it clear that respect for political pluralism is absolutely essential to the functioning of democratic institutions and that the human rights situation in Cambodia continues to give rise to concern."
"Mr Rainsy, I should like to assure you and your colleagues of our solidarity at this difficult time. We wish you every success in your efforts to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy in your country."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on EU relations with the Mediterranean region."
"I would remind the House that the European Parliament is due to assume the Presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly very soon, in the middle of March."
". Mr President, I have already had occasion to stress how important this presidency considers Mediterranean policy to be when meeting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"It is in fact the continuation of a process that began when the European Council decided to extend the European Union’s common strategy for this region, a region to which a number of Member States to some extent also belong."
"We have therefore demonstrated the EU’s substantial interest in and firm commitment to this region."
"This extension will allow the European Union’s relations with the Mediterranean region to be examined in the light of the European Council’s assessment of the strategic partnership for the Mediterranean and the Middle East in June 2005, of the Barcelona Process in the context of its tenth anniversary in 2005 and of the development of European neighbourhood policy over the same period."
"This commitment was reiterated at the recent Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting in The Hague on 29 and 30 November 2004, which confirmed the centrality of the Barcelona Process, backed up by the European neighbourhood policy for the Mediterranean."
"It is a process whereby the European Union and the Mediterranean partners work together towards political, economic and social reform objectives involving the societies concerned."
"Those same objectives are also taken up in the European Union’s strategic partnership for the Mediterranean region and the Middle East."
"More than ever, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is an essential and special regional framework for dialogue and cooperation between the two shores of the Mediterranean."
"The meeting in The Hague was the second ministerial meeting following the meeting held in Naples and preceding the one to be held in Luxembourg on 30 and 31 May 2005."
"In this context, preparations have already begun for the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, which will be marked in Barcelona in November 2005."
"Ministers have also agreed to undertake an overall review of the process and declare 2005 the year of the Mediterranean."
"So far as the European Union’s political and security dialogue with its Mediterranean partners is concerned, the Hague ministerial meeting confirmed the progress that has been made with cooperation in counter-terrorism, regional security and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as European security and defence policy."
"Partnership measures like the holding of a diplomatic seminar in Malta, cooperation in the field of civil defence and disaster management, or the Euro-Mediterranean Study Commission or EuroMeSCo network of foreign policy institutes, are making a substantial contribution to bringing the Euro-Mediterranean partners closer together."
"These efforts are also aimed at the implementation of political reforms and cooperation on human rights and democratisation, and are based on civil society through commitments entered into either by way of association agreements or, where necessary, as part of European neighbourhood policy."
"In this connection, the action plans agreed with a number of partners give a central place to human rights, democratisation, good governance and strengthening the rule of law."
"In like vein, the creation of the Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue of Cultures is a key step in the implementation of the Barcelona Process’s social, cultural and human partnership."
"All members of the partnership must take advantage of its inauguration to increase the visibility of the Barcelona Process on both sides of the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, I believe this is an historic moment, especially as far as the Middle East conflict is concerned."
"I believe the Barcelona Process should both accompany the relaunching of the peace process and also benefit from its relaunch, and I believe Europe’s future is also the future of the Mediterranean region, the future of its development, the future of cultural exchange and the future of cooperation with those who are very close to us."
". Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to participate in this debate on EU-Mediterranean relations."
"The European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the Barcelona Process."
"I wish to express my gratitude, especially to many individual Members who are enthusiastic supporters of Euromed relations, for your role as a driving force behind the Union's active involvement in this region."
"I have had a great personal interest in this region ever since I became aware of how crucial the peace process is for the Middle East."
"As my colleague has just said, there is a real moment of hope, although we know that the process is a fragile one."
"I visited the region the day before Sharm el-Sheikh."
"I had the chance to see the leaders who have taken really courageous steps."
"I told them that we have to go on and that both sides have to consolidate this new path to peace in the Middle East, especially by seizing the opportunities of, on the one hand, the platform – the Quartet – and, on the other hand, the roadmap."
"A successful disengagement in Gaza is a priority for all of us."
"Two days ago, the Israeli Government took a very courageous decision when Prime Minister Sharon and his cabinet decided to do that."
"We know that this is a risky process, but we must do everything possible to make this happen."
"In addition to the Mediterranean partnership, the tenth anniversary of which we will celebrate this year, the European neighbourhood policy, under which we have already adopted five action plans for the southern Mediterranean countries, is also important."
"The European neighbourhood policy means emphasising our common bonds through geography, history, trade, migration and culture by bringing these countries, as a ring of friends, closer to the European Union."
"The neighbourhood policy does not replace the Barcelona Process, but is there to reinforce it by means of a tailor-made bilateral process."
"Let me say a brief word now on Lebanon."
"We are all shocked and saddened by the assassination ten days ago of former Prime Minister Hariri."
"Mr Hariri was one of the main architects of the agreements that brought the long-awaited end to the civil war in Lebanon."
"He was a man committed to peace and reconciliation, to the reconstruction of the war-torn country and also to the promotion of cooperation and stability in the region."
"The best tribute to his relentless efforts would be to ensure that free and fair parliamentary elections, under full Lebanese sovereign control, take place in May."
"It is in the interests of Lebanon and of the stability of the country that the circumstances of this criminal act, and the identities of those responsible for it, are clarified as soon as possible."
"I spoke out at a very early stage in favour an international investigation, which I believe the United Nations will now carry out."
"The Commission has also attached the utmost importance to a full and prompt implementation by all parties of UN Security Council Resolution 1559."
"This resolution calls for free and fair elections without foreign interference, the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the disbanding and disarmament of all militias and the extension of government control to all Lebanese territories."
"As we have already mentioned, 2005 will be year of EU-Mediterranean relations."
"Since there are signs that the cycle of violence between the two sides can be broken, we have to do everything we can to consolidate the ceasefire and secure withdrawal from Gaza, and then move forward with the roadmap for a two-state solution."
"In March, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will meet for the second time in Cairo."
"I regret that I will be unable to attend."
"However, three weeks ago I met the members of the political bureau of that Assembly in Brussels, where I also attended a debate."
"At the end of May, Euro-Mediterranean ministers will meet in Luxembourg for the seventh Barcelona Conference."
"In November, we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the partnership, and the Commission is already in the process of preparing a communication to the European Parliament and the Council to mark the occasion, containing specific proposals."
"I shall outline those proposals very briefly."
"The first is to increase the impact of our policies by contributing to the pursuit of reform, peace and stability in the region."
"The second is to bring the partnership closer to our citizens' concerns."
"The Barcelona Process has, to a large extent, been an intergovernmental process."
"It is high time that we asked ourselves what the partnership can do for people's concerns."
"How can we tackle more successfully such issues as education, employment, gender equality, democracy, the free movement of persons, and migration rights?"
"These are the questions that affect the day-to-day life of our citizens, and our partnership should address them."
"I would like to give you some thoughts on the priorities for the years ahead."
"We should reflect on how we can best make use of the Barcelona Process to contribute to this new momentum in the Middle East peace process, as well as to safeguard peace once we have it."
"We should also address political reform with our partners – Members will be aware of the G8 initiative."
"I was at the Rabat forum – Members will be aware that Cairo will now be postponed to a later date."
"I want to go there because I believe we can do a lot to achieve the same goals in complementary and parallel ways."
"We should address the practical aspects of counter-terrorism and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"The European Union has an impressive record in democracy building, including in the new Member States."
"I think we should use this experience to build democracies and support these countries' reforms: what we Europeans have to do is to try to encourage reforms, not impose them."
"Education is one of the most fundamental issues for the future of the region."
"Therefore, the European Union and our partners should increase spending on education, and I will do what I can with my own services to foster more education projects, at elementary level, at the level of vocational training or at higher, university and university exchange levels."
"We should set a target date for eradicating illiteracy and focus on the critical issue of improving the quality of, and access to, education, especially for girls."
"Together we could organise schemes for student exchanges: I think this is crucial, if we consider what Europe and the United States have done since the war and how important that has been."
"We should promote the study of European integration."
"In trade and economic relations, we should reconfirm the 2010 target for free trade; agree a roadmap with a timetable for free trade in agricultural and processed agricultural products; decide on a timetable for the liberalisation of services; accelerate south-south free trade – the Agadir process was very important; use the neighbourhood policy to help partners to eliminate obstacles to investment; and hold a meeting of transport ministers to extend transport corridors to the Mediterranean with the financial support of the EIB."
"Finally, on the issue of migration and social integration, we should promote a joint cooperative approach to managing the movement of people."
"We should also implement European neighbourhood action plans and commitments on the social integration of migrants."
"The broader Middle East and North African initiative is a very interesting one."
"The Commission will certainly be very much involved in it, in a complementary but parallel way, and I hope that together we can achieve important goals, in terms not only of democracy, reform and the modernisation of these countries, but also of a real common partnership."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is highly symbolic that Viktor Yushchenko, the President of Ukraine, the EU's largest neighbour on its eastern border, is about to address the House on a day when we are also debating the EU's relations with its southern neighbours in the Mediterranean region.In the North, there is Norway, with which relations are friendly; in the West, there is the Atlantic, which means that our primary focus must be on our neighbours to the east and south."
"With all our neighbours, we want to pursue a policy of dialogue, partnership and, if possible, friendship."
"Our parliamentary group – like the House as a whole – actively supported the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the best tribute that we can pay to our late fellow-MEP Mr Renzo Imbeni is to make this Assembly a genuinely effective and forward-looking parliamentary body."
"With our support, and together with our colleague Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos, it was Renzo Imbeni who created this Parliamentary Assembly."
"Let us honour him by doing good work there."
"We want to work towards joint solutions with our partners in the Mediterranean region, your personal commitment to which, Commissioner, I regard as very commendable."
"I myself would have welcomed a Commission decision to appoint a Commissioner responsible solely for the Mediterranean region, but I have no doubt that your tremendous involvement will amount to virtually the same thing."
"Our task, then, is to discuss the future of the Mediterranean region with our partners, and, to the Arab and Islamic world, we say this: we want partnership rather than a clash of civilizations, and our relations with the Arab and Islamic world are among our key policy priorities."
"This includes achieving peace between Israel and Palestine."
"To President Bush, who is visiting Europe from the United States, we say this: let us make a joint effort to ensure that Israel can exist within secure borders and Palestine can exist within secure borders."
"After all, both countries – if I may call Palestine a country – are represented in the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and we must use our opportunities there to bring peace to this region."
"We urge Syria – with which we are about to conclude an Association Agreement – to renounce all activities that encourage terrorism, and to give Lebanon a genuine chance."
"Its former Prime Minister, Rafiq Hariri, has been assassinated along with his bodyguards, and we must find out who is responsible. We urge Syria to make its contribution to peace."
"Let me make one final comment: we want partnership, we want economic contacts, we want political contacts, and we want guaranteed human rights across the Mediterranean region."
"This too is a significant contribution to dialogue, partnership and peace in the Mediterranean."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased that the Council has decided to make 2005 the Year of the Mediterranean."
"Precisely for this reason, we hope that the Union will have a more important political role in this area."
"The Mediterranean is now our priority, because that is where the greatest challenges lie regarding peace, security, the fight against terrorism, development, respect for rights, protection of the environment and positive management of immigration."
"The neighbourhood policy must strengthen the spirit of Barcelona, in line with the partnership method which we could today steer in the direction of codevelopment."
"Ten years on from the Barcelona Intergovernmental Conference in 1995, although the results have essentially not lived up to the expectations created by this process, we must, in any case, acknowledge the progress made with regard to mutual relations and the improved application of the MEDA programme."
"We are encouraged, then, by the resumption of dialogue between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority following the presidential elections in Palestine."
"At the same time, we are aware of the complexity of the whole Middle Eastern situation and we are concerned by the situation in Lebanon, following the bomb attack which caused the death of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri."
"Moreover, we would urge Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and, in the same vein, we hope that Israel will pull out of the Golan Heights."
"This all means that the time may have come to resolve the whole Middle Eastern conflict."
"In this context, we appreciate the role played by Egypt, but at the same time we are troubled by the internal situation of that country where, precisely in the past few days, Mr Ayman Nour, a member of the Egyptian Parliament, was arrested and detained."
"Lastly, we are calling for a more incisive and coherent role for the European Union in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in the whole region."
"The neighbourhood policy should have more appropriate instruments and institutions."
"We would therefore invite the Commission and the Council to take greater account of the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, a fundamental democratic instrument which should be supported and strengthened, and which was established through the efforts of men like Mr Renzo Imbeni."
"The Assembly is taking its first steps: it is the first time that it is meeting outside Europe, in Cairo, and we hope that it can hold an extraordinary meeting, presided by you, President Borrell Fontelles, precisely on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, while I fully agree with the text of the joint resolution which will shortly be put to the vote in this House, I would like to join you, Commissioner, in stressing two points about this text: one concerning the resumption of dialogue between the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the other about the situation created in Lebanon by the assassination of Rafiq Hariri."
"So far as the new prospects opened up between Israel and Palestine are concerned, I want to repeat what I have already said many times in this House."
"If, as we all hope, a peace agreement is reached, the experience gained from decades of conflict resolution in such situations shows that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to do without the services of peacekeeping troops if the incidents that inevitably happen under such conditions, because local warlords are incapable of accepting peace, are not to degenerate into conflagration."
"I think a European force would be more likely than any other to be accepted by both sides for such a task."
"My question to the Council, Mr President-in-Office, is therefore: is it not time we prepared ourselves for that?"
"Turning to the situation in Lebanon, as you have all reiterated, we and the international community have repeatedly called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from its territory."
"Has the time not come, Commissioner, for us to call on Syria finally to heed these calls before the association agreement on which negotiations have now been concluded is signed?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my colleagues and I are very pleased that this year, 2005, will see the renewal and relaunching of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, because that is how we have always referred to the Barcelona Process, in order to emphasise both all the hope it has raised and all the disappointments which are growing as the days go by."
"My colleagues have referred to the despicable and abhorrent assassination of Rafiq Hariri, following which a question mark now hangs over that part of the world, just when a glimmer of light was appearing in the Middle East that we want to foster and see grow."
"We need to go beyond the wishes we have been reiterating for 10 years and think about how we can really achieve some progress on the main issues regarding democracy and human rights in that part of the world, because it is those fundamental issues that underpin the fight against terrorism, the issues of peace and stability and development."
"As the Arab Bureau never tires of saying in its different United Nations development reports, it is on this fundamental issue of democratic foundations, of individual and collective freedoms in that part of the world that we need to work."
"We have several ways forward."
"The Commission also has several ways forward, which it has set out in a communication in the form of 10 extremely precise recommendations."
"I believe that appropriate tools, the national action plans, the creation of the human rights subcommittees as part of this process, that is to say the new neighbourhood policy, are really needed to help us to implement those 10 recommendations, which as you said, Commissioner, go beyond the purely intergovernmental approach in that part of the world."
"That is what the strength, the potential power of this Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and also of the Euromed civil society platform is all about, because we are all aware that our ambitious aims of democracy and development in that region can only come about with the deep commitment of those societies themselves."
"We will shortly be welcoming Mr Yushchenko."
"We know that all our policies and all our aspirations depend first and foremost on the energy of the societies themselves to free themselves from complex situations that destroy freedom."
"I believe that is what we must …"
". – Mr President, I should like to point out three areas in which the Commissioner’s statements struck me as vague or imprecise."
"The first of those areas is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"We are all aware that the cease-fire that has been declared is very important for Palestine to be able to conclude its democratic election process."
"A cease-fire is not the same thing as peace, however, and Israel continues to take prisoners while it releases prisoners."
"Israel continues to redesign the West Bank wall while it prepares to abandon Gaza."
"The truth is that it is planning to turn Palestine into a Bantustan."
"Europe has everything to gain from being clear on this matter."
"You also spoke very generically, Commissioner, about the second aspect, immigration."
"Historically, the Mediterranean has been a sea of communication, a bridge between people and a thoroughfare for trade and cultures."
"We Europeans, however, have turned it into a modern-day moat, in which, over the past ten years, 4 000 men and women have drowned their hopes."
"Our duty, Commissioner, is not to turn the countries of the south into the policemen of those seeking better living conditions, but to replace the current immigration policy with one that seeks to strike a balance in migratory flows in both directions."
"This is the only way in which we will have the moral authority to address the issue of human rights without hypocrisy."
"This is the only way in which we will be able to condemn, for example, the appalling conditions suffered by the thousands of Sudanese treated as slaves in Libya."
"The Barcelona Process will either be a large-scale Euro-Mediterranean pact, whereby peace, democracy and human rights are exchanged by means of economic and social integration, or will be nothing more than a letter of intent."
". Mr President, who would say ‘no’ to being master in their own house?"
"Most of the Lebanese would not either, but reality is different."
"Years of Syrian military presence on their own territory is smarting ever more, and the cowardly assassination of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hariri, is now turning a remorseless spotlight onto this international grief about a lack of Lebanese sovereignty."
"How could the European Union, given this situation, ever conclude an association agreement with Beirut?"
"And how can the Council and the Commission now present Parliament with a similar agreement with occupier Damascus, as if Resolution 1559 of the UN Security Council which demands Syria to pull out, did not mean anything to Brussels?"
"I drew some strength, though, from the Commissioner’s attention to observing this resolution."
"In fact, that self-same Resolution 1559 stipulates the disbanding of the Lebanese Shiite terrorist organisation Hezbollah, which, armed to the teeth and trained by its patrons Syria and Iran, operates from the south of the country against Israel."
"This is nevertheless time for the Council and the Commission to take action in respect of Damascus and Teheran."
"Such European political decisiveness also promotes the new opportunities for the Israeli-Palestinian settlement."
"The fact is that recent statements by the present Palestinian leadership leave the European Union no other choice."
"Those statements are unambiguous."
"Hezbollah is not interested in Palestinian negotiations with Israel and puts up no less than USD 100 000 for Palestinian suicide attacks."
"Palestinian circles therefore, do not rule out terror from Hezbollah against its own negotiators."
"I urge the Council to be resolute and finally place Hezbollah on the European list of terrorist organisations."
"Only then will the Member States be credible in respect of the United States and, certainly not unimportantly, just as much in respect of the non-Member States across the entire Mediterranean."
"I thank you."
". Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, ten years after the Barcelona Declaration, there is still a long way to go before the objectives laid down by that Conference are achieved in the Mediterranean."
"This is a bitter pill to swallow, but we have to face the facts pragmatically and without hypocrisy."
"The social, economic, cultural and human partnership between the two sides of the Mediterranean is proceeding on a foundation of uncertainty and contradictions."
"The Barcelona Process has moved forward slowly, in particular with regard to the implementation of the MEDA programme, whose pace has quickened only in recent years."
"The European Union has been incapable of playing a significant, decisive role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"The outrageous trafficking in illegal immigrants between the two sides of the Mediterranean is a continuing sign of the failure of the cooperation policy that was hoped for between the countries of departure and the countries of arrival."
"We wish to remain optimistic, however, and we welcome the positive signals coming from that area."
"The changed behaviour of the Libyan Government towards international terrorism, the recent breakthrough in relations between Israel and Palestine and the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly all give us reason to hope."
"The European Union needs, at last, to take on a more powerful political role in order to bring about a genuine climate of cooperation, growth and peace in the area."
"Otherwise, this tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Conference, this 2005 dedicated to the Mediterranean, is likely to be seen just as a year marked by our weakness."
"Mr President, I had the privilege of representing this House at the funeral of Yasser Arafat."
"Later, I chaired the observer delegation to the Palestine elections."
"Last year I visited Egypt, Algeria, Yemen and Syria, following the path of Arab reform."
"Regrettably, the threat of terrorism remains all too real in much of the region."
"While in Palestine, and in a purely private capacity, I had a meeting with representatives of Hamas on the West Bank, on the basis that they had fought the municipal elections in Palestine."
"I urged them then, and I urge them again today, to take part in the parliamentary elections on 17 July."
"However, before doing so, Hamas must not only renounce violence, but also hand in its weapons to the Palestine security forces."
"Rightly, others have paid tribute to Mr Imbeni, my predecessor as Vice-President representing Parliament on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"Mr Trakatellis and I assist you, Mr President, in that work."
"I believe that the Arabs deserve democracy."
"President Bush rightly talks about Arab freedom."
"My distant relation, T. E. Lawrence of Arabia, once wrote: 'I wrote my will across the sky in stars to earn you freedom, that seven-pillared worthy house.'"
"The question today is who will give the Arabs freedom, the stars and stripes or the stars of the European Union?"
"I believe we should work together, but I say to the Americans that this is our neighbourhood."
"– Mr President, allow me to follow on from Mr McMillan-Scott’s closing words. The European Union must be involved in transforming the Mediterranean region into an area of peace and cooperation."
"You will understand, therefore, that, although I agree with the statements made by Mr Schmit and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, I believe they are short on ambition and political determination."
"It seems to me that we are stuck in a rut."
"Forward progress is being made, but the will to press for more and better progress, and for what is actually required right now is lacking."
"There have been many references to an alliance of civilisations, and the Euro-Mediterranean relationship is the best possible example of such an alliance."
"Unilateralism has no part to play in it."
"This must include democracy and full respect for human rights, security, negotiated solutions to all the conflicts in the region, on both shores of the Mediterranean, and the fight against terrorism. It must, of course, also encompass disarmament, aid for sustainable development, respect for the environment and forward-looking management of migratory flows."
"The Prime Minister of Spain made all this very clear yesterday at the meeting in Brussels, when he explained how the Union conceives the Euro-Mediterranean process."
"It so happens that 2005 has been declared the Year of the Mediterranean. This must not be an excuse for yet another calendar full of pretty pictures."
"There are more than enough of those around already. In addition, the Association Agreements have proved to be effective instruments."
"A parliamentary process is under way too, in the shape of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly due to meet in Cairo in the near future. There are other goals to be met also, such as the free exchange area that should be in place by 2010, with a new social dimension."
"This is all to take place in the context of a new neighbourhood policy, with five new Action Plans and even the launch of South-South cooperation."
"I believe the verdict on the Euro-Mediterranean process has to be positive."
"Obviously, there are shortcomings, but we Europeans are sometimes inclined to indulge in too much self-criticism."
"There are bound to be shortcomings, but we are building on everything that has been achieved over the last ten years."
"A dose of ambition is now called for, and we need to make more of the successes."
"A Euro-Mediterranean Summit will be held in November. This will be an occasion for a political commemoration of the Barcelona Process through the launch of new measures."
"It seems most appropriate that an Extraordinary Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is also to be held in November, bringing a political dimension to the aforementioned celebration."
"– Mr President, the Mediterranean region certainly is an area where consistent and committed action by the European Union can have a real impact. It can lead to tangible results helping the citizens regain hope for their future whilst respecting them as what they are."
"Such a future must be characterised by stability and gradual economic growth and also by full respect for human rights."
"I should like to focus on two particular issues in the agenda, because I feel they are particularly important to the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue."
"Firstly, it is absolutely crucial to engage civil society in this process, ensuring that the citizens, their organisations and associations understand that their future lies in their own hands, not in the hands of top politicians. Secondly, trade needs to be given a real boost."
"Of course, there must also be a South-North free trade area in which we are involved. This will be achieved by setting up a genuine free trade area between the European Union and the Mediterranean area."
"I believe these two issues are of vital importance."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Arab world and the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean are changing – and this change is long overdue. Only a few years ago, this region was largely at a standstill as far as democracy-building and human rights were concerned."
"We are pleased that Turkey, for example, has signalled its intention of playing a more prominent role in the dialogue with the Arab world, notably on the issue of women's rights and democratisation."
"This shows that the European Union's policy of gradually bringing Turkey closer to Europe is the right one."
"Furthermore, despite all the problems, the emergence of a younger generation of leaders – in Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain and indeed Syria, for example – has created the opportunity for a cautious opening towards democracy."
"We expressly welcome the release of political prisoners and the increased scope for political opposition."
"The issue of women's rights in Morocco and the debate about the introduction of a divorce law in Jordan are just two examples that I would like to highlight."
"Let me conclude with the Middle East conflict."
"A solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will help to ensure that hopefully, the spurious excuse that this conflict makes democracy impossible can no longer be used in future."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ten years ago in Barcelona, the European Union and its neighbours in the Mediterranean region launched an ambitious programme which sought to create an area of stability, peace and economic progress in the region by means of closer, mutual understanding."
"We have not managed to achieve everything and must relaunch the whole process more effectively."
"This year, 2005, could be our opportunity."
"Above all, we wanted an area of lasting peace, and these ten years have unfortunately been more difficult than the previous ones in terms of relations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, whose conflict has in some ways affected the stability of the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"Today, however, tangible facts appear to show that it is possible to overcome misunderstandings and tensions and resolve the ten-year-long conflict in that area."
"On the other hand, we must mention a positive accomplishment: the launch of the Anna Lindh Foundation, based in Alexandria in Egypt."
"We expect it to play a major part in boosting cultural exchanges between all countries in the Euro-Mediterranean area, and in the growth of a dynamic civil society which is as pluralist as possible in those countries which are still lagging behind."
"The Commission could and should consider links between the Foundation and other more minor Euro-Mediterranean satellite cultural centres located throughout the area, which can equally spread the same messages of friendship, mutual understanding and peace among the peoples of the Euro-Mediterranean region, and which serve as cultural, research and training centres, including for the many immigrants in that area."
"In short, we wish to obtain the necessary impetus from the ups and downs of these first ten years in order to look ahead with renewed confidence."
"– Sometimes the measures adopted by the European Union as regards the Mediterranean, were not always enough to render the Euro-Mediterranean policy a positive and concrete one."
"A clear example for me is the illegal/irregular immigration tragedy that exists in an alarming way in the Mediterranean."
"I believe that the European Union could have treated this phenomenon with more energy and urgency."
"This is not a situation that pertains to this region alone and therefore the 'burden-sharing' principle, not the 'burden-shifting' principle, should be adopted."
"This is an international issue and it requires an international solution, possibly joint initiatives between the United Nations and the European Union."
"While I appreciate that recently there was more commitment from the Council and the Commission, I hope that the necessary funds will be available so that these intentions can be translated into effective results."
"Without any doubt, the Barcelona process was fundamental so that the Euro-Mediterranean policy is given the due importance."
"However, it may be the case that, as happened with the Lisbon agenda, the time is ripe for this process to be reviewed so that, in the first place, we gauge how successful we were in achieving our aims successfully, as in the case of the creation of a free industrial trade area in the Mediterranean."
"In my opinion, we should revive this process, if need be."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I have several comments would like to make, having had the opportunity to visit the Middle East with the Commissioner just before the Sharm el Sheikh summit."
"As regards the Middle East programme as a whole, we know that stable development – through better economic and social conditions and through democracy-building – is very important."
"However, we also know that this will only work in the long term if the Middle East is able to solve its own problems, because they are the cause of, or an alibi for, many others."
"That is why the present situation in the Middle East is immensely important, especially since I believe there is a real chance, for the first time, of reaching an agreement."
"I say this on the basis of my visit there, when I met with leading representatives of the Palestinians and Israel and each ascribed positive motives to the other."
"That is the crucial difference compared with the previous situation, and it is the key basis on which to build a successful process."
"We must ensure that the Middle East Quartet now meets together in the region at last. It should not just rely on the written roadmap; it should visit the region as a joint body."
"We must ensure that we support the framework conditions that will facilitate an agreement between the leaders of the two sides."
"This includes bringing clear influence to bear on Iran and Syria in order to stop Hezbollah from wrecking the peace process from outside."
"We must support President Abbas so that the Palestinian people can see that peace benefits everyone."
"That is why assistance must be provided very swiftly."
"I do realise, Commissioner, that this House has always taken a very critical line on this issue."
"What is needed now, though, is swift action."
"This does not mean that something should be done through some programme or other at some point in time; it means making it clear, preferably before the parliamentary elections in summer, that it is worth taking the moderates' side."
"In this way, the cycle of violence can be broken, which is essential if the Israeli leaders are to secure the necessary support from their own people by being able to say to them that the peace process means no more terrorism."
"Prompt action is therefore required."
"Mr President, the assassination of Rafiq Hariri in Lebanon has reawakened the argument surrounding the EU-Syria association agreement and the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1559, just when the Bush and Chirac governments are making peace with each other around the idea of a free and sovereign Lebanon."
"The European Parliament’s position on the sovereign right of nations to self-determination has always been very clear."
"It has consistently rejected any form of overt or covert occupation, be it in Palestine, Iraq or other countries of the world."
"For a great variety of reasons, however, most often political and historical ones, action has rarely been taken against foreign forces."
"Today, the death of Mr Hariri, whose unknown assassins are still on the loose, again raises this question and many others."
"Should we or should we not ask the Syrians to refrain from all interference in Lebanese affairs?"
"My answer is yes."
"Should they at last put an end to the state of emergency in which their country has been for over 30 years?"
"Yes."
"Should they thoroughly democratise their society and release activists from prison?"
"My answer is clear, it is yes."
"Should they withdraw their troops from Lebanon?"
"Yes, and they have started to do so."
"Should we, as General Morillon suggests, make signing the Syria-EU cooperation agreement dependent on these conditions, and in particular the immediate withdrawal of all Syrian troops from Lebanon?"
"That is my question to the Council."
"The question is crucial."
"Mr Hariri’s death has both everything and nothing to do with the answer."
"This assassination must certainly be fully investigated and there must be an international inquiry."
"Having said that, I really want to ask the Council whether it is appropriate to sign an agreement that has been awaited for so long, since it is the last of the MEDA agreements and has been deferred so many times."
"Once it is signed, whether we like it or not, this agreement will inevitably be in the spotlight, and we, the European Union, will be forced to justify our idea of European foreign policy and its democratic basis to public opinion."
"That is no idle question, it is a question that I ask myself and that we are all asking ourselves."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what prospects has the Barcelona Process opened up, 10 years on?"
"During that time, Europe has been greatly preoccupied with its own organisation and enlargement."
"It has not always given its southern flank the attention it deserved."
"At the same time, the Israel-Palestine conflict has blocked the overall development dynamic by capturing all the attention in the region."
"Today there is an urgent need to get the process moving again."
"Tools are in place: association agreements, a neighbourhood policy and in particular the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which is a great democratic step forward in this process."
"There is also the establishment of the Anna Lindh Foundation to encourage dialogue between cultures and civilisations."
"Furthermore, there is the idea, which is already well advanced, of setting up a Euro-Mediterranean development bank to promote employment, health and education in the countries of the South."
"Other civil society organisations are being formed."
"All these projects are making progress, but two things are essential if they are to be effective."
"The first is to get the wind of political reform blowing, and the nations of the South are ready to back it."
"The second is to establish a just and lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians."
"The present circumstances are favourable but very fragile."
"Europe needs to be more committed."
"All these projects are converging towards greater peace, security and shared prosperity, but much too slowly."
"Europe has understood that there is no war of civilisations, but that an alliance of civilisations is necessary, because after dismantling a wall in the East, Europe now has to build a bridge to the South."
"– Mr President, if in the past Braudel, the important French historian, highlighted in his work the political and economic importance of the Mediterranean to Europe, international and regional developments over recent years are making the Mediterranean an area of strategic importance to the future of the European Union."
"It is true that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, as shaped in Barcelona in 1995, has become embroiled in the Arab-Israeli conflict and has not brought about the expected results."
"Today, the European Union should, alongside the implementation of the roadmap for Palestine, take the initiative, within the framework of the Quartet, to design a roadmap for peace between Israel and Syria."
"We now need a holistic approach to peace, democracy, security and stability in the Middle East."
"Syria, like Israel, should respect the decisions of the UN Security Council on Lebanon and withdraw its troops."
"At the same time, we need to re-evaluate the Barcelona Process within the new framework of the European neighbourhood strategy we have designed, in order to avoid overlapping policies and initiatives."
"May I close by saying that the European Commission and the Council are being called on to follow up the initiative of the former President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, who in 2002 created the initiative for dialogue between the peoples and the cultures of the Euro-Mediterranean area, and the relevant proposals which the Committee of Wise Men took at that time."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think it is very important that we are holding this debate today in the European Parliament."
"Without doubt, a great deal can be said about the past, the present and the future of Euro-Mediterranean policy."
"I wish to comment on two or three points."
"The first point concerns Euro-Mediterranean policy and the situation in the Middle East."
"It is a fact that a new wind is blowing at the moment in the Middle East and that is a positive thing; however, history has shown that we always need to approach the peace process with restrained optimism and, in all events, with the will to contribute as the European Union not just economically but also politically."
"The second point concerns the countries surrounding Israel and Palestine; the new situation in Lebanon following Hariri's murder, relations with Syria, which require attention and, without doubt, the role of Egypt, which has always played a stabilising role."
"I think that we need to look very carefully at our relations with Syria in the future."
"Here too there are numerous proposals and numerous alternative solutions."
"My third comment concerns Iraq."
"It is a fact that, at the moment, we are on the path of reconstruction."
"We had the results of the elections, which give a full map of what is happening in this country and, of course, we need to approach our relations with Iraq one step at a time, with the first important element of our assistance being in shaping the new constitution."
"As for relations with Iran, and we know about the current debate, I am one of those who would say to you, be careful with the nuclear power, because I am against nuclear power, against nuclear weapons but, at the same time, I would tell you that the approach needs to be an approach with diplomatic means, not with troops and wars."
"Wars do not resolve problems, they exacerbate them."
"Finally, having thanked the Commissioner for the efforts she has made for Euro-Mediterranean policy, can we please all agree that the European Union needs to be present in the Mediterranean, especially in the Middle East, politically as well as economically?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Barcelona Process is about to celebrate its tenth birthday and peace in the Middle East has never seemed closer."
"The time is ripe to remember objectives that are just as topical as ever: the establishment of a common area of peace, stability, and security and of an area of shared prosperity and the bringing together of nations and cultures."
"As Mr Javier Solana stressed in June 2004, this partnership is strategic for Europe, always assuming that Europe gives itself the resources to match its ambitions."
"First of all, the Barcelona Process must be the first pillar of the European neighbourhood policy, in as much as that policy proposes going much further than mere cooperation, extending to a degree of political and economic integration."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will have to provide the democratic framework for that; it needs to be further strengthened."
"The European presidency of the EMPA must enable a balanced partnership to be consolidated."
"We should be talking about codevelopment based on common values: democracy, good governance, the status of women, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue."
"Finally, these objectives presuppose that Europe makes its Mediterranean policy a budget priority."
"Mr President, three years ago we were wondering what to do with Iraq."
"Some countries joined the coalition, some did not."
"The price we all paid was enormous."
"Let us support democracy using our European soft means."
"Let us support democracy in Palestine by guiding Hamas towards participation in fair elections."
"Let us disarm it in our soft way."
"How should we do this?"
"Not via non-transparent budgetary support."
"We should fund ambitious and specific projects that directly counter Hamas' demagogic propaganda."
"Let us directly finance 200 doctors in the West Bank and let us equip and maintain 100 primary schools in the same area with our full support, clearly acting under the European flag."
"This would be a 'soft' way to disarm Hamas."
"There is another Soviet style authoritarian regime in our Mediterranean neighbourhood."
"We do not need to send troops, and we do not need to sign an association agreement with that regime."
"Let us stick with Resolution 1559."
"Let us call for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Lebanon."
"Let us call for the free and fair elections in Lebanon that Arab street, Beirut, is calling for today."
"But let us also separate Syria from Hizbollah, its terrorist companion, with no artificial distinctions between military and social links."
"We should put Hizbollah on the European list of terrorist organisations immediately."
"– This year, 2005, is the Year of the Mediterranean."
"The year began with positive signs, in terms of both the democratic process and the peace talks."
"In Amman, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly’s Committee on Economic, Financial, Social and Educational Issues attempted to reinforce these signs and give them short- and medium-term objectives aimed at protecting the citizens and development."
"Violence has reared its head, though, and Hariri’s death has demonstrated the urgent need for the EU to strengthen its role as an active partner."
"In Parliament, as in Amman, we all consider peace to be a desirable and necessary factor in prosperity."
"In the Middle East, EUR 60 billion is spent every year on arms and cutting this amount by half will release absolutely crucial funds to support development throughout the region."
"Accordingly, in this Year of the Mediterranean, and in years to come, the EU must have a clearly defined, practical role."
"Economic and regional integration into more globalised markets, such as the EU, must be guaranteed, and the 720 million inhabitants of the Euro-Med area therefore represent a more significant market than China, a fact that should be taken into account by businesses looking to make investments."
"Education and training are key elements in creating an industrial workforce."
"The Commission should therefore seek to support measures that encompass the countries of the MEDA Programme and thus open up new horizons."
"In order to develop employment, the EU must contribute towards the creation of jobs in industry and support and promote microcredit institutions."
"Development and joint initiatives are absolutely crucial, in areas such as water, energy, transport, infrastructures and tourism, to enable social progress and economic and regional integration."
"These proposals are crucial if this whole drawn-out story is to have a happy ending and if these people are to dream once again of a prosperous future, and this Year of the Mediterranean is setting a perfect example."
"We therefore hope that the EU can be the driving force behind the whole of this process."
"Mr President, the Mediterranean is a priority area for the European Union."
"The countries concerned are neighbours to many Member States, and there are a whole series of historical, political, economic, cultural and human links between us."
"We need do no more than think of the considerable number of citizens of those countries resident amongst us."
"Of course, the situation of the countries on the southern shore varies. Most of them are facing great challenges, however."
"By way of example I could mention the need to make progress on democracy and respect for human rights, social and economic modernisation, administrative reform and the improvement of public services, especially education."
"This is because young people make up a large proportion of the large populations of these countries."
"I am glad Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner emphasised education. Combating terrorism and the mafias involved in illegal immigration more effectively is a further challenge facing the region, as is the fight against corruption."
"The European Union and the Member States must encourage its neighbours on the southern shores of the Mediterranean to rise successfully to these challenges. Dialogue, aid and genuine cooperation at different levels will all help."
"For instance, greater political and economic liberalisation and improved education will ensure greater stability in those countries."
"Progress of this kind will also help to defeat extremism and fanaticism, because the latter tend to flourish wherever there is poverty and ignorance."
"It is important to be aware that the prosperity and stability of those countries is inextricably linked to the prosperity and stability of our own."
"We have a shared future."
"We cannot afford to neglect each other, and we must cooperate closely."
"The basic European instruments designed to allow us to achieve these objectives are the Barcelona Process, the European neighbourhood policy and the action plans."
"I am delighted that the Anna Lindh foundation is soon to be launched, and that this House will shortly assume the Presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"Ten years have passed since the start of the Barcelona Process, but we must continue to foster it, so that the citizens of the countries on the southern shore do not feel that an enlarged Europe has forgotten their problems."
"Consequently, strong support must be given to the Barcelona Process. This year, 2005, has been designated the Year of the Mediterranean, which presents a splendid opportunity to revitalise the Barcelona Process, just when the prospects for the Middle East peace process are so much better, as many previous speakers have pointed out."
"Mr President, when in the autumn of 2003, Mr Mahmoud Abbas had no choice but to step down as Prime Minister because Yasser Arafat did not give him the elbow room to work on peace, few people could imagine that one and a half years later, we would get such an historic opportunity to make peace sustainable – and historic this opportunity truly is."
"If we see how Mahmoud Abbas is adopting a pragmatic position, and what Israel’s first reaction is like, but also how the people in Lebanon are claiming their right to freedom and self-determination in a historic manner, I think it is of great importance for Europe to be giving the right signals."
"What are those signals?"
"First of all, we, along with the United States, should press for breathing new life into the roadmap, but also, as Mr Brok said a moment ago, give support to the Palestinians at this particular time, so that the people there realise, the sooner the better, that the pragmatists and moderates can really offer benefits."
"Thirdly, we must also give a clear signal, clearer than before, to the ill-intentioned, by which, in particular, I am referring to Hezbollah, to which our attitude in Europe is really odd."
"In the case of Hamas, we said at one time that it was, as a whole, both politically and militarily wrong."
"Where Hezbollah is concerned, we are still two-faced, because in their case, we say that the military side is wrong, but we can deal with them at a political level."
"There is no longer any reason to sustain that division, for that division is implausible."
"There is a leader, Mr Nasrallah, who is the political and military leader, and who claims that they are an organisation."
"Equally, the second man in the organisation, Sheikh Naim Qassem, says that they are an organisation, that politically and militarily speaking, they have the same objective: ‘Political activity is integrated into resistance operations, it is a inseparable part of the political activity’."
"That is what was said by Hezbollah’s Number Two, and should there be any doubt left, I should like to quote Hezbollah’s representative in the Lebanese Parliament, the one we have dealings with, who states: ‘Hezbollah is an organisation in which all the fighters are simultaneously politicians and fighters."
"The manner in which some in the West seek to betray Hezbollah does not deceive us’."
"We cannot afford to be naïve any longer, particularly at this time."
"We must send the right message to the Palestinians, Israelis and the Lebanese who want freedom, by taking a firm line with the evil-minded like Hezbollah."
"I know that during the last Council presidency, the Dutch Government tried to move away from this two-faced attitude and place Hezbollah as a whole on the list of terrorist organisations."
"I think that the people in the Middle East deserve that signal from the EU as a whole."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner, but also the Council’s representative, whether they would like to elaborate on this."
"Why are we still two-faced in our dealings with Hezbollah, and when will we at last come to fight the organisation as a whole by fire and sword, as we do Hamas?"
"Mr President, the relationship with our Mediterranean partners is one of interdependence."
"The Barcelona Process is based on the principle of mutual benefit."
"On the one hand, Member States are primarily keen to tackle issues such as immigration, terrorism and human rights."
"On the other, Mediterranean partners are eager to increase their standard of living and benefit through economic aid and trade."
"The solution is, of course, to address the gap between the Union and the Mediterranean region."
"Reduce the prosperity gap, and you slow migratory flows."
"Address the democracy gap, and you consolidate regional stability."
"The theory is simpler than the practice."
"The Barcelona Process has tried to do all this, with moderate results."
"We have been lacking in three areas: visibility – convincing people that we are in this together on all issues; prioritisation – trying to do everything, but ending up doing little; and implementation – through financing."
"Surely, if Member States see tangible results, they will be more forthcoming in committing funds."
"Our Mediterranean partners are asking for more money in order to produce these results."
"Ingenuity is needed to break this 'chicken and egg' situation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many speakers this morning have described how this year, 2005, can be a year of neighbourhood policy."
"The prospects have rarely been so good."
"It is the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, there are peaceful developments between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East – something that would have seemed impossible only a few months ago – and President Yushchenko is here with us today – from an eastern part of the neighbourhood where democracy and human rights are increasingly being asserted."
"That is why it is important that we, in this European Parliament, make a positive contribution to this neighbourhood policy process."
"In the countries themselves, too, we see that the mood is changing."
"Only a few days ago, delegates from Morocco told me that when they launched a human rights dialogue with the Council within the EU-Morocco Association Council, all the other neighbours said to them: 'Have you lost your minds?"
"How can you talk about human rights with the EU?"
"It will only backfire on you when the EU starts to interfere.'"
"However, the impact is positive."
"The dialogue is taking place and it means that they have an opportunity to talk about the human rights of Moroccans in the European Union as well. In other words, it is a productive dialogue, and one which will undoubtedly have a positive effect on all the other neighbours too."
"I believe we are on the right track and now we must become more ambitious."
"We always said that if corruption in the Palestinian Authority is addressed, if there is an end to terrorism, then we Europeans must help out with even more money if necessary. That means that we must be prepared to support this process on our own initiative."
"Mr Brok has undoubtedly voiced the opinion of the majority in this House, Commissioner."
"In other words, if you take action now, you will have our backing."
"The prediction that chaos would break out after Arafat's death has proved wrong."
"What has broken out is peace; anti-corruption measures are now in place, and we Europeans should support this process."
"Let me make a final comment on Syria, which Mr Eurlings has already mentioned."
"Mr Solana's comments are unacceptable in this form."
"We must now make more demands on Syria as well."
"All our Arab neighbours are keen to support the peace process and Syria must now be judged by whether it combats Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. If it fails to do so, it cannot be a good partner for EU policy."
"This must be made clear and, in this respect, the Commissioner has been rather more forthright in her comments than Mr Solana in recent weeks."
". Mr President, I believe this debate has shown first of all that Parliament is an important, not to say essential, partner in relaunching the Barcelona Process."
"A number of suggestions have been made and I will try to come back to some of the points that have been raised."
"First, I would like to say that the democratic project, the project of democracy for the Mediterranean, is a European idea."
"With the Barcelona Process, we have effectively advocated this idea of defending democracy in this region."
"In this context, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is an important step, since we all know that democracy is also a form of apprenticeship."
"Apprenticeship in parliamentary government, in parliamentary democracy, takes place first of all in this context of exchange."
"As we all know, not all members of parliament are nominated or elected in the same way."
"However, I believe this assembly is a step in the right direction."
"You have been entrusted with an important task, one which I might almost go so far as to describe as democratic education, but also education for peace and dialogue, since this parliamentary assembly brings together those who today are enemies or perhaps were yesterday."
"I believe this form of dialogue is an extremely important point."
"Moreover, the presidency will have the honour of being present at your deliberations at your Cairo meeting."
"Another point that has been addressed at length and is of concern to the Council is the situation in Lebanon."
"Since the assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri, the internal situation in Lebanon has become extremely delicate."
"I have noted that a number of comments, not to say demands, have been made."
"I can tell you that so far as Lebanon is concerned there is perfect agreement between the European Union and the United States, and that is something which clearly emerged from yesterday’s talks."
"In the context of the crisis into which Hariri’s assassination risks plunging the country, UN Resolution 1559, which initially was backed by one European country and the US, is taking on a completely new dimension."
"Our attitude towards Syria is not one of weakness."
"I believe we have tried to work with the Syrians."
"We hoped, and continue to hope, that Syria will rejoin the train of reform and democratisation."
"We also know and have to recognise, however, that the forces in support of such a development are probably still very much a minority and are very weak."
"That is why we may have to move to another form of dialogue with that country, and there is, to say the least, some doubt about whether the agreement will be signed on schedule."
"I would also like to say a word about Hezbollah."
"I do not believe there is any ambiguity, and we all know that Hezbollah is politically active, since it has members in the Lebanese parliament as well as being involved in other activities."
"However, the mere fact of putting it on the list will not solve the problem."
"I therefore believe we must monitor this Hezbollah question very closely."
"We also have to look at Hezbollah’s attitude to the present situation in Lebanon."
"I have to say that the threats made by some leading members of Hezbollah concerning the stability of Lebanon do not inspire confidence and we shall therefore probably have to take other measures in this regard."
"So far as Syria is concerned, I would simply like to say that there was at least one positive point that gave us hope when, after long negotiations and long discussions, Syria agreed to the non-proliferation clause."
"That was a glimmer of hope that we could persuade Syria to adopt a more responsible attitude in keeping with the principles upheld by the European Union and the international community."
"Concerning the peace process, I believe we are all agreed that it is essential if we are to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona Process and to dialogue with the Mediterranean region."
"I therefore agree with Mr Morillon when he says that Europe must make plans in preparation for the time when peace has been reached."
"I can assure him that the authorities responsible for these issues in relation to peacekeeping forces will certainly not neglect such preparation and planning."
"I will end with a point that is particularly close to my heart, namely immigration, since I am also responsible for handling it during our presidency."
"The European Union has no intention whatsoever of building a new wall between one shore of the Mediterranean and the other."
"Reference has been made to the thousands of people who try to cross the Mediterranean and perish in the attempt."
"They are not the victims of a wall between Europe and the other shore of the Mediterranean."
"They are above all victims of poverty, destitution and oppression."
"They are also, however, the victims of traffickers, of criminal gangs who financially exploit their despair."
"I therefore believe we must work with our partners on the other side of the Mediterranean to fight against these criminal practices and activities."
"These matters are all included in the Hague programme, which also brings this very issue of immigration into the new neighbourhood policy approach."
"I therefore believe that our approach to immigration, especially with our Mediterranean neighbours, must form part of a much more global approach."
"This week, the Justice and Home Affairs Council will hold its first debate on the Commission’s Green Paper, which has also been presented to this House by my fellow Commissioner Mr Frattini."
"It is a green paper on legal immigration."
"I believe we must adopt a partnership approach and try to find solutions for ordered, controlled but legal immigration, which, once people arrive in Europe, will allow them to be integrated and participate fully in life in our society."
". – Mr President, I should like to assure the House that we are very determined to improve cooperation with the Mediterranean countries. This applies to the Euro-Mediterranean platform that has been in existence for ten years, the Action Plans and of course to the Mediterranean peace process also."
"It is true that we have to do everything so that this small, first step of the peace process can be consolidated, and it must be consolidated on both sides."
"Mahmoud Abbas has to dismantle the terrorist structures and get rid of illegal arms and the tunnels."
"The other side must make an effort too."
"I gave both leaders this clear message."
"The Israelis have to do everything possible as well."
"First they have to release prisoners, giving the Palestinians confidence so that they do not use weapons any more."
"The Israelis must also go back to the table."
"They must guarantee freedom of movement for the Palestinian people and for goods."
"Only when the economy starts to flourish can there be a chance for real peace in the Middle East."
"As Mr Brok and Mr Laschet mentioned, we now have to do everything to support this peace process, including politically, within the Quartet."
"I am very proud to be a new member of that."
"The next quartet meeting will be held in London."
"There we can go on supporting this process, step by step."
"Yesterday we talked about it with Condoleezza Rice and President Bush."
"They have now nominated a security coordinator for the area to help address future incidents."
"This is important in order for the process to continue."
"The Gaza disengagement will be very difficult."
"It will now be a coordinated disengagement."
"Sharon has already said this."
"This has been one of the long-standing challenges."
"Now it is a promise."
"We must make financial efforts, too, and give the Palestinians everything."
"I also want to pay tribute to my predecessor, because he supported the Palestinian Authority in very difficult circumstances."
"I particularly wanted to mention that."
"I want to do the same, but of course in a transparent way."
"'Quick Start' projects can be started up on top of what we are already doing as soon as the withdrawal from Gaza begins."
"We provide help in the fields of education, health and job creation, and we often work with UNRWA."
"We will also start up investment projects, for instance with the sea port."
"I have already announced this."
"So, you can see we are not taking this process lightly."
"On the contrary, we take it very seriously."
"My colleague from the Council has already gone into great detail with regard to Lebanon."
"For us, it is very important to show Lebanon that now, the first steps towards a democratic process must be consolidated by elections."
"We are currently considering different options, including election observation and support, but negotiations in that regard are still ongoing with the Lebanese."
"We hope we can make progress."
"Yesterday, we talked about the broader Middle East with Condoleezza Rice."
"This is an excellent opportunity to use the momentum that is there to move ahead with the peace process, our neighbourhood policy, the Barcelona Process and the new American engagement to aim for the same goals."
"All this must be done in parallel."
"We want to make use of what we have already done."
"We have given an enormous amount of money under the MEDA Programme."
"At the end of 2004, EUR 1002 million was committed in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, including EUR 160 million for Iraq."
"With regard to Iraq, payments amounted to EUR 1 125 million."
"In 2004 we committed about EUR 700 million and paid EUR 800 million, so the payments/commitments ratio is 115%."
"Improved performance goes hand in hand with the enhancement of the quality of programmes."
"I appeal to you to support us when it comes to the financial perspectives and the European neighbourhood policy instrument."
"That is the instrument that will really help us to act."
"We gave EUR 320 million to Iraq last year, particularly for health, education and basic needs."
"We have just mentioned another EUR 200 million that we want to give to support the population and the constitutional process."
"We are ready to designate experts that could work together with the United Nations."
"We want to help in the integrated mission for police training, and for training connected with justice and the rule of law in order to enhance institution-building."
"We are also working to build up the ministries of trade and energy."
"I am ready to join my colleagues from the Council and Mr Solana in a Troika and go to the region to support the Iraqis as soon as a new government is in place."
"Yesterday, a new international coordination conference involving the Americans was announced."
"That is an excellent idea for creating a stable and prosperous Iraq in the future."
"I have received six motions for resolutions from six political groups to wind up the debate in accordance with Rule 103 (2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on human rights (Geneva, 14 March to 22 April 2005)."
". Mr President, the European Union played an active part at the sixtieth session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva."
"As in earlier years, it launched the largest number of initiatives: three initiatives on particular topics and ten initiatives on the human rights situation in various countries."
"The sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights comes in a context that is different in a number of respects."
"At EU level, the recent appointment of a personal representative of the Secretary-General and High Representative for Human Rights underlines the importance the EU attaches to strengthening its human rights policy."
"In the context of the United Nations, the publication of the High-Level Panel’s report ‘A more secure world: Our shared responsibility’ triggered a wide-ranging debate on the reform of the UN and of the Commission on Human Rights in particular."
"While the views expressed on the recommendations relating to the Commission on Human Rights differ, everyone is agreed in stressing the need to give it more teeth and, in general, to strengthen the human rights dimension in the United Nations."
"In this new context, the momentum created by the debate on the Commission on Human Rights, together with the hope to which the recent developments in the Middle East have given rise, gives us reason to believe that the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights may make a significant contribution to progress in human rights."
"The European Union in fact believes that the Commission on Human Rights is the main United Nations forum for promoting and safeguarding human rights in the world, and it intends to continue to play an active part and to cooperate with other regional groups there."
"Important as the EU’s activities within the Commission on Human Rights may be, this is nevertheless not the only means at its disposal for promoting human rights."
"Joint positions on human rights, cooperation with other organisations, such as the Council of Europe or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the human rights dialogues with China and Iran are also ways of promoting human rights."
"Talks are still going on about the initiatives to be taken by the European Union at the Commission on Human Rights this year."
"Some decisions have already been taken."
"The EU will be presenting thematic resolutions on religious intolerance, the death penalty and the rights of the child."
"These are three essential subjects."
"In the face of manifestations of intolerance towards believers of any religion whatsoever, the EU intends to reaffirm its determination to combat every kind of intolerance."
"On the matter of the death penalty, the EU believes that its abolition will contribute to strengthening human dignity and is working for its universal abolition."
"It considers the Commission on Human Rights to be an appropriate framework for promoting this objective."
"The promotion and protection of the rights of the child is an important aspect of European Union human rights policy."
"The European Union has decided to present resolutions on the human rights situation in Myanmar, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories."
"Talks on other initiatives to be presented by the EU will continue in the forthcoming meetings of the Working Group on Human Rights, which will be held prior to the session of the Commission on Human Rights."
"At its March meeting, the Council will formally define the EU’s priorities for the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights."
"Apart from its own initiatives, the EU intends to cooperate with any third countries that may launch initiatives for the promotion of human rights, especially in the fight against terrorism or in the context of transnational corporations."
"As in the past, it will seek to encourage the spirit of dialogue that is essential for seeking joint solutions to common problems."
"The European Union hopes it can count on the support of Parliament, whose resolution is far more ambitious than our programme for the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights."
"The Union shares the concerns expressed by Parliament and I can assure you that the issues you have raised will be taken into account in our discussions and in our decisions."
"However, as I said earlier, we have other tools besides action in the Commission on Human Rights alone and we try to find the most appropriate and most effective tool for each situation."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome the input which Parliament is making into the process of EU deliberations prior to the 61st session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) in Geneva."
"It is important that the EU prepares its strategy well and Parliament's resolution and debate serve to stimulate those efforts."
"We are all aware that the EU faces a range of challenges, not least the growing hostility of many UNCHR Member States to the very concept of country resolutions, a development thrown into sharp relief by the rejection of the EU's draft resolutions on Chechnya and Zimbabwe at last year's UNCHR."
"It is my view that such resolutions are a vital aspect of the UNCHR's work, in serving to draw attention to human rights violations and in establishing special rapporteurs who are mandated to investigate and report on such violations."
"It might be expected that, at the very least, the 53 States serving as members of the UNCHR would have seen fit to issue standing invitations to the rapporteurs whose mandates they have helped to create: in fact, only 19 States nominated as UNCHR members in 2005 have done so, eight of which the current EU members."
"Even where States have issued a standing invitation, special rapporteurs are frequently faced with obstruction and inconvenience in the execution of their mandates."
"This is a concern which deserves greater attention in the framework of the European Union's political dialogue with third countries and in our relations with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and other organisations."
"The European Union is reflecting on the country and thematic initiatives which it will bring at the 61st UNCHR and the European Commission is playing a full role in that process."
"I would underline that the EU is responsible for the lion's share of country resolutions and it is not realistic to expect it to expand that list indefinitely."
"We must concentrate our energies on rallying support for our initiatives amongst like-minded countries and the wider membership of the UNCHR in an effort to avert further defeats."
"We are also considering what we can do beyond country initiatives."
"The key issue here is thematic engagement. I am thinking, for example, of a campaign against the death penalty or religious intolerance, or the issue of child rights."
"I would emphasise, however, that the likelihood of defeat does not, in itself, constitute an overriding reason to refrain from running a resolution: as human rights defenders constantly attest, the very act of tabling a draft resolution sends a clear signal to the government and people of the country concerned."
"It is also important that we encourage others to take responsibility for running resolutions on key issues of concern – the lead taken by Switzerland as regards the resolution on Nepal last year is a good example."
"Parliament's resolution also makes the point that the fact that the EU engages in a human rights dialogue should not preclude support for a UNCHR resolution on a particular country: the co-sponsorship by all 25 EU Member States of Canada's resolution on Iran at last year's UN General Assembly Third Committee demonstrates that this principle is not neglected in practice."
"As the EU reaches out to third countries for support for our initiatives, we should also keep firmly in mind the wider context of our relations with many of the UNCHR Member States."
"I note, for example, that the human rights clause contained in the Cotonou Agreement is not solely concerned with the domestic human rights policies pursued by third countries but extends also to respect for human rights in the context of their international policies."
"We must also send out a clear message as to our continuing commitment to supporting the High Commissioner for Human Rights and her office as a critical part of the UN human rights machinery."
"Funding is one part of that and I am pleased to report that a range of projects with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights are in the pipeline this year."
"I shall conclude by underlining the Commission's intention to extend every assistance to the Luxembourg Presidency during what will undoubtedly be a challenging year for the EU in the UNCHR."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the annual sessions of the Commission on Human Rights are always a major event for the international and universal promotion of human rights."
"This cause is fundamental to us, yet we have to be mindful of the public’s consternation at the presence on the Commission on Human Rights of countries that are known as the biggest violators of human rights and that are in fact among the worst dictatorships in the world, such as Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Zimbabwe and China, along with others that have serious human rights problems, such as the Russian Federation, and we all know that this does not apply solely to Chechnya."
"In light of our European tradition in promoting human rights, we must set out a very clear strategy if we are to work in this context."
"In our opinion, this strategy must be based on three key strands, the first of which is the fight against dictatorships."
"Human rights culture is rooted in the fight against authoritarianism, totalitarianism and dictatorships, and there must be no let-up in this fight."
"Unfortunately, over half of the world’s population still does not have the chance to have a Parliament such as this one, and does not enjoy freedom of social or political organisation, and this continues to be a major priority, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Pact on Civil and Political Rights."
"Secondly, I wish to draw attention to two new, modern-day threats to human rights."
"One is terrorism, global terrorism, which we are pleased to see is now addressed from this perspective in Parliament’s resolution."
"Terrorism is often only addressed from the other side."
"The fight against terrorism must not violate human rights – we agree on this – but we must also bear in mind that terrorism, by definition and being a very present threat, is one of the biggest causes of fear, one of the biggest causes of insecurity and, in itself, an extremely violent attack on human rights."
"Lastly, there is a new reality that threatens human rights and that is international crime."
"The dark side of globalisation – the exploitation of children, child labour, the trafficking of women, organ trafficking, the trafficking of human beings – must also be treated as a new threat to human rights."
"I feel that it is on these axes that we must focus our attention."
"We will support the resolution adopted in the Commission, provided some amendments are approved that have split the democratic vote."
"We reserve the right to a final vote."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, human rights are an area of particular concern to the European Parliament."
"The intense debate and the amendments tabled concerning the report voted on this week are evidence of the hard work put in by the political groups to achieve a broad consensus. Consequently, the European Union will be able to play a leading role in the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva."
"For the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Union’s policy on human rights is the main added value of its foreign policy."
"The PSE Group believes that, whilst respecting multilateralism, the Union’s foreign policy is characterised by measures to ensure the recognition of human rights and their promotion and support."
"Europe is charged with rooting out suffering in the world."
"As preparations for the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights get under way, I should like to ask the Commission and the Council to ensure that the European Parliament’s delegation is fully involved in the work and negotiations in Geneva."
"I must emphasise to the Commission and Council representatives present here today that Parliament is a legitimate and credible body and deserves to be treated as such."
"Our presence in Geneva must not be purely symbolic."
"I trust suitable methods of coordination will be set up, to allow us to cooperate in a satisfactory manner."
"This leads me to call on the Council and the Commission to take full account of the specific content of the recommendations contained in this report."
"In particular, I should like to draw attention to Parliament’s hope that the Union will adopt a balanced, consistent and demanding stance at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The approach needs to be discarded."
"Parliament’s report goes beyond recommendations addressed solely to countries in the developing world, and focuses on human rights themselves."
"Consequently, the report argues for abuses and violations of human rights to be denounced wherever they take place, be that in Uzbekistan or in Guantanamo."
"As I conclude, I should like to call on the House to support the introduction of reproductive health rights into this report. I am addressing the more conservative Members in particular."
"Reproductive health rights are crucial when it comes to combating AIDS and guaranteeing other human rights."
"We are in favour of combating not only religious discrimination but also discrimination for reasons of gender or sexual orientation."
". – Mr President, the annual session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva is an extremely important opportunity for the countries of the world to meet and discuss human rights."
"Many states and many people around the world, including dissidents and the oppressed, follow this exercise with very great interest."
"This phenomenon is extremely important to the European Parliament, and so we very much welcome this cooperation between the Commission, the Council and ourselves."
"Of course, the formal aspects of the meeting need to be revised."
"This could perhaps be done in conjunction with the UN overhaul in September."
"For example, it is completely absurd that a rogue State such as Libya has chaired the session on human rights."
"This does not lend any credibility to our work."
"The meetings also need to be better structured, exactly as my fellow MEP, Mr Ribeiro e Castro said."
"Despite the good intentions in Geneva, there is of course a great deal of horse trading, with the really big rogue states, such as Iran and China, often being let off the hook, whereas it is easier to agree on North Korea, for example; which is also a rogue State, of course."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe finds this regrettable and would very much like to see resolutions on those very countries – Iran and China – because they are the worst offenders when it comes to the infringement of human rights."
"We are also very anxious about the situation in Darfur and regret that the abuses and genocide there are not being put before the International Criminal Tribunal."
"There is a large number of topics and countries that could be discussed, and the excellent report by Mrs Flautre, which has our support, states Parliament’s priorities."
"I should just like to highlight Chechnya, Zimbabwe and Colombia on behalf of the ALDE Group."
"It is also very important that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, her staff and various bodies be given sufficient resources to enable them to work on the issue."
"The three subjects that the EU is to pursue are very good, and have our support."
"We should also have liked to see one on freedom of speech in relation to journalists."
"Last year, more journalists than ever were killed on the job, and large numbers of them are in prison around the world."
"The courage of these people is essential to our learning of human rights abuses, and it is thus a prerequisite for the session in Geneva."
"For that reason, it is our duty not to forget the work they do."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, you rightly referred to the many initiatives taken by the European Union at the sixtieth session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"I agree, but I also remember what Shirin Ebadi said following that sixtieth session."
"Speaking of the silence on Iran and on the human rights situation in Iran, she said: ‘silence is an insult to the victims’."
"Those words have stayed with me and I believe we must also remember that at that sixtieth session a number of countries, among them China, Zimbabwe and Cuba, took extremely strong initiatives with a view to stripping the Commission on Human Rights of its substance."
"The European Union must be particularly vigilant in the face of such extremely damaging strategies on the part of some countries."
"I hear what you say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, about us having several instruments available – I am thinking of China."
"But why should they be mutually exclusive?"
"For countries such as these, the European Union’s credibility, its effectiveness, lies in showing that it does not have double standards: yes, it has several instruments, but they are not mutually exclusive."
"I believe Parliament’s resolution will help to make the European Union’s activity more cohesive and coherent; at any rate, that is what everyone who has spoken in this House wants."
"We have emphasised a number of rights that are considered new rights, third generation rights."
"It would be much to the European Union’s credit and advantage to emphasise those rights, which are connected with globalisation."
"I am thinking of human rights, the rights of man and the responsibility of transnational corporations."
"The UN is working on these questions; the European Union could encourage and support it."
"We have also spent a long time debating the right words for the fight against terrorism, which remains a cause for anxiety in many respects, as Mr Ribeiro pointed out."
"We would like the States to be given recommendations by the UN on counter-terrorism, because we find there are serious failings in this area."
"I will end very quickly on the question of journalists in war zones."
"We are talking about a dramatic situation that everyone finds moving."
"I do not believe the international machinery for protecting such journalists is coherent and effective enough and we ought to give this question some thought, too."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation of the full and accurate report."
"I nevertheless seem to detect a kind of reverence and a respectful distance – which I also felt during the speeches given by the Commission and the Council – when certain powerful quarters are named, when it is they who are responsible for the failure to uphold human rights."
"In particular, with reference to Iraq, injustices and violence must be condemned with equal force whatever their origin, whether terrorists or the occupying Anglo-American forces are involved."
"If prison conditions really were the measure of a society’s level of civilisation, then the West would be in a terrible state in view of situations such as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo."
"In this case it is not enough to ask the United States to clarify the situation."
"Here there is nothing to clarify but we have a political and moral duty to voice a firm condemnation."
"I also believe that in Afghanistan too, infringements of human rights should be condemned, including when they are carried out by international forces."
"Moreover, the United States should be called on to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."
"The law must be equal for all and no one must have any kind of international immunity."
"We recently voted to start negotiations with Turkey, and thereby contracted a debt which we must honour: namely, to continue monitoring, day after day, how the situation develops – not just in the legislative field but also in everyday policy – with regard to respect for human rights, in particular those of the Kurdish population, political recognition and a commitment to finding a solution to this conflict, and also recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and withdrawal of troops from the northern part of the island."
"These issues must be explicitly set out in the report."
"Human rights must also be interpreted in a broader sense: we cannot only condemn violence and the death penalty when individuals are concerned, while overlooking entire political decisions that condemn millions of people to death."
"I refer to the liberalist economic and financial policies which force, for example, 800 million people to live on less than a dollar a day and deny tens of millions of people access to treatment for AIDS."
"In the Amazon, where 20% of the entire planet’s freshwater flows every day, tens of thousands of people in Manaus have no access to drinking water because the service has been privatised."
"That is an example of how our model of development violates the most important human right, that is, the right to existence."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to human rights, I would like to take the opportunity to mention a ."
"I am not referring to an actual person, but to peoples’ right to self-determination which, unfortunately, is very often hidden, ignored, trampled on and violated."
"Too often, when we speak of human rights, we only refer to the rights of individuals, whose freedom, integrity and health must – quite rightly – be respected."
"The rights of peoples are, however, just as important, and one of the most important of these is the right to self-determination."
"This is why, as I found no trace of it in the report, I have tabled an amendment to rectify this omission, and hope that it will be received favourably by my fellow Members from all political parties."
"An excellent report, which reflects the criticism of the current state of human rights in the world."
"The report also includes documents guaranteeing citizens their rights."
"I am surprised that the priorities do not include the undignified position of women and the failure to guarantee their rights."
"Our problem is, however, that we sometimes notice failures to observe human rights elsewhere in the world but we do not notice them in our own environs."
"We assuage our consciences with the fact that we have instruments of justice, by means of which citizens can insist upon their rights."
"We tend to forget that Lady Justice is sometimes lazy and it takes her a long time to make decisions."
"Basic human rights include political rights."
"Political ethics are lacking if we fail to acknowledge such rights for our political rivals."
"Mr President, I am talking about the undignified position of the non-attached members in this Parliament."
"We are able to work, thank you, but we are not included in your Hontov system."
"This seems to be solely for the elite, or is it just one of those documents which subscribes to the principle of winner takes all?"
"Mr President, I was very aggrieved when the President of the European Parliament did not have a seat at the table for the negotiations with President Bush."
"I was very pleased that the situation was rectified, because it was not just matter of the personal position of Mr Borrell, it was a matter of the position of the President of the European Parliament."
"I therefore ask that you do not see my contribution as relating to individual people but to our voters, who are entitled to respect."
"Mr President, high standards of human rights are part of the of the EU, both internally and internationally, in its foreign and development policies."
"I am, however, a little cynical when I see references to the UN Human Rights Commission, whose current membership includes Saudi Arabia, which publicly beheads people for drug and alcohol offences; Cuba, which executed three people last year for attempting to flee the country in a hijacked ferry and locks up political dissidents, and Zimbabwe, which is a dictatorship in which press freedom is suppressed and people are subject to arbitrary arrest and torture."
"Ironically, all three countries are cited in the resolution."
"This is reflected in the 'no action' taken over Zimbabwe and China, where there is extensive use of the death penalty, even for such crimes as corruption, pimping, drug offences and tax fraud, its systematic torture of dissidents and its restrictions on freedom of speech, including the Internet, and religious practice, getting off the hook."
"China also has a nasty habit of sustaining brutal regimes like Sudan, Burma and North Korea, irrespective of the atrocities they commit, on the basis of non-interference in their internal affairs."
"Nevertheless, the UNCHR is the only international vehicle we have for promoting human rights globally, so we must stick with it."
"I welcome the bulk of this resolution, in particular the defence of the state's duty to protect its citizens against terrorism and the need to continue dialogue on human rights with countries such as Iran, whose track record is appalling with the recent execution of a 16-year-old girl for sexual misdemeanours."
"I also take issue with listing India, which is a democracy and subject to the rule of law, being in the same list as China and Zimbabwe."
"The Indian State actually practices positive discrimination in favour of the lower castes."
"Some recognition must also be given to Uzbekistan and President Karimov's recent undertakings that there have admittedly been excesses in his country in the fight against Islamist terrorists, but he now wishes to free up the press, establish an independent judiciary and abolish the death penalty."
"These are serious considerations."
"I feel strongly that we must encourage countries and their leaders who are not totally beyond the pale to move in the right direction and reward them for it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the violation of human rights in Belarus, one of the countries that shares borders with the European Union."
"According to a report on human rights violations in 2004, published on the Internet by the independent Belarussian civil initiative Charter 97, approximately 1 500 people were detained or arrested for political reasons in Belarus last year."
"Approximately 20 newspapers were closed, and three opposition politicians were sentenced to several years’ imprisonment."
"The political regime of President Lukashenko exerts control over the media and violates basic human rights, civil rights and political freedoms."
"The Belarussian people are denied the right to independent information as well as the right of political parties to conduct their affairs freely and the right to freedom of assembly."
"In February of this year, Belarus was also the scene of protests relating to economic issues."
"Everything indicates that the situation in that country will become more critical as a result of the presidential elections that must take place no later than September 2006."
"Lukashenko will run for the third time in these elections."
"It should be remembered that the referendum held last year, which did not comply with any democratic principles, allowed him to hold this position for life."
"On the other hand, the civilian population in Belarus is rousing itself, above all under the influence of the democratic breakthrough in Ukraine."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am saying this as a representative from Central Europe, and as a former leader of Solidarity, the trade union that began a peaceful revolution in Poland 25 years ago, guided by the idea of human rights."
"The European Parliament must not resign itself to the creation of a new curtain on the borders of the European Union, this time separating a democratic Europe in which citizens can develop freely from an authoritarian Europe in which political regimes violate basic human rights."
"We must remember that the flag of the European Union has become a symbol of freedom and hope for a better world in Belarus."
"We must bear in mind those young people who on St Valentine’s Day distributed light-blue ribbons with gold stars on the streets of cities in Belarus."
"The heart of Europe now beats in Minsk, and the fate of democracy on the European continent is being decided there."
"Mr President, fortunately, there are other bodies, apart from the UN Commission on Human Rights, that are concerned with this problem."
"This leads me to make two comments."
"The first is that we might find it useful, in the context of the interinstitutional dialogue with the presidency, the Commission and the European Parliament, to ask ourselves just how useful the UN Commission on Human Rights really is, and to question the sometimes surprising presidencies it appoints, and the virtual absolution it grants to its members."
"It may be that the presence of the Union will result, not in blackmail, but rather in a re-examination of the real usefulness of the Commission."
"I believe that we could use our place within the Commission to attempt to push it towards fairer solutions."
"My second comment concerns effectiveness."
"I note, Mr President, that you proposed that we should actually restrict the number of subjects and countries concerned, and that seems quite sensible to me."
"The fact is, however, that the resolution tabled by Mrs Flautre is pretty well exhaustive, so that one could take one’s pick."
"I see it includes the rights of children, religious intolerance and the death penalty."
"Allow me to add two further subjects which we could include, namely freedom of expression, because it is an essential catalyst in the development of human rights, and slavery in all its forms."
"As for the countries involved – Korea, Burma and Palestine – it seems to me essential to add to the list the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which causes the equivalent of a tsunami every three months, with 3.6 million deaths since 1992 in an atmosphere of general indifference, and finally Darfur, which is really starting to be the ‘forgotten man’ in this context."
"We could concentrate our efforts on these five subjects and these five countries."
"– Mr President, the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights represents an opportunity to tackle some outstanding issues."
"The European Union must sponsor specific resolutions on matters such as the situation in Colombia, corporate responsibility in the area of human rights, and the right to self-determination for forgotten peoples such as those of Tibet and the Sahara. Resolutions concerning discrimination for reasons of sexual orientation or gender must also be supported, in line with the Brazilian initiative."
"As an essential pre-requisite to membership, governments must first be required to have ratified the main treaties concerning human rights. They must also have fulfilled all the requirements concerning information, applied the recommendations adopted by the bodies charged with monitoring those treaties and issued open invitations to UN experts in human rights."
"A determined effort will be required to tackle these matters, and I urge the European Union to take them seriously."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, between 14 March and 22 April, the UN Commission on Human Rights will be holding its 61st annual meeting in Geneva."
"We can only hope that the Commission will be guided by strict ethical and objective criteria alone and will no longer be influenced by considerations more akin to cynical than to the defence of human rights."
"This was, unfortunately, all too often the case, and it was clear to everyone how the United Nations in general and the UNCHR in particular applied double standards."
"That was the case during the Cold War and I fear that this is still true of the UNCHR to some extent today."
"Last year, for example, during its 60th session, the UN Human Rights Commission rejected the resolutions on Zimbabwe, which the European Union helped to submit, as well as the resolution on China."
"With regard to those countries, the UN went as far as to adopt what is referred to as a no action motion."
"Could it be that in some cases – I am mainly thinking of China – the concern over human rights on the part of the UN bureaucrats decreases proportionately as the economic interest of the countries in question increases?"
"We hardly dare to imagine, but certainly in the case of China, it is striking how there are those who, time after time, apply double moral standards."
"China is the world leader when it comes to death sentences and executions, yet that does not appear to stop various EU Member States from pushing aside major ethical principles and keeping quiet about human rights when the Chinese leaders come to visit Europe."
"Of course, major deals are yet to be clinched – Airbus springs to mind – and it is, of course, considered more expedient to keep quiet about that troublesome Dalai Lama or those awkward Taiwanese."
"Those double moral standards are also being applied to Turkey, as speakers from different groups in this House have pointed out on different occasions over the months whenever this became topical."
"Accession negotiations with Turkey had to begin, by hook or by crook, and despite the persistent reports about countless cases of torture, about taking away the freedom of opinion and assembly, about the state’s policy of denial of the Armenian genocide, about the permanent occupation of Northern Cyprus, it was inconsistent with the truth that Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria."
"These are only two examples to illustrate that in this world, still takes precedence over the major democratic and ethical principles to which no more than lip service is being paid."
"Neither the UN, nor our own EU, are credible disciples or moral philosophers in this respect."
"Mr President, if the European Union really wants to make a difference on human rights, it has to start to get serious."
"For millions of people, the key to a better future, economic development, and to the much-needed improvement in human rights is good governance, and yet there is reluctance on the part of the European Union to confront regimes that are serial abusers of their people."
"In Africa, and this is a continent to which the European Union apparently attaches special importance, a very clear test case of the seriousness of our resolve is Zimbabwe."
"For years the people of Zimbabwe have suffered under the vicious, bigoted and corrupt Mugabe regime."
"This Parliament has been consistent, through many resolutions, in its call for robust action against Mugabe and those who keep him in power."
"I am sorry to say that the Council's reaction has been limp-wristed."
"At least last week Council renewed its targeted sanctions, but these are not being applied with any real vigour; they are not hurting Mugabe's cronies."
"With elections in Zimbabwe just five weeks away, simply renewing existing EU sanctions does not send a clear message to the regime that it must change for the better or face the consequences."
"It was disappointing that the Union failed to take the opportunity to threaten further specific sanctions should violence, oppression and intimidation mar the elections in Zimbabwe."
"Conditions in Zimbabwe are appalling."
"The opposition MDC has no access to the state-controlled media, its meetings are disrupted and there are over 400 court cases pending against MDC candidates."
"The voters' rolls are out of date, the opposition has no idea where polling stations will be and to get food, people are forced to attend Mugabe's rallies."
"No robust international observer mission has been invited and there are arrests of the few remaining international journalists."
"At the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the EU should sponsor a specific resolution on Zimbabwe and, in any case, use all means at its disposal over the coming vital weeks to ensure free and fair elections in that benighted country."
"Mr President, a debate about Europe’s commitment to worldwide respect for human rights in a UN context would not be complete without it being stated that one in five people, mainly women, still have no access to food, water, health care or basic education."
"I consider this to be a worldwide violation of human rights."
"The Millennium Goals are the concrete objectives to which Heads of Government across the world have committed themselves in a UN context in a bid to improve that situation."
"Five years after this ambitious plan, we have to conclude that those objectives are a long way from being met."
"By 2015, all children, and girls in particular, should be attending school."
"That, in practice, appears to be an empty shell."
"The right to development is being denied to many."
"It is now up to the EU finally to deliver on those Millennium Goals in the spirit of putting your money where your mouth is."
"Most Member States are a long way off the 7% mark of development cooperation."
"The European Union is still a long way from meeting its pledge to spend 20% of the development budget on basic education and basic health care."
"When we come to set down the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 – which involve billions – it is these that we should make into the real human rights issues."
"If those objectives are met, 500 new people can escape from extreme poverty, more than three hundred million people can live without hunger, thirty million children can be saved from premature death, two million fewer mothers will die in child birth, one hundred million more girls and young women will be able to attend school."
"That is respect for human rights."
"Mr President, someone once described the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva as the annual human rights circus."
"After all, in recent years, it has turned out several times that the show has been run by countries that are known for violating human rights."
"By concluding strategic alliances, they stand by each other and even manage to give each other pats on the back."
"It is high time the make-up of the UNCHR, as well as its voting procedures, were subjected to a thorough overhaul."
"If not, it is at risk of being sunk by its own lack of credibility."
"The European Union also carries a major responsibility in this."
"It must work towards more coherence and more consistency in its human rights policy."
"The EU should finally play a pioneering role, so that the 61st session does not end up being an unnecessary ceremony, but an efficient and credible consultation producing fair, and above all, concrete, results."
"Mr President, as we prepare for the Geneva meeting, it must be said that it has been a tough year for human rights around the world."
"At the same time as focusing our attention on various details, we should still make very specific mention of the leading violators of human rights, China and Russia."
"It is only right that Parliament should not be silent on the Chechnya question, for example."
"Regarding China, I would like to mention a small detail: two words that cause immense suffering."
"These two words of accusation can destroy the innocent lives of peace-loving citizens."
"Using the concept of the ‘Evil Cult’ as a pretext, the authorities in China arrest and imprison countless numbers of people."
"Their only crime is belonging to a religious community."
"These people are not responsible for civil disorder and do not pose a threat to others."
"They are simply asserting their basic human rights: in this case the right to assemble and practise a religion."
"The ‘Evil Cult’ is, as a concept, much too vague to be regarded in any way as reasonable grounds for arrest or imprisonment."
"As is often stated, our policy on China and Russia is closely tied to factors connected with policy on trade and energy."
"Sometimes I cannot help wondering what the future will bring in this regard."
"What will growing dependence on, and the need for, energy, which is already the norm in the EU, mean for European human rights policy?"
"At the moment we are 50% dependent on energy imported from outside the EU, and, according to the Commission’s calculations, that will rise to 70% by 2030."
"It has already been mentioned here that expressions of concern by Parliament and in particular the Member States have in certain cases come up against the passivity of the Member States of the Union and the commercial interests operating in the background."
"If that is what the situation is like now, how far will we go when our dependence increases and we are competing more and more alongside China and India for Russia’s energy resources?"
"Unless we realise this and identify the risk inherent in the situation we are in, the result may be an inadvertent weakening of our human rights policy."
"It could close mouths when they should be open."
"We need a pre-emptive strategy which takes our weaknesses and inclinations into account in our desire for a diplomatically comfortable existence."
"The debate is suspended."
"The debate will resume at 3 p.m."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, I would simply like to say that I am occupying a seat on the committee chairmen’s bench to which I am not entitled, because I am no longer a committee chairman, while Mr Jean-Marie Cavada, who is the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is sitting up in the gods."
"I hope that the officials will correct this situation, so that I can sit in a place more suited to my humble station and Mr Cavada can occupy a position appropriate to the dignity of his office."
"The relevant departments will certainly note your comments."
"In the meantime however, you, together with your colleague, may remain in your current seats, and this will not even affect the use of the voting cards."
"We will of course deal with this matter."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission declares that, with a view to ensuring that business operators in the European Union are not placed at a competitive disadvantage to business operators outside of it, it will involve business representatives and trade federations in the legislative process that will lead to the adoption of provisions allowing the amendment of the Community Customs Code."
"This will include those where provisions resulting from international agreements may be granted by publishing relevant documents and draft legal texts for meetings of the Customs Code Committee on the Europa website, so that traders and trade federations can make their views known to the Commission and the committee before a decision is taken."
"Secondly, the Commission will hold regular consultations on specific issues with a trade contact group that is already established and is made up of representative European trade federations."
"Thirdly, representative trade experts will be involved in committee proceedings in accordance with Article 9 of the rules for the committee procedures."
". Mr President, two minutes is too long to summarise the substance of the work we have carried out."
"Everyone is aware of the merit of the proposal and it is commendable that we have managed to reach an honourable compromise between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, which means that Parliament can vote – I hope with the broadest possible majority – for this report."
"The signal is clear: Europe is committed to considering vocational training one of its trump cards in order to win the battle of international competition, and to this end it is sending out a message to the enterprises and individual countries of the Union."
"This message has an intrinsic value which, if supported by a unanimous decision of Parliament, would take on even more importance."
"President Yushchenko, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure, on behalf of the House, to give a warm welcome to Mr Yushchenko and to offer him our most sincere congratulations on his election to this high office."
"We had hoped to welcome Mr Yushchenko to the House on 27 January. As you will recall, however, it snowed heavily on that day, disrupting transport across much of Europe."
"Today also happens to be your birthday Mr Yushchenko, and on behalf of the House I would like to wish you many happy returns of the day."
"We all have birthdays from time to time, but we are not all called upon to play a leading role in events such as those your country has just experienced."
"I should also like to welcome the large delegation from Ukraine seated in the official gallery."
"Mr President, the recent election in your country confirmed that the people of Ukraine have embraced democracy. They gave ample proof of their maturity and showed their determination to work for peace and progress in the future."
"I am sure that the images of the mobilisation of your fellow citizens at the end of last year are still fresh in our minds and will remain so for a long time. We are impressed too by the ambitious democratic and economic reforms you plan to undertake."
"The task ahead of you will not be easy, but you can be assured that the European Union will support you."
"I would remind you that on 13 January this year, the House adopted a resolution calling, and I quote, ‘on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to consider, besides the measures of the Action Plan, within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy, other forms of association with Ukraine giving a clear European perspective for the country and responding to the demonstrated aspirations of the vast majority of the Ukrainian people, possibly leading ultimately to the country’s accession to the EU.’"
"This was the European Parliament’s standpoint. I am simply repeating what the House adopted, putting the seal on a process in which we have all been very much involved."
"We believe that the 12 days of the Orange Revolution served to do more than demonstrate the strength of the longing for democracy in your country, Mr Yushchenko. They also demonstrated the European Union’s ability to take political action in its immediate vicinity."
"There are therefore two reasons for us to rejoice. We can celebrate what you have achieved in Ukraine, and we can congratulate ourselves for the part that, as a political entity, we played in bringing it about."
"This all constitutes a further reason to welcome you in our midst, albeit for a short time."
"I wish you a pleasant stay in Strasbourg, Mr Yushchenko, and give you the floor."
"(1). Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and a great pleasure for me to address you here in this Chamber."
"The European Parliament is a symbol of democracy within the European Union and democracy is the value that unites all of us today."
"Democracy is the cornerstone on which our prosperity is built, as is the case with every country which has chosen the path of democracy and freedom, and for our entire continent which was enabled to build a union of free countries."
"I am therefore very proud to be able to address the European Parliament."
"I am also very proud to be able to be representing a country that has created a new symbol within the European continent."
"The Berlin Wall was pulled down and our Orange Revolution too became a new symbol within a democratic Europe."
"All this means that totalitarianism will no longer be possible on our continent."
"Our people were able to choose the path of freedom and truth, showing that they were able to fight and to do their utmost to live in a Europe which is united and free."
"The borders of Europe now extend from Lisbon to beyond Kiev."
"We have chosen the European civilisation."
"It is not just a question of geography, it is a question of our spiritual values, of our shared moral values too."
"In my country we have seen the President elected democratically for a second time and this time it has happened in a transparent and democratic way."
"Democracy won the day even though it cost the people of my country and me myself a lot of effort."
"This victory became possible because we saw the development of a proper civil society in Ukraine."
"Journalists, politicians, businessmen, judges, public servants, all became mobilised, thanks to the establishment of what is almost a new nation, that is to say Ukraine."
"You in the European Parliament should consider yourselves the godfathers and godmothers of that newly-born democratic Ukraine."
"During those unforgettable days of the Orange Revolution your support was of great encouragement, a great symbol for us, helping us in our struggle against the fear we knew during the month of December, which was a very difficult month to live through."
"Here in the European Parliament we heard, we understood, that a new democratic society was possible within Ukraine."
"A new page of the European history book was being turned."
"In true Ukrainian fashion I would like to thank you for your support and for your struggle for our freedom."
"Thank you, all of you."
"Dear friends, we are here together."
"Ukraine still needs to do much to become a full member of the European family but we have already attained our main objective."
"We are now united by shared values."
"We have a shared history."
"We have shared aspirations."
"These things unify us and this feeling of unity is so much more important than mere statements that people make."
"My country today has embarked upon a path of new reforms."
"This process reminds me of the process of making bread: you need good ingredients, you need hard work."
"When the dough is ready it then depends on how you shape it for it to become a good loaf."
"For us in Ukraine, our objective for this bread is that it be shaped by the new standards and new values adopted in accordance with European standards and values."
"European integration is the only true path open to Ukraine."
"Over recent days we have already moved towards integration into the European Union."
"We have chosen our strategic and political path in that direction."
"Over and above words, we need to see action."
"In the past, democracy, the rule of law and even the media were very difficult in Ukraine."
"There was a lot of corruption."
"That forced the people out into the streets and into the squares to call for better conditions, for internal reforms to take place and for us to move towards the European Union."
"Ukraine and the European Union should not forfeit this single and unique opportunity."
"We appreciate your commitment to grasping this historic opportunity."
"By adopting its resolution on 13 January this year the European Parliament has shown how visionary it is by recommending to the Council, the Commission and the Member States that they support Ukraine in its European aspirations."
"I believe that the extension of the Ukraine action plan is an extremely positive gesture."
"We, in Ukraine, will do everything we can to implement the provisions of the action plan from our side."
"I would emphasise once again how we will do our utmost to achieve this."
"It is one of the most important tasks ahead for my government."
"Ukraine will do its utmost so that we can now conduct a joint analysis, enabling us to show how much progress we have made."
"I hope that in the year 2007 it will be possible for us at the end of the action plan to begin negotiations for membership and that we could open up the process of negotiations for membership in that way."
"The neighbourhood policy already seems to have been overtaken by events."
"The scope and dimension of our relations should be based on the fact that Ukraine is an integral part of a united Europe already."
"Once again I emphasise that we feel that our cooperation with the European Union is situated very much within the framework of the action plan, but going beyond the neighbourhood policy and we are proposing that, as of now, we undertake actions with a view to the future membership of Ukraine in the European Union."
"We know the position of our partners who propose that different scenarios be developed."
"We feel that it is important for our own aspirations to be supported."
"My final objective and that of my country and my government is for Ukraine to join the European Union."
"The final outcome of the conclusion of the action plan, which we are fully prepared to implement faster than was originally planned, could then allow for the creation of an association agreement."
"Ukraine can make an official request on the basis of Article 49 of the European Union Treaty, and we can do our utmost to meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"I would emphasise once again that we understand that most of the work for joining the European Union will fall to us."
"We are the ones who have to make the effort, and if we cannot implement quick reforms, the European Union will not be able to help us."
"Nobody can do that work for us."
"My government has already drawn up an action plan for the next five years, with the ultimate objective of our joining the European Union."
"The Deputy Prime Minister responsible for European cooperation is currently drawing up all the detailed aspects of that action plan."
"We shall be doing our best to ensure that we have a transparent economy, an economy that works, to alleviate taxes, fight against corruption, and ensure that the judiciary and the media are independent."
"During my presidency, there will be no talk of the infringement of human rights in Ukraine."
"Our ambition for European integration requires us to make progress in the reforms that I have just listed."
"These are important objectives for us and clearly it is going to require much work to adapt our society."
"We will have to adapt our administrative structures to European standards to ensure that people shoulder their responsibilities."
"We want the people of Ukraine to trust the administration again and for them to understand our policies."
"We will be introducing social reforms, reforms in the areas of education and training, and social protection."
"One of the most important priorities is the reform of the judiciary."
"We will be fighting against drug trafficking and illegal immigration and doing our utmost to ensure that our judicial system works properly, based on European standards, and with regard to human rights and respect for the dignity of human beings."
"I am convinced that we can avoid discrimination of any kind being tolerated in our society and in our fight against the scourges with which we are all familiar in Europe."
"Ukraine will continue to fight for the rights of its citizens to become true European citizens, for them to feel that they belong to the European family."
"We shall be doing everything we can to implement things in a meticulous way at all levels, in the economy, in social life and in every area of society."
"We need to ensure that all this is done with a European vision and in a European spirit."
"There is very much a European philosophy underpinning my work and the work of my government."
"I can show you that my government will be moving from words to deeds, and the practical support of the European Union in these endeavours will only be effective if that is the case."
"Now the definitive choice of Europe cannot be refuted by anybody really."
"It is the only path open to us to bring us closer to the European Union."
"It is now time for a decisive step to be taken also vis-à-vis Ukraine."
"The Atlantic Alliance is something that will further assist the creation of civil society, the rule of law and respect for human rights in my country during my presidency."
"We are more interested than anybody in developing our relations also with the Russian Federation, our big neighbour."
"We do not see our moving towards Europe as a problem for Russia because it will help to bring the Russian Federation itself closer to Europe."
"Nobody can say that Ukraine moving towards Europe could prevent us having closer cooperation with our Russian neighbours."
"Do not believe those who say that Ukraine moving into European structures is against the interests of Russia."
"I am convinced that this is not the case and, in fact, the opposite is true."
"If Ukraine were a member of the European Union and NATO, it would not mean that we would use that membership against the interests of Russia and the Russian people."
"A stable Ukraine, just as a stable Russia, is something that should be considered as guarantors for our common and shared values."
"As far as our cooperation with the Russian Federation is concerned, there will be a new regional policy to develop that."
"As far as concrete actions are concerned, we have already begun to undertake such actions with the European Union aimed at a peaceful settlement of the Transnistria dispute."
"We feel that this is a way that we will be able to help to contribute to European values becoming rooted in our region."
"Transfrontier cooperation, energy networks and the like will become ways of fleshing out our cooperation in concrete terms, from Baku to the western frontiers of the European Union."
"In this way we can bring European standards into our region."
"This is clearly one of our priorities."
"We feel that this is the only vision that will enable my country properly to meet these aspirations."
"Dear friends, nothing is guaranteed."
"We have to defend our common values on a day-to-day basis."
"We have to build jointly the walls of the house within which our peoples live."
"Unless a house has solid foundations it will collapse."
"And as it says in the Bible: a house divided against itself cannot stand."
"It is the strength of Europe that is to be found in this unity."
"You, yourselves, have been the witnesses to the emergence of this new colour on the European map - the colour orange."
"You know that Ukraine can also form part of the future of Europe."
"The time has come now for us to work hard; the time has come now for us to take concrete measures."
"It is not going to be easy for us to do this, but I know that, by going together down this path, in this direction, we will be able to achieve our final goal."
"Thank you very much."
"Thank you, Mr Yushchenko. In your address you have restated how history has decreed that the creation of an independent Ukraine should be linked to the creation of a strong political Europe."
"We stood shoulder to shoulder at a critical juncture, and you have made it clear that you wish to continue our association in the future."
"You can be confident that the European Parliament will support your stated desire to create a Ukraine based on political freedom, economic progress and social cohesion, which are the three distinguishing features of European society."
". Mr President, on several occasions there have been lengthy discussions with both the Dutch and the Luxembourg presidencies and an informal trialogue to reach an informal agreement within the procedure under Article 251 of the Treaty."
"I am a little surprised, therefore, that the ALDE Group, having been involved in this, have asked for a split vote."
"If we do not vote in accordance with the block compromise we would be unpicking everything that had been agreed, or the basis of the agreement, in the compromise."
"So I urge people to go for the block compromise and support the first two parts in its entirety."
". Mr President, I have a purely technical point concerning Amendment 13."
"All language versions of this should be made to conform with the Spanish original so that, for example, in English it will read: 'investigate and develop technical control and inspection solutions'."
"Mr President, I beg your attention for a few seconds, because the wording of this oral amendment is different from the one on your voting lists."
"At the end of paragraph 9, after the words ‘asks for an immediate withdrawal of troops from the country as stated in the UNSC resolutions’, I propose that we should add the words ‘and will make that condition a crucial assessment criterion when the time comes to sign the Association Agreement’."
"I shall now read the proposed text in Spanish: ‘Calls on the Council to adopt the decision to organise a Euro-Mediterranean Summit of Heads of State or Government to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process."
"– Mr President, I merely wanted to make a comment concerning the presentation of the oral amendment tabled by Mr Morillon. It has just been voted on and we support it."
"I should like to point out that in view of the agreement that seems to have been reached between all the political groups, the last part of paragraph 9 should become a separate paragraph. I have in mind the reference to sending an electoral observation mission to Lebanon."
"Mr Morillon did not take this into account when tabling his amendment and I think it is important."
". With this further agreement, which the rapporteur endorses, we are taking another necessary step on the road towards fully integrating the new Member States."
"Like the other agreements that have already been concluded, this one gives further proof that the EU’s traditional partners have taken a positive view of the enlargement, a sign that Europe is now an increasingly relevant political entity."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". This recommendation arises from the recent EU enlargement and is intended to incorporate the new Member States into the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement of association between the EU and Egypt, by concluding an additional protocol to this agreement."
"It is similar to other previous recommendations."
"The conclusion of this protocol will, , cover the importation of agricultural products from Egypt to the new Member States that will be subject to its provisions."
"I have supported these association and cooperation agreements. I feel that they will constitute another positive step in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"In addition to focusing on its citizens’ well-being, the EU should also help to make its neighbours economies more dynamic, which, moreover, is in line with its strategy of a ‘European Neighbourhood Policy’ (COM (2004) 373 final), adopted by the General Affairs Council on 14 June 2004."
"I voted in favour."
". – The Commission is proposing that the Council authorise the Member States falling under the EU’s common visa, asylum and immigration policy (including Sweden) to ratify, in the interests of the Community, the Seafarers’ Identity Documents Convention of the International Labour Organisation."
"The Convention does not imply any change to the Regulation governing the area, which expressly lays down exceptions from the visa requirement for civilian sea crews."
"Consequently, it is unreasonable that Member States should need the Council’s authorisation; a view obviously shared by France, which has already ratified the Convention."
"The June List does not, therefore, see anything to prevent the Member States from making their own decisions on whether they wish to accede to the Convention, without authorisation from the EU."
". Following the work already done at first reading, and in light of the cooperative work carried out with the Council, I believe that this report should be adopted, given that the issue before us, relating mainly to a harmonised risk assessment system, strengthens the security of the Community’s external borders, an issue of vital importance to all of us."
"The new challenges and threats to the stability of the international community and, more specifically, that of the European area and its internal market, which have been brought on by the emergence of an increasingly volatile and unpredictable new reality, require us to adopt fresh preventative measures. The aim of this proposal for a regulation amending the Community Customs Code is to incorporate the basic principles underlying the new concept of security management for external borders, including the introduction of a harmonised risk-assessment system."
"Accordingly, the aim is to tighten up security around goods crossing international borders."
"To this end, the proposal redefines the role of customs officers and introduces a mechanism for setting risk-selection criteria at Community level, together with a computerised risk management support system. These elements meet the expectations of European citizens as regards improving general security levels."
"I welcome the adoption of most of Parliament’s proposed amendments adopted at first reading. I am also pleased about the unanimous vote in the committee concerned."
". This report supports a regulation to establish a common framework for the presentation of Community statistics on vocational training in enterprises."
"Although it sounds rather dry, this proposal is to be warmly welcomed as it underpins the policy of lifelong learning as a basic component of the European employment strategy (as acknowledged by the Lisbon European Council in 2000)."
"The report requires Member States to compel enterprises to report on levels of training, it also calls for access to vocational training to be broader so that workers have access to training regardless of their contract type and even if they are employed in businesses with less than 10 employees."
". My view on this issue, like that of the rapporteur, is not entirely devoid of doubts."
"Beginning with the key elements, it strikes me that there is potential conflict in the Council seeking to authorise the Member States to do what, in France’s case, they have already done, particularly in an area in which there is no clear guidance as to whether this power rests with the Community or forms part of the exceptions enshrined in the Treaty."
"Furthermore, the shortcomings that the rapporteur highlights regarding the substance of the convention in question may also make us consider that we should think carefully before adopting it."
"Against this backdrop, one might vote against this report, for the reasons I have stated. There are two factors, however, that have led us not to do so."
"On the one hand, given that it is the Council that wishes to authorise the Member States, the Member States are requesting that authorisation. On the other hand, it is not for Parliament to analyse the efficiency of a convention that is considered efficient by the signatories to it."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report, with the reservations that I have mentioned."
". Article 3(j) of the EC Treaty states that the activities of the Union should include the promotion of coordination between employment policies of the Member States with a view to enhancing their effectiveness by developing a coordinated strategy for employment."
"Furthermore, one of the innovative elements of the Lisbon strategy is the promotion of lifelong learning, and this forms part of all of the Member States’ national action plans."
"A legal basis at European level for compiling comparable data which give a true picture of continuing vocational training must be seen as an essential element both from the point of view of coordination and of what is referred to as effectiveness."
"The regulation before us establishes a common framework for producing Community figures on vocational training in enterprises."
"This will be the decisive factor in the adoption of strategies arising from the promotion of active lifelong learning policies."
"Portugal has already taken steps in this direction, with the introduction of measures into labour legislation under the heading of continuing lifelong learning for workers and companies."
"I voted in favour."
". The Lisbon strategy set out a range of instruments aimed at creating more and better jobs."
"One of those instruments is lifelong learning."
"Lifelong learning is a long way from being a reality for European workers, however."
"Improving vocational skills is not accorded its due merit, even though the Member States place the issue at the heart of reducing unemployment and promoting productivity."
"In the EU of 15, only 8.5% of European citizens enjoyed this professional benefit."
"What kind of figures will we now see in the Europe of 25?"
"We are speaking about something that has little practical substance."
"Because I feel that anything that is not measured cannot be managed, conditions must be created whereby comparable data that will give a true picture of the situation as regards continuing vocational training can be regularly and systematically collected."
"I am also in favour of including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in statistics of this kind."
"Despite the amount of bureaucracy involved, it is worthwhile involving the SMEs in this process, albeit by means of simplified processes, because they account for some 90% of European enterprises."
"Promoting training for our workers and investing in their lifelong employability are sustainable ways of achieving greater competitiveness in the European economy."
". The Member States have negotiated a new version of the Seafarers’ Identity Documents Convention of the International Labour Organisation, aimed at simplifying the formalities involved in going ashore in countries of which they are not nationals."
"Unlike the rapporteur, I am not in the least surprised by the decision to enter biometric data in seafarers’ identity documents, because there can no longer be any doubt that the security of travel documents must be tightened up and that new technology of this kind offers a series of advantages in terms of identifying individuals and preventing documents from being falsified."
"The global aim of this proposal is thus to ally flexibility with security."
"As regards the issue of the ‘model’ chosen, which consists of a fingerprint printed as numbers on a bar code, there is no interoperability problem, either with passports or with visas, since fingerprints will be included in both proposals, hence they are comparable."
"As for the technical discrepancy and the different equipment required, it should be pointed out that this is the least costly solution. Furthermore, we are still waiting for the Commission to table a proposal with the model chosen for the introduction of biometric data on visas, ..."
". Based on the principle that the issue before us is only that of identifying seafarers when they go ashore, we agree with the general thrust, which is that seafarers’ identification documents should be considered sufficient and that no entry visas should be needed, for example when ships are docking or making ports of call and in the previously mentioned cases of transit, transfer or repatriation."
"Furthermore, according to Article 9 of Annex I of Legal Decree No 280/2001 of 23 October, the Portuguese marine registration certificate ‘can constitute a marine identification document for the purposes of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No 108’."
"All that remains, therefore, is the ‘visas’ issue, and in our view they should not be required."
"Consequently we broadly agree with the proposals contained in the report."
"There is one issue, however, that has not been analysed, which is the Commission’s proposal that the Council authorise Member States to ratify an ILO Convention. This is a further example of undermining national sovereignty, and we are opposed to the move."
"It should be pointed out that France has already ratified the Convention concerned, effectively exercising its sovereignty as an independent country, without, of course, asking the EU’s permission to do so."
". Given that only Member States can sign up to International Labour Organisation Convention No 185, the Commission took part in the talks as an observer, proposing that the Council authorise the Member States bound by Community rules in this area (Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, of 15 March 2001) to ratify the Convention in the interests of the Community."
"Despite some reservations of a technical nature (not least with regard to the operational capability of checking by means of biometric data) put forward by the rapporteur, I believe, as he does, that this proposal for a Council decision, if adopted, essentially confers symbolic value on this authorisation."
"If all Member States are entitled to ratify the Convention simultaneously, this will confirm ‘in the eyes of the rest of the world the importance the Community attaches to the Convention’."
"I voted in favour."
"Mr President, we are in the habit of making a lot of noise when it comes to the explanations of vote."
"I would simply like to say that I welcome the adoption of the Wortmann-Kool report, which is probably one of the most remarkable legislative acts of the European Union in recent years."
"Here in this House, in the presence of Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, following the Erika I and Erika II maritime packages, I called for the creation of a European maritime safety zone."
"If ever it materialises, it will have a legal basis and it will be ambitious."
"Never has the European Union gone so far in imposing sanctions of the most severe kind, in other words criminal sanctions, on the pirates of the seas who blight our coastlines and who very often devastate entire livelihoods as well as the flora and fauna of coastal areas."
"I believe we should be very pleased with the considerable progress which has been made, and hope that the Council will now follow it up."
"From now on, no one will be able to put the blame on the European Union, as we witnessed in the case of the and that of the ."
"Member States are now facing up to their responsibilities."
"Personally, I would like them to accept those responsibilities fully, because Europe is not only defending itself in this way against maritime pollution, but also sending out an international message which is even bolder than the MARPOL legislation, and it is in a position to change, throughout the world, the legislation against pollution and against the pirates of the seas."
"I should like to finish by expressing a hope, the hope that the legislation we adopted to prevent the dumping of fuel waste at sea will be revised with the same degree of ambition."
"In my opinion, the only solution is to equip our ports with free fuel-discharge facilities, because with this kind of dumping, as you know, it is naturally difficult to catch the perpetrators, who generally operate at night in foggy weather."
"I believe, therefore, that we ought to set up a system like the one used for disposing of household waste, with a port tax and port discharge facilities, thereby making it possible for all vessels to discharge fuel waste in purpose-built facilities in all European ports."
"If we make this additional progress, I think that we shall then be the world leaders in safety and sanctions against pollution."
"– Mr President, as far as the Wortmann-Kool report is concerned, I should like to report that we New Democracy MEPs voted in favour of the amendment tabled by vice-chairman Mr Varvitsiotis supporting the compatibility of Community law with the MARPOL international convention on questions of culpability in relation to sanctions for accidental pollution."
"We believe that in both territorial and international waters what applies in the MARPOL convention should also apply in Community law and this concerns equal treatment for ships under the law and efficient management of pollution at global level, because shipping is a global activity and must be governed by international conventions."
"Regional measures, wherever they have been applied, have been unproductive and are confusing."
"Similarly, we New Democracy MEPs also supported Amendment 37 which, on the one hand, calls on us to impose a regime of cooperation between the national authorities, because numerous accidents are caused by a lack of cooperation and inadequate exchange of know-how and, on the other hand, stipulates the need for a cost-benefit study to be carried out on the new measures and the new policies which the European Union wishes to apply for the development of maritime transport within the framework of efficient management of waters and their protection from pollution."
". I believe that the EU must act clearly on this issue and must provide a responsible framework of rules for the maritime transport of oil and other noxious liquid substances."
"It is therefore important to combat illegal discharges and to move towards uniform implementation and interpretation within the EU of the international rules in force."
"The proposal for a directive incorporates into Community law a range of international rules governing discharges, based on global agreements (MARPOL) and specifies which contraventions of the discharge rules are criminal offences, providing guidance concerning the nature of penalties to be imposed."
"In light of the fact that MARPOL rules are relevant, clear and reasonable, they should be incorporated into Community law, given the increasingly international nature of maritime transport."
"A further relevant point is undoubtedly the establishment of measures to protect crews, and the possibility of prosecuting others involved in the chain."
"It is essential that the imposition of sanctions should encompass all those responsible for polluting the marine environment."
". The disaster caused by the sinking of the oil tanker is still fresh in the minds of all Europeans."
"The memory of that disaster has led the EU to seek to prevent something of that nature from happening again."
"In addition to addressing the issues involved in preventing maritime accidents, there is also a need effectively to combat deliberate maritime pollution, which is the biggest problem that the oceans face today."
"In this context, discharges from ships on the high seas require particular concern and attention."
"I endorse the view expressed in Spain, France, Italy and Portugal’s declaration to the Council, namely that the EU should go further in combating illegal discharges in the exclusive economic zone."
"In so far as international rules allow, they reserve the right to do so themselves."
"I have doubts as to the legality of laying down criminal standards based on Article 80(2) of the Treaty relating to transport and as to whether the basis presented by the Commission and Parliament would be lawful, given that criminal sanctions must meet the objectives of the European policy on the environment and transport."
". I abstained in the final vote on the proposal for a directive on driving licences, because it is the direct opposite of the ‘better regulation’ which we talk about so much."
"This mass of detail, with so many exceptions, is not an example of good legislation."
"We could even ask ourselves whether we need a European directive in this field at all."
"This over-detailed directive is contrary to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"Why, in this area, can we not accept the principle of the country of origin?"
". – In our opinion, it is a good thing as far as possible to harmonise the rules for, and appearance of, driving licences within the European Union."
"The Commission proposal for a directive has become too detailed, however, as have the amendments tabled in the European Parliament."
"In our opinion, the principle of subsidiarity and the country of origin principle should apply to the provisions governing driving licences for motorcycles and mopeds."
"The validity of driving licences and the need, or otherwise, for medical examinations of their holders are also issues on which we believe in the principle of mutual recognition and have confidence in the Member States’ ability to make well-considered, sensible decisions."
"It is often said that the Member States have to trust each other when it comes to legislation and rules."
"In our opinion, that is also the way it should be with regard to provisions on driving licences."
"We are voting against this report, as we are of the opinion that provisions on driving licences can be harmonised without this detailed proposal for a directive."
"Besides, we already have a directive on driving licences that has regulated the appearance of driving licences issued within the EU."
". ‘Our rapporteur has been at pains to consider the highly diverse views on this extremely controversial subject."
"I endorse his report because his proposal will genuinely improve safety and free movement for road users and offer more opportunities for control in order to reduce the possibilities of fraud."
"It is an outrage that some people in Europe have been driving on forged driving licences for ten, twenty, thirty and more years."
"I am in favour of harmonised rules and driving examinations;"
"I am also in favour of harmonised age requirements, both maximum and minimum, and I have no objection to a provision requiring older persons in the 70+ age group to renew their driving licences more often, which may entail eye and other medical tests."
"However, this should remain a matter for each individual country."
"I personally would endorse the introduction of a single European model of driving licence, that is to say, a plastic 'credit' card type with a microchip inserted, in five years’ rather than in twenty years' time."
"It is undoubtedly the case, though, that road safety in Europe would also be improved if those EU countries which still drive on the left – which is the wrong side, from my perspective – could be induced to abolish this system."
"Sweden proved years ago that switching is possible."
"I would like to be able to drive my car in Ireland without feeling that I am a danger to myself and other road users.’"
". I support the stated objectives of this directive as it now stands, namely to reduce fraud, to guarantee truly free movement of EU drivers and to reinforce safety on European roads."
"I feel the amendments from the European Parliament have improved the proposal."
"Nevertheless, difficulties do remain that can be tidied up, particularly concerning motorcycles, caravans and motor-homes."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Grosch on driving licences."
"Protection against fraud, the free movement of drivers and road safety are key factors in the defence of freedom of movement in the EU."
"This positive idea should not be spoilt by excessive regulation leading to more obligations and obstacles for the drivers concerned."
"If we are to enjoy the benefits of greater freedom of movement, we must accept the harmonisation of the basic rules intended to foster safety on the roads, to prevent fraud and to punish offenders."
"When it comes to beneficial and entirely justified measures such as this one, we must avoid increasing regulatory and bureaucratic constraints, creating additional limitations for those learning to ride motorcycles or creating more restrictive conditions concerning the period of validity or renewal date of driving licences."
"Although the amendments that I endorsed did not secure majority support in this House, I feel that the balance of the text is positive, hence my vote in favour."
". – The myriad models and types of licences that allow a citizen of the Member States to drive a motor vehicle may, in a Community in which freedom of movement is the norm, place worrying constraints on the ability of the Member States’ authorities to exercise control, at the inevitable expense of legal certainty and road safety."
"The European driving licence information network and the mutual recognition of sanctions may be valid ways to help to address the situation."
"Fighting fraud, free movement for motorists and road safety are, in fact, the main issues involved here, and we need to move towards the harmonisation of criteria in order to achieve the same degree of reliability from Lisbon to Nicosia."
"In my view, such harmonisation must take account of the principles of subsidiarity, suitability and proportionality so as to avoid duplicating bureaucracy and creating obstacles to the free movement of people and goods."
"I believe the step-up approach, or progressive access to certain types of vehicle, particularly motorcycles, may have a positive effect in cutting the number of road accidents among young people, and it is worth examining the possibility of introducing it."
"All things considered, I voted for the proposal."
". – I voted for the Sommer report as I believe inland waterway navigation is a key factor in transport intermodality."
"The European Union has a dense network of canals and natural rivers which are not yet being used to their full extent and are worth exploiting in view of the safety and environmental friendliness of this mode of transport."
"This proposal, which is intended to establish a Europe-wide framework for the introduction of inland waterway transport information services, may contribute to improved and more effective traffic and transport management on inland waterways."
"It is time to ensure the interoperability of such services and to lay the foundations for modern supply-chain management."
"Real-time information thus clearly makes the sector more competitive."
"This proposal does not excessively constrain action by the Member States, and it should also lead to significantly less subjective error and fewer accidents."
"The new technologies to which it refers may give the sector a boost and affect the distribution of modes of transport in the economy."
"Intermodal transport systems, which form a basic model for future transport, should therefore take account of the positive role that inland waterway navigation can and must play."
". – This Commission proposal represents a major effort to reduce the excessive demands on our roads, particularly with regard to heavy goods transport in Europe. I have been continually stressing the need for that for a long time now."
"Inland waterway navigation is a safe and environmentally-friendly mode of transport but unfortunately accounts for only around 7% of the freight traffic in the 15 ‘old’ Member States."
"Like inland waterway navigation, coastal navigation also deserves greater attention and promotion."
"Rather than merely being sectors ‘not to be neglected’, as the Commission describes them, both are solutions worthy of promotion and development."
"In addition, the proposal seeks to create a Europe-wide framework for the implementation of inland waterway transport information services, involving the use of modern information and communications services designed to bring about improvements in traffic and transport management on internal waterways."
"The intermodality proposed in Europe’s transport policy and the high levels of environmental protection and quality that we want can only be achieved by revitalising areas of activity that can transform these ambitions into reality."
"I hope, therefore, that this proposal for a directive can be one more step on the road towards a genuine strategy for long-distance sea and inland waterway transport in preference to road haulage."
". – The June List has chosen to vote against the proposal on the recognition of seafarers’ certificates."
"The Swedish Government Offices’ information note 2003/04:FPM113 states that there has been a ‘marked increase in the amount of fraud in connection with the certification procedure’."
"Likewise, the Swedish National Maritime Administration has expressed concern that the right to lay down necessary conditions will be lost if this directive is adopted."
"The June List is fundamentally sympathetic towards the country of origin principle and supports the idea of removing the barriers to the functioning of the internal market."
"In this specific case, there is much, however, to indicate that the European Union is not yet ready to take that step."
"."
"Levelling downwards – that is the technique constantly used by Brussels to harmonise European and non-European legislation."
"In this case it is the certificates issued to seafarers."
"The recognition of certificates issued ‘outside the European Union’ is simpler than the scheme in force within the EU."
"That inevitably leads to the recruiting of more seafarers outside Europe than in it."
"This report recommends that our recognition procedures be simplified, but not that existing procedures outside the EU be brought up to the same standard, which would have had the advantage of limiting the numerous cases of fraud which occur."
"We must not sell off our seafarers’ diplomas and qualifications on the cheap."
"Their occupations are difficult, and the constraints attached to them – low wages, long voyages, restrictive working conditions – certainly do not encourage young people’s interest in training for them."
"This is a market in which there is a growing shortage of qualified workers, and that works to the advantage of a cheap and under-qualified labour force from the countries of Asia and elsewhere in the East."
"We must restore the career ladder, and attach importance to diplomas and qualification certificates, not the contrary."
"Finally, we must abolish flags of convenience on the rust buckets which swarm over and pollute our seas and oceans."
". – I voted for the report by Robert Evans on the recognition of seafarers’ certificates because I believe we need to halt the decline in the number of EU seafarers through measures to protect the freedom of movement of workers in this sector."
"This proposal aims at simplifying the procedure for recognising seafarers’ certificates."
"The proposal would reduce the administrative burden, combat discrimination and promote the mobility of workers in the maritime sector."
"Measures such as those proposed therefore have my support."
". – This Commission proposal is designed to simplify the recognition procedure for seafarers’ certificates because a situation has arisen where the recognition of certificates from outside the EU is now simpler than that of certificates from within the EU."
"The aim is essentially to bring European rules into line with international agreements, namely the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). In particular, the 1978 Convention laid down specific criteria for the recognition of certificates for masters, officers and radio officers issued by the parties."
"I consider it a timely proposal and, of course, I underline the fact that it adopts language proficiency requirements for seafarers – a command of English, which is obviously the international – and provides for mechanisms to prevent fraud in the certification process (Article 5 of the Commission proposal)."
"Reducing the burden of regulation for workers in this sector in Europe is another positive aspect of this proposal."
"Mr President, I will be very brief."
"I want to give an explanation of vote on behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party as to why it abstained on the amended proposal and then voted for the legislative resolution."
"Our explanation of vote is very simple."
"We believe that joint deployment plans are important for the effectiveness of the agency's work."
"That is why we voted for those amendments."
"Amendment 36 to 43 clarify the rule of the agency in implementing these joint deployment plans and they also give an appropriate role to Regional Advisory Councils."
". The setting up of a Community institution to ensure a certain level of coordination in the work of national fisheries inspectors is a useful initiative."
"What is crucial, however, is the scope of the competences of the institution that is set up, and its mandate."
"I cannot vote in favour of the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"Control of such matters falls under the jurisdiction of the Member States, both practically and in legal terms, and the proposal for a regulation violates the equilibrium between the institutions."
"Another aspect of the common fisheries policy is the protection of aquatic resources."
"The Lisbon strategy states that sustainable development entails paying attention to both the ecological and social factors of this development."
"By protecting aquatic resources, we also protect the people who make their living from these waters."
"We should review overly ambitious conservation plans that only allow for short periods for the renewal of fish stocks, as is in the case with the cod stocks in the Eastern Baltic."
"The period that has been agreed on gives rise to unacceptable social tensions."
". – I congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the important and timely report she has produced on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy."
"I give it my full support, particularly since the proposed changes seek to clarify the role of the agency as a facilitator, particularly in the context of the formulation of joint deployment plans, which involve a pooling by Member States of their control and inspection resources, as well as the nature of the functions performed by the Fisheries Monitoring Centre."
"The establishment of the agency deserves our full support, since its role will be that of a facilitator of fisheries plans to be drawn up by Member States for the inspection and control of their resources."
"It will be a support body for the implementation of the new common fisheries policy, which will help to create more uniform and effective control and inspection procedures."
"For it to function effectively, however, an operational organising structure needs to be set up to act as a facilitator of the whole procedure."
"."
"Brussels loves agencies."
"There are agencies for everything, from the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen to the European Food Safety Agency in Parma, via the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao."
"Now there will also be a Community Fisheries Control Agency, in other words a real European Fisheries Ministry."
"This FBI of the sea will have the task of coordinating the control and inspection activities of Member States in the fisheries sector."
"It will be the strong arm of a control system which has been, until now, somewhat modest."
"Parliament wanted such a control system both in Community waters and in international waters."
"Multinational inspection teams will therefore be created, at sea and on land."
"The agency will be able to charter and operate surveillance vessels, which it will place at the disposal of observers."
"Yet who will those observers be?"
"They will be inspectors from other countries, unfamiliar with national regulations, and this constitutes a refusal to acknowledge each Member State’s own competence."
"They will therefore be able to inspect, without necessarily finding infringements, without necessarily improving control."
"Thus, in the territorial waters of sovereign states, it will no longer be a matter of simply reinforcing Community sovereignty but also of strengthening foreign sovereignty."
". Common fisheries policy rules must be implemented effectively and in a uniform way."
"Strengthening control was one of the key priorities of the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy."
"I therefore welcome this proposal to establish a fisheries control agency."
"I believe that this agency should be established without delay."
"I did have some problems with the text as adopted by the Fisheries Committee."
"This Parliament from the outset has championed the cause of including fishermen and their legitimate representatives in the decision making process."
"In this context Parliament gave a resounding approval to my report on Regional Advisory Councils, or RACs, as they are known."
"It should be no surprise to anyone that fishermen will have the greatest interests in this agency."
"And yet they are being inexplicably excluded from the proceedings."
"I believe that there is a vital need for transparency in this issue. I therefore submit that fishermen must be included."
"I believe that the overriding consideration is that the agency must operate in strict conformity with Community interests."
"I believe that the question of voting rights in this new agency should not be used as a subterfuge to allow the Commission to dominate proceedings."
". – The issue of fisheries is of great importance for Europe as a whole, but above all it is especially important for Portugal, because, in this respect, the interests of our country are not always adequately safeguarded by Community policies."
"The regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency therefore deserves particular attention."
"Although the Member States will retain control over fishing activities, the fact is that the Commission is responsible for the operational coordination of monitoring activities and, above all, has the common interest to protect."
"We must therefore focus on the way in which this common interest is pursued, without forgetting the need for full compliance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"The resources needed to achieve that have to be guaranteed, especially in the case of Portugal in view of its vast EEZ."
"Lastly, I must admit to having certain reservations, because there is a risk that the establishment of a new Community agency will result in some overlap of functions and duplication of costs."
". – It has been common practice to establish Community agencies whenever the importance and sensitivity of particular topics seem to require the European Union to examine and respond to them more quickly and effectively."
"I am afraid that the practice will continue and will extend to topics the effective scope of which does not deserve such an investment in terms of human and material resources."
"That does not seem to be the case with the Agency proposed here, which may be an asset to the sector if the principles guiding its establishment are taken into account."
"I must, however, warn against the risk of centralisation and loss of powers by the Member States. I believe they should retain their essential powers in this area without any undue imposition or regulation by the Agency, which should take particular care to comply with the principle of subsidiarity."
"To that end, I believe it would have been beneficial if the draft report had unequivocally delimited its competences and the functions of each of its sections."
"UK Conservatives abstained on the vote on the creation of a centralised Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo in Spain for the following reasons: Firstly, the policy of centralising fisheries control is politically part of the integrationist agenda of the European Commission which as Conservatives we oppose."
"Secondly, we accept that in the event of a Conservative government withdrawing from the CFP and returning fisheries management to local and national control many UK vessels will nevertheless continue to fish in EU waters out with the UK 200 mile limit."
"In these circumstances, and accepting the fact that the Commission policy to create an EU Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo is a , it will be in British interest to a working relationship with this new body."
"We therefore felt it was appropriate rather than opposing outright the proposal to abstain in this vote."
"Mr President, I would like to explain why I did not support the amendments to paragraph 20."
"It is important that we look at the idea of banning smoking in public places in the European Parliament."
"We look to the European Commission to do something, but it is wrong at this stage to start talking about having exclusions for certain areas or little glass cabinets where people can smoke, because somebody has to clean those areas afterwards."
"Workers have to clean them and I am not sure there is any evidence to show that such areas actually prevent smoke escaping."
"We should not prejudice the debate at this stage."
"Primary responsibility in this area lies with Member States."
"Member States should conform with legislation, the Commission should help coordinate it and bring forward best practice."
"Member States cannot escape their responsibilities by passing on to Europe things they are not sure they want to do at home."
"I am very much against the idea of prejudicing the whole debate by deciding now what we are going to do."
". – The Moderatedelegation in the European Parliament today voted in favour of the Ries report on the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004–2010."
"In our opinion, it is wrong, however, of the European Parliament to call on the Commission to take the initiative on issues of lifestyle-related diseases or various measures against smoking."
"Decisions on these issues fall within the competence of the Member States and should ultimately be taken primarily by individuals and not by politicians."
"The Moderate Partyis of the opinion that the EU is an important tool in the pursuit of a better environment, but there are nevertheless limits to its responsibility."
"The responsibility of the EU should only extend to those environmental issues that are clearly of a cross-border nature."
"For this reason, it is wrong to call on the Commission to work, on the one hand, on eco-labelling of construction materials and, on the other, on drawing up lists of hazardous places of work and on setting up environmental ambulances."
". – I voted for this report, which denounces the major downgrading in approach and ambition between the Commission’s Environment and Health Strategy and what should be its implementation, the Action Plan."
"Parliament considers that the Action Plan can at best be seen as a research plan, which does not in itself mitigate the problems of disease caused by environmental factors, at least not in the short term."
"Of the examples mentioned, I must highlight the criticism that, of the thirteen actions set out in the Commission's Environment and Health Strategy for 2004-2010, only four are concerned with specific measures and none of them sets any targets, and the fact that there is no mention of the mental and neurological health impact of pollution."
"One of the greatest omissions, however, is without doubt the lack of any evaluation of the consequences of current European Union policies, such as the common agricultural policy and the liberalisation policies that promote the privatisation of essential public services, subordinating them to the profit motive, as is happening with water."
"Another omission is health in the workplace, particularly regarding hazardous locations and jobs."
". I am supporting this report because of the amendment to Paragraph 6 of the original, discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I understand the need to use the 'precautionary principle' to protect consumers from the possible long-term dangers of the phthalate family of chemicals including DEHP, but I represent a factory in Quedgeley, in Gloucestersire, Gambro, which has received the Queen's Award to Industry and has 120 employees."
"This factory uses DEHP for devices that help control blood clotting."
"People in such circumstances have to worry about the next 25 minutes rather than the next 25 years."
"In those circumstances, the exception that allows DEHP and other phthalates to be used 'where such a restriction would have a negative impact on medical treatment' is entirely appropriate."
"On that basis I will vote for the amended Ries report."
". – The health effects of environmental pollution are of fundamental concern to society, and a broad commitment to this issue is important."
"Consequently, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole."
"We disapprove, however, of its lack of emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity."
"A European Environment Action Plan should only cover cross-border environmental issues."
"Unfortunately, this is not the case with the present Action Plan."
"We do not believe that the EU should be working on combating ill health caused by tobacco, alcohol, poor diet or lack of exercise (paragraph 17), or that the Commission should be acting to put an end to smoking in enclosed areas (paragraph 20)."
"The areas dealt with in the above paragraphs have an obvious impact on health, but are typical of issues in which the EU does not have competence and to which the principle of subsidiarity is applicable."
"Nor do we believe that the principle of subsidiarity has been applied in paragraph 28, which emphasises that particular attention should be paid to people living close to sources of pollution."
"By way of conclusion, it is very important that the Commission, on the one hand, clarifies what total sums are to be released to fund the Action Plan and, on the other hand, explains whether it believes that a new financial instrument is required to fund it."
"The costs of the Action Plan must be borne within the limits of the budget."
". As a non-smoker, I am in favour of Amendment 4, which was – partly on my initiative – tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"This amendment would allow entrepreneurs in the catering industry to set up separate, and adequately ventilated, smoking areas."
"In this respect, I should like to urge the Commission to leave scope for market-led initiatives to accommodate the problem of (passive) smoking in the catering industry."
"Thanks to modern ventilation technology, the quality of indoor air can be raised to a level that is even higher than that of the air outdoors."
"By imposing a statutory smoking ban from the top down, innovative initiatives of this kind are taken out of the market, and will take with them some of the dynamism from the economy."
"Moreover, entrepreneurs as well as consumers, become restricted in their freedom of choice, so much so that I cannot reconcile this with the ideological principles that I as a Liberal uphold."
"A European smoking ban will also have implications for employment in the tourism industry, as smokers are sufficiently well-informed about the dangers of smoking."
"If there is a European smoking ban, what will the next ban be?"
"Alcohol, or fast food that results in obesity, driving cars, on account of road victims, or even sex, given that most people die in bed?"
". – I support the need to implement an action plan to evaluate and promote the environment and health with the focus on children."
"The strategy governing this initiative, better known as SCALE – Science, Children, Awareness, Legal instruments, Evaluation – aims at implementing a transversal approach to this subject. This is a matter of increasing concern to Europe’s citizens, above all because of the constant increase in four types of disease: respiratory diseases, asthma and childhood allergies; neurodevelopmental disorders; childhood cancer; and endocrine-disrupting effects."
"In view of the situation, I endorse the intention to speed up and improve information exchange and communication procedures so that the actual causal relations between types of pollution and health can be made known more quickly and on a sounder basis."
"The rapporteur invokes the precautionary principle to deny the need for absolute scientific proof that a particular product is dangerous before it is withdrawn from the market."
"While I may even agree with the idea, I would, however, draw attention to the fact that interpretation of this principle by Community courts has been uneven and not always consistent, and it therefore really needs to be clarified."
". – It is a fact that the Mediterranean is of strategic importance to the whole of Europe and that we need to develop a Mediterranean policy based on solidarity in order to act on the multiple shared challenges of peace, stability, terrorism, mutual understanding, the fight against trafficking in people, and the objective of creating a shared area of prosperity."
"This must not, however, lead to increasing interference in the political life of individual countries, nor can it justify repressive and militaristic action that may have precisely the opposite effects to those declared, as certain recent experiences have already demonstrated."
"The whole Mediterranean area is particularly sensitive and requires very special care, particularly with regard to the need to support peace in the Middle East, taking account of the defence of Palestinian interests and compliance with the corresponding UN resolutions."
"That is why I distance myself from certain aspects of this resolution, which Parliament has adopted."
". – It is the responsibility of the Member States to carry out control and inspection measures to implement the common fisheries policy (CFP) in their respective exclusive economic zones."
"I am sceptical about the added value provided by the creation of a Community Fisheries Control Agency and believe that centralisation at that level conflicts with the Member States’ competences."
"Indeed, it cannot be an accident that this regulation is appearing before the results of a feasibility study on the agency have been published."
"I therefore voted against the report."
"My position does not invalidate my belief that it is important to strengthen coordination among Member States in the area of control activities in order to ensure more uniform application of the CFP and to combat illegal fishing, and that we should increase the Community budget contribution to the investments that are needed to guarantee such control activities."
"Without prejudice to questions of principle, I have to say that I disagree with the representativeness of the Administrative Board, its and the excessive influence that the Commission holds in it, particularly in the voting arrangements."
"I also believe that, under the principle of co-management, the participation of the various representatives of the fisheries sector should be guaranteed."
". – Europe must not ignore the lessons of history if it is to gain a clear understanding of its sphere and range of action."
"It should not only realise that the ‘middle sea’ has always united more than it has separated, but it must also have the pragmatic desire to revitalise it as a major artery for political, commercial and cultural exchange."
"While pointing out the aims and objectives that we have in common, I do not ignore the specific problems that affect a large part of the Mediterranean’s southern rim."
"I believe, however, that those problems should not merely be a cause of concern for their own peoples and leaders but, on the contrary, they need to be addressed through a programme coordinated and structured in conjunction with the European Union, within the neighbourhood policy that the EU is advocating."
"In my view, some very positive measures have been adopted to that end, including the conversion of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum into the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly – an affirmation of a parliamentary political component which will make the interregional dialogue a permanent, institutional feature – and the declaration of 2005 as the ‘Year of the Mediterranean’ by the Euro-Mediterranean Ministers of Foreign Affairs."
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and the Commission statements on the 61st Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (Geneva, 14 March – 25 April 2005)."
"Mr President, I too am grateful to the Council and Commission for being back here promptly for this debate which has overrun."
"I only have enough speaking time to raise two issues."
"The first is that of Colombia."
"Human rights organisations and the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Human Rights defenders have expressed regret at the EU position on Colombia taken at the recent donors' meeting at Cartagena."
"The EU has a special responsibility in negotiating on the Chair's Statement, and I hope the Council will confirm today that it will postpone producing a draft text until the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has produced recommendations for this year."
"I hope that we in the EU will back those recommendations in full."
"Second, last year's deferral for further consideration of the draft UN norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations must genuinely lead to action this year which will ensure that companies observe human rights obligations."
"In this year, the 20th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, minimum standards for companies are required which will reduce the number of victims of abuse across the world in future years."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we all agree that human rights are universal and indivisible and that they are also a measure of the quality of international relations."
"That is why the European Union is committed to ensuring that respect for human rights is given the necessary priority, whether this is in the context of relations with China, Russia, Syria, Iran or North Korea, a list that is, of course, by no means exhaustive."
"One of the problems in this debate is that definitions are sometimes blurred and can be manipulated for ideological reasons."
"As regards the European Parliament's human rights resolution, it must not become a back door for a general liberalisation of abortion under the pretext of reproductive health; here, the protection of human life and dignity is at stake."
"I would like to focus on just one case which is especially important as it concerns a country with which accession negotiations are scheduled to begin, namely Turkey."
"However, this is not the main reason why I am raising this particular case."
"Nor is it because it involves an Austrian citizen who was arrested and whose release may – thanks to the intervention of the Austrian authorities – be imminent."
"The fact is that it could just as easily have been a citizen of another country."
"What worries me, firstly, is that in Turkey, even today, the mere allegation of membership of a terrorist organisation is enough for an arrest warrant to be issued, even if the individual concerned has not committed any criminal act."
"Secondly, I am also very concerned that arrest warrants issued by the State Security Court are still being executed, even though Turkey claims to fulfil the Copenhagen political criterion."
"We all know that arrest warrants issued by this Court violate Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"If this case is symptomatic of legal practice in Turkey, neither the Commission nor the Council should proceed to the agenda."
". Mr President, first of all I apologise for being a few minutes late."
"On the subject of human rights, I believe that the views emphasised by the various speakers here in Parliament are to a large extent shared by the Council."
"I would simply like to consider a few points and try to comment on them."
"I think we all agree that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is not perfect, and that there are many criticisms that can be levelled at it."
"Nevertheless, it has to be said that in the final analysis it is the only multilateral forum where human rights can be discussed on a truly worldwide scale, even if difficulties sometimes arise."
"It is obvious, then, that the European Union should apply itself to improving the way in which the UN Commission operates."
"We should play an active role in reforming its operation, and I believe that this is an extremely important point, in the context of the reform of the United Nations and of the multilateral system in general."
"We are also aware that the handling of human rights issues in various countries sometimes forms part of a long-drawn process."
"It is not possible to obtain rapid results, and that is why we need diversified approaches, working on different aspects."
"I shall mention three examples, which have been commented on in detail in this House."
"Firstly, there is Iran."
"Of course, we could have a policy of confrontation with Iran over human rights issues, but the outcome of such a policy is still extremely uncertain."
"However, in the general negotiating process – and heaven knows we are discussing highly sensitive and important issues with Iran – human rights have not been left out of the equation."
"On the contrary, they occupy an important place."
"Last week I had the opportunity to meet Iran’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, and we talked about human rights in a very specific way."
"We clearly called for the reactivation of the group discussing human rights in Iran, and for the resumption of the dialogue with Iran on human rights in the context of the general relations which we wish to establish with that country."
"I have some hopes that Iran will agree to reactivate that group."
"For example, Iran has tried to obtain, in exchange, an assurance that there will not be any initiatives within the ECHR."
"I do not believe that we can agree to that request: a deal is not possible."
"However, what is important is that we have a dialogue with a country like Iran."
"China was also mentioned."
"I believe that the human rights dialogue with China is an extremely important aspect of our relations with that country."
"As recently as this very afternoon, a meeting with China took place in Luxembourg on the subject of human rights."
"We know that we are not going to modify, change or overthrow the Chinese system from one day to the next."
"We have a long job ahead of us, but if we look for a moment at the situation in other parts of the world, we can see that this relentless, gradual but constant work on human rights can prove successful and produce results, and there are plenty of examples to demonstrate this."
"The final example I should like to mention is Zimbabwe."
"It is a very sad and tragic story, and it is not the only one in Africa – there are others."
"However, in the case of Zimbabwe we have imposed sanctions which I would not describe as too lax, as someone did just now."
"These are real sanctions."
"We have even gone so far as to cancel an EU-Africa summit because of Zimbabwe, since we did not want the President of Zimbabwe to take part in that meeting."
"We do not, therefore, have a weak and accommodating attitude towards that country."
"We have made Zimbabwe the subject of strict observation as regards the elections which are due to be held there."
"I do not think that we really have much hope that those elections will follow proper democratic procedures."
"We shall therefore have to decide how we are going to continue our relations with this important country, and there are other countries in Africa which would be worth mentioning in this context."
"Belarus has also been mentioned."
"We have imposed sanctions on Belarus, a country which has to some extent isolated itself."
"The question remains of whether, where human rights are concerned, we should isolate a country or seek to keep a minimum of dialogue open, especially in order to help those who are the first victims of restrictions on freedoms and human rights."
"To conclude, I believe that Europe is making real, constant, active, but also diversified progress in the area of human rights, and we are not making this area a secondary priority as some people have said."
"I believe that we want to play an important role and adopt a more global approach towards human rights."
"Certain more specific rights have been mentioned, particularly in connection with multinational companies."
"That is why I believe that we should have a more innovative, yet multilateralist, conception of human rights."
"I believe that Europe should show the way, working with others of course, but we must do so in order to achieve progress in this cause."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that human rights really do – and should – play a very important role, not only on the occasion of the sixty-first session, but also, of course, in general."
"What is more, ladies and gentlemen, this is true at every summit or meeting which we hold with various countries."
"Thus, on the occasion of the meeting with China in December last, we spoke a great deal about the human rights issue, and we are hopeful that China will ratify the international pact on civil and political rights."
"I believe that it is also very important that these issues should always be on the agenda at our bilateral meetings too."
"As Mr Schmit has already said, this does in fact happen."
"The same is true of our new neighbourhood policy, about which President Yushchenko expressed a certain reticence today."
"I have to tell you that I do not agree, and I said as much to him in Ukraine."
"Although the neighbourhood policy we have designed is a gradual policy, it is also a policy which can bring countries together."
"Ukraine is much closer to the European Union in the area of human rights and also in many other areas."
"I am grateful to the Members of the European Parliament for the interest that they have shown."
"I am also delighted to hear that a delegation of MEPs will be going to Geneva for the meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights next month, with the aim of facilitating various contacts."
"The position expressed by Mrs Flautre, to the effect that our dialogue with a country is not incompatible with action within the United Nations, is a position entirely shared by the Commission and the Council."
"This is why we have always clearly said that we would oppose any motions seeking to prevent a vote on any resolution, and have in fact done so. This is the case with China."
"The no motion vote forms part of the procedures of the Commission on Human Rights, but sometimes, unfortunately, it prevents us from working together."
"I wish to continue in English."
"I have listened with great interest to the comments about the situation of women, journalists and others in several countries."
"It is very important that the Commission is active on human rights issues."
"Let me say that the issue of human rights at the United Nations was also mentioned in the debate today."
"We must look at the new ideas proposed by the different experts to the UN Panel."
"There are some very interesting ideas."
"One concerns the universalisation of membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights or, in the longer term, even the creation of a fully-fledged human rights council."
"This is a very interesting idea and I feel we should support it."
"The Commission is contributing to the internal reflection on all these issues."
"It is still rather early in the process, as we are waiting for the report by the Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, which will be submitted sometime around March."
"However, I am convinced that the creation of a new human rights council would reinforce the credibility of the UN as regards human rights."
"However, we must ensure that any UN reform process promotes respect for human rights, the promotion of humanitarian law, the rule of law and democracy, all of which are at the core of our peace-building response of the United Nations."
"If we think of Iraq, we know that this is important."
"Finally, it is important that we improve the efficiency of the whole human rights machinery."
"The first speaker in the debate today, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, mentioned the broad scope of threats we face - for example, terrorism, organised international crime, trafficking, etc. I want to tell him that he is absolutely right that we must tackle these threats."
"He has our full support."
"I see these threats and the countermeasures to tackle them as a part of the human security concept."
"This is a comprehensive concept of understanding of individual security, where, importantly, there are hard and soft threats."
"The idea of freedom from need and freedom from fear are also important and both have to be eliminated."
"I have received one motion for a resolution to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The European Parliament must say a clear ‘no’ to the export of arms to China."
"I wonder whether a higher turnover for a few European arms manufacturers should mean that Europe has to give up its values and its ambitions to uphold human rights effectively in the world."
"I believe that the Council of Ministers will take Parliament’s stance to heart, and that it will abandon its pragmatic approach."
"I would warn that Europe will otherwise lose its capacity to bring about positive developments in Asia and Africa."
"What political tools will remain to Europe for the enforcement of human rights and social, ecological and trading standards?"
"Independent organisations have given evidence of the murder, persecution and abduction of ideological opponents in China."
"This affects not only Falun Gong, but also Christians, Buddhists and others."
"What credit will be due to an EU which breaks embargos, even though the reasons for which they were imposed are still valid?"
"The Union has still not carried out its own investigations into changes in access to human rights in China."
"Is it also blind to the obvious infringement of rules on international trade and intellectual property?"
"What we are talking about here is also a safety hazard, after all;"
"I can say this on the basis of my own experiences in the Czech Republic a couple of years ago."
"Journalists revealed how arms were being exported to Congo, on which Europe had imposed an embargo."
"This was due to a failure of politicians, who facilitated sales through the unreliable Zimbabwe, with the latter being happy to accept falsified end-user certificates."
"We should remember that countries in which public control is not working - ..."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statement on the elections in Moldova."
". Mr President, on behalf of the Presidency, I am very grateful to Parliament for the great attention that you are paying to the forthcoming elections in Moldova."
"The Presidency is constantly and closely following developments in the political situation in that country, and in particular the preparation and conduct of the elections on 6 March."
"The parliamentary elections in Moldova will also be observed by the OSCE."
"The Moldovan Government invited international observers a long time in advance, and I hope that Members of the European Parliament will also take part in this observation mission."
"As a future neighbouring country to the European Union, Moldova is of great importance to us."
"You will not be unaware of the fact that the electoral process is giving rise to certain concerns, particularly as regards the position of the media and the way the opposition is treated."
"The European Union examined all these issues with the Moldovan Government last autumn, during the visit of the Troika."
"We clearly reaffirmed that democratic practices must be respected and that the elections must be free and fair."
"More recently, on the subject of the elections, the European Union issued a declaration, the principal elements of which are as follows. The European Union reminded Moldova that its relations with the EU would depend on its commitment to common values."
"This morning there has been a lot of talk about values and democracy in the Mediterranean context, and President Yushchenko has to some extent given us a master class in democracy and values."
"It is therefore important that Moldova should rejoin Europe in this area too."
"The European Union has appealed to the Moldovan authorities to ensure that these elections take place in an open and fair climate, that the media coverage of the election campaign is pluralist and impartial, and that the State administration remains neutral towards all candidates and their supporters."
"The Union has also asked the authorities to ensure that the votes of expatriates are treated properly and impartially."
"Finally, the Union has appealed to the Moldovan Government to take into account the concerns raised by the OSCE’s fact-finding mission and to implement the joint recommendations established by the OSCE and the Venice Commission in 2004."
"Last but not least, the issue was examined at the meeting of the EU-Moldova Cooperation Council held on 22 February in Brussels."
"Democratic reforms and the holding of free and fair elections are also important components of the EU-Moldova Action Plan adopted by the Cooperation Council in the context of the European neighbourhood policy."
"The action plan also refers to the subject of human rights in the context of our neighbourhood policy, a fact which was emphasised by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"I can assure you, Mr President, that the Presidency will be closely following the electoral process in Moldova, which is an important step in the European future of that country, which is now faced with the choice of demonstrating that it is ready, one day, to rejoin the family of Europe."
". Mr President, yesterday we had a EU Cooperation Council in which the new neighbourhood policy and the action plan for Moldova was adopted."
"We also had an excellent frank and open dialogue in which I personally participated."
"As my colleague pointed out, we clearly said that if Moldova really wants to get closer to the European Union then it is very important for it to also demonstrate that interest."
"I think that the elections which are to be held very soon, on 6 March, will be an excellent moment to show what is really going on."
"Moldova really has to promote respect for human rights."
"It has to promote and empower civil society, it has to strengthen the independence of the media, and it has to ensure better follow-up of the Council of Europe's recommendations."
"I said all of that to them personally."
"We all agree that a vibrant democracy, a respect for the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free and independent media are necessary if it wants to promote the stability and prosperity of the country."
"Since independence in 1991, Moldova has had a rather good record of free and fair elections."
"The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and ODIHR, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, confirmed in its report on Moldova that the last two parliamentary elections did indeed meet international standards."
"To Moldova's credit very few elections in the newly independent states had been assessed in such a positive way."
"However, the OSCE's assessment of local elections since 2001 have reported that, unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated."
"The organisation noted shortcomings in the context of local government elections held in May and June 2003, including abuse of administrative resources, heavy bias of state media in favour of the incumbents and the arrest of prominent candidates."
"Reports on the October 2002 elections for the Governor of Gagauzia, an Autonomous Territorial Unit, also noted similar shortcomings."
"In the run-up to the 2005 parliamentarian elections we are concerned that one of the joint recommendations, made by the OECE and Council of Europe Venice Commission, for improvements to the election legislation and administration have not really been completely implemented."
"Other reasons for concern include also the apparent lack of confidence in the central election commission, problems with the accuracy of voter registers, reported abuse of the administrative resources by the authorities, control by the ruling party and government of the public media, and pressure on the private media."
"In addition, up to one fourth of Moldova's population might not be able to cast their votes."
"This includes Moldovan citizens living abroad, or in Transnistria."
"Yesterday we heard from the government that there had also been some disturbances in the electoral process coming from outside the country."
"That is how they described it and I think we have to ensure that we observe these elections very carefully."
"As a result, the Commission has given funding for 25 specially named commissioners for this election observation, going into the OSCE/ODIHR mission."
"It is important to know that this will not be an easy task and we should remain very vigilant."
"I also welcome the visit to Moldova in January of the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, Mr Terry Davis, and the launch of the OSCE's election observation mission."
"I shall take this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the very good work of this Council of Europe and OSCE support team."
"We are in regular contact with our mission and, as I said, we are contributing EUR 50 000."
"This was mentioned again yesterday."
"I think the Moldovan delegation that wants to move towards Europe has shown great interest in trying to comply with the standards, but there is also some concern about the influences that might come from outside."
"Again, I hope that Parliament, together with the Commission, follows events very closely as it may prove crucial to do so."
". – Mr President, it is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is examining issues relating to Moldova today, because Moldova is a small country that is somewhat overlooked by Europe."
"It is a country with a rich history, and a country where there have been clashes between ethnic and national interests, as well as cultural, religious, economic and political differences."
"Moldova is the point at which East meets West and Christianity meets Islam, and the point at which the interests of different rulers and powers have intersected throughout history."
"Moldova’s situation today is also difficult and complex."
"We must remember that this is a country that, following the collapse of the USSR, experienced a tragic war in the Transnistria area."
"This conflict has still not been finally resolved."
"Moldova is currently struggling with many economic and social problems."
"This sensitive region needs stability for the good of our entire continent."
"Stability can only be safeguarded by full democracy, the rule of law and respect for human and civil rights."
"Democracy cannot be imposed, it can only be supported, and this is our responsibility to Moldova today."
"The elections on 6 March 2005 will be an important test of the extent to which the democratisation process has progressed, and of the extent to which the common good will prevail over individual interests."
"These elections will determine whether Moldova’s key economic, educational, and social problems will be successfully resolved."
"These elections may open a new phase of development, and thus also give rise to the implementation of the strategy adopted last year for future membership in the European Union."
"The elections will also set new challenges for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Mr President, judging from the Council and the Commission, the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council, it is clear that all of us – by which I mean the three institutions – have to give Moldova, the Moldovan Government, a joint signal in the run-up to the elections of 6 March, and that is also the very objective of today’s debate and of the resolution which we in this House will undoubtedly be adopting by a large majority tomorrow."
"Next Sunday, the Moldovan people will be able to have their say about the composition of a new parliament, and that is, of course, an important day for that country, for those elections will also result in a new national government."
"I personally think that the poor shape Moldova itself is in will set the tone for the election campaign, because that country’s development over the past year does not really instil hope."
"It has now become Europe’s poorest country."
"To us, I think that there are two other issues of key importance."
"Firstly, there is the issue of Transnistria and the quest for a solution to the unacceptable situation in that part of Moldova."
"I think that only a government with democratic legitimacy will have the authority to facilitate, and get involved in, new initiatives."
"There is now room for this."
"This morning, President Yushchenko made a clear statement about the new Ukrainian Government’s willingness to help find a solution, and this is where Ukraine’s help is absolutely necessary."
"What I think matters, though, is that the elections should result in a government possessing the authority to help find solutions."
"In addition, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, that country’s future orientation is an important topic, and by and large, the parties seem to be agreed on the need for it to draw closer to Europe and to the European Union."
"Needless to say, we would warmly welcome a new government in Chisinău setting course for Europe, and the action plan agreed upon with Moldova in the framework of the neighbourhood policy offers the concrete framework for this."
"Cooperation and political relations with the European Union cannot be improved, however, unless the Moldovan Government’s mandate is based on an entirely democratic expression of the popular will; if not, it will be difficult to have dealings with that country in the years ahead."
"A government that has been legitimised by the population is the EU’s first contact and when that government opts for a credible European course, it can count on the EU’s support."
"When, however, the elections fail to meet democratic standards, that casts a shadow over future cooperation."
"A democratic and credible regime and leadership are a for European involvement."
"That is why we urge the present government to make every effort to ensure that the elections and the campaigns be conducted fairly and openly, and that is why balanced access to the media must be guaranteed across the political divide."
"For the rest, I would concur with what the Commissioner said in this respect, and we also greatly appreciate the Commission’s commitment to those elections."
". Commissioner, Luxembourg Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, Moldova is the EU's least developed neighbour, and in addition to serious underdevelopment it also suffers from a number of other problems and serious burdens."
"In addition to being the least developed country in Europe, Moldova does not have control over the whole of its own territory."
"Its railway system is broken in two."
"Foreign military units are deployed on its territory against its will."
"Everything can be found there, including the worst forms of international crime and trafficking in weapons, drugs and human beings."
"The country has serious problems, but its people know how to live and survive in desperate economic circumstances as this is what they have to do."
"More than half the population is forced to survive on two dollars a day, and a fifth live on one dollar a day."
"If this is not a miracle, then there is no such thing as a miracle."
"For them there truly can be none."
"We must be, and are, in solidarity with them."
"We all nurture hope in the expectation of democratic and economic changes."
"There will be elections in Moldova on 6 March, the results of which could increase our mutual cooperation and bring Moldova closer to the European Union."
"Romania is becoming a member of the European Union, there have been great changes in Ukraine, and we hope that they will also succeed in their wishes and that the wheels of development and democracy will begin to turn faster in Moldova."
"I wish that the Ukrainian president had used his speech today to encourage our friends in Moldova, because the Ukrainian example has demonstrated that outside interference does not help and cannot stop history."
"We wish them success as well as new and better opportunities to make progress, and we look forward to working with them after the elections."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Republic of Moldova is a country which is often forgotten about in Europe."
"It is a country rarely mentioned in lists of examples or in key speeches, yet its fate is closely bound up with the European Union."
"Only when the Transnistria conflict is resolved and Moldova can genuinely protect its own borders once more will it have the chance to develop economically."
"We know that Moldova is the poorest country in Europe and that its young people are leaving in droves."
"That is why the resolution of this conflict is also important for us, and democratic elections are essential for this process."
"Democracy-building and successful economic development in Moldova will increase the European Union's security as well."
"I am pleased, therefore, that the Commission, the Council and Mr Solana have also finally understood – and I emphasise the word 'finally' – that a solution to the Transnistria conflict is a key security issue for Europe and that we must do all we can to move this process forward."
"Nonetheless, and I emphasise this point again too, democratic development in Moldova is the responsibility of its parties, government and administration."
"It is they who must now ensure that the elections are free and fair and take place without ballot-rigging, so that a government can be founded on trust and become a significant interlocutor for the EU."
"That is the signal which will set the Republic of Moldova on course towards the European Union."
"I agree with most of what has been said by previous speakers."
"I too share their concerns with regard to the need for a calming of the situation in Moldova, and for closer cooperation with this European country."
"The Commissioner has mentioned several problems relating to the elections."
"We discussed these problems yesterday when preparing our resolution, and I believe that the motion before the House is an acceptable compromise."
"As regards the problem of the media, I have information from sources provided by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe that there has nonetheless been a shift."
"Roughly half of broadcasting time in the state-owned media is allocated to the opposition and half to the ruling parties, with this rising to one to twenty in favour of the opposition in the private media."
"It also seems that the problems relating to voting by students have been resolved, since they will be able to vote both at their places of residence and at their places of study."
"There has also been a shift with regard to identification documents, as extensions have been granted both for passports from the Soviet era and for those about to expire."
"In conclusion, it seems to me that progress has been made, and that there are no obstacles that could prevent the elections taking place democratically and transparently."
"It will, however, be up to us to monitor this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in one year, nine months and eight days’ time Moldova’s neighbour, Romania, will become a member of the European Union."
"When discussing the political situation in Moldova, we should therefore remember that we are talking about democracy or the lack thereof in a country that will soon be a neighbour of the Union."
"If it is said when discussing Iraq and Iran that they will be neighbours of the European Union following Turkey’s entry into the Union in around 20 years, we should take an even greater interest in the Union’s present neighbours, such as Ukraine and Belarus, or Moldova, which will be our neighbour in the near future."
"The elections that will take place in Moldova in 11 days will not be entirely credible if there continues to be no fair election campaign preceding them."
"At present there is no such campaign, and no sign of there being one."
"Yet elections without campaigns are like a fish out of water, and we must therefore judge the Moldovan authorities not only on whether they observe procedures on the day of the elections, but also on whether they ensure that a normal campaign takes place."
"At the same time, we should not forget that the elections in this country have an international context, whether we like it or not."
"Mr President, Moldova is a small landlocked country, the poorest in Europe, whose importance to the EU will rise as our frontiers will border it by 2007."
"It is also the location of a frozen conflict in its breakaway territory of Transnistria, under Russian military protection since 1991, following a bloody secessionist conflict."
"This territory is a haven for gansterism, smuggling and money laundering and corrupts the local authorities around the Odessa oblast in Ukraine."
"President Voronin, whom I met a year ago, in spite of being a Communist and ethnically Russian, is committed to EU and NATO approximation for his country after a row with President Putin, who failed to withdraw Russian troops by 2002 from Transnistria, as agreed."
"I have no doubt that the parliamentary elections on 6 March, although far from perfect in terms of media bias in the run-up and the monopoly of administrative resources, will not be subject to the kind of fraud seen under Prime Minister Yanukovych in neighbouring Ukraine, which sparked off the famous Orange Revolution."
"The European Parliament, the parliamentary assemblies of the Council of Europe and NATO, as well as OSCE/ODIHR presence in Moldova, with Romanian and Ukrainian help, will prevent such a scenario."
"The new parliament must help Romania, Ukraine, Russia, the USA and the EU get together with the Moldovan Government to solve the Transnistria problem."
"Reassurances of strong safeguards for Slav minorities must be given, probably along with a form of devolved government to the territory, which, after all, has never been part of historic Bessarabia or been Romanian speaking and which Stalin annexed cruelly to create Moldova 60 years ago."
"I personally would start by advocating tightening of the sanctions against Tiraspol by asking President Yushchenko of Ukraine, who was here this morning, to further demonstrate his independence from Moscow by preventing Mr Smirnov and his 16 cronies from travelling to Ukraine as the EU has already done with the visa ban."
"I would also ask the Council to bring in a policy to prevent any aircraft landing in EU territory having taken off from Tiraspol military airport, thus ensuring they all fly out of Chisinau, where they can be openly inspected for smuggling, including arms trafficking."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, since the Orange Revolution, the European Parliament has been paying more and more attention to its neighbours in the east."
"Today’s resolution confirms that the bold decision, made on 13 January, to offer EU membership to Ukraine was not made hastily."
"The Moldova resolution is well balanced."
"We both confirm our support and indicate our understanding of complex situation in the region."
"Moldova’s territorial integrity has been breached: contrary to the wishes of the democratically elected government, foreign troops – the Russian army – are stationed there."
"By the way, it is ironic that today, 23 February, is the day that the Soviet Union’s vassal states, Estonia and Moldova included, were for decades required to celebrate as Soviet Army and Navy Day."
"The European Union is ready to support the Moldovans, both in the process of European integration and in the restoration of their territorial integrity."
"The European Union, within the framework of the European Securityand Defence Policy – ESDP – must also be prepared to support border control between the Moldovan separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine."
"Today’s speech in Parliament by the Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko gives us cause to believe that Ukraine considers the solution of the Transnistria problem to be a serious issue."
"The democracy of the Moldovan elections does not just depend on how the votes are counted."
"The elections are not democratic unless all political parties have fair and equal access to the media during the election campaign."
"I am referring here to Teleradio Moldova airtime."
"At the same time, opportunities for election advertising, both on the streets and in the media, must be made available."
"This is the minimum; without this, we cannot declare the elections on 6 March to be democratic."
"The European Union must be prepared to treat Moldova on equal terms with Ukraine."
"I do not see any reasons why the European Parliament should not support Moldova’s European Union membership prospects during the democratic and economic reform processes."
"The first Copenhagen criterion – democracy – is, of course, a prerequisite for Europe’s support and cooperation, but the other two – a free market economy and the rule of law – are equally essential for Moldova."
"A clear position regarding these issues is necessary if we are to be honest with ourselves, with Europe, and with the Moldovans."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schmit, the President of Ukraine has summed it up very aptly today."
"The principle that his country associates with Europe is democracy – and the democrats in the Republic of Moldova are looking to us as well."
"What they want from us is not only a commitment to them as Europeans, but also a clear signal over and above the neighbourhood strategy."
"That is why I believe that – especially in the light of events in its neighbour, Ukraine – we must offer Moldova a clearer perspective."
"With the Thessaloniki strategy, the EU mapped out a course for the countries of the Western Balkans."
"What about the countries that are only now shrugging off the shackles of the past?"
"Ukraine has set a precedent."
"It is to be hoped that the Republic of Moldova will follow suit on 6 March, and even Belarus will in future have no option but to embark on the path towards democracy."
"What we need now is a Thessaloniki strategy for these three countries."
"It is an anachronism that the Republic of Moldova is the only country in the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe to have no prospect of accession to the European Union."
"It would be splendid if, very soon, this House could welcome a democratically elected President from the Republic of Moldova who is genuinely committed to democratic politics."
"At the moment, that is not the case, as I saw for myself during my visit to Chisinau ten days ago."
"If, though, there is to be a European Republic of Moldova, the election on 6 March must be democratic."
"We appeal to our European friends in the Republic of Moldova to go and vote, to vote for democracy, and to make the Republic of Moldova freer, more democratic and more European so that this House can very soon bid their country welcome."
"– Mr President, the predominantly Romanian-speaking area that used to be referred to as Bessarabia, and is currently known as Moldova, alternated between being Romanian and Russian."
"It would never have existed as a state had it not been for the pact between Stalin and Hitler that redrew the Soviet Union’s western borders on the eve of the Second World War."
"Both in the Romanian-speaking sector to the west of the Dniestr and in the Slavic sector to the east, there is shared nostalgia for the kind of society that existed in the days of the Soviet Union."
"All those circumstances are not the ideal foundation for democracy, tolerance, transparency and pluriformity."
"They can result in the different peoples seeking a regime whose authoritarianism is directed against those perceived as being opponents."
"One cannot therefore exclude the possibility the elections being as flawed as were last year’s in Ukraine and Belarus."
"That is why it is important for us now to express our desire that Europe’s poorest country should have normal parliamentarian democracy, with equal rights and opportunities for all parties taking part in the elections on 6 March."
"–Thank you Mr President."
"As we know, on 6 March Parliamentary elections will take place in Moldova, which I hope to be able to observe as a member of the European Parliament's delegation of election observers."
"However, today I would also like to express my concern about the pre-election situation in Moldova."
"The situation in Moldova is complicated above all because to this day the Transnistria problem remains unresolved."
"Neither the international community nor even the European Union have yet been able to persuade Russia to keep its 1999 Istanbul Commitments and withdraw its army from Transnistria."
"Transnistria has become a region involved in money laundering, and the manufacturing and illegal export of arms."
"This in turn, either directly or indirectly, serves organised crime and international terrorism."
"Today, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner expressed concern about the environment of the forthcoming elections, about the influence which some have been trying to exert from outside for some time."
"Yesterday Moldova's Prime Minister Tarlev spoke about this at a press conference in Brussels and today the world's news agencies are speaking about it."
"In conclusion I would like to express the hope, that the European Union and international community will not be impotent and that the European Union will not only observe the elections and monitor the situation, but will take concrete steps to help Moldova's democratic forces and will not allow the situation in that country to become unstable."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike certain fellow Members, I think that Parliament is welcoming and feels close to the Moldovan people and in particular to their efforts to put in place a complete democratic system and achieve greater civil progress."
"We are united by strong ties and by common interests and we wish to pursue the cooperation already underway in the framework of the neighbourhood programme."
"We are taking note of what happens, of the contradictions and the delays, but also of the positive action carried out by political and social bodies, institutions and associations, in particular secular and Catholic associations, which are fighting to defend the inviolable rights of children and to combat the trafficking of girls forced into prostitution."
"There is a two-fold issue that we must address: human rights and political rights."
"From this point of view, the forthcoming elections on 6 March are an important occasion and it is right to call for them to take place with the greatest transparency to ensure the fullest participation possible."
"I believe it is right and proper also to call on the governments and the States where large numbers of Moldovan citizens live, including Italy, to provide the practical means for thousands of Moldovan immigrants to fully exercise their right to vote."
"– Mr President, the peoples do not need instructions or recommendations and, more to the point, they are not under surveillance to ensure they choose the governments they want."
"It is unacceptable for the European Union and the European Parliament to intervene repeatedly in the internal affairs of other countries."
"In the case of Moldova, hypocrisy about the democratic process really does exceed all limits."
"If anything has to be denounced, it is the open intervention of the United States of America with funding of USD 1.7 million for the organisation, which supports the so-called opposition to the present government."
"This is the big problem of foreign intervention in the internal affairs of Moldova."
"The stand of the United States of America, which acknowledges precisely this intervention, is provocative."
"They protested through its embassy, accusing the government of Moldova, and this protest was of course also signed by the embassies of large European countries. None of the motions tabled has the courage to refer to this problem."
"You are not interested in democracy or genuine democratic elections."
"You want to subjugate Moldova."
"Finally, today is 23 February, the anniversary of the foundation of the Red Army and honour should be paid to the millions of Red Army soldiers and officers killed during the Second World War in order to crush fascism."
". Mr President, I think this debate has shown that Moldova is not the forgotten country of Europe."
"It has shown that we are interested in this country which, in spite of everything, is a little behind compared with general development in Europe, in other words development towards greater democracy and also development towards economic and social reform, the fight against corruption and the fight against trafficking in human beings, all subjects which are very important in this context."
"I believe that the lesson which we can draw from this debate, and on which Parliament, the Council and the Commission all agree, is, as someone has already said, to send a strong signal to Moldova, to the effect that it must not miss a historical opportunity in the wake of the events in Ukraine."
"I believe that this message should be transmitted clearly and firmly to the Moldovan authorities, not only with the elections in mind, but after the elections too."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has spoken about the European neighbourhood policy."
"By means of that policy, by means of our action plan, we must put pressure on the Moldovan authorities, the authorities currently in power but also those who will be in power tomorrow, so as to ensure that these reforms really are carried out and that they really do have some substance to them."
". Mr President, Transnistria has been an issue in the debate here today, and is an issue on the ground."
"We talked about it at length yesterday."
"As Austrian Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairperson-in-office in 2000 I tried hard to find a solution to the Transnistrian problem."
"At the time there was a ."
"Prime Minister Primakov had been nominated by Russia and there was a chance to get somewhere."
"However, immediately afterwards, this question unfortunately erupted again and no solution has been found."
"Therefore, I am very happy about the Secretary-General's new special representative, because it is very important to go further."
"This was said yesterday."
"We must do everything we can via our action plan, but we must also find a solution to this very difficult problem."
"I will be going to Moldova shortly after the election, as soon as a new government has been formed."
"I said this yesterday at our meeting and I can also officially announce today that the Commission will open a new delegation there."
"If we want a new neighbourhood policy, then the time is now."
"It is important and I hope that I can combine my visit with the opening of such a delegation."
"Moldova is the poorest country in Europe today."
"But let us not to go too far."
"Let us act."
"Rhetoric and vision are necessary, but it is even more necessary to look at the complexity of the situation."
"I know the country because I went there many times in my former capacities."
"Many things need to be done."
"The action plan is appropriate to that."
"Please look at the action plan."
"I have heard that some people want to go beyond the action plan, but this is not the time for that."
"It is now the time for the neighbourhood policy to bring these countries closer to the European Union."
"However, it is a question of give and take."
"These countries also have to accept the helping hand we are stretching out to them."
"At the end of the debate, I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, at last year’s General Assembly of the United Nations, President Lula launched an initiative that received the immediate support of President Chirac, President Lagos and Prime Minster Zapatero. This led to the Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty on 20 September, signed by 111 governments, including the governments of all the Member States."
"In addition, the last paragraph of Article 3 of the Constitution for Europe that is currently undergoing the ratification process proclaims the European Union’s adherence to international law and to the United Nations and its Charter. There is also a clear commitment to the Millennium Agenda and a proclamation of the principle of free and fair trade."
"This all calls for renewed and greater effort, not only by the Member States, but also by the Union as a whole. This is the right time for us to be informed of the views held by the Commission and the Council on important matters of current concern, such as the situation in Africa or climate change."
"It is also the right time for us to intensify our financial contribution to development aid, ensuring implementation of the Millennium Agenda. In particular, it is the right time for us to assume a responsible and leading role in a matter of such crucial importance to the future of mankind."
"Finally, Mr President, I believe this should also apply to the mandate to be granted to the Commission as we approach the Hong Kong Summit in the development of the Doha Round."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, poverty is not inevitable, but the result of political and economic decisions taken at national, regional and international level, and I believe that it is high time that it were considered illegal."
"Outlawed."
"The number of people living in extreme poverty has risen – and I do not intend to bore you with details or numbers, because you already have them – but, as stated in the New York Declaration, the greatest scandal is not so much that hunger and poverty exist, but that this problem persists despite there being the necessary human and material resources to tackle it."
"Both President Lula da Silva and the Quintet countries are strongly in favour of this Declaration, which was also mentioned by Mr Barón Crespo, according to whom it has been signed by 108 governments, whereas I believe the number to be 111."
"The Quintet has recommended new funding instruments for development, which I am not going to list here (taxation and similar strategies)."
"Although I support the new instruments, I think that they should be considered additional to and not a replacement for the existing instruments and they should be pooled in a global fund managed by the United Nations."
"In reality, eradicating poverty in poor countries, but now also in classes of the so-called rich countries, means respecting the right to life and also constitutes the best weapon against fundamentalism and violent conflicts."
"The structural adjustment programmes and unbridled liberalisation have certainly not improved living conditions in those countries."
"The Millennium Development Goals, referred to by Mr Barón Crespo, should be considered an essential intermediate stage, but certainly not the final one."
"Likewise, declarations of principle must be followed up with tangible actions, including the doubling of contributions for development."
"I extend my congratulations to certain European countries – Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Sweden – which are already allocating 0.7%, and to others which are moving in the same direction, while I truly regret that in my country, Italy, there is a trend in the opposite direction."
"I hope that it is possible to reverse this."
"Lastly, we are also committed to cancelling debt and in my view the transparent management of aid must also be one of the EU’s express, fundamental commitments."
"We are not and must not feel alone."
"We must also contribute to the development and growth of the role of the United Nations and its agencies."
". Mr President, I believe that we should pay tribute to President Lula’s initiative on action against hunger and poverty, which is behind the honourable Members’ oral question."
"This initiative has not been without effect."
"There is now a real awareness, firstly an awareness that poverty and hunger in the world constitute a real scandal, and then, beyond that, an awareness that they pose a permanent threat to stability and normal development."
"We have talked a lot, this morning and this afternoon, about democracy in the developing world."
"The ‘Make Poverty History’ initiative launched by Tony Blair, by the UK Presidency of the G8 countries, is to some extent in line with this action, and some time ago we had a debate on the issue of reducing, or even cancelling, the debts of the poorest countries."
"Now, therefore, this initiative by President Lula, together with other Heads of State, should be followed by practical action."
"It is true that so far the Council has not yet adopted a position on the innovative sources of finance for aid to developing countries."
"However, you will have become aware that a certain number of ideas have been put forward, which are currently under discussion and which are no longer regarded as taboo."
"Thus a subject such as the taxation of aviation fuel is no longer taboo, but forms one of the routes which are currently being studied in the move towards new sources of finance enabling us to combat poverty more effectively."
"Moreover, the search for such innovative sources of finance is one of the eight commitments defined in Barcelona in 2002 by the European Council with a view to implementing the Monterrey Consensus."
"In Barcelona, the Member States of the European Union confirmed their willingness to make a series of eight commitments, known as the Barcelona Commitments, which should be regarded as eight different aspects of the European Union’s action towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, with the aim of eradicating poverty."
"Heaven knows that we are still, in the case of many countries, and particular sub-Saharan countries, very far from achieving those goals, for example as regards access to water, access to education and access to proper food."
"In its conclusions of 27 April 2004, the Council, noting the work currently being carried out in Member States on innovative sources of finance, encouraged the Member States and the Commission to examine the possibilities for agreement on the various proposals currently under discussion."
"In that connection the Council emphasised the important role of partnerships between the public and private sectors."
"At its meeting in June 2004, the European Council confirmed that the European Union would intensify its efforts with a view to meeting the commitments made at Monterrey, in particular by seeking the innovative sources of finance which I have already mentioned."
"In addition, at its latest meeting, in December 2004, the European Council confirmed that the European Union is completely committed to the Millennium Development Goals and to the idea that we should ensure that progress is made towards achieving them, particularly by seeking new methods of finance based on the proposals submitted by the Commission for the high-level meeting in 2005."
"The time for action has arrived, the time for proposals has arrived, and I believe that the Council is now waiting for the Commission to submit proposals, in the hope that they will depart somewhat from the old, well trodden paths, and really will contribute something new."
". – Mr President, I should like to say to Mr Barón Crespo and Mrs Morgantini that I believe President Lula’s initiative is very important and very relevant."
"My colleagues, my fellow-Commissioner Mr Michel, who is dealing with this specific issue, sends his apologies and naturally I am happy to take this question on his behalf."
"The Commission endorses the fundamental standpoint that prompted the Quartet to consider new sources of funding."
"In order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, we need a significant increase in financial resources, especially ODA – official development assistance."
"This must go beyond the increase that was agreed in Monterrey and the associated commitment to development financing."
"However, as the World Bank notes in its report to the Committee on Development, the simplest and most effective way of increasing the available resources is to provide a greater proportion of funding for development assistance from national budgets."
"The European Union has already adopted this course in fulfilment of the commitments undertaken in Barcelona in 2002 and will pursue it further, possibly at an accelerated pace."
"We intend to make practical proposals which will be presented by my colleague Louis Michel to the Commission for discussion before they are forwarded to the Council, notably in the context of the Commission Communication, now being prepared, which follows up the Monterrey Conference, and in relation to a consolidated project for the Millennium Summit +5 review conference in September 2005."
"My personal view is that the current innovative proposals, such as the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, are very interesting and we will, of course, take part in the discussions within the various bodies."
"However, they should not serve as a pretext for putting the Monterrey commitments on the back-burner or downgrading them."
"On the contrary, these commitments must be reaffirmed and new ones must be made."
". Thank you, Mr. President, for the floor."
"Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I will speak in my own language – Polish."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have the noble goal of helping poor countries."
"Yet sometimes merely giving money has no effect."
"As a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and hence a representative of education, which the Commissioner mentioned earlier, I would like to draw your attention to one issue."
"The research I have carried out to date indicates that only a little over 30% of those who come from poor countries to study at leading European, American or other universities return to their countries of origin, whether they are here to gain master’s or doctoral degrees."
"We are helping one or two people individually, but this is no help at all to the poor country."
"What needs to happen is for these people to return as technological experts in agriculture, education or any other field, in order to become the elite and the driving force of the economy."
"This is one way to reduce hunger and poverty."
"With regard to the matter we are discussing here, I once had the opportunity to exchange a few words with Commissioner Michel, and I believe that we agree that it would be useful to put forward a proposal, and if possible to implement it, whereby a certain amount of money would be earmarked in the budget to help those returning to poor countries to adapt, or rather re-adapt, to poverty during the transitional period before they find a suitable job that is in keeping with their skills."
"This would be a great help, and in some ways an extension of the scholarships and financial assistance we offer for them to come here and study in our countries."
"In other words, ladies and gentlemen, we do not really need these Ph.D.s from Mali or the Congo, as we have our own, yet they are very much needed in their own countries."
"I am therefore very much in favour of this proposal."
"If necessary, I will draft it properly, including data, and submit it to the Committee on Development as a proposal for the Commission."
"I would like everyone here present and the Commissioner to devote their attention to this now."
"I thank you."
". Mr President, the initiative that was taken on 20 September 2004 in New York, with Lula and Annan playing the leading parts, contains good ideas about aid, trade debts, cancellation and new forms of financing."
"However, back in 2000, the world leaders signed a declaration in which they committed themselves to meeting the Millennium Goals by 2015 or thereabouts."
"Now in 2005, the world can see that, in Africa, a goal such as ‘everyone to school’ is not moving any closer but has edged further away."
"Similarly, the financing pledge of 0.7% of the national budget has not been fulfilled by a long shot."
"A declaration of this kind in 2004 may then seem a little like ‘management by declaration’; unless, with that declaration added to Jeffrey Sachs’ report and the massive wave of sympathy and funds that have been freed up by the tsunami disaster, new political will is organised."
"That, to my mind, should be done straight away, and not by setting up a new world fund, but by fully concentrating all existing aid sources – the World Health Fund, the European Development Fund, the activities of the IMF and the World Bank – from both north and south on the MDGs – the Millennium Development Goals."
"Firm agreements, tight control and coordination are what is needed."
"Europe, being the world’s largest donor, can take the lead."
"At the same time, all European Member States should be able to achieve 0.5% of the national budget for development cooperation by 2010 and 0.7% by 2015."
"The EU itself should set aside 10% from its own financial multi-annual perspectives, channelled via a single development budget, with the MDGs being the legally binding instruments."
"Debt relief for poor countries would also form part of this, thereby making room for water, education and basic amenities; hence also the need for the IMF to revalue the gold reserves."
"This also involves fair trade and an immediate end to export subsidies, while also looking for new sources, not with the intention to forget the 0.7, but to think about new sources that would be interesting."
"It is also a good idea to impose taxes on the negative side of globalisation, such as ‘flash capital’ or the arms trade."
"Now is the time to act."
"I think that the presidency is in good hands and is keen to move in that direction along with Mr Michel and the other Commissioners."
"It will be primarily by the multi-annual financial perspectives that the value of all our declarations will be able to be judged."
". Mr President, the fight against hunger and poverty is still, needless to say, one of the greatest challenges of our time."
"People claim, with good reason, that there is a connection between the provision of aid, debt relief and trade, and that actions in those three areas should complement each other."
"Today, I should mainly like to focus on the trade aspect."
"The ability to integrate in the world economy is beneficial to all countries, whether rich or poor."
"By way of concrete example, we could juxtapose comparable countries, for example South versus North Korea, or the Asian tigers versus the South-Asian countries."
"A free, fair and development-minded multilateral trade system is indeed an effective mechanism in order to drive back poverty and hunger."
"The European Union, in particular, must guarantee the poorest countries better access to the world market by granting priority to capacity-building and technical assistance, thus enabling trade to generate as much development as possible."
"The WTO’s next ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December will be a crucial test to see to what extent the rich countries are serious about giving the poor countries a good chance of being able to integrate fully in global trade."
"Doha has been presented as the ideal development round and after Cancun, we cannot afford a second failure."
"Whichever way, further liberalisation of world trade is a basic condition for more economic growth, both here and in the developing countries."
"In addition to aid and debt relief, a correctly liberated market is a very important, if not most important, instrument for distributing prosperity in the world more effectively and more evenly and for narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor."
". Mr President, when we talk about hunger, we are also talking, and this seems to me to be obvious, about agricultural policy."
"So we cannot, on the one hand, discuss the possibility of increasing development aid funds and, on the other hand, pursue agricultural policies that contribute to a worsening of the situation in many countries."
"As an example, the EU is currently negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements with the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) countries that are causing a great deal of concern, or even opposition, with regard to the direction now being taken."
"This is because the discussions are concentrating almost exclusively on an indiscriminate liberalisation of trade, without taking account of local conditions, while large numbers of cheap, often subsidised, exports from our countries are already playing a part in seriously destabilising the situation for farmers in these countries."
"I therefore think that all these issues need to be examined at the meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly which will take place in Bamako in April."
"I hope, on behalf of my group, that the direction taken by the European Union in this area will change so as to achieve greater consistency between what we are saying today about hunger and poverty and what we are saying elsewhere, in other arenas, about agricultural policy and the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products."
"This is a truly fundamental question."
"If we can start now by making sure our deeds reflect our words, I think we will have taken a real step forward."
". I am of the opinion that overcoming poverty is not primarily a matter of increased financial resources, but that it must be seen in a completely different context."
"In the 1960s, Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, published a book called , in which he talked about an atmosphere of pessimism."
"At the same time, an optimistic atmosphere prevailed in Africa, because Africa had far greater resources than the Asian countries."
"The situation today is completely the opposite."
"The doctrine of Afro-pessimism is spreading, while a number of Asian countries are moving forward."
"This results from the behaviour of the leaders, and it relates to the cultural underpinnings, as Africa has been dominated by tribal structures which subsequently achieved political power."
"It also relates to the quality of the institutions."
"I must say that this comparison between Africa and Asia gives a pointer as to the direction European Union policy should be taking in the field of development aid, in order to ensure that the available resources are being used appropriately in the interests of economic growth."
"Commissioner, I too share the opinion of the authors of the oral question."
"I would ask you to forgive me for making a number of comments, but the subject of this debate has prompted me to inform the Council and the Commission of the frequent cases of extreme poverty and destitution that exist in Poland, and perhaps in other countries of the Union as well."
"The Union has recently undergone enlargement to include poor countries."
"In December, one of my constituents, who was invited to visit the European Parliament in Brussels, told me that in his village it is sometimes the case that children are unable to go to school because they do not have shoes, to say nothing of school supplies."
"The minimum welfare benefit in Poland is between EUR 10 and EUR 100 per month, and the minimum wage is EUR 212."
"Would it not also be possible to establish a fund for the citizens of the Union along the lines of the fund that we are debating, or to force Member States to pay at least EUR 250 per month to those in need?"
"I thank you."
"Mr President, the European development policy is aimed at achieving the Millennium Objectives, central among them the fight against poverty, and those objectives will not be achieved if we continue to work at the current pace and with the current means."
"That is a generally known fact, but it is also known that if we really put our minds to it, we can still achieve them, and to that we must commit ourselves."
"Fighting hunger is one of the most important action points."
"Every day, some 24 000 people die of starvation and malnutrition. That is 24 000 too many."
"Our line of approach can only succeed if we adopt coherent policy in the areas of development aid, agriculture and trade, and deliver on our commitments."
"For that reason, I wholeheartedly back this resolution."
"I should like to mention one item that is not explicitly mentioned in the resolution, namely the position of women."
"Studies have shown that the role of women is crucial to the success of development cooperation policy, yet women are still insufficiently involved in the preparation and implementation of programmes in the countries concerned."
"I am impressed with the work that has gone into the Hunger project, concerning which a huge awareness campaign was recently launched in the Netherlands."
"It is a worldwide organisation that combats hunger in many developing countries."
"Their formula appears extremely successful, precisely because it is mainly geared towards women via training, the provision of information, micro-credits, and such like. Through these, they manage to bring about a significant and permanent improvement in social circumstances and drive back hunger."
"Women take up a key position in society in terms of agriculture, education, hygiene in the family, and such like, which are crucial factors in combating hunger."
"I hope we manage to adopt more effective policy by means of more decisive and more coherent policy."
"As the largest donor, Europe should play a pioneering role in working on the Millennium Objectives and should, in this respect, not forget to involve women in the relevant countries."
"– Mr President, during the campaign prior to the election that took place in Spain in the spring of 2004, Mr Zapatero, who is now the Prime Minister of my country, stated that he would airbrush Spain out of that photo of the three warmongers taken in the Azores. He promised to lead the country into the Quintet engaged in combating hunger instead."
"Mr Zapatero has kept his promise."
"Under President Lula’s direction, this Quintet has succeeded in placing the fight against hunger and extreme poverty on the international agenda."
"I myself had the honour of presenting the first document on this issue to the House. There are three reasons for this."
"Firstly, I believe the European Union must spearhead the international community’s effort to attain that objective."
"Secondly, the objective is attainable. The technical, financial and economic means to overcome hunger and consign it to oblivion are available."
"Thirdly, because I believe the fight against hunger and poverty is not simply a question of development aid."
"This crusade must become one of the axes or one of the pillars of the foreign policy of the European Union and of its Member States, and this is already coming about. Fifteen or twenty years ago, human rights and development aid were key strands of foreign policy."
"It is now time for the fight against hunger and poverty to become more than a campaign, Commissioner. Instead, it must become a permanent feature of the foreign policy of the Commission, the Council and the European Union as a whole."
"Ladies and gentlemen, all initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and hunger are worthy of support."
"Rich countries and supranational organisations with significant financial resources, such as the European Union, bear a special responsibility in this respect."
"In order to reduce hunger effectively, there must be an appropriate hierarchy of spending in the budgets of all countries."
"Priority should be given to measures that promote a pro-family policy, understood in the broadest sense of the word, in order to ensure that everyone has adequate conditions in which to live and develop."
"It is an unfortunate fact that large sums of money are still being wasted, as they are earmarked for measures that directly and indirectly attack the family and those who are weakest and poorest."
"It is reprehensible to treat poor persons and backward regions as though they were objects, by means of showy and sham aid measures aimed at broadening the spheres of influence of the modern superpowers."
"It is shameful to enslave poor countries by means of usurious financial systems."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the following teachings of the Holy Father John Paul II should be an inspiration and source of strength to us in the fight against world hunger and poverty; ‘millions of our brothers and sisters are suffering from hunger, and many are dying of it, especially children."
"In an age of unprecedented technological development, the tragedy of starvation is a great challenge and a great indictment."
"After all, the earth has enough resources to feed all of humankind."
"Why then are millions of people dying of starvation today?"
"What is needed is a serious and worldwide examination of conscience regarding social justice and basic human solidarity."
"We would do well to remember the basic truth that the earth belongs to God, and all the riches it contains have been placed by God in man’s hands to use in a just fashion, so they can serve the good of all."
"The very law of nature bears testimony to this."
"Our common cry for bread on behalf of all who are suffering from hunger must not fail to be heard."
"We address it first of all to God, but we also address it to the politicians and economists, upon whom rests the responsibility for a just distribution of goods, on both a global and a national level."
"We must finally put an end to the scourge of hunger."
"May solidarity prevail over the unrestrained desire for profit."
"Upon each one of us there rests a small part of the responsibility for this injustice."
"Each one of us in some way has first-hand experience of the hunger and poverty of others."
"Let us learn to share our bread with those who have none’."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the light of these teachings by the Pope we must revise our current political activities, all the more so because the problem of hunger is affecting an ever increasing number of citizens of the European Union."
"More than five million people in Poland are already living in extreme poverty."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Ladies and gentlemen. Today, while we are discussing poverty in the world, I should like to draw attention to the central thrust of World Poverty Day, which we are commemorating on 17 October."
"In those places where people are condemned to live in poverty, human rights are being violated."
"It is our sacred duty to unite in an effort to ensure that they are respected."
"The voices of the poorest should be heard everywhere where men and women take decisions on the future of humanity."
"Poverty today represents the greatest obstacle to women’s involvement in all aspects of life."
"International institutions, like the World Bank, for example, challenge us not to forget the fact that the first stage on the long road towards the liberation of women is the struggle against their poverty."
"The participation of women in determining the indicators for poverty is a basic prerequisite in this respect."
"The question arises as to whether we know how to develop the talents of poor people and to facilitate their access to fundamental rights."
"In order to measure and quantify poverty, we need precisely defined indicators."
"The traditional indicators have been roundly criticised by the American economist Gary Becker in his works on human capital and the economic approach to life."
"Becker in particular measured the effect of the gender gap in the field of income and the economic value of family life in all its forms."
"All this economic research shows that one third of the economic activities mainly undertaken by women are not subject to any form of evaluation or monitoring."
"There are simply no indicators or instruments for measuring them. Would it not be useful to take inspiration from the words of Gary Becker to define today a policy for a higher position in society for women?"
"– It is shameful that most European countries have not yet honoured their commitment to allocate 0.7% of their GDP to development aid."
"Even so, the European Union today contributes 55% of total development aid."
"Strengthening Europe’s role in the fight against poverty and in development aid enhances the credibility and effectiveness of the EU’s foreign, security and defence policies throughout the world."
"Europe can make a difference to hunger and poverty if it supports the initiatives of President Lula da Silva and Prime Minister Rodríguez Zapatero and also if it is able to mobilise funds and take the lead in projects with a strategic impact."
"An example is the eradication of malaria, as recommended by the director of the United Nations Millennium Project, because malaria strikes above all at the poorest countries with devastating effect, causing incalculable economic damage."
"According to the WHO, malaria is the disease that causes most death and disability: more than a million people die each year, 90% of them in Africa."
"According to UNICEF, malaria kills a child every 30 seconds."
"Three children have died of malaria while I have been speaking."
"Europe can do more and it can do better."
"The Commission must therefore launch and take the lead in a global anti-malaria campaign, increase funding and channel it into control programmes in the countries affected, support national policies prioritising malaria control, and encourage the private sector in vaccine production and the distribution of treatment drugs and impregnated mosquito nets."
"Poverty and misery feed injustice and despair, and these feed global insecurity."
"By committing to a malaria strategy, Europe will be making a decisive contribution to the Millennium Objectives, which are binding commitments, and also to a fairer and more secure world, the world that Europe’s citizens hope that the European Union will help to build."
"Mr President, during my two minutes speaking time 40 people will die of hunger: 3.5 seconds per person; 24 000 people per day; 9 million every year; 400 million in the past 50 years – 3 times the number of people killed in all the world wars of the last century."
"We talk, we debate, we wring our hands."
"What we do not do is do something about it."
"Almost daily in this Parliament we talk about the Lisbon Agenda – competitiveness and growth leading to prosperity in Europe."
"We are slowly beginning to understand that you can only achieve that with healthy people."
"However, the low income countries of our world also need their own Lisbon agenda, and they need healthy people too."
"Malnutrition means disease and disability."
"Disease means a reduced and ever less-productive workforce."
"That means poverty; and poverty means the inability to counter disease and hunger."
"That is the vicious circle that we have to break."
"That is what the Millenium Development Goals set out to do."
"That is what the World Food Summit set out to achieve."
"That is what the Declaration on Action Against Hunger and Poverty, once again, has declared."
"Even my own report in the ACP set it out yet again."
"We have 30 years of resolutions and 30 years of failure."
"The key is not food aid but food security."
"The former for emergencies, but the latter for long-term survival."
"The key is removing barriers to the imports of produce from low-income countries."
"The key is to ensure that our rightful concern with the tsunami-affected countries does not strip Africa of crucial aid."
"The key is to stress to President Bush - while he is here, in Europe - as well as to other Member States that aid is not an opportunity to reduce First World agricultural surpluses, but that he should buy local with aid money."
"If you cannot buy local, buy regional."
"The key is to reinvest debt repayments in indebted nations to meet those millenium goals for hunger and disease."
"Only then can we give real hope to the 800 million of our fellow human beings who are undernourished."
"Then we will meet those food production targets, not globally but specifically in high-debt, low-income countries."
"That is what this motion sets out to achieve."
"Mr President, I am delighted that we are holding a debate on the issue of hunger and poverty."
"I am one among many to say so, but I cannot help but be pleased."
"This debate also follows on from the initiative launched by the Quintet last September at the United Nations."
"Since then, many other voices have been heard on the same subject."
"Nevertheless, I would remind you that no specific commitments have yet been made."
"Only four of the Member States of the European Union are currently meeting the commitment to devote 0.7% of their GDP to development aid."
"At the rate things are going, the Millennium Development Goals will not be reached in 2015."
"The problem of ending hunger and poverty is as old as the solutions being put forward to solve it: increasing the quality and quantity of development aid, cancelling and reducing debt, instituting a global tax on capital flows, and reforming international trade rules for fairer trade."
"In addition, all of the initiatives being put forward today must be in the form of additional resources devoted to development aid and can under no circumstances replace long-standing commitments."
"Myself, I will be keeping a close eye on these commitments and on this resolution, because only a firm political will can bring an end to this scourge."
"Hunger and poverty cannot be reduced to an ephemeral debate subject to the ups and downs of opportunistic media promotion or of charity, however well intentioned."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the role the new Member States of the European Union play in the achievement of development cooperation."
"I am delighted that a number of the new Member States have recently made significant increases in the budgetary funds they have earmarked for development policy."
"Yet the people of these countries know very little about development cooperation."
"Many people believe that aid consists exclusively of humanitarian aid."
"The noble impulses of the heart and people’s generosity whenever there are natural or humanitarian disasters are commendable, but it is important for people to understand that the elimination of extreme poverty and hunger is a strategic goal."
"I think that it would be worth alerting the citizens of the new Member States to the fact that the poverty that occurs in European countries is a different type of poverty to that which occurs in the poorest countries of the world."
"It is true that Poland is home to five million families who have to survive on the equivalent of EUR 2.5 per person per day, but EUR 2.5 in Poland is significantly more than EUR 2.5 in the poorest countries of the world."
"This is the case because the vast majority of men and women in Poland have access to water, electricity, gas, roads, education, health services and welfare."
"The difference between the technical and social infrastructure in the new EU Member States and in the poorest countries is much greater than it generally seems."
"Raising awareness of development cooperation in the new Member States is a task of such importance that not only the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, but also the governments of the Member States should commit themselves to accomplishing this task to the best of their abilities."
"I know that Commissioner Michel is aware of this issue."
"Poland is the country where immensely positive changes in the economic, political and social spheres came about as a result of the Solidarity movement and the implementation of the idea of solidarity, which began 25 years ago."
"Lech Wałęsa always said that people needed fishing poles, not just fish."
"At the same time as fighting hunger and extreme poverty throughout the world, we should never forget that local opportunities must be created, as well as providing emergency aid."
"This would enable those living in the poorest countries of the world to help themselves, and we would avoid the phenomenon described by researchers as the ‘modernisation of dependence’."
"Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has made it clear that in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, we need a significant increase in ODA – official development assistance, which I would, in fact, prefer to call ‘funding for official development cooperation’."
"I think it is also important to congratulate those countries which are fulfilling the target of spending 0.7% of GDP on development cooperation."
"We should also congratulate countries such as Belgium, Finland, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, which have pledged to achieve this target by 2013."
"I myself come from a Member State that is not high-ranking in this respect."
"Austria and Italy are at the bottom of the league table as far as ODA is concerned."
"That is the reason for my question to the European Commission and the Council: what specific forms of cooperation and monitoring are envisaged so that the countries at the bottom of the table and the middle-rankers catch up with the front-runners, thus ensuring that enough public funding is available to deliver Europe's contribution to fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals?"
"Mr President, you said that it was time for action and we in Parliament agree with you."
"We have a unique opportunity for action this year because we have the two big issues of the banana and sugar regimes on the trade agenda where we can show that we mean business in terms of helping the developing world."
"I am pleased with what Commissioners Mandelson and Michel have said."
"I was recently in the Caribbean, meeting small farmers with tiny farms who cannot survive without access to the EU markets."
"We cannot rob those slightly less poor people to give to the poorest in the world; we have to have a just reform of the banana and sugar regimes."
"That will be a real test of our mettle."
"The WTO conference in Hong Kong in December will be another enormous test for the EU on tariffs."
"We all know that we have spoken many warm words over the years, but I have seen what goes on behind the scenes in developing countries – EU tomato paste and American rice dumped on the markets of Ghana and some of the poorest countries in Africa."
"It is time now for action."
"We will be scrutinised by the NGO movement and by public opinion, which today is watching more carefully than ever because of the big campaigns like 'Make poverty history'."
"They will watch what we do and judge us."
"That will have a big effect on how public opinion perceives the European Union."
"Mr President, I am rather surprised at the direction this debate is taking, because the discussions are focussing very much on identifying additional sources of finance."
"Even if we are right, I wonder whether this debate is not obscuring the real issue, which is that before we discuss the amount of aid we grant, should we not first endeavour to improve the quality and effectiveness of existing aid?"
"This question is all the more important because the discussions on international taxation or on the creation of international financing mechanisms will remain rather hypocritical, as long as the United States and the great majority of the international community will not accept these mechanisms."
"Equally, the amount of effort put into looking for new means, while we have still not achieved the objectives of the Monterrey Consensus, the priority given to improving the effectiveness of existing aid in order to achieve the Millennium objectives, and the scattering of resources and objectives in development policy all diminish the effectiveness of aid."
"We must be careful not to get involved in this headlong rush; we need to concentrate on looking for practical solutions that will allow us to meet our current commitments."
"Let us be specific and pragmatic – that is what the people we want to help expect."
"– Mr President, the hunger and injustice in the world are issues of great importance."
"What factors supposedly make the EU the most suitable global player in relation to this issue?"
"Rather, the EU has contributed to bringing about global problems of poverty through unfair trade rules and a protectionist agricultural policy."
"Whilst contributing economic resources in the form of development aid to poor countries, the European Union is preventing these countries from achieving growth through its bizarre agricultural and trade policies."
"This is inconsistent and not particularly credible."
"Many developing countries are more inclined to see the EU as the cause of their problems than as a solution to them."
"The UN, on the other hand, is an organisation more suited to combating poverty and hunger, having broader global support and more member states."
"In the EU, special national interests are still too dominant."
"Let us fight together for a fairer world."
"The division of responsibilities between the EU and the UN could be as follows: the EU works on reforming its agricultural policy and attempts to bring about a fairer trade policy, whilst the UN provides a means for the countries of the world to channel financial and other aid to starving and suffering people."
"Let us avoid an unnecessary institutional power struggle in pursuing our common goal of eradicating poverty."
". Mr President, I do not think that there are many parliaments that are this sensitive to issues to do with underdevelopment, poverty, countering hunger and actions promoting development."
"I think this does the European Parliament great credit, and it has an important part to play in the European Union's development cooperation policy."
"I think that there are indeed times when we should get indignant."
"Mr Bowis quoted some figures that were horribly effective in showing that, behind the statistics, there are human beings who are suffering in this vicious circle of hunger and who are dying every day, every minute."
"A moment of indignation therefore does have its place."
"However, as someone said, this indignation must be followed by action."
"I must say that the European Union has nothing to be ashamed of in this respect either."
"I do not think that it needs to feel guilty: it is the largest donor of development aid."
"I also admit, though, that the aid we are giving is not enough."
"That is why we have set ourselves more ambitious objectives for those countries that are well below 0.7%."
"On the other hand, those that have achieved, or even exceeded, 0.7%, which, in the current budgetary climate, is still not easy, must remain on course."
"It is also worth emphasising that, in the fight against hunger, against underdevelopment and against poverty, our approach cannot be anything other than global."
"That is why it is important to discuss methods of finance and why the commitments that have already been made must first of all be met."
"We need to find additional and alternative sources of finance."
"However, all of this will only be effective if this approach is part, as one speaker said, of a global approach that also takes trade issues into account."
"In this regard, I must also say that the European Union has not got everything wrong."
"True, there are problems with certain policies, and issues around agricultural policy have already been mentioned, but, in this area too, the European Union is probably the region whose markets are the most open to exports from developing countries."
"The previous Commission's initiative, or more specifically Pascal Lamy's initiative, called , is aimed at the poorest countries."
"I therefore believe that we need to build on what has already been achieved, which is not negligible."
"We also know, though, that the stakes are enormous and that time is short – we do not have decades in front of us – in an increasingly globalised world, and I think that Europe must not get the impression that it is sheltered from these problems, that it is just a spectator."
"We are at the same time a participant, by necessity, but we also feel the direct effects of this poverty."
"When thousands of people arrive on our shores on makeshift rafts, it is one of the consequences of extreme poverty."
"I therefore believe that we need to adopt a global approach; we now have to set up a monitoring system and we must not be afraid of saying, if need be, that the efforts made have not been adequate."
"I think that we in Europe are gradually going to put in place an even more effective policy in this field, which your Parliament considers to be extremely important."
". Mr President, I would like to reiterate what the honourable Member has just said: of course, the fight against hunger is important and it is a moral obligation for us all."
"However, I would like to quote the figures for the development assistance provided in 2003, for example, by the European Union – the world's largest donor, if we take the Commission and the Member States together."
"In that year, the total was EUR 32 billion."
"If the current trends are confirmed, we can assume that in 2006, it will amount to around EUR 46 billion."
"Of course, we must continue our efforts to achieve the UN target of 0.7% of GDP, but let us take a good look at these figures: from the Commission budget alone, the sum of EUR 7 billion is allocated to development every year."
"You are right in one respect."
"As Mr Yañez-Barnuevo has said, trade and other mechanisms, as well as debt relief, are important, of course, and the issue of coherence therefore plays a key role here as well."
"We all know that the Doha Development Round and the WTO conference in Hong Kong are extremely significant in this respect."
"The Commission is currently negotiating the Economic Partnership Agreementswith the ACP countries, and the focus here is on trade as well."
"Our aim is to further liberalise the developing countries' access to EU markets."
"At the same time, the Commission is keen to help the developing countries boost their own economies in future too so that they can benefit from the opening of the markets."
"I noted that this morning, we spoke a great deal about human rights, the rule of law and good governance."
"This afternoon, by contrast, we have not mentioned them."
"Monterrey addresses this very issue: the fact that an appropriate approach must be adopted by both sides."
"The developing countries must uphold these principles too, for otherwise our money – and it is taxpayers' money – will simply be wasted."
"In response to Mr Kaczmarek, the honourable Member from Poland, who will be informed of my comments even though he is unfortunately no longer in the Chamber – I say this: it is, of course, sad that there is poverty in Poland, but that is why the European Union has established the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds and it is up to the Polish Government to make appropriate use of them."
"In response to Mrs Martens, let me say that she is absolutely right."
"Until recently, I myself was not only the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria; I was also the State Secretary for Development Cooperation, and in my work, I always focussed on women, for they are a key development factor both within the family and in the economy as a whole."
"However, small and medium-sized enterprises are also extremely important for a bottom-up approach."
"Finally, let me reiterate that from our perspective, it is extremely important for the Millennium Development Goals to dictate the direction of development cooperation."
"The Commission will work very closely with your House in this context, and we hope it will be possible to adopt the millennium package on 22 March."
"The package comprises four communications: one cross-cutting, which describes our contribution to the UN Millennium Summit, and three others, each dealing with one aspect of our endeavours."
"Here too, we will undoubtedly have occasion to discuss the financing issue further."
"At the end of the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Hunger and poverty are no longer only a humanitarian issue."
"According to the recommendations of the UN High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, hunger and poverty along with the HIV epidemic and environmental degradation, constitute a threat to world security, over and above the traditional threats facing Humanity at present (eg terrorism)."
"These threats are interrelated, and a threat to one is a threat to all."
"The World Bank estimates that the September 11 attacks increased the number of people living in poverty by 10 million."
"Poverty, as measured by per capita GDP, is strongly related with the outbreak of civil wars: 12% probability when less than 1000USD and 2.5% when it reaches 4000USD."
"Meeting the Millennium Development Goals and decisions taken in Johannesburg and Monterrey is the right direction."
"Reducing trade barriers, increasing development assistance and providing debt relief are obligations of the developed countries."
"It is true that not all Member States, particularly the newcomers, including my own, can meet the obligation of contributing the 0.7% of their national income."
"I urge the Council to take a collective decision on this issue so that every M.S presents a multiannual programme by which it commits itself to reach the 0.7% target and in the meantime the remaining to be complimented through the EU Budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was present at the meeting with the representative of the United Nations."
"I would like to clarify why we have made this request."
"With the entry into force of the agreement and the signing of the quota system, many developing countries which have turned textile and clothing manufacturing into one of their major economic resources, will have to contend with a social and economic disaster, a drastic restructuring which will also affect economically dominant countries such as ours."
"More than 60 countries may be cut out of the market to make room for the giant China, whose competitiveness is not only based on low wages – they are far lower in Vietnam and Cambodia – but also on more advanced factories and a steadily improving transport network."
"According to some estimates, China will secure 50% of the United States’ clothing market and 29% of that of Europe, followed by India in second place."
"It could be argued that eliminating a complex quota system and preferential treatments would chiefly benefit the industries of developing countries."
"Market liberalisation, however, directly favours the largest manufacturers and not developing countries."
"Let me repeat that trade is one instrument, but it cannot and will not resolve the development problem, as is clear from the liberalisation of the sugar and banana sectors."
"Recent country reports on textile industry exports show a negative economic and social impact in these countries."
"It is a known fact that the producer countries are moving towards areas where labour costs are much lower, with the consequent severe exploitation of manpower and social dumping issues rather than guaranteed minimum standards."
"In order to stay competitive, many countries, such as the Philippines or Bangladesh, make working conditions worse by doing away with worker’s rights."
"The contradictions which have emerged from this work represent a challenge as to how we can, on the one hand, play our part so as not to ruin these economies while ensuring, on the other, that our countries’ economies as well can be evaluated differently."
"We have also asked, therefore, which instruments should be put into effect in order to prevent such contradictions from being so hard-hitting."
". Mr President, Mrs Morgantini, Mr Barón Crespo, I think that the question you have asked is actually not unrelated to the debate we have just had."
"If there is one sector that is in the avant-garde of globalisation, as it were, it is the textiles sector."
"For decades now we have been noticing the extent to which the international division of labour has changed in the textiles sector in particular."
"Indeed, you raise some important issues that affect not only Europe but also its partners, especially those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, as demonstrated by this morning's debate on the constant development of production and the delocalisation of textiles manufacturing."
"I think this is a very important issue."
"In addition, the Council has in recent years continuously monitored the situation in the European textiles and clothing industry as it has changed in response to the phasing out of quotas on imports of textiles and clothing from WTO Member States."
"Two sets of Council conclusions, adopted in response to two communications from the Commission in 2003 and 2004, demonstrate this concern, amongst other things."
"With regard, in general, to the gradual move towards a quota-free system, it has to be said that this is not an unexpected event."
"In fact, as I am sure Parliament knows, the end of four decades of heavily regulated trade in textiles and clothing comes as no surprise at all."
"The implementation and expiry of the Agreement on Textile and Clothing form an integral part of the results of the Uruguay Round concluded in 1994."
"Since then, it has been clear that as from 1 January 2005 the textiles and clothing sector would be fully integrated into the framework of Article 9 of GATT 1994."
"All over the world, all those involved, including of course the European textiles and clothing industry, knew that this was coming."
"The Commission, for its part, adopted a set of seven actions to deal with this new quota-free environment."
"As the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry stated when this plan was adopted, whether at EU, national or regional level, we need to provide the sector with conditions that will enable it to improve its competitiveness and to remain a key industry for the EU, which is what you also called for, Mr Barón Crespo."
"In its conclusions of 25 and 26 November 2004, the Council stated that it supported the Commission's strategy for the textiles and clothing sector, which focuses on competitiveness linked to research and innovation, training and better skills, protection of intellectual property rights, access to third country markets and encouraging the development of strategies for the textiles industry in the Euro-Mediterranean zone."
"The Council considers the Commission's package of measures to be appropriate."
"It has also urged the Commission to allow the High Level Group for Textiles and Clothing to continue its work."
"In addition, it has invited the Commission to regularly inform the Council about developments in the EU textiles and clothing sector in the aftermath of the dismantling of import quotas as from 1 January 2005; and it has also invited the Commission to report on the outcome of the further discussions of the High Level Group."
"As regards the High Level Group's recommendations on the growth of imports from China, which is indeed a top-priority concern, the Council recognises that the Commission has stated that it is prepared to use the trade defence instruments available to it, if the legal conditions are met and if such an approach is actually necessary."
"I would like to add that our relations with China are indeed also important in this particular area."
"We are anxious to integrate China into international trade rules, which is why we have made every effort to bring them into the WTO."
"We now need to ensure that they respect these rules, and also other less formal rules regarding, for example, social protection and social standards."
"It is a subject that we will have to discuss with China."
"These legal conditions have very recently been changed in order to transpose the lifting of quotas into Community law."
"The Council adopted a Regulation to this end on 13 December 2004."
"Council Regulation 2200/2004 thus marks the end of the Agreement on Textile and Clothing as far as the European Union is concerned, and it also provides for a surveillance system to be put in place as of 1 January 2005 to monitor imports of the most sensitive textiles and clothing."
"This system will provide customs-based surveillance of imports of liberalised products of all origins and will include a requirement to issue an import surveillance document for imports of certain products from China."
"This requirement will be lifted in 2005, once the customs-based surveillance system is fully operational."
"This information will be published at least once a month."
"With regard to the use of safeguard clauses, Parliament considered, in its resolution of January 2004 on the future of the textile and clothing sector in the EU, that there was a need to set up a clear, rapid and transparent procedure concerning the WTO general safeguard clauses and the special clauses applying to China under the Protocol on China's accession to the WTO."
"The High Level Group also requested more detailed information in this regard from the Commission."
"At the moment, it appears that the Commission is prepared to meet expectations in this respect, since it is going to draft guidelines governing the procedures regarding safeguard measures."
"Finally, with respect to the impact of the expiry of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing on developing countries and the measures that the European Union could take under Articles 177 and 178 of the Treaty, let me start by citing two of the three objectives of our development cooperation, as set out in the Treaty: the sustainable development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them; and the integration of the poorest countries into the world economy."
"The European Union's trade policy obviously takes account of these objectives, as required by Article 178 of the Treaty."
"The realisation of the Doha Development Round and the way in which the Doha Development Agenda is developing are just one more example of this."
"Let me also remind you, with regard more specifically to the expiry of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, that the end of quotas and the integration of trade in textiles and clothing into the GATT were one of the main demands of the developing countries during the Uruguay Round."
"It is true that, since it joined the WTO, China has seen a constant increase in its share in the international textile and clothing trade."
"China's continuing growth, which is already significant, may be achieved at the detriment of a number of weak and vulnerable developing countries, as Members have stressed."
"In this regard, the direction that the Council is taking is clear, and I would like to quote again from the conclusions I referred to earlier: 'the Council supports a GSP scheme that will be targeted at countries most in need, such as the least developed countries and the most vulnerable developing countries in order to help them play a greater role in international trade’."
"In this context, the situation resulting from the removal of textiles from the quota system will also be examined during the discussions on the new GSP scheme."
"Moreover, it is this new GSP scheme, known as 'GSP Plus', which should in principle be finalised by the end of March in order to enter into force at the beginning of April."
"This issue has also repeatedly been brought up during the EU-China Textiles Dialogue, initiated on 6 May 2004."
"During the last meeting held as part of this dialogue, in December 2004, we had the impression, for the first time, that the Chinese authorities had started to understand the problem and the European Union's message, because they announced measures favouring a number of developing countries."
"It remains to be seen how effective these measures will be."
"The Council will continue to monitor carefully all the changes facing this market."
"With regard to measures favouring the European Union's textiles and clothing industry, the Council has been insistent in calling on the Commission to take a greater interest in the strategic sectors, namely innovation, including non-technological innovation, and the development of industrial cooperation with the Euro-Mediterranean partners."
"We need to focus on higher value-added products, for one thing, and on industrial cooperation with complementary partners in developing countries, for another."
"I would add to this the opening up of markets, in particular the Chinese market, to this type of European product."
"In order to supplement these general guidelines, we need to leave a certain amount of room for manoeuvre with regard to the rules of origin, which will make it possible to improve the situation of the developing countries that export textiles and clothing."
"At the beginning of January 2004, the Commission presented to the Council a Green Paper entitled 'The future of rules of origin in preferential trade arrangements'."
"The Council will be sure to examine any legislative proposal that the Commission may submit to it on this subject when the time comes."
". – Mr President, I can be brief. My colleague from the Council has already said everything the Commission would say."
"– I would, nevertheless, like to say a few words."
"The WTO Agreement is of course a very important one, and it expired on 31 December."
"The task now is to see how we can cushion the predictable impacts."
"Mr Schmit has already responded to Mr Barón Crespo by outlining the measures presented by the Commission and adopted by the Council."
"Let me say again: it is extremely important to adopt measures to step up the fight against fakes and piracy, to enforce intellectual property rights, to establish an action plan in response to the existing trade barriers in third countries, to promote high-tech and ultra high-quality textiles and clothing, including via the EU's research and development programmes, and to guarantee lifelong learning and vocational training and development."
"He also mentioned the monitoring procedure and the imports of textiles and clothing into China."
"I would just say that Commissioner Mandelson, who is actually responsible for this portfolio, is now on his way to China to discuss all these issues, and others."
"The protection measures outlined by Mr Schmit are a last resort."
"Indeed, they can only be implemented if the legal conditions comply with WTO rules."
"We must also consider how trade developments in this area will impact on the highly vulnerable textile and clothing sector."
"It has already been mentioned that the Commission and the WTO are carefully monitoring China's progress in implementing its WTO commitments and are utilising the opportunities available to us."
"For those countries affected by the liberalisation of textile quotas, the best option would be to adopt measures to improve the range of goods they offer."
"We are prepared to assist these countries as they adopt these measures."
"For the ACP states, for example, a study is now being prepared which reviews the response strategy of those countries which are heavily dependent on exports of textiles and clothing."
"The European Investment Bank could also offer services here, such as an investment facility."
"That is one option which I throw open for discussion. I will then answer questions on this issue."
"Thank you, Commissioner. Indeed, the Council spoke for four times as long as you."
"From my vantage point, however, I do not interpret this as an attempt by the Council to encroach on the Commission’s time. Rather, I understand it as an effort by the Council to save the Commission some work, in the best spirit of interinstitutional cooperation."
". Mr President, with effect from 1 January 2005, WTO members have no longer been able to apply quotas to the import of textiles and clothing, and this has had a phenomenal impact on the European market."
"The first figures of January this year compared to the same period last year demonstrate that a fivefold increase in imports of clothing from China is not a flash in the pan."
"This does, of course, have major implications for European manufacturing industry."
"It has, of course, been known that the quotas would expire and perhaps the industry should have been better prepared for this."
"Since it now transpires that, according to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of jobs, or at least thousands of jobs, are on the line, I can imagine that thought is being given to protective measures or the temporary reintroduction of part of the quota system in order to give the industry a little more time to adjust."
"China’s protocol of accession to the WTO allows for this."
"If the Commission considers measures in some way or another, then this will bring with it new problems, certainly if those measures involve quotas."
"After all, there are European importers of clothing from China who have now entered into major commitments for 2005."
"They should not be sacrificed to an operation to rescue manufacturing industry."
"I would therefore urge the Commission and the Council, in the event of any reintroduction of quotas or other protective measures, to ensure that an arrangement is put in place which stops entrepreneurs who have anticipated the new situation from being victimised."
"Finally, I do believe that – as has already been said – we should do our level best to ensure that China complies with the WTO obligations with regard to opening up its own market."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is concern that the end of the quota system for imports as of 1 January 2005 will lead to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the European textile industry."
"As has already been pointed out, this sector currently employs over two and a half million workers."
"The representatives of the sector do not wish to infringe the January 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. What they are calling for is recognition of the fact that when China became a full Member of the WTO in 2001 the situation of the sector changed dramatically, and this had not been foreseen."
"It is therefore entirely justifiable for the textile sector to receive special support from the Union’s institutions and also from the Member States and regional authorities."
"The Commission and the Council must provide strong support for the European textile industry to allow it to enter new markets."
"It is important to insist that China abide strictly by the commitments it entered into with the WTO."
"In addition, other countries such as India, Brazil, the United States of America and Canada should lift the artificial technical and bureaucratic barriers they currently have in place."
"It has to be said that the strategy proposed by the High Level Group on the textile sector provides for a most appropriate course of action."
"The sectors concerned are now calling for it to be developed and applied as a matter of urgency."
"Time is of the essence."
"The inclusion of an approach aimed especially at SMEs has been suggested, as the latter account for 90% of industries of this type. There has also been a call for a flexible reserve fund to be set up within the Structural Funds to help implement the changes required within the sector."
"For many years, the textile industry has been making a tremendous effort to restructure in order to become competitive. The challenges now before it are so enormous that it cannot be left to face them alone."
". Mr President, as you know, thanks to a particularly aggressive dumping policy, and the reduction of prices to an improbable 70%, which is lower than the price for raw materials, China has already seized one-third of the quota-free textile imports in Europe."
"If nothing is done about this, the European market, now fully open, will be flooded with cheap textiles from China, but also from India and Pakistan."
"I very much doubt, Commissioner, that the Commission’s action plan of 13 October 2004 will be enough to help the European textile industry in its fight for survival."
"The plan provides for support measures, but does not contain any trade-related measures at all."
"It was envisaged that textile imports into Europe would be monitored from 1 January onwards, which would allow the Commission to take action swiftly if necessary, but Commissioner Mandelson acknowledged last week in the Committee on International Trade that this monitoring system is still not operational and criteria have not even been laid down."
"When will this, at long last, be done?"
"When it is too late to lock the stable door, and the horse has already bolted?"
"Might I urge the Commission to use all possible means to combat unfair commercial practices in some countries?"
"The Commission has the means at its disposal, including a horizontal safeguard clause, a textile-specific safeguard clause which, according to the Multi-Fibre Agreement, is permitted under certain circumstances, or in extreme circumstances, it can lodge a complaint to the WTO’s dispute settlement body."
"In short, Commissioner, what we expect from the Commission is a more trade-minded and more pro-active approach."
"We must be bold enough to hold up our fist to major trading partners, certainly if they compete with us unfairly."
"It is unacceptable to leave 177 000 companies and 2.7 million workers in the European textile sector out in the cold."
". – It is a positive step that we are at last having this debate here, but it is a pity that it did not take place towards the end of last year, before liberalisation, as I had proposed."
"What is at stake is the textile industry, a strategic sector with great potential for the future, which can make an enormous contribution to economic and social cohesion. As a productive sector it deserves urgent protection through a specific programme."
"Otherwise, the opposite will happen, with higher unemployment and obstacles to development."
"In countries with weaker economies, where the textile and clothing industries are mostly located – as is the case in northern and central Portugal – there is already a worrying increase in the number of import licences issued for Chinese goods, especially in the most sensitive product categories for Portuguese industry, in addition to all the concern about household textiles imported from other places, such as India and Pakistan."
"Therefore, for the sake of protecting the jobs of thousands or even millions of workers and the industry itself, the safeguard clause must be applied urgently, since it will only have a positive effect if it is used soon."
". – Mr President, now that the quantitative import controls for the textile and clothing industry have been abolished, there is great concern about the future of the textile and clothing industry in the EU."
"It is worth putting this into an historical perspective."
"In 1962, as a young economics student, I wrote an essay on the marked decline of the Swedish textile and clothing industry after the Second World War."
"At that time, the reason for this was the stiff competition from low-wage countries such as Germany and Italy."
"I found that structural change in the sector had been successful."
"Labour had moved to better paid jobs in the engineering industry, and what remained of the textile and clothing industry had moved on to more advanced products."
"No unemployment had resulted, and the trade unions had played an active part in the structural change."
"The whole episode stood out as a tale with a happy ending from both an economic and a social point of view."
"This process continued during the 1960s and 1970s."
"At that time, the surviving Swedish textile and clothing enterprises moved a large proportion of their production to low-wage countries such as Finland and, in time, Portugal, but kept their design and marketing operations in Sweden."
"Special products such as men’s suits and car upholstery continued to be made in Sweden, and were profitable."
"Nowadays, the thought of Finland – ‘Nokialand’ – now so advanced, still being considered a low-wage country in the late 1960s is laughable."
"Today, very little remains of Swedish textile and clothing production, but large Swedish clothing chains employ large numbers of people in designing and marketing clothing worldwide."
"We have had ten years to adapt."
"For the EU to become a leading, dynamic, knowledge-based region, its socioeconomic system must succeed in compensating for a decline in the textile and clothing industry by means of a transition to more sophisticated textile and clothing products and strong growth in other sectors."
"If it does not, the Lisbon agenda will show itself to have been a soap bubble waiting to burst."
". Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today all the concerns already raised during the parliamentary debate in January 2004 are being voiced again, but above all the emphasis is on the inadequacy of the measures recommended by the Prodi Commission with regard to the crisis in the textile and clothing sector, which have already been weighing down industry in this sector for some years, causing the loss of thousands of jobs."
"We only have to cast our minds back to the unwillingness to address the issue with specific programmes."
"We hope that there will now be other guidelines."
"The High Level Group and the Commission have proposed seven actions to help the textile industry boost competitiveness in the sector: they are all important, but I would give particular emphasis to one of these."
"In Europe we have labour legislation with especially strong worker protection which vastly inflates the cost of goods."
"We cannot tolerate unfair competition from certain non-EU countries based precisely on extremely low labour costs and in particular, the exploitation of child labour."
"Along with the call to tighten corporate social responsibility, we will have to make the public more aware of ethical purchases, through special campaigns."
"To this end, labelling which allows consumers to easily identify goods manufactured in accordance with the fundamental labour rights specified by the International Labour Organisation is vital in order for buyers to take responsibility too."
"Together with actions in the fight against counterfeiting, I would highlight the suggestion to take action to support traditional textiles with focused programmes, not least so that we can avoid further official approval of textile goods, which is certainly of little use in the context of celebrating regional identities."
"Mr President, our textile and clothing industry is in bad shape."
"Since the end of the 1980s, French companies have been making workers redundant or closing down altogether, and more and more businesses are relocating to low-wage countries."
"Since the 1960s, the textile and clothing sector in France has lost two-thirds of its workforce, which is about 20 000 jobs per year, and today we are suffering 2 000 job losses a month."
"In my own region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, historically an important textile-producing area, towns such as Elesmes, Roubaix and Tourcoing have witnessed the closure of their businesses."
"The social situation is already serious and yet it is going to get worse in future."
"Until now, quotas have made it possible to limit imports of textiles from third countries, but on 1 January 2005 the door was opened to imports on a massive scale from China."
"France and Europe now need to define a strategy to defend their textile industry."
"We must as a matter of urgency request the WTO to provide safeguard clauses."
"Indeed, this option is available to Member States if a sudden increase in imports is observed, to the major detriment of a local industry, and this is indeed the case in France and Europe today."
"Since the quotas expired on 1 January, imports have soared, and the flood from China is destroying whole sections of what remains of our textile industry."
"Imports of trousers made in China between 1 January 2005 and 2 February 2005 increased by 792% compared to the same period in 2004."
"Imports of pullovers increased by 613%."
"Before it is too late, and regardless of the opinion of Guillaume Sarkozy, President of the French textile industry union and a fierce advocate for the delocalisation of businesses, we must not wait to see our internal market flooded before we demand a return to customs barriers and safeguard clauses."
"The extremist advocates of liberalisation who drafted Article 314 of the Constitutional Treaty, announcing the opening of our borders to world trade and the lowering of customs barriers, are promising us major general industrial and social decline, of which the textiles issue is an unpleasant foretaste."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, my fellow Members have pointed out several times that the textile industry used to provide more than two and a half million jobs, and I myself come from a region, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais in France, that knows all about this, because it is currently suffering greatly from this loss of jobs."
"These figures show how necessary it is to put in place a strategy that can help the textile and clothing industry to cope with changes connected with the disappearance of quotas."
"We currently have only incomplete data, but even what we do have is alarming."
"According to declarations made by Chinese importers, imports of many categories of textile products into Europe have doubled, or even trebled, since quotas ended on 1 January 2005."
"It is vital for the EU to have trade policy instruments that enable it to respond to sudden variations in imports."
"In that regard, Commissioner, it has become a matter of urgency for the Commission to publish guidelines regarding the textiles-specific safeguard clause for China announced in October 2004, in the absence of which industries throughout the Member States will be unable to respond."
"The EU respects its commitments within the WTO."
"These commitments must now be respected by all members of that organisation."
"The textile and clothing market must remain open and competitive."
"The European Union also needs to realise that many textile-producing countries regarded as vulnerable are also at risk of being seriously affected by the lifting of quotas."
"I am thinking of Bangladesh, Cambodia and our Mediterranean neighbours."
"It was almost ten years ago that the European Union decided to enter into a partnership promoting development in the Euro-Mediterranean region."
"The question of textiles therefore points more than ever to the need to establish a real free-trade area as soon as we can."
"– Although the textile and clothing industry has lost some ground across the European Union in general in recent years, it is still very important in some countries of the Union and, in fact, the economies of several regions are actually structured around it."
"Since January, as has been mentioned here already, international trade quotas for these products have disappeared."
"Even though the change was expected, it has had a severe impact on markets, particularly because of the dominance of China."
"Ignoring social or environmental concerns, China allows its companies to sell at exceedingly low prices."
"That results in two essential consequences: the more vulnerable exporting countries are harmed, as in some cases they depend almost entirely on this kind of industry for their economic survival; and countless factories in Europe may be ruined."
"Despite the commitments made by the Chinese authorities in recent months to impose their own limits on exports from their country, the fact is that the indicators that we have are giving us great cause for concern."
"It is now appropriate, therefore, to raise the following questions: first: how are the Commission and the Council taking account of the changes occurring in this area and what means are they using to constantly monitor the situation; and, secondly, under what conditions is the Commission prepared to implement the specific safeguard mechanisms, bearing in mind that there is at least a fear that the United States may do so very soon?"
"Mr President, my fellow Members have already pointed out that the consequences of lifting the quotas has been immediate, and the threat facing the European textile and clothing industry is indeed a real one."
"By way of example, I would also like to refer my own region, which has been seriously affected by the decline of the textile industry."
"The district of Castres-Mazamet acquired its industrial nature from the wool pulling and leather industry."
"For many years now, the SMEs in this sector have been closing down one after another."
"Some of them have been able to switch to other fields, thanks to skills developed in international trade, industrial technology and the development of new products."
"But do we have the right to write off those who want to ply their trade in textiles and clothing?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, do we not have a duty to protect the European textile and clothing industry?"
"Pending implementation of the High Level Group's recommendations, on which Parliament will state its position, the European Union has defined a strategy for coping with changes resulting from the end of quotas, which translates, it would seem, into specific commitments: producing a draft protocol on the rules of origin, adopting guidelines regarding the textiles-specific safeguard clause for China, putting in place the Community preference system, the likely establishment of a 10% threshold with the aim of preserving the market share of traditional providers of the EU, negotiating at the WTO in order to obtain substantial concessions from emerging countries that maintain high tariffs, as well as erecting non-customs barriers in the textiles and clothing sector and, finally, adopting strategic plans at local level to improve the allocation of public funds."
"I have in mind in particular funds from the flexibility reserve within the framework of the structural funds and of the 'regional competitiveness and employment' Objective."
"Within what timeframe and following what timetable are you planning to apply these specific measures?"
"Mr President, the textiles and clothing sectors are very important in many areas of Europe, particularly in Catalonia."
"It involves more than 2 600 companies that employ over 72 000 workers."
"This year all the quotas and duties for WTO countries must be completely phased out."
"Therefore, these countries will have unrestricted access to EU markets."
"This could lead to dumping situations that will harm our economies."
"This could encourage businesses to relocate to other latitudes."
"I understand that such a phenomenon can only be addressed by pouring more money into research investment budgets."
"There are two possible objectives."
"First, to manufacture products of finer quality with added value that can compete with those from other countries, mainly China."
"Second, to launch a unified European trade market, including a quality index."
"In addition to that, we need to develop a strategy that favours business concentration as a positive tool to make the sector more competitive and efficient."
"This would forestall the threat of business relocation."
"An active role by the EU is the best way to achieve social cohesion and the maintenance of the living standards we have come to expect in this part of the world."
"– Mr President, the liberalisation of the markets for the profitability of big business and within the framework of the WTO included, among other things, the abolition of textile import quotas in Europe."
"Thus, companies and handicrafts either moved to countries with lower labour costs or closed."
"In both cases, those who lost most were the workers in the sector, who know the road to unemployment."
"In Greece, entire towns have literally died."
"WTO analysts estimate that, over coming years, China's share will exceed 50% internationally, while in the European Union approximately 325 000 jobs will be lost."
"This is a choice of the European Union which, although it appears contradictory, is in the interests of the European monopolies, so that they can penetrate China's huge market in profitable sectors and exploit cheaper labour costs."
"All that is maintained about controls, research and innovation, about a more competitive European textile industry, does not help and does not concern the small professionals who will be wiped out; it concerns the monopoly groups, which will increase their profits."
"Let the workers and the small professionals draw their own conclusions about the policy of the European Union, which destroys the many that are weak and strengthens the few that are rich."
"Let them join forces with the consistent class movement in order to change this policy."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some years ago the British Commissioner responsible for international trade was asked: ‘What should be the minimum market share that the textile sector in Europe should be guaranteed?’"
"The reply was: ‘None, if the market is pushing in that direction.’"
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, today, one day after the removal of the quota measures imposed on textile imports from China, that Commissioner’s prophesy has come true."
"Market risk occurs not when people are guided by common sense but when there is woolly thinking."
"The textile sector is on its knees, with all the consequences that has for developing the economy and for our fellow citizens’ well-being."
"Market reaction has been immediate in these first two months of 2005."
"Applications for import licences from China have risen."
"To a great extent, the small producers in the textile sector are closing and becoming importers."
"They close their factories and lay off their workers, thus becoming vendors of products that are placed on the market at high prices even though they are of terrible quality."
"We need to understand, therefore, whether the Commission and the Council want to implement those measures that are possible, recognised and permitted within the framework of the WTO agreements, so as to cushion the adverse effects of removing the quotas."
"Even before that, however, we need to understand the Commission’s and the Member States’ philosophy."
"We believe that the mark of origin remains the most important of the possible measures."
"Producers and consumers need to be protected by means of transparency – in other words, by identifying the quality and origin of products."
"The European quality mark, with the European nation of origin specifically mentioned on it, is thus in our view the primary objective to be achieved if we want to ensure, not protection of Europe as such, but rather respect for what Europe produces."
"The Commission and the Council are aware that, in view of the current situation in the textile sector, the entire industry in Europe may disappear from world markets and from our own markets."
"How do they intend to act in the WTO when faced with the next demands for liberalisation in one or other manufacturing industry, in which the same consequences that we have seen in the textile industry may be repeated?"
"We look forward to a reassuring answer, Commissioner; otherwise, we shall be forced to think that, as Europe progresses, some manufacturing industries in Europe including Italy, – as it concerns me directly to a great extent – will be forced to shut up shop and wave goodbye to social cohesion and the European model."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank those who initiated today’s debate."
"We are facing a serious problem that has affected many textile factories in my country, Poland, as well as in the EU as a whole."
"This has not happened over the past few weeks or months; we have in fact been confronted with an Asian invasion of cheap fabrics since the 1990s."
"If this were only a matter of a free market, cheaper products or a cheaper workforce, it would be hard for us to protest, given that the European Union itself promotes the principle of a free market."
"Yet the non-European powers in the textile market do not play by any rules, not even those that they themselves agreed to when they joined the WTO."
"In view of this, the European Union must join forces to defend Polish, French and German companies – indeed all companies throughout the European Union – from what must quite simply be called unfair competition."
"– The textile and clothing industry in Europe is facing a serious crisis."
"The crisis is also concentrated in certain regions that are in themselves already disadvantaged and will now be much more vulnerable."
"With the shake-up in the sector, we have seen massive relocation of production in recent years as well as mass redundancies, the vast majority of which involves poorly-skilled women."
"The result is well known and leaves no room for doubt: a loss of 20 to 25% of factories and jobs over about ten years."
"The recent opening-up of the market to China is aggravating the situation."
"Now that we have reached this point, I suggest that the Commission should adopt three kinds of measures."
"First, it should stringently monitor all imports into the single market, and not hesitate to act through the safeguard clauses."
"For that to happen, it is essential that the monitoring system should work, and that it should work soon."
"I do not intend to call for any kind of protectionism, which would be to fly in the face of history."
"Europe has to accustom itself to competing with countries where labour is cheap, but it cannot accept competition from companies that do not pay for their energy, use child slave labour and do not respect intellectual property."
"Secondly, it is important to look into the relocation of textile companies, as well as cases of fraud and of companies that had been given support before closing down."
"Thirdly, a recommendation for the Commission: the European textile sector should invest at the points in the value chain where Europe has a genuine competitive advantage."
"To that end, we need to develop a policy that takes account of the following aspects, amongst others: logistical infrastructure, geographical proximity to major markets, fast order turnaround, design, quality control, innovation, use of new materials and new technologies, relations with major distribution networks, permanent vocational training, and support for SMEs, which still make up the majority of companies in the sector."
"I call on the Commission to accept that that is the path for the future of the textile industry in Europe."
"– Mr President, the abolition as of 1 January 2005 of all duties and quotas and of textile import restrictions is a development of huge economic, social and political importance to the countries of the European Union and to my country, Greece."
"This development has already created the first adverse consequences in Greece, with uncontrolled imports of Chinese products, which hit not only the textile and clothing sector, but also consumer safety, with poor quality, cheap products."
"The experts at the WTO and the OECD may see advantages in the full liberalisation of the textile and clothing trade, but European and Greek businessmen and workers do not."
"The textile and clothing industry manufacturing base is shrinking."
"Industries and handicrafts close daily in Greece, while others relocate to neighbouring Balkan countries."
"At the same time, unemployment is constantly rising."
"One typical example is that, in December 2004 alone, 12 small and medium-sized businesses closed in Greece, leaving over 650 workers unemployed."
"In the face of this dramatic development and taking account of the data of the WTO, which forecasts that China will control 50% of the world textile market in the next two years, I fear that the European Commission is merely monitoring developments."
"While the United States, Turkey and Argentina recently decided to use safety measures and impose quotas on certain categories of Chinese products, at the moment we are still waiting for the European Commission to submit guidelines."
"This is a question I wish to put to the Commissioner, in the absence of Mr Mandelson."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to confront the Commissioner with a statement from her fellow-Commissioner Mr Mandelson."
"He recently said to the French newspaper , that ‘according to a study commissioned by the OECD, the omission of the textile quota will save each family EUR 270 annually’."
"Unfortunately, Mr Mandelson ignored the thousands of families who, as a result of the abolition of the quota and of the resulting Chinese ‘tidal wave’, will lose their jobs, if they have not already done so."
"Moreover, Mr Mandelson has drawn rather hasty conclusions, because he overlooks, whether consciously or not, the fact that the expected falls in price will affect only a very limited range of textile and clothing products, and will therefore have a very limited effect in general."
"I am surprised by, and very disappointed with, Mr Mandelson’s ultra-liberal discourse, but that is just by the by."
"I have a few concrete questions and suggestions."
"First of all, can you confirm that the Commission will respond and take action once it is proven that the Chinese products end up on the European market at dumping prices?"
"That can be done on the basis of the price of raw materials on the international markets."
"The Commission only needs the will to do this."
"Secondly, Commissioner, what safeguard measures – and this subject has already been expressly mentioned here – would you consider in order to prevent certain product categories in Europe from being wiped off the map as a result of unfair competition?"
"Finally, what concrete steps can you take, and indeed, are you prepared to take, to ensure that in China too, the basic social and ecological threshold standards are respected?"
"You could, for example, make certain practices public in the context of a naming and shaming information campaign, to mention but an example."
"Finally, Commissioner, it is reported that last month’s textile imports from China increased considerably, not to say spectacularly."
"I hope that the Commissioner will not fob us off again with a bromide that our textile industry has had ten years to adjust, for that would be the height of oversimplification."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is not, of course, the case that the textiles industry has been dormant in recent years."
"It is, of course, often pointed out that this industry has had ten years in which to adapt to the situation. That is all true."
"The fact is, though, that China now dominates 20% of the world market, and in three or four years' time, this share will have risen to 50%."
"China has the lowest wages and its energy costs are also a third lower – and what was that about its human rights record?"
"Over the next three to four years, the number of jobs in Europe's textiles sector – currently standing at 2.7 million – will be cut by half."
"This will have a particular impact on some old EU countries, notably Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece, but also on Romania and Bulgaria, not to mention Turkey."
"What I would like the Commissioner to tell us is which measures she will adopt to cushion the imminent and severe labour market problems."
"Which measures does she intend to deploy to persuade China to cooperate more fully?"
"I ask this in my capacity as Vice-President of the International Textile, Clothing and Leather Workers' Association. We cannot simply leave these workers to fend for themselves."
"– Since 1 January, the volume of licensed textile imports from China in several textile categories has been up to seven times higher than in the corresponding period in 2004."
"For several items, import licences in the last two months have already exceeded the total imports of the same items for the whole of 2004."
"Prices for almost all products have dropped sharply, sometimes to less than half their previous levels."
"In view of the possibility that exists for the Commission to use the safeguard measures provided for in China’s protocol of accession, I would ask you, Commissioner, to clarify some matters: first, what are the consequences of the fact that the Commission has not yet begun to produce customs data on textile imports; secondly, what are the consequences of the fact that the guidelines that the Commission should have prepared and made available in 2004 are still to be drawn up; and lastly, how sure can European producers be that the Commission is technically and politically able to act before it is too late?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to make two points."
"Firstly, in April, we will have a further debate on the issue of textiles, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on International Trade will also hold a joint hearing on this topic."
"On behalf of my colleagues and the two committees, I look forward to continuing this debate and hope that we will, on those occasions, have more reliable data with which to work."
"Secondly, it is now 2005, which means that at the end of the year, we will have the WTO negotiations in Hong Kong."
"I think this is a good opportunity to send out the signal to China to which many of my fellow-Members have referred, and to exert gentle pressure by diplomatic means."
"I believe that it is essential to do so."
"Finally, it is also important that, in preparing the analysis to which the President-in-Office of the Council referred, there should be real consideration of the various factors involved."
"We must find out more about what is happening, for example, in Tunisia, Turkey or our traditional EU Member States, both in terms of what is going well and what is going wrong."
"We really do need a more carefully researched and clearer picture."
"If, in conjunction with the relevant Commissioners, you could provide us with this before the end of your Presidency, it would be more than helpful."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by the Textile High Level Group contains indications for seven different measures to bolster competitiveness in the sector."
"The group also recommended that a system should be set up to monitor Chinese imports from 1 January 2005."
"Unfortunately, however, the same group was unable to issue guidelines on the mark of origin because of internal differences of opinion."
"Today, in fact, there was an article in a major Italian daily by Commissioner Mandelson about the ‘Made in Italy’ mark, according to which the Union has a duty to inform consumers so that they can distinguish a shirt produced in China from one made in Italy."
"I agree, and I would add that strict labelling rules fulfil that duty."
"Therefore, with regard to the system to monitor Chinese imports, first of all I would like to know what the results of monitoring have been in the almost two months since the restrictions were removed."
"Secondly, regarding labelling of origin, I would ask the Commission and then the Council whether they intend to adopt measures soon that will make it compulsory to label goods with their origin, and I would point out that such a measure is strongly demanded by textile manufacturers in Italy and elsewhere."
"Mr President, the upheaval experienced by the global textile and clothing industry has hit those regions in Europe where textile production is heavily concentrated particularly hard."
"This is the case for my region in France, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, which has already been affected, over recent years, by restructuring and delocalisation and where this sector is the second-largest industrial employer, still providing work for more than 30 000 employees."
"In 2004, Parliament, in a resolution, and the High Level Group on textiles and clothing both called for a specific programme for this sector, in particular in regions in difficulty, which have a large number of SMEs and a high employment rate among women."
"In these regions, European aid has made it possible in recent years to mitigate the socio-economic impact of sectoral crises, to avoid job losses and to cushion the effects of economic restructuring thanks, in particular, to innovation, integration, training and the development of a modern industry."
"At a time when the European Union is drafting its new financial perspectives, these regions are concerned about the future of the structural funds, which have contributed to economic development."
"I am sure that the Commission and the Council will be keen to reassure them and to prove to them that the economic and social cohesion to which these funds contribute is one of the European Union's priorities."
"."
"Mr President, I will be very brief: I just want to mention in passing the proposal to provide the committees concerned with more specific data, but I think it is something that needs to be done with the Commission."
"In a spirit of good interinstitutional cooperation, I will yield my speaking time to the Commission, which is in any case the main party involved, and I would simply like to say that the Council obviously shares all of the concerns that have been expressed regarding the situation in the textile sector both within the EU and in some of our partner countries."
". Mr President, the textile industry is a very important economic factor for all of us in Europe and, therefore, internal and external measures must be taken."
"We are working on a very comprehensive strategy."
"Again, let me just mention a few points because this was a very complex and comprehensive debate."
"The Commission has proposed several actions to enhance the competitiveness of the European textile industry in its second communication on the textile industries."
"The actions proposed include measures such as strengthening the fight against counterfeiting and piracy; enforcing intellectual property rights; establishing an action plan to address existing trade barriers in third countries; fostering advance technology and textiles and clothing with high added value under the EU's Research and Development Programmes; and ensuring lifelong education and vocational training."
"Second, the Commission has established a system for monitoring imports of textiles and clothing products from China."
"However, it is too early to draw conclusions on monitoring."
"The Textile High Level Group was unable to reach a conclusion in its June 2004 report on the 'Made in the European Union' mark of origin."
"The Commission will come back to that and will draw up proposals at a later date."
"We will resort to safeguards only as a last resort."
"This includes the textiles-specific safeguard clause that was established in China's Protocol of Accession to the WTO."
"This is an important and clearly proactive strategy."
"Open international trade is also a key factor in the competitiveness of the economy as a whole."
"Access to third-country markets allows for the creation of jobs in Europe, which is also a key priority of the Commission."
"We are therefore determined to do all it takes to achieve the objective of equal market access so that EU firms in these sectors can exploit their hard-earned know-how and quality."
"The Commission will therefore draw up an action plan to address the barriers in third-country markets, and the Doha Development Round will provide the opportunity to carry out a comprehensive review of all the alleged non-tariff barriers."
"Finally, I shall say a few more words on China."
"Commissioner Mandelson is not here because he is currently visiting China, but I will tell him about today's comprehensive debate and maybe you can go into more detail with him, as the Commissioner responsible for trade, at another time."
"I would like to emphasise again that the Commission is monitoring closely China's compliance with the WTO accession commitments, most notably in the framework of the EU-China Textiles Trade Dialogue signed in May of last year by the Trade Commissioner and his Chinese counterpart."
"Additionally, in the framework of other dialogues between the Commission and the Chinese authorities, the Commission has requested that the issue of the sustainable development of the textile sector, and in particular the question of corporate social responsibility, be put on the agenda."
"The Commission hopes that this will contribute to having the rather strict Chinese labour and environmental laws properly enforced."
"We are also conducting a study, which will be finalised shortly, on working and other manufacturing conditions in the textile and clothing sector in China."
"In line with the Council's Presidency Conclusions from 2003, the European Union is committed to promoting respect for core labour standards through trade relations with third countries."
"The last point I would like to make is about the proposed guidelines on the textile safeguard clause for China."
"This is still under preparation."
"The Commission wants to examine all sides of the issue thoroughly before taking a final decision."
"The Commission is reluctant to do something that would more or less pave the way for the easy introduction of safeguards."
"The Commission does not want the guidelines to be a vehicle to facilitate or prompt safeguard action, but one that prevents recourse to safeguards."
"The Commission would like these guidelines to introduce transparency in the handling of the requests for safeguards that may be made, but it would also like them to introduce greater predictability in trade, for instance by providing some safe zones, generously established and providing for very large expansion possibilities below which we would not consider safeguard action."
"The debate is closed."
"– Product quality and safety, protection for the environment and for social rights, consumer protection, compliance with international trade rules, and technological development: these are all points on which the European Union has taken a stand and is basing most of its political strategies for the coming years."
"Sustainable economic development, market liberalisation and the well-being of EU citizens are thus our objectives, and they must not therefore cause our own products to become less competitive on our own territory, in favour of goods that fall far short of our quality and safety standards."
"We must therefore ensure that, rather than being penalised, our values and our efforts – and along with them thousands of enterprises, especially small ones, which underpin our social fabric – are instead valued and protected both internally and at an international level."
"We call, then, for the highest degree of protection for our mark of origin and promotion of the quality mark, with careful monitoring and severe penalties for any counterfeiting and attempted fraud to the detriment of the consumer. We also demand a firmer stance in bilateral relations, so as to stop or limit the devaluation of the yuan, the ridiculous bank rates and the massive investment in new machinery that are helping the Chinese market to such a great extent."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0009/2005)."
"We shall be taking a series of questions to the Council."
"What stage has been reached in preparations for the forthcoming accession negotiations with Croatia?"
". Madam President, the European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004 noted with satisfaction the progress made by Croatia in preparation for the opening of accession negotiations."
"It invited the Commission to present to the Council a proposal for a framework for negotiations with Croatia, taking full account of the experience of the fifth enlargement."
"It requested the Council to agree on that framework with a view to opening the accession negotiations on 17 March 2005, provided that Croatia cooperates fully with ICTY."
"The Commission transmitted the framework for negotiations on 31 January."
"Technical discussions were opened within the Working Group on Enlargement on 1 February, in order to adopt a common position with a view to opening the accession negotiations on 17 March."
"Let me remind you, in this context, that the conclusions of the European Council of 17 December 2004 very explicitly requested Croatia to demonstrate full cooperation with ICTY."
"In addition, the Council, following consultation with the European Parliament, decided in December 2004 to give Croatia access to the pre-accession financial instruments – PHARE, ISPA and SAPARD – from 2005 in order to help that country to prepare for accession."
"A sum has been allocated for this purpose as part of the current financial perspectives."
"At the same time, the continuity of activities promoting cooperation with the Western Balkans covered by the CARDS programme is ensured."
"Madam President, I wish to inform you that, next week, our EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee will be meeting in Zagreb."
"If the Council takes the view that the opening of negotiations should be conditional upon General Gotovina being arrested, then its opinion conflicts with that of the European Parliament, which has never made this a condition."
"I have the Brussels Presidency Conclusions here, and they – in paragraph 15 – clearly urge Croatia to take steps to cooperate, stating also that, once the indictee is located, he must be transferred to The Hague as soon as possible."
"That is something we all support, but it cannot be a condition for accession negotiations, which we expect to open on 17 March."
". Mr Posselt, you are quite right to emphasise that Mr Gotovina's arrest is not a precondition."
"The issue referred to in the conclusions is real cooperation with the tribunal, and it is therefore on the basis of that cooperation that we will decide whether negotiations can be opened."
"Madam President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply."
"As I recall, this type of situation has arisen on previous occasions during accession negotiations, notably when negotiations opened with Slovakia under Mr Mečiar’s government."
"I take the view that we should not make the opening of accession negotiations contingent on one person; a country like Croatia does not deserve that type of treatment."
"I think the Council should prove that in reality, cooperation is not possible here."
"The Croatian Government has offered its unequivocal support."
"If there is a desire to make the opening of negotiations conditional on the General's extradition, proof is required that he is located in territory to which Croatia has access."
"I think it is shameful that an entire country is being penalised for one person's misconduct."
". I do not have much to add."
"We are indeed in contact with the Croatian Government."
"They are fully aware of the need to cooperate with the Tribunal, and, as I have already said, we have never claimed that the arrest was a precondition, since, if the gentleman to whom you referred is in hiding, which does seem to be the case, it follows that it is impossible to provide any assurances."
"This does not alter the fact that the Croatian Government must make every effort to cooperate as effectively as possible with the Tribunal."
"It is on the basis of this cooperation that the assessments will be made."
"Madam President, the assurances provided by the President-in-Office of the Council are very gratifying and are welcomed by the House."
"I would simply ask you to inform Commissioner Rehn that, while the General's arrest is not a condition, good cooperation is absolutely essential."
"He sent out a rather different signal."
"Perhaps someone could also inform him that if he actually has any evidence of General Gotovina's whereabouts, wherever in the world that may be, he should kindly inform the relevant authorities instead of engaging in public polemics."
". I do not have much to add on this subject either; it is the Council that will make the decision."
"That said, I can only reiterate that cooperation with the Tribunal is a vital element."
"The Israeli nuclear physicist, Mordechai Vanunu, was released by the Israeli authorities in April 2004 after eighteen years in prison, eleven and a half of which were spent in solitary confinement."
"Unfortunately, since the day he was released, Mr Vanunu has been held hostage by his country's government."
"He has been deprived of the right to travel and of freedom of speech."
"Recently, in November, he was re-arrested by the police on totally unfounded charges."
"Does the Council intend to make any recommendation to the government of Israel to restore the democratic rights of this person who has been persecuted to excess?"
". Mordechai Vanunu was conditionally released in April last year."
"Certain restrictions were placed on him, and the appeal that he lodged against these restrictions was rejected by Israel's Supreme Court on the grounds that there was still a risk that he could reveal information affecting the security of the State of Israel."
"The restrictions are time-limited and are subject to review."
"Relations between the EU and Israel are also based on respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"Under Article 2 of the Association Agreement concluded between the European Union and Israel, which entered into force on 1 June 2000, these provisions constitute an essential element of the Agreement, which guides the domestic and international policies of the two parties."
"The European Union, in the context of its political dialogue with the Israeli authorities and of the implementation of the Neighbourhood Action Plan, will continue to ensure that the commitments entered into are respected."
"– Madam President, Minister, thank you for your reply which, unfortunately, does not satisfy me, because it does not answer my question."
"The Council is obviously playing in the theatre of the absurd."
"I asked you if the Council intended to recommend to the Israeli Government that it restore Vanunu's democratic rights and you give me a surreal reply to the effect that Israel is a democratic country and, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy with the European Union, will continue to honour the commitments it has made."
"Once again you have set the wrong example with this provocative attitude of yours."
"Naturally, I did not expect you to reply to me that you would go and free Vanunu personally, but I would at least expect the Council to defend freedom of thought."
"Within this framework, I should like to ask you if you approve of the fact that Vanunu is still in prison ..."
". I think that what I actually said was that the Council would be in contact with the Israeli Government on this matter."
"With regard to general respect for human rights, I should add that Mr Vanunu has been released."
"The only problem is that the conditions under which he has been released are perhaps not quite what we would have hoped, but we are still in contact with the Israeli authorities on that matter and we will be sure to discuss it."
"President-in-Office of the Council, will you remind the Israelis, when you discuss this issue with them, that Mr Mordechai Vanunu was illegally taken from European soil."
"Effectively, he was kidnapped and taken to Israel to face trial."
"The offences for which he was charged took place 20 years ago, and the notion that he still has secrets that could do Israel some harm 20 years later is clearly ludicrous."
"Will you encourage the Israeli Government to stop their persecution of this individual, allow him to leave Israel and, if he so desires, to live in the European Union?"
". Yes, I will."
"The Commissioner for External Relations announced that she intends to propose to the College of Commissioners that a standing rapid response force be set up at European level to intervene in the event of natural disasters and humanitarian crises all over the world."
"This standing force will consist of 5 000 national experts preselected by the Member States who shall be placed under a central coordinating authority after undergoing training."
"According to the Commissioner, this force could become operational from 2007."
"In the conclusions of the extraordinary summit of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 7 January 2005, the Council calls upon the Commission and its own competent bodies to examine the potential for developing an EU rapid response capability and also calls upon the Commission to submit proposals for a strategy for strengthening prevention, early warning and preparation measures for dealing with disasters, which recent events have proved necessary."
"Does the Council not believe that the Commissioner's proposal provides a sound basis for attaining its objectives, as set out in its conclusions?"
"Why do they make no reference to the specific proposal of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner?"
". At its meeting on 31 January 2005, the Council adopted an action plan providing for measures that are currently being drawn up."
"In the action plan, the Council invited the Commission and the Secretary-General and High Representative to present appropriate proposals, within their own fields of competence, on the creation of a European Union rapid response capability enabling us to deal with future disasters."
"The Secretary-General has agreed to present his proposals to the Council as soon as possible and by 31 March 2005 at the latest."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Commissioner for external relations who formulated this specific proposal was here five minutes ago, opposite you."
"My question is: how does the Council view the Commissioner's specific proposal: in a positive or negative light?"
"Does the Council believe that a specific step should be taken or will this too be referred to a committee and be eternally postponed, while we wait for the next major humanitarian disaster because we have no money?"
". With the greatest of respect for Greece, no, there is no question of deferring this instrument to the Greek calends."
"The Council has clearly stated that proposals on this subject must be put forward simultaneously both by the Commission and by the Secretariat General, or by the Secretary-General and High Representative."
"It has therefore never been suggested that the measure is not a useful one."
"I think the tsunami disaster showed us that Europe needed such an instrument."
"We now need to see how it could be set up, and it is true that 31 March 2005 is not far off."
"We will then have proposals for such a system."
"– Madam President, civil protection, which concerns the prevention of and dealing with natural or man-made disasters, is an objective of the European Union."
"With the European Constitution, it is promoted to a separate sector of supplementary or support action."
"Does the Council intend to proceed to shape the policy in question? In other words, to lay as of now the foundations for shaping cohesive and effective action for civil protection?"
". Unfortunately, the Constitution has not yet entered into force, but I think it is nevertheless important to work on this project, which is, I repeat, a very important one."
"It is also provided for in the current Treaties, which refer to civil protection."
"We know, however, that, if we are to have a really effective instrument, making use of the full range of elements, including those that perhaps do not come within the Community's field of competence, a broader approach is needed."
"That is why it is important to involve, firstly, the Commission and, secondly, the Secretary-General and High Representative."
"Once these proposals have been put forward, the Council has undertaken to take decisions and to set up such a system, which is, of course, essential."
"One of the key priorities of the Luxembourgish Presidency of the EU is the Lisbon Strategy."
"Results in implementing the Strategy have so far been disappointing, since both the productivity and the competitiveness indicators in the EU have lagged behind US indicators and those of some Asian countries."
"Does the Council intend to help effect the transition from a general programmatic text to a coherent and integrated development strategy?"
"How does it intend to address the problem of the excessively large number of objectives and priorities, the lack of internal cohesion between the objectives and means to attain them, the lack of effective implementation mechanisms and the need for interconnection between economic development, social cohesion and environmental sustainability?"
"The honourable Member is perfectly right. As the President of the European Council clearly affirmed when presenting the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency, the Lisbon strategy is a top priority of our presidency."
"The Council, in all its specialised configurations, is fully engaged, and will remain so, in the final weeks before the March meeting of the European Council, in the preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy which will enable the European Council to take the requisite decisions at that meeting."
"The summit will focus on the need for intensified efforts to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon strategy and to arrive at tangible and specific results."
"We have here before us a proposal from the Commission which will, I believe, enable us to improve the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, define more clearly the priorities of that strategy and – let me place particular emphasis on this – organise the governance of the Lisbon strategy more effectively."
"In fact, as you emphasised in your question, if there has been a weakness in the Lisbon strategy, it has lain in an undoubted surfeit of objectives and supposed priorities but also in defects in the governance of the process as a whole."
"It is therefore up to the European Council, on the basis of what the Commission has presented to us and in the spirit of the three Lisbon pillars – economic growth and competitiveness, adherence to the social model, and sustainable development and environmental protection – to propose a more effectively structured and clearly discernible strategy, integrating the various processes that are already being pursued."
"I refer here to the Cardiff processes, the processes relating to sustainable development, the guidelines on employment, the broad economic policy guidelines and the like."
"We must therefore try to improve the coherence, visibility and transparency of the whole strategy."
"This is one of the main missions of the Presidency as we endeavour to propose a draft that can be accepted at the March summit."
"– Madam President, I submitted my question before the communication on the part of the President of the European Commission about the text for the new momentum for the Lisbon strategy."
"Of course, I am delighted that the mid-term review of this strategic plan coincides with the Luxembourg Presidency."
"My supplementary question concerns more efficient twinning of European and national objectives and policies: does the Council believe that the new Commission proposals rectify the current weaknesses in the application of the strategy?"
"To my mind, the approach adopted by the Commission, which emphasises the need for the establishment of European objectives, followed by the formulation of national plans, creates more links between the main aims agreed jointly at European level and their implementation at national level."
"This is, after all, the point on which the Lisbon strategy has proved very weak and largely impracticable."
"On the basis of this idea of national plans, I feel we could achieve better governance."
"With regard to these national plans, it should be emphasised that the present proposal includes full stakeholder involvement in the Lisbon process."
"I believe that in this way it creates more favourable conditions for the success of the strategy."
"– I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply."
"However, as you know, the communication from the Commission and from Mr Barroso about the objectives for the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy caused tremendous reaction and concern, because he told us that he has three sons and he will only look after the sick one, which is competitiveness."
"The other two, the environment and cohesion, will be pushed to one side."
"Is the Council in a position to assure us that policies for cohesion and the environment will not be demoted and that the resources will be secured to service these policies?"
"I think it is very clearly specified – and this, I repeat, has been said by the President of the European Council – that the Lisbon strategy is a coherent whole, comprising a pillar that might be described as competitiveness or the economic pillar, a social pillar and an environmental pillar."
"The great challenge is to demonstrate that these three pillars are not mutually exclusive but form a truly unified entity."
"The Presidency will endeavour to ensure that full account is taken of the coherence of these pillars when the new strategy is being defined."
"Greek farmers are protesting at the fact that 'ceilings' are being imposed on cotton by area of land and weight, even though this is a product in which demand outstrips production in the EU."
"It is worth asking why European taxpayers' money no longer goes to the most hard-working group of Europeans, namely farmers, but instead to markets outside the borders of the 25 Member States."
"The device of 'ceilings' will wipe out farmers in the regions, in precisely the same way as the policy of large multinational conglomerates is removing SMEs from European ownership."
"Why are these 'ceilings' not abolished, so that the EU can become self-sufficient in agricultural products in which demand outstrips production, enabling European farmers to enjoy a larger income?"
"Is the Council examining the possibility of abolishing these 'ceilings' for cotton and other products in which there is a shortfall in the EU"
"Madam President, with a view to supplementing the reforms of the common agricultural policy which were adopted in June 2003, the Council adopted a regulation on 29 April 2004 which partially decouples support for cotton, olive oil, tobacco and hops, and integrates them into the single-payment system."
"This reform is due to enter into force on 1 January 2006."
"With regard to cotton production, it was agreed that, to avoid any disruption of production in the cotton-growing regions of the Community, part of the support would remain linked to cotton-growing and would comprise a payment per eligible hectare."
"The amount of this payment should guarantee that economic conditions in the regions where cotton can be grown are favourable enough to ensure that production continues and that cotton is not supplanted by other crops."
"To this end, the total aid available per hectare for each of the relevant Member States was fixed at 35% of the national share from which growers benefited indirectly through the ginners in the reference period from 2000 to 2002."
"The establishment of a basic acreage for each Member State, designed to limit the total area sown with cotton plants, is in line with budgetary constraints and takes account of the specific features of the crop."
"The establishment of ceilings for cotton production should also be seen in the context of the Doha round of WTO trade negotiations, during which the developing countries, and particularly the West African cotton-producing countries – which have featured prominently in this afternoon’s deliberations – expressed concerns about the cotton sector."
"Through this reform, the Community wishes to send an important signal to the WTO and particularly to the developing countries."
". – Mr President, leading on partly from the previous debate on the influx of products from China and countries that you term ‘developing’, I should just like to ask whether the Council has calculated how much the ceiling imposed on the cotton-producing regions of Europe might cost, and whether in future the Council intends to increase the amount of aid if the planned amount proves insufficient, in order to prevent cotton farmers too from succumbing to the influx of products from other parts of the world."
"I do not have the requested figures to hand, but I am sure that the Commission can help us by providing them."
"I can, however, add that a resource transfer of EUR 22 million to the second pillar of the CAP, the rural development pillar, for the cotton sector will accompany this reform, which, but cutting production, will probably trigger restructuring processes at regional level."
"Aware of the need to give Community producers a stable policy in the medium term, the Council – which, incidentally, has not yet received any proposal from the Commission to this end – considers that there is no reason to alter the main reform package, which is an indivisible whole."
"I therefore undertake to seek to obtain the figures you requested, but in that respect too I shall simply repeat that, following the parliamentary debate, some thought must be given to the matter of consistency."
"– Mr President, I should like to ask the Council whether, when they talk of encouraging imports from less developed countries, they also take into consideration factors such as worker protection in those countries, in terms of both social security and, above all, working hours and conditions, and whether they also take environmental protection into account, so as to avoid adverse effects on the environment as well as adverse effects on our economy caused by producers who do not comply with the strict standards to which we have to adhere."
"Mr Speroni, you know that, besides the issue of social rights, Europe has been trying to introduce an environmental dimension into the debate in the WTO – without much success, I have to admit, because of the opposition of a number of developing countries."
"Be that as it may, in the ILO and in our dealings with the WTO, this debate must be, and is being, further pursued."
"So I cannot say that these elements are an integral part of the question."
"Nevertheless, we shall continue to devote special attention to them."
"Every day UNICEF and NGOs receive large numbers of accusations about cases of abuse, exploitation and disappearances of children in the areas of Southeast Asia devastated by the tsunami."
"The accusations concern the uncontrolled activities of gangs involved in prostitution, illegal adoptions and the trade in human organs."
"What initiatives does the Council intend to take, as part of humanitarian aid and in cooperation with the UN, NGOs and the authorities of these countries, so as to provide effective aid, care and protection for children in the devastated areas and camps for the homeless?"
"Madam President, it should be remembered that, at its meeting of 7 January 2005, the Council declared that aid should go to the hardest-hit regions and the most impoverished people, especially children."
"Being especially vulnerable, children need specific support, particularly through the appropriate UN agencies, such as UNICEF."
"Since then, the Council’s competent preparatory bodies have drawn up an action plan to assist the tsunami victims in response to the conclusions of the European Council."
"This action plan was examined by the Council on Monday, 31 January 2005."
"Among the proposed initiatives are measures that directly concern children, particularly in the fields of health and education, the aim being to get them back into the classroom as soon as possible."
"The Council is also studying proposals focusing on the fate of the children who were orphaned or separated from their families by the disaster, with special emphasis on the problem of trafficking to which they might fall victim."
"For fuller information on the aid measures launched by the Union and its Member States, I refer the honourable Member to the Commission and to the Member States, as many programmes are also national programmes."
"It goes without saying that the Council shares the general sense of outrage at the revelations of abuse, exploitation and disappearance of children in the parts of South-East Asia that were devastated by the tsunami disaster."
"The Council condemns such acts and will support all efforts designed to combat the intolerable exploitation of the most powerless and vulnerable."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply."
"Nonetheless, I should like to ask you to place greater emphasis on the question of combating the maltreatment and sexual exploitation of children in these areas and I should like to have your assurance, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the action plan which the Council is processing at the moment and the overall humanitarian aid given to these countries will include a real commitment by the authorities in these countries, requiring them to take even more effective measures to combat such phenomena which, as you yourself said, are scandalous and are issues which we need to deal with effectively and in cooperation with these countries."
"I should also like to know if more specific measures are also being processed in this direction in the action plan."
". I believe that this is a fairly general action plan."
"It is now a matter of identifying specific measures, as the honourable Member has just said."
"The message, then, seems to have been heard, and I think we shall try to work on a number of suggestions, targeting especially the problems to which the honourable Member refers."
"President-in-Office of the Council, it is a sad fact that many of those who will try to take advantage of the tragic situation in the tsunami countries will be European citizens."
"Will the Council look at creating a Europe-wide register of child sex offenders outside the territory of the European Union, so as to ensure that every Member State is aware of the activities of these individuals and to ensure that we have a common EU approach to dealing with them when they return to European soil?"
"I have no doubt that it would be useful to identify the framework within which the mechanisms for combating these phenomena in Europe could be strengthened, perhaps even on a European scale, and to find ways of improving cooperation with the relevant countries with a view to prosecuting the perpetrators of such acts."
"Does the Council have any plans to address the anomaly of European tax havens?"
"I can tell the honourable Member that there has never been a debate devoted specifically to the subject of European tax havens, although it has featured in debates on a number of subjects in which the question of fiscal harmonisation has been addressed."
"The Council and Representatives of the Governments of the Member States did, however, adopt, on 1 December 1997, a resolution on a code of conduct for business taxation."
"This resolution focuses on fiscal measures which have, or may have, a significant impact on the location of economic activities within the Community, with potentially harmful measures being examined by the Code of Conduct Group on Business Taxation."
"In fact, the measures deemed to be harmful have been gradually eliminated."
"The work of the Code of Conduct Group is ongoing."
"Its last progress report was presented to the ECOFIN Council, which took note of it at its meeting of 7 December 2004."
"The group was to continue monitoring the standstill and rollback and report to the Council during this Presidency."
"Mr President-in-Office, I am referring to places such as the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and others – places that are hardly independent countries or, if they claim to be so, they still rely entirely on the goodwill of the European Union for their continued existence."
"In spite of that these places are not subject to all European Union standards."
"They are exempt from legislation, even money laundering legislation, and they are duty-free tax havens."
"Is it not time that we addressed this situation?"
"Surely a genuine free market has no loopholes."
"I completely agree with the honourable Member’s supplementary remarks."
"I would like to remind him that we reached agreement on a Directive on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments."
"This directive also includes, in what one might call parallel provisions and through a number of agreements, the territories and countries he has mentioned."
"This is certainly a move in the direction he desires."
"These autonomous countries and territories are covered by the Directive on taxation of savings income or are at least required to apply its provisions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question to you has to do with tax competition, which, in my view, is now a given in Europe, and an integral element of the internal market."
"One of the major problems we face is that small and medium-sized enterprises often lose sight of which tax regulations apply to them."
"As regards value added tax, for example, we have more than 100 different regulations."
"Will any initiatives now be launched in order to make taxation more transparent for the layman?"
"With regard to the indirect taxation to which you refer, this is an area in which the Union is empowered to legislate, and so it will indeed be necessary to try and make these directives somewhat easier to digest and apply."
"It must be remembered that national governments are responsible for national fiscal legislation."
"Seeking a minimum degree of harmonisation, for example on the assessment basis, would mean breaking new ground."
"This is a debate that has been initiated."
"I hope, for the sake of what is referred to as ‘better regulation’, that the indirect taxation to which you refer will not be quietly ignored."
"Mr President-in-Office, I am grateful to Robert Evans for tabling this question."
"I am interested in whether you believe that the existence of tax havens makes it more difficult to track down and freeze the funds of organisations that are considered terrorist organisations; and also whether their existence makes it more difficult, for example, for the world's poorer countries, to access money that may well have been siphoned off by some of the less reputable regimes for the benefit of those in power."
"This relates to quite a different matter, namely the use of various financial channels to fund such things as terrorist activities."
"You will be aware that the OECD has a body called the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, the FATF, whose activities include the investigation of such issues."
"I also believe that there are lists which show whether countries, and territories too, adhere to the rules, particularly as regards money laundering."
"In short, this is a very important issue, and the European Union is very actively engaged in efforts to ensure that the fight against money laundering is waged effectively in all Member States as well as in neighbouring countries and autonomous territories."
"Will the Council ensure that the justified action that it is taking to assist victims of the Tsunami is not undertaken at the expense of aid to Africa?"
"Madam President, the Council is firmly resolved to ensure that the measures adopted to help the tsunami victims are not taken at the expense of aid assigned to Africa, as it clearly stated in the conclusions adopted on 7 January."
"Paragraph 15 of those conclusions states that, ‘in this context, solidarity in facing this disaster must not lead us to forget the general issue of development, humanitarian aid and the Millennium Goals, especially in Africa, nor to reduce the resources needed for that purpose."
"In this connection, it is important to ensure that resources released in the context of recent events are indeed additional to development commitments already made."
"The Council will come back to the implementation of commitments regularly’."
"At its meeting on 31 January, the Council went on to adopt a new series of measures in the form of an action plan designed to serve as a framework for all the initiatives that have been and will be taken by the Union and its Member States in response to the earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean."
"This operational action plan, which will be monitored by the competent Council bodies, also re-emphasises, in its introduction, the importance of ensuring that the resources committed in the wake of the recent earthquake do not prejudice any funds previously committed to development, particularly in Africa, in pursuit of the Millennium Goals."
"It also contains a raft of specific practical measures designed to guarantee that this political commitment will be honoured; to this end, the fulfilment of financial pledges made in response to the disaster will be monitored."
"These funds were pledged in addition to the financial resources allocated under the development policy of the European Union, of which Africa is the main beneficiary."
"Thank you, President-in-Office, for that very encouraging reply."
"I am sure you will agree with me that it would be tragic if Africa – which faces a tsunami week in, week out in a less visible way through the ravages of famine, its climate and diseases such as Aids - were to lose money as a result of our justified generosity towards the victims of the tsunami."
"I would like to ask, before your time is up as President-in-Office, if you would ask the Commission to report and show that Africa is still receiving as much money this year as it would have received if the tsunami had never happened?"
"I believe that the various conclusions adopted by the Council all refer to monitoring and evaluation."
"The Commission is required to render accounts, but the funds earmarked for Africa in the various frameworks, particularly that of the Cotonou Agreement, are reserved funds."
"This means that it is not possible to draw on these resources to finance other activities, such as those relating to the tsunami disaster."
"I believe there are enough guarantees to preclude any transfer of funds."
"Having said that, I recognise the need to ensure that future funding cannot be reduced because of the special effort – entirely commendable though it is – made by the European Union and the Member States to help the countries stricken by the disaster;"
"I also recognise the need to ensure that none of this has any adverse effect on Africa, which, as you so rightly said, faces a tsunami of its own on an almost daily basis."
"A framework decision concerning the storage of traffic data is currently being drafted within the EU."
"The issue has been raised previously and, each time, the Article 29 Group (the EU's data protection authority whose task is to ensure compliance with the rules on the protection of personal data) has delivered strongly critical opinions."
"The current draft proposes that the EU should introduce a common rule stipulating that data from 'publicly available communications services' should be stored for 12-36 months 'for the purpose ofprevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of crime and criminal offences including terrorism'."
"The proposal is not confined to telephony; it also covers data traffic, i.e. information concerning websites visited and addresses to which e-mail has been sent."
"Furthermore, the proposal is not simply concerned with the investigation of crime but also with prevention; everyone is to be treated as a suspect."
"Naturally, the Article 29 Group has also sharply criticised this proposal."
"Their opinion states that the proposal is not only contrary to the rule that information may not be used for a purpose other than for which it is retained, it is also as a whole contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states that 'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.'"
"Will the Council take measures in response to the Article 29 Group's criticism?"
"Madam President, in its declaration on combating terrorism of 25 March 2004, the European Council instructed the Council of the EU to examine proposals for establishing rules on the retention by service providers of data on communications traffic."
"The declaration calls for the adoption of an instrument on the retention of data on communications traffic by June 2005."
"In April 2004, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Ireland and France presented a proposal for a framework decision on the subject."
"The Council asked the European Parliament for an opinion on the proposal, which it has begun to examine."
"On 2 December 2004, the Council held a debate on the matter."
"A number of points were raised, but they will have to be examined in greater detail before the instrument can be properly finalised."
"The Council particularly emphasised the need to pay special attention to the proportionality of the proposed measure in terms of its cost, whether it adequately safeguards privacy, especially as regards personal data protection, and its effectiveness."
"These deliberations are continuing within the Council’s preparatory bodies, and there is no doubt that the criticisms made by the Article 29 Group will be taken into account and will be one of the items on the negotiating agenda."
"More recently, the Commission has expressed the view that some aspects of the draft framework decision relating to the harmonisation of data categories and data retention periods fall within the competence of the Community, which should be reflected in a directive based on Article 95 of the EC Treaty."
"The Council awaits the presentation of a proposal from the Commission for its consideration."
"– First of all, I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"My question was aimed rather more at the fact of there being a fundamental conflict between, on the one hand, the international conventions we signed in the Council of Europe, which are intended to protect citizens’ private lives and also the right to private correspondence and, on the other hand, the directive that you are discussing, which proposes storing all correspondence sent using certain technologies."
"Even though certain limits are imposed in this directive, the fundamental conflict remains."
"One can hardly state that correspondence is to be private, at the same time as stating that it is to be stored in every possible way."
"What is your view of this contradiction?"
"I do not know whether there is a glaring contradiction."
"It is true that there is a grey area and that care must be taken to ensure that security considerations and the need to combat phenomena such as terrorism do not prejudice the protection of privacy."
"I believe that this concern, which has been expressed by some of the Member States and indeed by the Commission too, must be taken into account."
"In my view, data protection should be a primary means of effectively guaranteeing the protection of personal privacy."
"– The fact is that what we have here is not, of course, an isolated case."
"There is, in fact, a wide range of areas in which the limits set by the European Convention on Human Rights, which makes a number of demands in terms of data protection, are being substantially exceeded. As the questioner puts it, it is of course the ultimate crime, moreover, to use this information contrary to the interests of suspects."
"The mere fact of storing the information, however, constitutes an infringement of the requirements under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"We may therefore expect the Council to adopt a basic position on these problems without wrapping them up in waffle about matters being taken into consideration."
"This is a most fundamental issue."
"When all is said and done, I can only repeat that this issue is being discussed from the very angle indicated by the honourable Member and that no final decision has been taken."
"I believe there is a very real concern to safeguard privacy and to comply with Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, and full account will undoubtedly be taken of this concern when the provision is re-examined."
"Questions 10 to 40 will be answered in writing.(1)"
"– The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0027/2005) by Mrs Bresso, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC and European Parliament and Council Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC and European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 0000/2004 (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for their highly constructive approach at second reading."
"Thanks to them, and to the Dutch and Luxembourg Presidencies, we today have a package of amendments to the common position which is acceptable to both colegislators and to the Commission."
"I trust that this House will support the proposals contained in Mrs Bresso's recommendation, which were supported unanimously in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"All the proposed amendments to the committee recommendation are acceptable."
"The amendments are in keeping with the objectives of the directive to safeguard constant consumer protection throughout the European Union, something which, on the one hand, will increase consumer confidence and, on the other hand, will simplify things for legal undertakings."
"Similarly, their application in practice is feasible."
"This directive provides consumer protection and, at the same time, it is good both for the internal market and for our competitiveness in general."
"It will replace the current compilation of national regulations with a cohesive Community framework."
"For traders, this means a cohesive set of regulations wherever they trade in the European Union."
"For consumers, it means new means of protection in certain sectors, such as aggressive practices, and the certainty that cohesive rules apply throughout the European Union."
"We trust that you will support this package, so that we have the possibility of putting this new law into application."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on unfair commercial practices was approved by Parliament at first reading on 20 April 2004."
"The directive provides for a general ban on unfair commercial practices and an indicative, non-exhaustive list of general and specific examples of unfair commercial practices."
"The key aim of this directive is to achieve a high degree of consumer protection, as the Commissioner pointed out, coupled with the smooth functioning of the internal market, in such a way as to favour commercial transactions and, therefore, economic growth."
"The original text of the directive was based on harmonisation of consumer protection at a sufficiently high level on the one hand and application of the country-of-origin principle and mutual recognition on the other."
"At first reading, Parliament introduced amendments aimed at improving the balance of the proposal, by adding further consumer protection elements."
"In this connection, Parliament proposed extending the legal basis, partly by inserting Article 153 of the Treaty, whereby Member States had the option to retain more stringent national provisions for five years after the directive’s entry into force."
"Parliament also added an obligation for the Commission to report to Parliament on the application of the directive every five years and to propose any necessary updating of the annex."
"The most important amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading covered a wide range of issues, particularly the insertion of a definition of vulnerable consumers and codes of conduct, consumer participation in the drawing-up of the codes of conduct, as well as other amendments."
"The common position which the Council sent to us was, of course, examined by the committee, and we decided in the first place to base ourselves solely on Parliament's amendments at first reading, above all so as to avoid reopening the debate on points already settled in the earlier discussions, which would have prolonged the time required."
"On the country-of-origin principle in particular, which was omitted from the proposal, we believe it is no longer necessary to call for it to be included, in view of the level of harmonisation of consumer protection now achieved."
"It is important to note that the common position has incorporated many of Parliament's amendments, notably the definition of vulnerable consumers, the participation of consumers' associations in drawing up codes of conduct, and the inclusion of a definition of undue influence among aggressive practices."
"The Council has also accepted Parliament's proposal for a derogation, extended from five to six years, for the application of legislation."
"We believe that the common position represents a satisfactory compromise, while also being aware that certain of the amendments from first reading aimed at significantly boosting consumer protection need to be reintroduced."
"Our intention was particularly to re-propose consumer protection provisions in the following areas: restricted after-sales guarantees; the right to exchange; products similar to those of another manufacturer designed to mislead the consumer; plus advertising directed at children."
"As regards the last point, the aim is not to outlaw advertising but to tighten the ban on commercial practices which could put children under undue pressure."
"After a considerable number of amendments to the draft report had been tabled, we arrived at a compromise document which incorporated the most significant of them, upholding Parliament’s rights but also taking the Council’s common position into account."
"In particular, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection unanimously accepted amendments on the following points: taking social, cultural and linguistic factors into account in defining the average consumer for legal purposes; a ban on a trader claiming that a product has been approved by a public or private body when it has not; a ban on promoting sales by pretending to be just a consumer or a private vendor; and, lastly, it is considered unfair practice to create the false impression that the consumer has won something when the prize does not exist or is subject to the consumer paying money."
"In conclusion, I consider that, subject to the slight changes proposed, this directive is worth adopting, since it will mark a step forward for both consumers and traders in the EU, in terms of a secure legal framework and the protection of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union."
"I should like to give a final warning on a technical point, for which I apologise: since a number of issues have arisen during revision of the translation, the text to be considered authentic is the one approved by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO)."
"I should also like to thank the first rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, the Commission, the Council and my colleagues on the IMCO Committee for their fruitful collaboration, which, as has been mentioned already, led to the text being adopted unanimously."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am pleased to inform you that overall, we are satisfied with the report adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I can assure you, Mrs Bresso, that we will once again be giving the package of amendments, all nineteen of them, our full backing."
"We have all been working on unfair commercial practices for a while and as progress was made, starting with the Green Paper up to second reading now, we have become increasingly aware of the need to allow the internal market to be not only an area in which the free movement of goods and services simply occurs, but also to turn it into an area in which this free movement occurs in the knowledge that all is done in accordance with fair practices."
"It is, of course, not the case that so far, or as long as this directive is not in force, everything would have been done unfairly."
"The Member States assumed their responsibilities at a time that was appropriate to them in the past, but we have noticed that, for as long as those Member States organise that protection differently in each country, we will have a problem within the internal market, namely that this market lacks the confidence of the unassured consumers who dare not look across the border, or the confidence of the enterprises, mainly the smallest enterprises, that hardly dare take a step across the border because they too are unfamiliar with the rules on the other side of it."
"I think that the work we have done collectively is sound."
"It is a very balanced document because it offers a high level of consumer protection, as the treaty expects from us, but it also provides maximum legal certainty for the trader, which means that we can strike a perfect balance."
"We are also for the first time taking a careful step towards full harmonisation."
"I think we can do this because the level of consumer protection is so high."
"This is all thanks to perfect cooperation with Members from other groups, the Council and Commission."
"I should like to thank all those involved, because it is thanks to this openness, transparency, constructive attitude that we have achieved so much and that we are able to complete the dossier at second reading."
"Mrs Bresso, I would, of course, like to thank you, in particular, for your commitment."
"Although this proposal only deals with ‘B to C’, that is, ‘business to consumer’ relations, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is nevertheless pleased with the fact that this legislative document explicitly mentions that when an entrepreneur establishes that a competitor contravenes this directive, that that can be used by that entrepreneur to turn it into a case of unfair commercial practices, a case of distortion of competition, albeit in accordance with the national law of the country in question."
"We are also satisfied that we have, at long last, managed to establish among ourselves who the reference consumer is, that we take the average consumer as a point of reference but that we do this without losing sight of the weak consumer."
"I think that in that area too, we have struck a particularly good balance."
"All that remains for us to do is to hope that the Council will set to work promptly to give the initiative its official stamp of approval and that the Member States will not hesitate to ensure that everything is transposed into national legislation within the prescribed timeframe."
". Mr President, I too, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, would like to extend particularly warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, for the really very good work that she has done, as also for the persistence with which she has approached it."
"The fact is that she, along with everyone else concerned, has helped to make it possible for us, today – or, rather, at tomorrow’s vote – to draw a line under the legislation in this area."
"I believe that these 19 amendments, all of which my group will be voting to support, have enabled us to achieve a good compromise, one to which we can consent with a clear conscience and with confidence."
"This is, I have to say, a compromise, and we Social Democrats would have been quite happy to go further in some respects, although we did of course have to make sacrifices to the majorities in this House, and that is what we did, particularly where more vulnerable consumers – by which we meant children in particular – were concerned; had things gone our way, we would have afforded them even more protection."
"We would have preferred it if there had been no possibility whatever of direct marketing to or for children being permitted, thus outlawing unfair business practices in this area from the word go."
"Unfortunately, though, that has not been possible; that is something we have to live with."
"Perhaps we will be able to achieve this through further amending legislation at a later date."
"We Social Democrats can, however, be very satisfied with the way in which we – with evidently large majorities in both the Council and this House – have managed to dispatch the planned provisions relating to the country of origin principle."
"This is an area in which real harmonisation is happening – rightly, I think, for we have to ensure that the legislation rests on firm foundations."
"That we have done in this area, and the decision we will take tomorrow will surely be the right one, pointing the way into the future."
"Once again, then, many thanks to Mrs Bresso for a job well done;"
"I think we have now done something very fine for the protection of consumers and the public, something that enables us to face the world out there with our heads held high."
". Mr President, tomorrow our Group will be voting in favour of all the amendments."
"I must thank the rapporteur for her hard work in bringing this consensus together, especially taking over the report as she did."
"It has been a wonderful example of all the institutions working together at the second reading to get a good result."
"It seems to me that this is an important and innovative proposal, giving us a very high level of consumer protection, and harmonisation of that protection, across the EU, in a comprehensible and coherent way."
"That is to be welcomed."
"It is also innovative in that, as a framework directive, it is combined with the use of codes of conduct."
"That is a good step forward."
"I hope, and it seems from what has been said here already tonight, that we will all be able to give this proposal a fair wind."
"On behalf of our Group, I want to make two further, more specific, points."
"As others have said, there are still concerns about the definition of vulnerable consumers."
"I know, for instance, that in some of the Nordic Member States and, indeed, in the EEA states for whom this legislation will have relevance, there are higher levels of protection already in existence."
"There are worries about how this will be affected in the future."
"I believe that the Commission, during the transition period, should give some consideration to these concerns."
"I want to turn to one of the particular unfair commercial practices that is dealt with in the Annex and is the subject of an amendment that we will vote on tomorrow."
"It is a particular practice in my own country that has reached epidemic proportions."
"I refer to the telephone scams, where people are phoned – again and again, evening after evening – told that they have won a prize and invited to phone another number, which, if they do, they will run up an horrendous and huge telephone bill."
"We will, at last, have the ammunition to deal with that when this legislation comes into force across the European Union."
"I believe there are many other good things in this proposal that commends itself to us all in the House, and I hope it and our rapporteur get the support they deserve tomorrow."
"Mr President, I wish to add my support for agreement at second reading on this very important directive."
"I also want to thank Mrs Bresso for leading that negotiating process, together with all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular my colleague, Mrs Thyssen, who led for our side on this."
"This proposal, as many Members have already said, will be very good for consumers."
"It will also be very good for thousands of businesses that want to trade fairly and provide high standards, because those companies are in many cases outraged when they see fraudsters perpetrating scams on unsuspecting consumers."
"They want them dealt with as much as anybody else."
"Unfortunately, ingenious tricksters keep finding ways to take money off unsuspecting consumers."
"It is interesting that since we started work on this we have already added a number of new provisions to this annex."
"One of the things we must have – and this is addressed to the Commission – is a mechanism to keep absolutely on top of this."
"We must also ensure that we keep adding to the blacklist when we find that people are finding ways around the rules."
"We want consumers to have confidence that they can exercise their rights in the internal market."
"That leads me to the second point: as we are clearly going to approve this overwhelmingly tomorrow, it is now important to tell the Commissioner that we want to see this transposed as quickly and effectively as possible."
"Under its 'better regulation' proposals, the Commission has new mechanisms to coordinate and push through transposition as quickly as possible."
"We expect the Commission to do that and also to put pressure on those Member States that, perhaps, are not quite as vigilant as they should be or are not supporting the consumer protection bodies with the resources required."
"A part of our overall work in this committee is to support consumers."
"It is an important flanking measure to other things we are working on."
"I must also say, in conclusion, that it is an essential foundation for what I know will be a very successful directive on the internal market for services, which I am confident this House will adopt very soon."
"Mr President, I am happy to follow Mr Harbour in that same spirit which characterised the committee."
"The tone was set from the outset by the rapporteur, and her energies and skills as a new Member of this Parliament were quite exceptional, particularly since in the last few weeks she has been crossing the Alps more often than Hannibal, with other activities in her own country also."
"I want to pay tribute to all those who brought this about under the Treaty provisions for consumer protection, which had not been used very frequently up to now."
"Everyone has to agree to a conclusion like this and any one person can wreck it."
"All of those who have spoken in the debate today have been contributors, both by withholding the negative power to destroy and joining the other institutions; the Luxembourg presidency and the Commission, and indeed the staff of our own committee, the Internal Market Committee, a new committee, to whom I would pay particular tribute, so that we brought about the right result here."
"It extends the internal market; we should not forget that, because it produces more assured consumers."
"And it produces them because they are protected; because the special character of vulnerable consumers is acknowledged in this legislation; because there is a clear guarantee that high existing standards of consumer protection will not be imperilled and that over the next five years we move to higher standards for those that do not yet have them, and not lower standards for those who do; because the blacklist in the annexes here is clear, comprehensive and unambiguous."
"The consumer knows where she or he stands."
"So does the honest and legitimate businessman; and so does the cold-caller with the lottery scam; the rip-off timeshare artist; the peddler of mock sales."
"If you sail under false colours this directive will sink you."
"I can think of nothing better guaranteed to enhance the image of this institution as a people's parliament for the public good than legislation like this."
"It opens the way for further developments, including, in time, more sophisticated use of self-regulation by a stable industry, and for the position of children, the one social category who are, by definition, vulnerable."
"To those of our colleagues who felt that, in these fields, we did not go far enough, I would say that we have a foundation of security which harmonisation at the highest level can now proceed."
"We have helped our citizens, Mr President."
"We have provided an object lesson for our colleagues."
"It is not a bad start for this new committee and for this new Parliament and Commission."
"I thank you all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to express my thanks to the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"It is not always easy to be a consumer in present-day society."
"The volume of advertising has increased enormously and it has become very diverse."
"In the course of their daily lives, consumers constantly have to make decisions on the basis of the very conflicting information they receive."
"Sometimes advertising can be misleading for the consumer, and marketing can be aggressive and unfair."
"Legislation to regulate this varies from one country to another."
"For that reason, we need common legal instruments that will guarantee high levels of consumer protection everywhere in the countries of the EU."
"I think it is wrong to suppose that consumers have the opportunity or time to examine advertising material very carefully."
"The average consumer will only skim through it."
"We ought to pay special attention to advertising which is aimed particularly at children, who are more vulnerable to the effects of marketing."
"Harmonisation must not lower standards of consumer protection, which in some EU countries are very high."
"Consumer policy should be based on guaranteeing high levels of consumer protection."
"For that reason, I hope that we will get and apparently we will the transition period that has been proposed for this directive."
"This is a good thing. The Member States need to be given time to reform their national laws in order to maintain high standards of consumer protection."
"Mr President, the country-of-origin principle is not being applied, and should not be applied, in this directive."
"If the authorities in the country of origin were deprived of the opportunity to take issue, if necessary, with unfair advertising, the most crucial objectives contained in this proposal for a directive could not be achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in the congratulations addressed to Mrs Bresso."
"To be sure, it is no easy matter to take over such a brief in mid-stream, and, while carrying on with what Mrs Ghilardotti had begun, you have added your own emphases, and I have to say I admire the way you have been able to hold your own in the trialogue, a place where predatory beasts dwell."
"We did not always agree about everything, but I would like to stress at the very outset that I am very glad that you have succeeded in keeping this directive flexible in its application."
"The eastward enlargement has of course given us a much more heterogeneous range of consumers, as well as far more diverse ways of doing business, and I am glad that that has been taken into account by allowance being made for local circumstances in the interpretation of the directive in individual cases."
"This, though, also means that it is important that Article 4 should provide that the Member States may not restrict the free movement of services and goods on the grounds of unfair trade practices."
"As I understand it, this also means that a decision taken in one Member State on the legitimacy of a business practice cannot be questioned in another."
"I think this comment is an important point of reference for the courts who will have to interpret this in future."
"I am glad to see, Commissioner Kyprianou, that you have given pride of place in your work programme to the transposition of European rules and regulations."
"This directive is one where putting good thinking and ideas into practice will be difficult."
"The internal market is meant to be one for fair competition between upright and honourable business people, and by means of this directive we are ensuring that this it what it becomes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, bolstering consumer confidence is one of the keys to the development of the internal market."
"The creation of a European legislative framework, based on an adequate level of harmonisation, to give consumers legal protection against unfair business practices will increase their confidence, whether they do their shopping locally or on a website hosted in another Member State."
"I am keenly aware of the need to take account of vulnerable consumers, who, by reason of various factors such as age, physical or mental incapacity, limited literacy or disability, require extra protection."
"I regret, however, that we have been unable to reach agreement on better protection of minors."
"I am particularly pleased that the country-of-origin principle has not been reintroduced in the compromise, and for this I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, who has done an excellent job."
"The Socialist Group has always vigorously contested this principle and will continue to do so in the context of the Services Directive, because the application of this principle only generates social insecurity and legal uncertainty for the public."
"The adoption of this directive and Mrs Bresso’s report tomorrow is therefore of the utmost importance in the effort to protect consumers."
"It is an opportunity to give the internal market a human face."
"In this respect it would be a splendid triumph."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too shall begin by congratulating both the rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, and the shadow rapporteur for our group, Mrs Thyssen, on the excellent work they have done and the sensitivity, astuteness and sense of balance with which they have done it."
"It is their work that has enabled Parliament to put forward its positions on this subject, which is so important to consumers, and at the same time has saved us the delays and uncertainties of a conciliation procedure."
"This represents an important moment in the internal market and the first landmark in this area during this parliamentary term."
"Parliament has here a very important contribution in terms of key points, and all those who often underestimate our legislative work will be proved wrong."
"During the previous term, it was because of Parliament that the common position after first reading included the following points: the notions of vulnerable consumer and binding commitment; greater procedural rigour in drawing up codes of conduct, including the participation of consumer associations; a more precise and comprehensive listing of aggressive and, as such, banned practices; the derogation clause, now extended to six years, to permit the interim application of more stringent national legislation; and the obligation on the Commission to report regularly to Parliament on the implementation of the directive and to propose updates when necessary."
"Returning to the astuteness of the rapporteur and those who conducted and closely followed the interinstitutional proceedings, the second reading will also enable us to go a little further with consumer guarantees and protection, particularly in the area of child protection, outlawing the unfair exploitation of children through a number of duly considered and polished amendments, for which the final agreement of the Council is already assured."
"Good news, then, and complete success."
"I also made a modest contribution to some of these amendments, especially Amendment 17, and I should like to thank my fellow Members for all their understanding in accepting it and following it through, because I am aware that I tabled it only just within the time limit allowed by the Rules of Procedure for second reading."
"However, it is one more consumer guarantee that has been put in writing – in this particular case, in the area of insurance – and that is clearly a positive outcome."
"Just a final point, Mr President, to say that I share the rapporteur’s view that it is unnecessary and might even be inappropriate to insist here on the so-called country-of-origin principle or, in this case, the internal market clause."
"I am also one of those who believe that we should be moving towards the harmonisation of legislation in these areas, and that is what has been achieved here, which is a good sign for the future."
"We have chosen the right path."
"– Mr President, I too wish to thank my colleague, Mrs Bresso for her hard work."
"My Swedish colleagues and I have a number of misgivings, however."
"At first reading of the proposal, Denmark and Sweden registered their reservations, as we are concerned about the directive adversely affecting the level of consumer protection where Member States have stricter national legislation, as does Sweden in this case."
"The Swedish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament still hold this view."
"We also find the scope of the proposal too narrow, as it is strictly limited to the economic interests of consumers."
"Our main objection to the proposal, however, is that it threatens to overturn the Swedish ban on TV advertising aimed at children."
"This is currently governed by the Television without Frontiers Directive which, in turn, is in danger of being fully harmonised as a result of this proposal for a directive."
"Unfortunately, the proposal does not afford children sufficient protection against advertising, as we discussed in this House earlier this evening."
"The Swedish proposal to ban TV advertising aimed at children under the age of twelve is based on the same developmental theories that form the basis for our requirement that minors be protected against violence and pornography."
"Children cannot be expected to view advertising critically or resist bait advertising directed at them."
"That is why we ought to have had a stricter proposal with regard to advertising aimed at children."
"Mr President, I too would like to add my congratulations to Mrs Bresso for ensuring particularly that we get this law to ban unfair commercial practices on the statute books at first reading."
"Many of my constituents have written to me as the victims of bullying and aggressive door-to-door salesmen."
"I believe this law heralds the beginning of the end of the con merchants and the dodgy dealers who dupe and mislead our consumers."
"Thank you to Mrs Bresso for adding to the list of banned practices the bogus prize draws and scam lotteries a scourge that is plaguing my constituents and relieving them of large amounts of their hard-earned cash and pensions."
"One of my constituents paid out GBP 1 300 to a claims agent for transfer charges and tax to claim his non-existent EUR 630 000 winnings from the fake lottery ."
"Many of my elderly pensioners are being targeted by another bogus prize draw that promises winnings on return of a cheque paid for administrative costs."
"From premium rate telephone scams to property investment schemes; from door-to-door dodgy dealers offering building services, to the bogus lotteries and prize draws; the consumers in my country are being cheated out of GBP 1 billion a year."
"That is a lot of money lost to the economy."
"This law must protect the vulnerable consumer."
"It must ban unfair practices."
"I welcome this new law on behalf of my constituents."
"I believe it is a great model of how we can deliver on behalf of citizens and consumers in a relevant and practical way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me in my turn to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, for the quality of the draft that will be put to the vote tomorrow and which will serve to protect European consumers, especially those who are most vulnerable, against the aggressive tactics of unscrupulous operators."
"This second reading of the common position on unfair commercial practices has demonstrated that, given the necessary political will, it is possible to formulate a European law which harmonises the wide diversity of national legal positions instead of pitting them against each other."
"We must indeed remember that the European Commission, in its initial draft, proposed the application of the country-of-origin principle, and it was the Council that opted for a strategy of closer harmonisation, which our Parliament firmly supported at first reading."
"Accordingly, I can only urge the Commission to learn the lessons from this directive and encourage the House to keep pursuing the path of harmonisation in respect of the draft instruments currently under discussion, and particularly the proposal for a directive on services as well as the proposal on measures to promote sales, on which a stalemate has been reached in the Council."
". Mr President, I should just like to say once again very briefly that this is a very important piece of legislation, not only for the protection of the consumer – I would say more than anything else – but also for the completion of the internal market and to help and protect bona fide traders."
"It is a realistic compromise; like all compromises, I am sure that many of us would like to certain aspects go further."
"However, it is a realistic and workable compromise."
"I agree with Mrs Wallis that this is a good example of how cooperation between the three institutions can produce positive results for European citizens."
"Most of the concerns expressed today are met by the legislation."
"I remind you that, in respect to children and other vulnerable consumers, there is still the possibility of stricter measures by the Member States based on health, safety, taste and decency."
"This gives Member States room for manoeuvre."
"The derogation period of six years for higher protection and standards will be very useful."
"In the meantime, the Commission will come back with a report on the application and transposition of the directive, and we will also review every aspect and see how we can take it even further."
"In this respect, we will see how we can proceed with updating and increasing, if necessary, the list of practices contained in Annex I. I must remind you that the list may be modified only by revision of the directive."
"Mr Harbour was right: my commitment to Parliament is to give priority to enforcement and implementation."
"Otherwise, we can adopt the best laws but, unless they are transposed and implemented by the Member States, they will be of no value to European citizens."
"This will be the Commission's first priority and will be reflected in the report, where we will present to you any problems in implementation."
"I look forward to working together with you to get the Member States to implement and enforce this legislation."
"Finally, I wish once again to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, for her excellent work."
"I also wish to thank the Groups, the shadow rapporteurs and the chairman of the committee, who helped a lot in this respect."
"I am very proud that this important piece of legislation comes under my competence."
"I am proud and very happy and take it as my duty to ensure that it will be transposed properly by the Member States."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0029/2005) by Mr Jiří Maštálka on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on promoting health and safety at the workplace."
". Allow me first of all to thank all those who have worked very constructively with me to prepare this report on the promotion of health and safety at work."
"I should also like to thank all the other members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for the attention they have devoted to this problem and to the materials provided."
"This is proof that they consider the problem of protection of health in the workplace to be an important component of European policy."
