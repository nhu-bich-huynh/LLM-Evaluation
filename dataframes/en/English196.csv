"Subject: Common EU defence policy During the European election campaign this year, the Swedish Prime Minister, Göran Persson, said that there was no possibility of a common EU defence becoming a reality as Sweden would use its veto as soon as the question came up for discussion."
"Pierre Schori, then Minister for Co-operation, claimed that there was a crucial difference between what the EU meant by effective crisis management and a common defence."
"According to Schori, the EU does not intend to develop a common defence but simply wishes to enhance its capabilities for effective crisis management."
"With regard to these statements, will the Council say whether the Treaties stipulate that the EU should develop a common defence?"
"How does the Council interpret the decision of the Cologne Summit to integrate the WEU into the European Union?"
"Is there a place for neutral Member States within the future common foreign and security policy?"
"Mr President, as the Honourable Member knows, Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union states that ""The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy...which might lead to a common defence, should the European Council so decide."""
"Therefore, a common defence is stated as a future possibility in the Treaty on European Union in compliance with the conditions set forth in the Article."
"The Article also states that Union policy will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policies of certain Member States."
"The European Council at Cologne discussed Europe' s capacity for attending to the so-called Petersberg Tasks, which are in accordance with Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union, and which are humanitarian and rescue actions, peacekeeping and action by combat forces to restore peace in crisis situations, including when there is a credible military capacity."
"Heads of State and Government undertook to develop an effective European military capability founded on existing national, as well as bilateral and multilateral capabilities, and to strengthen the European capacity in this connection."
"The General Affairs Council has been given the task of drafting pre-conditions and measures required to achieve this goal."
"In this connection, we have to determine detailed provisions for incorporating in the Union such action on the part of the WEU that the EU needs to be able to see to its new responsibilities in respect of the Petersberg Tasks."
"Thus, the WEU is not integrated into the Union as such."
"The aim is to take the necessary decisions by the end of the year 2000."
"As is pointed out very forcibly in the statement approved at the Cologne Summit, this strengthened capacity for effective crisis management does not change the independent solutions that Member States have regarding defence."
"The special nature of militarily non-aligned states is preserved."
"In compliance with the conclusions made at Cologne, the task we have in common is to strengthen the Union' s capacity for effective crisis management, not an arrangement for regional defence."
"As the European Council at Cologne confirmed, the common foreign and security policy, according to the stipulations of the TEU, includes the issue of crisis management."
"Under the Treaty, all Member States have the same rights and obligations."
"Furthermore, the third subparagraph of Article 17 (3) provides for the participation, fully and on an equal footing, of all Member States in planning and decision-taking in the WEU."
"The conclusions of the European Council at Cologne stress that the creation of a successful European security and defence policy will require, inter alia, that all Member States of the Union, including non-aligned Members, may participate fully and on an equal footing in EU operations."
"Let it be said that decisions taken in respect of crisis management action, especially decisions having military and defensive effects, will be taken in compliance with Article 23 of the TEU."
"Member States will maintain the right, in all circumstances, to decide if and when they will use their national armed forces."
"Thank you for your answer."
"It was quite comprehensive, but I think you would have to be able to interpret oracles to understand what the representative of the Council really said."
"Is there to be a common defence policy or not?"
"If the answer is to be interpreted as saying that there is in fact not going to be a common defence policy, then that is sensational news."
"It would then be extremely interesting to hear the reactions from Paris, Berlin and Madrid and many other places where the Cologne resolutions have in fact been interpreted as a further step in the direction of a common defence policy."
"Or shall I interpret the answer as saying that there will in actual fact be a common defence policy?"
"Is it really so impossible to answer the question?"
"I do not know how many times I have taken up this question since I first came into this Parliament a few years ago and how many times I' ve tried to obtain clarification and clear interpretations from the Council about what is really going on."
"Because opinions within the European Union are so diverse and because interpretations of the Cologne resolutions are so totally at odds with each other in different parts of the EU, is it just not on, then, to say quite straightforwardly either ""yes, we are on the way towards a common defence policy"" or ""no, there' s not going to be a common defence policy"" ?"
"Can we not get a clear answer to this extremely important question?"
"I can see that the matter is clear in so far as, if you ask something about the future, then nothing completely certain about what is going to happen can be said to you in reply."
"Obviously you can state that it is a possibility which may become real for us when the EU is developed further, but in that case different decisions have to be made before anything can happen."
"Where the present position is concerned, it can be stated quite clearly that there are more so-called peacekeeping exercises the European Union could become involved in."
"These should progressively be engaged in first."
"As this process goes forward, we do not know exactly what will happen."
"At this stage, I should still not, however, be able to say that we can begin to talk about a common defence policy."
"Our colleague, Mr Gahrton, refers in his question to my statements in the Swedish EU election campaign."
"These have proved to be correct and have also been confirmed not only by the Council here but also by Chris Patten in the Committee hearings."
"He said that a common EU army would be unnecessary, extremely expensive and directly damaging to relations with the USA."
"Let me add that we who definitely do not want to see a common EU army and who are not members of NATO would nonetheless, in common with an overwhelming proportion of Sweden' s population, its government and the party I represent, like to see the EU taking more responsibility when it comes to Europe' s peace and security."
"We also recognise the Cologne resolution which says, amongst other things, that the EU must become better at organising military and civil crisis management."
"My question to the Council is this: do you share my view that the way to lasting security is mainly through civil, cross-border co-operation and not through military rearmament, that is to say that we ought to follow the Monnet line and not the Maginot line?"
"I think the questioner is quite right."
"If we have to use military troops, then we have gone wrong somewhere."
"The whole fundamental idea behind the EU is that attempts are made to bind the people of Europe to one another in a way which guarantees peace and security throughout Europe."
"If we talk about the enlargement process, what we are basically saying is that we must try to bind other countries too to a peaceful Europe and in a way that guarantees that problems don' t arise in this area."
"I am of precisely the same view, namely that we ought, in the first place, to direct our efforts towards such measures so as to ensure that crisis situations do not arise in Europe or in our immediate neighbourhood."
"Mr President, I have a question concerning how events will run in practice."
"What would happen today if a neutral Member State was attacked militarily by a non-EU State?"
"What would you do and which course of action would you recommend?"
"We have just recently had a military crisis between the borders of two EU countries, namely between Greece and Austria."
"What plan would you have if a military attack were to take place today against an EU country, even if it were a neutral EU country?"
"How would you proceed as President-in-Office of the Council?"
"It has to be said that it is difficult to predict what would happen in a situation like that."
"There are no legal requirements to the effect that Member States need to take measures if anything like that should happen."
"However, we clearly inhabit a Union characterised by solidarity."
"If any Member State were to be attacked by a non-EU country, we should obviously have to show solidarity in some way."
"Precisely with what means, it is very difficult indeed to predict."
"Clearly, situations such as the ones you describe and which we hope will never arise can end up having to be dealt with in different ways."
"I hope, however, that we shall never find ourselves in a situation such as is described in the question."
"Question No 3 by (H-0408/99):"
"Subject: UN Convention on combating organised crime On the basis of Article K.1 of the TEU, the Member States have committed themselves to preventing and combating all forms of international crime and regard the fight against organised crime as a matter of common European interest."
"The action plan for organised crime sets out the joint strategy which the Member States have chosen as a means of combating such crime."
"In October 1998, the Council called on the Presidency to submit, pursuant to Article K.3 of the TEU, proposals for joint positions concerning the draft UN Convention and protocols thereto, as it wishes to contribute to their negotiation and prevent inconsistencies between the future Convention and EU instruments."
"What action has the Council taken to advance and influence the future UN Convention and to ensure consistency between it and EU instruments in this area?"
"Mr President, the Council is aware that it is desirable and necessary to draft and propose joint positions concerning the draft UN Convention and protocols thereto."
"It also wants to participate actively in talks on them and ensure there is consistency between the future Convention and the EU instruments in this area For this, the EU countries holding the Presidency, after a call to do so expressed in the Council in October 1998, reconciled the positions of the Member States and put them to a multi-sector working party and the K.4 Committee, which is now a committee within the meaning of Article 36, at meetings in Brussels and also during talks held at Vienna."
"The Member States of the Union took an active part in the talks."
"During the German presidential term, the Council confirmed the common position on the proposed Convention based on Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on 29 March 1999."
"In the future, we shall have other joint positions confirmed, depending on the progress made at the talks in Vienna."
"Member States agree that it is desirable to avoid inconsistencies between the proposed Convention and the instruments drafted in the European Union, which include, for example, joint action, as agreed on 3 December 1998, on money laundering, recognition of the means of committing an offence and benefits associated with it, tracking down criminals, freezing assets, seizure of goods and successful conviction, and joint action, as agreed on 21 December 1998, on involvement in organised criminal activity."
"Member States continue to reconcile their positions in talks on the proposed Convention as far as possible, and on the initiative on the part of the country holding the Presidency, and are endeavouring to reach consensus on all issues that significantly affect the interests of the Union."
"The Commission is fully involved in this work."
"The Member States of the European Union agree that it is desirable to participate in negotiations on the proposed Convention as energetically as possible, and they intend to continue to be intensely active in discussions and negotiations on this issue."
"Thank you. That is a good answer."
"It should, however, be possible to develop it further."
"When it comes to combating organised crime, what is needed is a greater degree of organised, cross-border co-operation."
"It is a fact that criminal investigations are unduly focused upon national inquiries."
"If we want to be effective, more investigations involving a European dimension are needed."
"My question is this: is the Presidency exerting pressure to ensure that the informal meeting of ministers which is taking place at this very moment will be in a position to take further steps which might find concrete expression in more cross-border investigations following the summit meeting in Tampere?"
"As the questioner says, the Justice Ministers are at this very moment holding a meeting in Finland."
"Clearly, this meeting is preparing the ground for the summit meeting in Tampere in the middle of October."
"One of the subjects to be discussed at the summit meeting is criminality and organised crime, together with the problems which this type of criminality entails."
"As the questioner pointed out, it is however also extremely important that this question not only be discussed within the European Union but also at international level and in conjunction with work being done by the United Nations."
"Obviously, matters will be discussed within the European Union but, in order that progress might be made, we shall also give all our support to the United Nations."
"With regard to providing a mandate for talks within the framework of the United Nations' convention, the idea is that a mandate shall in fact be provided, but this may be a little difficult."
"This is something which, as the country which holds the Presidency, we are now looking into."
"Mr President, in the draft Convention approved by the Council, there are also regulations on concealed listening devices and co-operation among authorities connected with it."
"Many of the regulations on bugging, however, are drafted by the Enfopol working party, which is under the control of parliamentary or political forces, but is concerned exclusively with police co-operation."
"Nevertheless, this sort of bugging might be violating personal and national privacy, and may also be criminal."
"I would ask what the Council intends to do in order that these Enfopol regulations come within the scope of parliamentary and democratic control."
"Mr President, obviously at the stage when regulations on concealed listening devices in each Member State are finally agreed, they will certainly be the subject of extensive debate and they will have to be assessed."
"Regarding the views of the Member on the political control of this working party, the country holding the Presidency may throw light on the issue, but I cannot take a more precise position on the proposal as I do not know a good deal about it."
"Question No 4 by (H-0409/99):"
"Subject: Access to Schengen documents When the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force, the Schengen Agreement, together with its implementing regulations, became EU law."
"Previously, the Council had been unable to make public certain documents owing to the separate status of the Schengen Agreement."
"The opportunity is now there to increase transparency and, thereby, democratic control over Schengen issues."
"Some of the most important documents which have been kept secret are the Sirene manual and handbooks for external border control and those for embassies and consulates."
"Will these documents now be made public, in full or in part?"
"Mr President, as the Member quite correctly stated, the Schengen Agreement became part of the European Union framework when the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force."
"The more than 700 pages long Schengen Convention is to be published in the Official Journal, and it will be accessible on the Council' s web site as soon as it has been translated into all the Community languages."
"The General Secretariat of the Council has, in addition, just published a pamphlet containing the Schengen Agreement, accession treaties, and decisions and declarations made by the committee implementing Schengen."
"We intend to have this pamphlet sent to the Member who asked the question."
"Thank you for your answer to the question."
"I wonder if I am to interpret it to mean that the SIRENE manual too is to be in the public domain, as are instructions to ambassadors and consulates and instructions for external border controls."
"Are these included in the 700 pages of material to be published?"
"Or are they still to be secret?"
"I think it is quite unreasonable that significant, applicable parts of such an agreement should remain outside the public domain."
"The documents which are in this manual and which will be published in the OJEC should cover most of the material the questioner is asking about."
"If there is something missing from this material, it will be seen to what extent such information can be handed over if it is requested, and in that case, we will comply with the Decision which the Council approved on 20 December 1993."
"Mr President, I welcome strongly the fact that the 700 pages are going to be published."
"They are of course legally binding on the citizens of Europe."
"But what about the future when more of these laws are going to be passed in the Council of Ministers?"
"They will be passed in total secrecy."
"The public in the gallery, we Members, the press cannot watch law-making going on."
"What is the attitude of the Finnish presidency towards law-making in secret, because at the moment the Council of Ministers is only matched by Beijing and North Korea in passing laws over citizens in secret?"
"Should not it be in the open and will you do something about it?"
"Mr President, as the country holding the Presidency, Finland aspires to the greatest possible transparency in its work in the European Union."
"For this reason, among other things, during the Finnish presidential term, we will be publishing Council and other committee agendas, so that people may know, if they need to, what issues are up for discussion, and so that, if necessary, they can find out more about those issues and, besides, hold public debates on them."
"As far as my personal experience of the work of the Council is concerned, I have to say that, although, obviously, issues are prepared in a way that is not always open, in most cases the best way of acquiring information on the preparatory work of the Council is to read about it in condensed form in the Financial Times."
"Question No 5 by (H-0414/99):"
"Subject: Establishment of a universal moratorium on capital punishment On a number of occasions, the European Parliament has called for the EU to promote an initiative within the UN aimed at establishing a universal moratorium on capital punishment."
"In this connection, on the initiative of the Council or of Member States, the UN Commission on Human Rights has, over the last three years, adopted resolutions calling for the universal abolition of the death penalty."
"Does the current Council Presidency believe (as the European Parliament does) that the conditions are now such that a majority of the members of the UN General Assembly will this year call for the establishment of a universal moratorium on capital punishment?"
"If so, has it already moved to include such an item on the agenda for this autumn's General Assembly? If not, is it intending to do so during the next few days, by means of some other procedure?"
"Mr President, opposition to the death penalty plays a central role in the Union' s policy on human rights."
"In June 1998, the Council established guidelines on EU policy relating to the death sentence in third countries."
"It is a fundamental aim of the Union that the death penalty should be abolished world-wide."
"To achieve this aim, the Council is urging those countries still applying the death sentence to agree to establish a moratorium on capital punishment, and is calling for compliance with minimum standards."
"In addition, it is inviting them to embrace international legal instruments banning the death penalty."
"In compliance with its guidelines, the EU proposed, as an initiative, for the first time a draft resolution on the death penalty at the 55th sitting of the Commission on Human Rights at Geneva this year."
"The initiative was a great success, being in content more radical than former resolutions and, in addition, there were more who were jointly proposing it - 72, in fact - than in 1998, when there were 65."
"The Union also organised a panel discussion at the sitting on capital punishment, in which NGOs and government representatives of different countries took part."
"The Council has just decided to continue with its policy to take up the subject of the death penalty in a multilateral forum, and it decided for the first time to propose a draft resolution on capital punishment during the 54th session of the UN General Assembly."
"The Council believes that the Union initiative will strengthen the international trend towards abolishing the death penalty."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to ask you to take a look around the House to the right and left, because I was first to indicate that I wanted to ask an additional question just now and, because you did not see me, I was not able to."
"I wish to thank the Finnish President' s team for the action it is taking at the United Nations on the matter of abolition of the death sentence, and I am delighted to know that thanks to the Finnish Presidency - not just them, of course - we will have a decision this year in New York."
"The whole problem resides, I believe, in the matter of the text adopted by the Assembly."
"According to the information I have, this text was based on the one adopted in Geneva."
"There is only one problem, the omission of successive deadlines for the implementation of a moratorium initiative in the form of a treaty or other institutional initiative."
"Could the Council Presidency give me further information on this?"
"What type of schedule, if any, does the Council have in mind in order to be able to realise this initiative?"
"Mr President, the Council wants to act openly to achieve the best possible result at the United Nations General Assembly."
"I also hope that we can have talks with other possible supporters of the project."
"With this process still under way, the draft text has not yet been finalised."
"The resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights contain a reference to the question of a moratorium."
"Setting a deadline is a good thing in itself, and it would be good to achieve such a thing, but it is not entirely without problems."
"I would also like to stress that we all have an obligation to try and encourage the abolition of the death penalty in our official contacts, at one-off events, at official announcements and in multilateral forums."
"It is also important that when we have political discussions with countries such as China, Iran and the United States we try and raise the issue of capital punishment at those meetings also."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question concerns the last part of your intervention."
"We are very happy that it affects the Member States and that it is intended to be included in the agenda of the 54th Assembly of the United Nations."
"I am in complete agreement with the spirit of the question and the intervention of Mr Dupuis."
"However, could the President-in-Office of the Council tell us whether, in those countries with which we maintain political and economic relations, such as China, the Council can have an influence, maintaining a clear and specific position in favour of the abolition of the death penalty which this European Parliament supports so firmly?"
"Can we not in some way have an influence in those countries with which we maintain these commercial and political relations?"
") Mr President, I would like to say once again that in June 1998, we agreed guidelines for Union policy relating to the death sentence in third countries."
"Our main goal is the abolition of capital punishment, but as the group of countries that apply the death penalty contain some very important countries, cooling relations with them is not a viable solution."
"Mr President, I was very pleased to hear the President-in-Office say that the Finnish Presidency will go ahead with negotiations with certain countries, including China, with a view to abolishing the death penalty."
"I would like to ask the Finnish Presidency: do you intend to begin some kind of negotiations with Turkey either to prevent the carrying out of the death sentence on Abdullah Öçalan or to abolish the death penalty in Turkey altogether?"
") Mr President, it is very evident that the Union has repeatedly expressed its desire that Turkey should continue with its policy by which it has refrained from using the death penalty, and that must obviously also apply in the Öçalan case."
"Question No 6 by (H-0416/99):"
"Subject: EU support for Ireland's maritime services Ireland has one of the largest maritime areas to patrol in the EU, a responsibility which is important to Ireland and the EU as a whole and extends to activities such as drugs surveillance and interception, fisheries protection and the safety of shipping."
") Mr President, the Council is aware that Member States, which have a long coastline, have an enormous responsibility regarding the implementation of Community regulations on maritime security and the protection of the sea environment from its contamination by vessels."
"To lighten the burden of these obligations, Community directives and regulations on the subject provide for closer co-operation and an exchange of information between Member States, to avoid overlapping, to make it easier to acquire information on vessels, and to standardise practices in Member States."
"Regarding fisheries, the Council would like to mention the legislation provisions that apply under Council Decision 95/527/EC."
"These acts, which cover the period 1996 - 2000, provide for Community participation in the funding of costs incurred by the implementation of monitoring and surveillance in respect of fisheries policy."
"On the basis of this act, Ireland has the right to apply for a contribution by the Community."
"Mr President, would the Council accept that the cost of maritime surveillance to Ireland is totally disproportionate to our size and population."
"I appreciate his point that under the 1995 fisheries legislation provisions this is taken into consideration, but does he support the provision of funding commensurate with the area to be surveyed by the Irish authorities?"
") Mr President, we must be cautious about the sort of promises we make, but I have to say that at this time, there are no plans to increase funding in this area."
"I suspected something like this."
"That is why I wanted to give you time to reflect."
"Question No 7 by (H-0418/99):"
"Subject: Cheaper mortgages In view of the ever increasing cost of housing throughout the EU, will the Council outline new ways in which house buyers could avail themselves of long-term cheap mortgages?"
") Mr President, the trend in mortgage rates partly reflects the long-term interest rates in capital markets."
"The present long-term interest rates in the euro area should, in principle, therefore mean cheaper mortgages."
"To some extent, monetary policy might indirectly affect mortgages interest rates."
"This does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Council, however, as the Honourable Member will certainly know."
"The Commission has not presented the Council with any proposals for tax or any measures to improve mortgage rates."
"Mr President, the introduction of the single currency, combined with better competition in the marketplace, has resulted in a substantial reduction in interest for those on variable rate mortgages."
"I want to emphasise variable rate mortgages."
"There are however, particularly in Ireland, a substantial number of borrowers on fixed rates, sometimes at interest which is three times higher than the current rates and which lending institutions are unwilling to adjust without substantial financial penalties."
"I would ask the President-in-Office if he is willing to have this matter examined, if not by the Council, by the Commission or indeed the European Central Bank."
"It is a very serious problem for a very large number of borrowers who are finding it increasingly difficult to meet interest rates which prevailed five, six and seven years ago at treble the rate which we have at the present time."
"Although there are some requests for the floor, I have to apply the rules, and point 4 of Annex II of the Rules of Procedure says that each Member may ask only one supplementary question during questions to the Council."
"I am therefore very sorry to say that I cannot give the floor to Mr Newton-Dunn."
"Mr Sasi has the floor."
") Mr President, improving the regulations on single market procedures with regard to finance policy is in fact one of the primary goals of the Council."
"It aims to increase competition in the sector, which would be likely to benefit house buyers also."
"As I mentioned in my speech just now, the Council has had no proposal from the Commission in this area."
"If such a proposal should emerge from the Commission, we will obviously pay special attention to it."
"Question No 8 by (H-0420/99):"
"Subject: Stopping the practice of multi-use trial contact lenses Media reports in June stated that in Britain 'opticians have been advised to stop using multi-use trial contact lenses because of fears they could transmit new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'."
"Has the Council considered this development at EU level and does it consider that such a 'precautionary measure' should be taken in all EU Member States?"
") Mr President, since 1996 the Health Council has examined and monitored at all their half-yearly meetings the appearance of any new form of contagious Spongiform Encephalopathy, and especially Creutzfeld-Jakob disease."
"However, as yet, the Council has not been presented with information or proposals on the particular matter the Honourable Member refers to."
"Is the Council aware of the situation in Britain to which I have referred?"
"If he is not aware, I would strongly suggest that the Council familiarises itself with this situation."
"I do not want to be alarmist in any way but the fact that the British Government has already acted is something which should be taken into consideration."
"In view of the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty accords the highest priority to the protection of human health and given the fact that the European Parliament now has powers of codecision under the Treaty can the Council assure the House that any proposal to be considered on the multi-use trial contact lens will be brought before the House for our consultation and approval?"
") Mr President, I believe that ophthalmologists and opticians are aware of the risks which contact lenses carry with them, but, as we know, as far as division of responsibility is concerned, it is the job of the Commission to monitor how the situation is progressing in practice."
"If the Commission perceives problems it is its task to make recommendations that we will obviously look into carefully."
"As the author is not present, Question No 9 lapses."
"Question No 10 by (H-0424/99):"
"Subject: Youth crime, drugs and the Tampere European Council What assurances can the Finnish Presidency give that at the special European Council on Justice and Home Affairs to be held on 15 and 16 October next in Tampere a common strategy will be adopted aimed at tackling youth crime and delivering a clear message that the EU will not introduce a liberal policy towards drugs?"
") Mr President, at this stage I cannot give any guarantees to the Honourable Member of what issues will be discussed at the Tampere Summit, although mention has been made of them today."
"In fact, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Home Affairs have to prepare work on matters relating to their own areas in an unofficial meeting to be held in Turku on 16 - 17 September, and the General Affairs Council began its preparatory work on the European Council meeting at a meeting last Monday, and will continue with the task at a meeting to take place 11 - 12 October."
"I can say, however, that the country holding the Presidency has noted the particular interest the UK delegation, with the support of the French and Swedish delegations, has shown towards the problem of youth crime."
"In the debate on the prevention of crime, the country holding the Presidency intends to stress how important it is to have an active preventive policy to act as a counterweight to measures that strengthen the tools of co-operation in respect of the police and matters of law."
"The Extraordinary European Council meeting at Tampere will not be dealing with the question of drugs mentioned by the Honourable Member."
"The institutions of the Council and the European Parliament are right now drafting a strategy on drugs, which is based on a Commission communication."
"The intention is to deliver a presentation on the matter at the European Council to be held in Helsinki in December 1999."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer."
"However, he has told us nothing new."
"The purpose of this Question Time is to allow Members to raise issues of importance and try to get some information from the Council."
"In my supplementary therefore, I would like a direct answer from the President-in-Office as regards the Finnish Presidency' s position firstly on reducing youth crime, secondly on ensuring that the right of Member States not to be forced to comply with a so-called liberal regime of drug use and drug policy are not diminished and thirdly, on ensuring that there is no diminution of the requirement for unanimous agreement on any changes in this area."
") Mr President, I can assure the Honourable Member that Finland, as the country holding the Presidency, will play an active part in striving to prevent and reduce youth crime."
"We see youth crime as an enormous problem, and giving attention to this problem will have an impact on the crime rate in the future also, as someone learning antisocial patterns of behaviour when young is a danger in the longer term not only to himself but obviously to the whole of society also, in terms of criminal damage."
"Regarding a policy on drugs, the Finnish line is very clear."
"As the country holding the Presidency and as an individual state, Finland is not in favour of the liberalisation of the drugs policy or, for example, of some drugs becoming legalised."
"As the author is not present, Question No 11 lapses."
"Question No 12 by (H-0428/99):"
"Subject: Reciprocal abolition of visa requirement between EU and other countries Some Member States of the European Union have abolished the visa requirement for US citizens travelling to EU countries."
"The USA, however, retains the right to require EU citizens travelling to the USA to obtain a visa."
"Which Member States' citizens are not required to hold a visa for travel to the USA and what measures will the Council take to persuade the USA to abolish the visa requirement for all EU citizens?"
"Mr Alavanos also requests the floor for a procedural motion."
"Mr President, I apologise for the interruption but from the text, at least the Greek text, it appears the question has been written incorrectly."
"Something must have gone amiss between the text leaving my office and it arriving at the services department, and I would like to clarify the matter for the President."
"The question is this: although the citizens of the United States can enter all the countries of the European Union freely, there are some countries within the European Union whose citizens require a visa from the American embassy in order to enter the United States."
"I would like you, Mr President, to enlighten us on this political issue and tell us what you intend to do to put an end to this discrimination."
"I am saying all this because my question has been written incorrectly."
"Mr Alavanos, it seems to me that the Spanish version says the same thing that you have mentioned."
"It is probably a linguistic issue."
"Nobody is perfect, as you know."
"Errors are committed and the President-in-Office of the Council, who furthermore has been enlightened by you, will reply to you."
") Mr President, I believe the Honourable Member is fully aware that, as the United States is not at this time on the list annexed to Regulation EC/574/99, it is not for the Council to persuade the United States to abolish visa requirements for citizens of the Union."
"This is rather the task of the Member States concerned, by virtue of Article 2(3) of the above-mentioned regulation."
"The plan of action accepted for the Council and the Commission in the Council of Justice and Home Affairs on 3 December 1998, which concerns the most suitable ways of implementing the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on the realisation of an area of freedom, security and justice, puts forward a proposal, one of a group of measures to be implemented within a two-year period, for a regulation for countries whose citizens do not need visas for Member States of the Union, and for countries whose citizens do."
"Reference is made in this respect to subparagraph i of paragraph b of Article 62(2) of the consolidated version of the EC Treaty."
"Only when the Commission makes proposals on this regulation can the Council, by virtue of the principle of reciprocity, make a check of those countries whose citizens do not need any kind of visa to visit EU Member States."
"The USA' s Department of Immigration and Naturalisation permits travellers from certain countries to apply for entry into the United States without a visa for a maximum of 90 days for purposes of business or tourism under the so-called visa waiver pilot programme, Visa waiver."
"EU Member States included in the programme are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, which means that only Greece is missing from the list."
"Greece is not yet actively involved in the programme."
"However, I would like to point out that the US Foreign Minister has announced that the Attorney General has agreed that Greece should participate in the programme, but there is still preparatory work to be done before Greek citizens can enter the USA within the context of this programme."
"Talks are being conducted with Greece with special advisers present, with the result that Greek nationals will soon be able to participate in the Visa waiver programme, and thus this problem will no longer be on the agenda."
"Mr President, I received a reply which was quite substantial and requires some study on my part."
"I do not, however, agree with the Presidency' s viewpoint that this is not a matter for the Council."
"I believe that from the moment the European Union was created, from the moment we had free movement, from the moment we had the Schengen Agreement and consensus on the issue of the movement of people between Member States, no country, such as the United States, should ever have been allowed to come along and rock the boat and impose discriminatory practices on a country like Greece."
"From this viewpoint, we would expect the Council and particularly the Finnish Presidency, which is generally attuned to these issues, to intervene in some way with the United States."
") Mr President, it is true that the free movement of people is a central principle in European Union policy, which, moreover, has been implemented."
"On the other hand, it is also true that Member States practise independent visa policies that are not at the moment entirely in line with one another."
"Question No 13 by (H-0436/99):"
"Subject: Land acquisition in applicant countries What is the Council' s position on efforts being made in applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe to continue, subsequent to any EU accession, to restrict or prohibit the free acquisition of land by EU citizens, at least during a transition period?"
") Mr President, as the Honourable Member states, several countries that have applied for membership have asked, during the accession negotiations at present going on, for a period of transition, for them to be able to keep in force some restrictions to the right on the part of Union citizens or companies to freely acquire land."
"These requests, which are being justified in terms of political, economic and social necessity, are being examined at present in Council bodies established to formulate the EU common position at the negotiations."
"The Union will, however, determine its final position only after it has received further information and reports from the countries in question on the scope and consequences of the requests."
"Nevertheless, we must remember that the European Treaty contains undertakings, according to which Community companies based in countries that have applied for membership have the right to acquire land, including agricultural land."
"The Union also stressed its common position, when the negotiations on accession started on 21 March 1998, that the requests in respect of transition measures may not involve changes to Union regulations or policy or prevent them from being properly implemented."
"In this connection, it has to be said that a transition period in respect of land acquisition has been proposed in the chapter on the free flow of capital."
"This principle is of primary importance as far as the proper functioning of the single market is concerned."
"In a general sense, this means it should be guaranteed that all kinds of capital transfers may take place freely in connection with accession."
"Mr President, I would like to put one additional question: I share your opinion and thank you for this clear response that the complete adoption of the acquis communautaire is, of course, necessary for accession."
"More and more rumours are being circulated these days that a deal could be struck: transitional periods, as far as the free labour market and similar are concerned in the EU, could be combined with transitional periods in the candidate countries."
"I regard this as being extremely problematic because it will certainly not be a question of the amalgamation of two things, rather an accession process, and I am of the opinion that there could be transitional periods with regard to accession, as there have been earlier, but that the candidate countries actually have to adopt the complete acquis communautaire on accession."
"Should this not be the case, then it would be accession à la carte which could greatly jeopardise the Community."
") Mr President, I have myself travelled around in the applicant countries, and in some of them I have had my attention drawn to the fact that people are worried about the right of foreigners to purchase land."
"I must, however, say that many countries have by now already amended their legislation, so that land acquisition will at least be easier than before."
"I have made it clear in all discussions that Union regulations cannot be changed, and that applicant countries must accept the acquis communautaire in this regard also."
"Question No 14 by (H-0437/99):"
"Subject: WTO Millennium Round At the European Council held in Cologne in June 1999, EU Heads of State agreed that the forthcoming ""Millennium Round"" WTO trade negotiations should include workers' rights."
"""Negotiations covering a broad spectrum of topics, including labour standards, environment, development and transparency"" , they argued, ""are the most appropriate approach for achieving substantial and balanced results for the benefit of all WTO members"" ."
"The inclusion of labour standards was widely applauded by the governments of developing countries, by NGOs and by the trade union movement world-wide."
"A few weeks later, however, EU trade ministers subsequently decided to remove workers' rights from the EU' s negotiating mandate."
"Does the Council now agree with its trade ministers that minimum labour standards have no part to play in achieving substantial and balanced results in the ""Millennium Round"" for the benefit of all WTO members?"
") Mr President, the Council has many times adopted a stance on trade negotiations and the forthcoming Millennium Round of talks, the last time in the resolutions issued at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 21 and 22 June 1999."
"The Council has not given the Commission an official negotiating mandate to prepare for the round of negotiations."
"The Council has, however, decided to return to the preparatory work in respect of the WTO' s third ministerial meeting in October this year, when the new round has been planned to start."
"The intention is therefore to decide on the Union' s overall position on this preparatory work."
"The Council, in its resolutions of June 1999 on preparatory work in respect of the WTO' s third ministerial meeting, clearly made reference to the President' s conclusions at the European Council at Cologne on 3 and 4 June 1999, which stated that talks on various subjects, including rulings on employment, are the most appropriate way to approach the achievement of significant and fair results for the benefit of all WTO members."
"Mr President, I should like to say, on my own behalf and on behalf of Mr Titley, that response is rather weak."
"As we are aware, the Council meeting in Cologne fully endorsed the need to include minimum core labour standards in the negotiations for the WTO millennium round."
"It is vital for our prospects of bringing the world ever closer in terms of these minimum core standards - which include an end to slavery and child labour - that we start this round properly."
"I hope, therefore, that the Council will take on board many of the issues which have been raised in this Parliament, both in committee and in plenary regarding such measures."
"I hope that you will take a stronger stance and come back with a stronger answer when you have considered the full implementation of your key negotiating standards."
"It is essential that you consider this particular element."
") Mr President, I agree with the Honourable Member that it would be appropriate to discuss core labour standards at the WTO round, and preparations are based on the recognition that these matters have to be discussed."
"However, we must bear in mind that it is evident from discussions that, particularly in developing countries, there are very great fears that the Union will call for a labour action policy which will simply try to prevent the import of goods from developing countries."
"We have tried to diminish these fears purposefully, consistently and emphatically, but they still remain relatively strong."
"I know, however, that, merely for the sake of the NGOs, it is important that in questions of labour standards and minimum standards we should be able to make progress, so that the next round of WTO negotiations acquires sufficient approval and credibility."
"I can also assure you that the country holding the Presidency is determined to seek a solution whereby labour standards will be on the agenda for discussion at Seattle, and in that way we should be able to make real progress."
"I would like to raise a question which has a bearing on relationships between the European Union and the WTO, also affecting employment but concerning present compliance."
"There are small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the Union which are still suffering sanctions imposed in the context of the banana war and this is because we have been slow to comply with the ruling; hence sanctions are still in force."
"This will cost jobs in very vulnerable parts of the Union and I would like an assurance that the President of the Council is in favour of securing compliance with standards of international law and preventing suffering by members of this Union from sanctions imposed under what have turned out to be illegal actions."
") Mr President, I agree with the Honourable Member entirely."
"It is very important to be able to resolve the banana dispute before the next round of World Trade Organisation talks begin in Seattle."
"A decision was taken in the General Affairs Council last April in which the Commission was set the task of presenting a proposal during September that would guarantee absolutely that the Union' s new strategy in respect of the banana sector would be in compliance with WTO rulings."
"The banana issue was discussed last Monday in the General Affairs Council, and there was a report on the situation."
"The Commission has primarily tried to find a solution that would involve some sort of quota system, but it has been very difficult to move from any kind of banana quota system to consensus on the matter with the banana-producing countries and the United States, as the interests of the countries concerned are very different regarding quotas."
"If no agreed solution can be found, it is possible that we will end up in a situation in which a solution will only be found in a system based on tariffs."
"The country holding the Presidency will apply its energy to find a solution quickly, in a way that will not cause any problems in relation to WTO rulings."
"It is important that this dispute is off the agenda as quickly as possible, and we know that it is also important for many of those companies that have suffered from the increased sanctions approved by the WTO."
"Question No 15 by (H-0438/99):"
"Subject: Situation in North Korea For many years now, the situation in North Korea has been catastrophic: the total lack of freedom and democracy has been exacerbated by a food crisis of tragic, not to say apocalyptic, proportions."
"According to the estimates of international organisations, between one and three million people have died in North Korea since 1995 in the wake of the chronic famine which resulted from natural causes and, more specifically, from the nature of the nationalist-communist regime in power in Pyongyang."
"In reaction to that situation, not only has the North Korean regime not shown the slightest inclination to initiate political and economic reforms but, on the contrary, it has imposed even harsher measures on the people of North Korea, maintaining total control on missions by expert advisers and on the food aid provided by the international community to the people of North Korea (600,000 tonnes of cereals in 1998, and 530,000 tonnes in 1999) and refusing to allow the international organisations involved to monitor the use and effectiveness of the aid."
"Furthermore, the menacing attitude taken by the North Korean authorities towards neighbouring democracies, especially Japan and South Korea, extends to the entire region the threat posed by this dangerous regime."
"What measures has the Council taken, or does it intend to take, with a view to ensuring that the people of North Korea may regain their freedom at the earliest opportunity, build a country where democracy and the rule of law hold sway and once again participate in the market economy?"
"Does not the Council feel that, at this juncture, it has the duty to propose to the UN Security Council a plan whereby North Korea would be placed under international trusteeship?"
") Mr President, the Council is just as concerned as the Honourable Member about the events in the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea, especially the violation of human rights in respect of political prisoners, and that the principle of the rule of law is not complied with and the authorities are unwilling to work in co-operation with international human rights organisations."
"The Union also believes that the difficulties in the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea are mainly structural and self-inflicted in nature."
"Taking into account the North Korean administration and, to a large extent, the speed of progress it has chosen for itself in large part, the Union is in favour of giving North Korea the opportunity to respond positively to certain undertakings."
"The EU undertook the first round of political dialogue with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea in December 1998."
"It is prepared for the second meeting later this year, depending on North Korea' s progress in those areas the EU sees as worrying."
"In this respect, the EU has appealed to the Democratic People' s Republic of North Korea to comply fully with the undertakings specified in the agreement on nuclear shut-down, and sign and ratify an agreement on a total ban on nuclear testing."
"The Democratic People' s Republic of Korea would have to stop missile exercises, such as test flights, which weaken stability in the region."
"The Union is strongly urging North Korea to stop exporting missiles and missile technology to the world' s unstable and potentially explosive regions."
"The Union is also concerned about possible new missile testing."
"The EU is urging third countries, in its political contact with North Korea, to try to influence the country in its compliance with all these undertakings."
"On 19 October, the Council of the European Union endorsed important conclusions concerning a communication by the Commission on the Republic of Korea."
"The conclusions also discuss the situation in the Korean peninsula, and express the Union' s above-mentioned worries."
"Mr President, Mr Member of the Council, I think it is not enough for the European Union to be concerned."
"It must take action on North Korea."
"Obviously it is a distant country, but nonetheless the regime in power there is literally a criminal one; the Union ought to make efforts to overturn this regime, before we are obliged, as in the case of Kosovo or other regions, to adopt drastic means."
"This would require some imagination, and that is what I am asking of the Council."
"It would be possible to carry out ""subversion"" in the best sense of the word, and to get information to the citizens of North Korea so that they did not feel isolated."
"The United Nations could set up a major diplomatic initiative in order to isolate North Korea completely."
"We could parachute certain things in, as we do have the necessary military and technical resources."
"I would like to know if the Council is willing to study a number of steps of this type in order to overturn this literally criminal regime, so that we would not have to, as is the case for the Soviet Union, lament the tragedy 30 or 40 years later."
") Mr President, I am very much of the same opinion as the Honourable Member."
"North Korea is a positive shame to humanity, and I consider its government criminal in nature, and I have to say that its system of government is totally inhuman."
"The Honourable Member said that creativity should be applied in contemplating how the country' s administration could achieve democracy and essentially change."
"Many countries in the world have certainly used their imagination, but so far nobody has yet found the philosophers' stone enabling us to find a peaceful solution to the problem which is simple and easy, or even one that demands considerable effort."
"Mr President, both the question and the answer have perturbed me somewhat."
"I have the feeling that the incursion against Yugoslavia has whet the appetite of those warmongers who want to join the United States of America in its role as the world' s gendarmerie."
"I must confess that the second reply of the Council delegate increased my concerns."
"Perhaps he could tell us if the European Union really does intend to invade North Korea."
") Mr President, I wish to stress that, as the country holding the Presidency, Finland will act purposefully and firmly to ensure that the Union does all within its power to safeguard human rights in the world."
"But the Union cannot act as the world' s police force, and that restricts our possibilities for a more radical solution for North Korea."
"But I want to make it quite clear that the North Korean Government is continually in serious breach of fundamental human rights and introducing democracy to the administration would be desirable."
"Here we have talked of creativity, with which we have endeavoured to find positive means of bringing about changes in the North Korean administration."
"But it is not very easy to bring about change through positive means, and, obviously, the problem arises where such positive means only give strength to the existing administration."
"These are exactly the reasons why, Mr Member of the Council, it is necessary, in my opinion, to come up with alternative solutions."
"Some Members, such as the Greek Member who spoke before me, think that we discovered North Korea after Kosovo."
"Let me reassure him, we have been concerned with it for a long time already."
"There are means other than the military means which we should strive to avoid, and therefore the imagination of the European Union should concentrate on the invention of other systems."
"We could, for example, invest five million ECU to create a radio service broadcasting to the population of North Korea."
"Is the Council willing to work on a hypothesis of this nature?"
"We could parachute in food aid, broadcast information to the population of North Korea to enable them to find the means to resist this criminal regime."
"Otherwise, we shall be obliged, as our Greek colleague fears, to resort to military means, because the tragedy will have grown in scale."
"It is necessary, I think, to show some imagination."
"But unfortunately I do not hear many responses of this kind."
") Mr President, I only want to briefly say that information is often an important friend of democracy and human rights."
"But, obviously, in the case of North Korea, the problem is that the country is so tightly shut off from the outside world it would be tremendously difficult to broadcast information there, although that would be desirable."
"Question No 16 by (H-0440/99):"
"Subject: Situation in Kosovo During two and a half months since the introduction of KFOR into Kosovo, not only has there been no progress in calming the situation in the region and promoting a climate of stability, security and peaceful co-existence among the populations, but the unstable situation created by the NATO bombings has been further inflamed and exacerbated."
"The silence maintained over the discovery of a mass grave containing the bodies of 15 Serbs murdered in mid-July in the vicinity of Gnijlane, a zone under the responsibility of American troops, raises serious questions about the role of the so-called peacekeeping force in that it has tolerated or even supported an extensive campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Serbian population of Kosovo, revealing the partiality of the international community with regard to the protection of the human rights it is supposed to uphold."
"Given that the KLA is pursuing its illegal activities without hindrance and, according to reports in the international press, organising arms and drugs trafficking and murdering innocent Serbs with impunity, what steps will the Council take to call an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council so as to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the massacre at Gnijlane, launch an overall review of the human rights situation, assess the role of KFOR in Kosovo and take firm and immediate decisions regarding the KLA as well as measures to ensure that Serbs, gypsies and other ethnic groups can remain in Kosovo?"
") Mr President, the international community rejects the accusations made by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that there was concealment over the discovery of a mass grave containing the bodies of fifteen Serbs."
"The United States, which was responsible for the zone in which the grave was found, confirmed that information on its location had been given to the International Criminal Court on the day after the discovery."
"The International Criminal Court has been responsible for the investigation since mid-July."
"Neither can I accept the accusations relating to partiality on the part of the peacekeeping forces in Kosovo."
"The international community is committed to full implementation of Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council for the establishment of a democratic and multicultural Kosovo within the internationally recognised borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"The violence and persecution that continue in Kosovo is only to be condemned."
"For this reason, it is very important to disarm the KLA and dismantle its military structures."
"The KLA must comply with the imposed deadline of 19 September."
"The Council also expressed serious concern that Serbs and non-Albanians have left Kosovo in large numbers, and it reminded everyone that Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council states that all refugees and those forced to move out of their home regions have the right to return."
"Everything possible should be done to try and make their return home easier."
"Mr President, I believe that both the President' s reply and the debate concerning the previous question are evidence of the selective approach of the said International community for dealing with world-wide problems, including the situation in the Balkans."
"At the moment, Mr President, we are witnessing the ethnic cleansing of Serbs, Gypsies and any other ethnic groups living in Kosovo."
"Is this issue of any concern to us?"
"Yes or no?"
"Secondly, does the Council believe that the KLA will have disarmed by 19th of the month, i.e. Monday?"
"Yes or no?"
"Thirdly, does the Council have any inkling that the KLA is, by its actions, attempting to or is in danger of destabilising Albania and the Former Republic of Macedonia?"
"Yes or no?"
"I would appreciate some concrete answers."
") Mr President, the country holding the Presidency has been alarmed to see the exodus on the part of many Serbs, and Romanies also, from Kosovo."
"The fact that Romanies have also left shows that internal problems and disputes between ethnic groups in Kosovo are very serious and difficult to solve."
"Obviously, it is absolutely essential that KFOR troops protect and help all ethnic groups in Kosovo equally."
"We must try to achieve peace in the region as speedily as possible so that everyone there may feel secure."
"I also wish to say that the country holding the Presidency of the Council considers it very important that the KLA adhere to their commitment to a decommissioning of weapons."
"Only then can confidence be sufficiently increased within Kosovo, enabling us to preserve a genuine multi-ethnic society."
"Mr President, we are indeed dumbfounded by the replies that the President-in-Office has given us."
"Is he mindful of the fact that of the 250,000 Serbs who were in Kosovo when the bombing stopped, only a few thousand now remain."
"In Pristina, there used to be 27,000 Serbs but now there are only 1,500-2,000."
"He himself recognises the fact that everybody is fleeing Kosovo, apart from the odd few and the Albanian-speaking population."
"Can he tell us therefore why this proud International Force, which I call the Occupying Force, has left?"
"Can he tell us therefore why, whilst Mr Solana himself is recording secret documentaries on NATO which prove that the KLA is involved in drug trafficking, prostitution and crime, the International Force is continuing to support the KLA, and why the International Community is continuing to arm and not disarm them as was agreed? This hypocrisy must come to an end once and for all, Mr President-in-Office."
"We must sober up and acknowledge the fact that the real goal was for there to be true ethnic cleansing in Kosovo just so that you could manipulate it to suit your own needs."
"Furthermore, that is why you are refusing to pay for the reconstruction of what you destroyed in the rest of Yugoslavia."
") Mr President, my understanding is that there is no ethnic cleansing taking place in Kosovo at this moment but that peace to some extent has been restored, with occasional isolated incidents."
"The KFOR are obviously there in a peacekeeping capacity and Finland also has sent an 800 strong force."
"These soldiers will work in earnest to ensure that there is a lasting peace in the region and that all Kosovans can return to their home regions irrespective of race or creed."
"Question No 17 has been withdrawn by its author."
"The Council will reply jointly to Question No 18 by Mr Medina and Question No 19 by Mr Korakas."
"Mr Korakas has let us know that he considers that they should not have been regrouped, but this has been decided and I trust in the ability of the replies of the President-in-Office of the Council to respond to both of them appropriately."
"Question No 18 by (H-0443/99):"
"Subject: Construction of a nuclear power station in southern Morocco Is the Council aware of the fact that a nuclear power station is due to be built in southern Morocco for the purpose of desalinating sea water?"
"Question No 19 by (H-0446/99):"
"Subject: Stopping the construction of a nuclear power plant in the highly earthquake-prone region of Akkuyu, Turkey The scale and intensity of the recent earthquake in Turkey and the incalculable damage it has caused have focused attention even more sharply on the plans to build a massive nuclear power plant in the region of Akkuyu in south-west Turkey, a project with which the Turkish Government is nevertheless persevering."
"All expert reports confirm that the region is highly earthquake-prone."
"What measures will the Council take to block this plan, which threatens the vital interests of the entire region and opposition among its inhabitants, both within and outside Turkey?"
") Mr President, I would like to answer Manuel Medina Ortega' s and Efstratios Korakas' questions simultaneously, as both questions concern the risks connected with the construction of nuclear power plants, in this case, one planned in Morocco and one in Turkey."
"The Council would like to state, in a general way, that Morocco and Turkey have both signed a convention on nuclear safety, whose aims are connected with the concerns raised in the Honourable Members' questions."
"The aim of the convention referred to, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is to achieve and maintain high standards of nuclear safety world-wide by developing action at national level and international co-operation, and organise and maintain effective protection in nuclear plants against possible dangers of radiation, for the protection of society and the environment from the possibly harmful effects of ionising radiation issuing from these plants."
"In addition, it sets out to try and prevent accidents that lead to effects from radiation and alleviate the effects of radiation if an accident does occur."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in the case of Morocco the issue concerns the building of a nuclear power station to produce 600 MW of electricity."
"The European Union has agreements with Morocco with regard to economic aid and, it seems, the reason for constructing this power station is because there is Chinese aid available."
"That is to say that it seems that the Republic of China is prepared to offer money for the construction of a nuclear power station."
"My specific question is whether the Council thinks that it could offer Morocco the possibility of a more rational procedure, because building a nuclear power station to produce 600 MW of electricity is ""using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut"" and I believe it would be preferable if our neighbours were not to do it."
"Can the Council not do something so that Morocco will not have to turn to this dubious Chinese technology which is currently being offered to them?"
") Mr President, it is important that the Union should monitor these projects and their implementation and try its best to see that the plants are as safe as possible and that their use and construction present no risks either to the citizens of the Union or to the inhabitants of the countries in question."
"Let it be said that one positive aspect of these plants is that they are not responsible for carbon dioxide emissions."
"Mr President, the issue we raised in our question has nothing to do with the more general issue of nuclear power plants."
"We are concerned with a specific nuclear power plant of 1400 MW which Turkey is about to establish for no apparent reason. We greatly fear that it will be used to build nuclear weapons, in the Akkuyu region, 120 kilometres east of Cyprus, in an area renowned for its seismic activity."
"There, three tectonic plates are adjoined and in 1917 we had an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale."
"Recent studies point to the fact that the Esemis fault is still active and between 1871 and 1975, more than 50 significant earthquakes were recorded, all within 130 kilometres of each other. Not too long ago, about 136 kilometres from there, we had an earthquake in Adana, measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale leaving 140 dead."
"Another typical example is of course the recent earthquake, and we are all aware of its effects."
"So, notwithstanding all that, is it or is it not criminal on the part of Turkey to insist on building a station in that area?"
"This is an issue of general importance not only for Turkey where there have been rallies taking place against the plant, but also for the whole of Greece, which is why we need direct intervention to stop this plan from going ahead."
") Mr President, it is clear that earthquakes are a factor that cannot be ignored when considering the planning and safety of a nuclear power plant."
"It is quite obvious that the safety authorities must always take account of the possibility of seismic disturbances in examining the suitability of a site and that it is necessary to see to it that structural solutions help to ensure that an earthquake would not cause problems for the plant."
"Obviously, we will be monitoring the situation as closely as possible to ensure that the buildings are up to the approved standard."
"In addition, I wish to emphasise that Turkey and Morocco are nevertheless bound by these international agreements, which is an ideal situation for proposing additional safety requirements."
"Mr Sasi, we thank you for the great effort that you have made today in response to all of the questions."
"Since the time allocated to questions to the Council has expired, Questions 20 to 26 will be replied to in writing."
"Question Time is closed."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.10 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I wanted to ask you about a non-profit association that calls itself the non-profit association pension fund."
"Members of the European Parliament, I believe that pension funds have already been discussed here in the European Parliament a number of times, and that we are in a transitional phase."
"That is why I am extremely bemused to find an invitation from Mr Balfe here for a meeting that he is going to have with the non-profit association pension fund."
"I wanted to ask whether Parliament provides the interpreters and covers the expenses for meetings of this kind, and whether this non-profit association continues to be supported in any way by Parliament."
"Thank you very much Mrs Maes."
"Your comments have been noted by the Bureau."
"As you can imagine, at the moment, and in these circumstances, the Bureau is not in a position to be able to give you an answer."
"This is not an individual decision, taken by the President-in-Office. It is decided on by the Bureau as a whole."
"You will receive an appropriate answer when the time is right."
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, it appears from yesterday' s Minutes that Mr Barón Crespo replied to an intervention of mine from the previous day."
"Do not worry, Mr President, I am not going to exercise my right to reply to personal references."
"And furthermore, I confess I do not have the parliamentary skill to reply to a personal reference within 24 hours."
"I simply wish, through his colleagues, to offer him my willingness to co-operate."
"Thank you very much, Mr Galeote."
"You have asked a question, as is your right, but you must understand that I am not really in a position to give you the answer you would like."
"I think that you will have to raise this question the next time Mr Barón Crespo is acting as President."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"European Reconstruction Agency - Situation in Kosovo"
"The next item on the Agenda is the following joint debate:"
"Report (A5-0013/99) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation 1628/96, relating to aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in particular through the setting-up of the European Reconstruction Agency (COM599)312 - C5-0062/1999 - 1999/0132(CNS));"
"and the Commission' s statement on the situation in Kosovo."
"Neil, Commission. Mr President, with your permission, indeed at the suggestion of the House, I would like to make a Commission statement on Kosovo."
"Naturally I value the work and the words of Mrs Pack and particularly the force and clarity with which she put a very convincing argument."
"I will respond properly to her report at the end of this morning' s debate."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that international civil and military administrations have been established and have begun the very difficult task of rebuilding in Kosovo."
"It calls on all parties to respect Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military agreements and undertakings in full and hopes that complete KFOR and UNMIK deployment will be completed without great delay."
"The Commission supports the creation of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo and deeply regrets the continuing ethnic violence."
"It condemns, in the strongest terms, violence perpetrated by any ethnic group and calls for maximum efforts to secure the reconciliation and cooperation which are essential to stability and security for all in the region."
"The Commission' s roles in the massive efforts to restore infrastructure and civil society in Kosovo will be of interest to the House."
"Broadly, there are two such roles: engagement in the major reconstruction programme and collaboration in the framework of UNMIK coordinating initiatives with other international donors."
"Clearly the first element will be discussed, particularly as this House debates the report by Mrs Pack, and I therefore highlight just a few of the relevant elements at this juncture."
"Firstly, a total budget of EUR 137 million is foreseen for 1999 under the Obnova Programme of which EUR 46 million has been committed and implementation is under way."
"However, the Commission counts on the active support of this Parliament, which I am sure will be forthcoming, in obtaining both the remaining EUR 92 million for 1999 and the additional funding which will be required in the coming years."
"At present we estimate that some EUR 500 million will be needed in 2000 and EUR 500-700 million needed in 2001 and 2002."
"Secondly, efficient implementation will obviously be of crucial importance."
"The Commission proposes, therefore, the creation of a locally established reconstruction agency to ensure the effective application of the Community' s reconstruction programme in Kosovo."
"Thirdly, the creation of the agency must clearly be well prepared and a taskforce has therefore been set up for that explicit purpose."
"The taskforce has programmed and is implementing the first EUR 46 million tranche of reconstruction assistance."
"Landmine clearance, customs and the procurement of essential supplies for rehabilitation of housing, public buildings and, in particular, Mitrovica Hospital are the main focus of attention."
"Later tranches will concentrate on preparing roads for winter conditions, municipal twinning in which assistance from Member States is being requested, and subsequently public utilities, public buildings, economic reconstruction and institution-building."
"The second element of the Commission' s involvement goes beyond the implementation of Community assistance and extends to the wider international effort in Kosovo."
"It naturally includes a variety of activities."
"I refer to some of them for purposes of illustration."
"Firstly with the other participants in reconstruction and the major international financial institutions, the Commission is involved in damage and needs assessment."
"Indeed the Commission is conducting the only province-wide methodological assessment of physical damage."
"The initial results of that exercise relating to damage in housing and local infrastructure were issued at the conference arranged by the Commission and World Bank donors last July."
"A more comprehensive report, focusing on large-scale infrastructure, will be completed by the end of this year."
"Secondly, the Commission shares responsibility for donor mobilisation with the World Bank and at that July conference of donors over EUR 2 billion was pledged."
"A second conference is scheduled for next month."
"Thirdly, as the House is aware, the European Union has a special responsibility for reconstruction within the United Nations Civil Administration, UNMIK."
"These activities are organised in the so-called Pillar 4 which is headed by a Commission official, Mr Dixon."
"Thanks to the strenuous efforts made by Mr Dixon and his colleagues, Pillar 4 is working well, though faced with enormous problems due to the legal and institutional vacuum in Kosovo."
"The current priorities are putting the banking system in order, working closely with other pillars and KFOR to provide essential supplies, shelter and transport in advance of winter, preparing with the World Bank and the IMF a simplified budget and working on fiscal issues and drawing up with the World Bank a medium-term investment framework to be presented to the next pledging conference."
"Fourth, the European Union, and obviously the Commission, will also contribute to work in the other pillars: pillar 1 with UNHCR on humanitarian issues, pillar 2 with the UN and pillar 3 with OSCE on institution-building and democratisation."
"We will strive to ensure full cooperation between the different participants where there are clear overlaps between civil administration and reconstruction."
"Mr President, following the Council' s recent decision on the easing of sanctions relating to the Kosovo crisis the Commission is putting forward a proposal for the exemption of Kosovo and Montenegro from particular EC sanctions against the former Republic of Yugoslavia."
"The oil embargo and the flight ban will therefore be lifted."
"Cooperation from all relevant authorities in Kosovo will obviously be vital in order to establish effective controls on end use and to avoid circumvention."
"Mr President, in recent years fellow Europeans have again been perpetrators and victims of appalling violence and attempts at ethnic extermination, sometimes described, in a euphemism which bewilders me, as ""cleansing"" ."
"As ever, the worst results of such horrors are suffered by the innocent and the effects will blight their lives for many years to come."
"I know this House does not need convincing, but as a direct and leading contributor to relieving suffering and rebuilding normality and as a coordinator of the efforts of others, the European Union must make the maximum possible commitment."
"In those and other efforts, by working with people of all ethnic backgrounds we are for them and also working for the purposes and values that bind us together."
"In giving help as humanitarians, we hope that we are giving an example as Europeans too."
"Mr President, we welcome with great interest and some concern the draft which has been submitted to us, and of course we approve of the general positions stated by our rapporteur, Mrs Pack."
"On the matter of the Committee on Budgets and Mr Tillich - whom I am representing here on an ad hoc basis - and I hope, Commissioner, that you will forgive me if I am not able to stay in order to hear your replies, but I shall certainly look forward to finding out about them - our concerns are both positive and worrying."
"There are three things whose presence we welcome."
"Firstly, we welcome the idea that this agency will be active at a grass roots level."
"It is at a grass roots level that problems will be solved, not in Brussels."
"It is better to do things in Pristina than to wait in vain for them to be done in Brussels."
"Secondly, we also welcome the maintenance, within the structure of the agency, of a system of hierarchical responsibility, which means that this agency will be headed by management staff from the Commission."
"Nevertheless, we do feel that the distribution of tasks is unsatisfactory and gives the staff sent by the Commission a too basic and limited role compared to workers recruited on-site."
"We are also delighted with the administrative flexibility which I have just mentioned, which means that we will be able to attend to local needs with largely locally recruited staff who, consequently, know the area well."
"I shall describe this agency, Commissioner, as a kind of anti-TAO, as we have combined the flexibility necessary in TAOs with keeping hierarchy and responsibility, the lack of which has sometimes been criticised."
"We have five main concerns."
"Firstly, the location."
"There is no point in leaving Brussels only to move to Thessaloniki."
"Either you are on-site or you are not."
"This agency will be dealing with problems in Kosovo, so it should be in Kosovo."
"Secondly, its length of stay."
"We support the idea of an agency which acts when needs arise. We oppose the idea of an agency whose administration would continue indefinitely."
"From this point of view, a length of stay of 30 months seems, at least to start with, quite satisfactory."
"Our fundamental concerns relate to the balance of power between the Commission, the Council and the Member States."
"This is of real concern to us."
"In the structure which has been proposed, we - and the Court of Auditors shares our concern - see a serious risk of the Commission' s administrative authority being dismembered in favour of an intergovernmental supervision which we cannot approve of."
"We are also in favour of a board of management which will not hand over the management of the agency to the Member States, but which will uphold the Commission' s control."
"We are defending you, Commissioner, and we are asking you to defend yourself too."
"We also favour not a management committee, but a consultative committee, in which the Member States will play a role, can make their voices heard, but in which they are not the real decision-makers."
"Our last concern is for clear financial responsibility."
"It is essential that what is paid for by the European Union should be managed by the European Union, and that what is paid for by Member States should be managed by the Member States."
"Mr President, after months of misery it looked as though it was going to be possible for a little ray of hope to shine on Kosovo."
"The European Union generously released EUR 500 million to help the Kosovars rebuild their country and the Commission did its best too."
"Instead of the usual bureaucratic ""to-ing and fro-ing"" between Brussels and the location where the work takes place, the Commission opted for a decentralised agency which was in a position to start work on an autonomous basis."
"But nothing came of the Commission' s good intentions."
"Yet again they were torpedoed by political games in the Council."
"It was due to horsetrading, for it cannot be called otherwise, between the Germans and the Greeks, that the unhappy decision was taken to have the Reconstruction Agency based in Thessaloniki."
"This leads to wastage, wastage of money, wastage of manpower and wastage of efficiency."
"It also produces incomprehension in Kosovo, for at the end of the day, it is Kosovo itself that has to be reconstructed and not Greece."
"But the worst is still to come."
"Do you know that a Kosovar needs a visa to travel to Greece?"
"And that he can only obtain that visa from the Greek Consulate in Belgrade?"
"Of course that is very hostile territory for most Kosovars, which means that in deciding to base the agency in Thessaloniki, the ministers are excluding the people they are trying to help from the reconstruction process."
"The members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have decided unanimously, that is across all parties, to reject this state of affairs."
"We also call for there to be effective supervision of the agency."
"Some of the points have already been mentioned by my colleague from the Committee on Budgets."
"Furthermore, we consider it to be of the greatest importance, of course, for OLAF to be able to intervene when things go wrong."
"I will just return briefly to the question as to where the agency should be based, and I also speak for my group."
"Mrs Pack has very courageously taken upon herself the task of clearing up the Council' s mess, proposing a completely logical solution that involves establishing the agency in Pristina and linking it with the Stability Pact in Thessaloniki."
"That ought, at the same time, to give some substance to the motley collection of talking shops we have now."
"I applaud her intentions, but of course the question is whether the Council is going to take any notice."
"I think it was made clear yesterday that the Council has no intention of listening to what we want in any way, shape or form."
"That is why I wholeheartedly support her proposal to postpone things."
"We are simply going to have to do battle with the Council for what is right and efficient."
"Mr President, the reconstruction of Kosovo has not yet got underway and the Member States are already greedily asking themselves: what can my country get out of it?"
"Duties are being distributed amongst the large countries, regardless as to whether they are major sponsors, and curtailing the Commission' s role is successfully preventing a rather broader vision from establishing itself."
"That is generally accomplished by setting up a Governing Council with representatives from the 15 Member States."
"In this way everyone can easily see if the interests of their own country are being given due attention."
"I am also under the impression that the 15 representatives of the Member States work on this Council on the basis of an oath of office which requires them to support and further the interests of their own country to the best of their ability. They do not work on the basis of a European oath of office, which could require them to promise to do maximum justice to European interests and visions, and not just to national interests."
"If our attention was truly focused on Kosovo' s needs then we would never set up a Governing Council of this kind."
"For if this was truly the case then an advisory committee with a limited number of expert advisors, based on a European oath of office, would be sufficient."
"They would then be able to monitor how effective the implementation process was."
"Self-interest would not be the determining factor in their case, but rather the question as to whether the reconstruction of Kosovo might also give a nice boost to the business community in Kosovo and in the surrounding poor countries, whom we are only compensating in dribs and drabs for the loyal way in which they have carried out the boycott against Serbia."
"In any case, we want to make a Stability Pact work for their sakes."
"By stability we don' t mean things being at a standstill, but, rather, progress."
"We can use the Council' s readiness to modify its proposals as regards the aforementioned board, to show the citizens what the Council' s true motives are and to what extent it has a horror of wastefulness."
"After all, it will tend to be cheaper to produce the goods needed for the reconstruction of Kosovo in the region rather than in the Member States."
"I would like to draw your attention to another particular aspect."
"It is well known that building up the public administration will make a very important contribution to Kosovo' s developmental opportunities."
"In my country, the association of Dutch authorities is working very hard on this at local level."
"But they come up against KLA civil leaders wherever the KLA has been able to take over the office of civil leader."
"These civil leaders impose their will on the population, which directly frustrates all attempts to create a civil service that functions effectively and inspires confidence."
"That is why I ask myself if the Council would be prepared, at the suggestion of the Commission, to look into whether it might be better for such offices to be filled by experienced people from outside."
"We know from our experiences in Bosnia that there are some civil leaders of decidedly criminal character and some real low-life in these posts, which impedes the proper development of local communities."
"Mr President, we can see whether this project will be feasible from the Council' s willingness to take up our request to amend their document, a process that will show that Kosovo really is at the centre of interest."
"I would therefore also like to see the Commission do what is necessary to urge the Council to make amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to warmly thank our colleague, Doris Pack, for her commitment and the firm stand she has adopted and also for her willingness to compromise on issues."
"We have therefore also fully supported her amendments."
"This Chamber proves in fact to be very united in its desire to repudiate the Council' s inability to be educated on these questions."
"Incidentally, we can hardly educate them in fact because they are not actually here."
"I hope that the Commission is on our side even if Commissioner Kinnock could not say so as clearly as I am doing."
"For we are not concerned here with who is right, we or the Council, but rather with together learning what mistakes have been made."
"The citizens of our Member States cannot accept there again being even the possibility of money being squandered."
"Just like our citizens, we are prepared to spend money, but it must be spent efficiently."
"I should like to make four points."
"Firstly, we have agreed - and I am very happy about this - that the Agency is to be in Pristina, but - and here I differ somewhat from Mrs Van der Laan - that Thessaloniki is definitely the appropriate location for regional co-operation organised at a higher level and for the reconstruction of the region as whole."
"It is a question of all the peoples and all the countries in this region co-operating with each other, and that can certainly and unambiguously be better organised from Thessaloniki than from Brussels."
"This division of responsibilities is therefore certainly a division which we fully and completely support."
"Secondly: for a single Agency, two management committees are planned, each with the 15 Member States represented."
"What is the sense in having two management committees for one Agency for the 15 Member States if not that they want to allocate as many tasks to themselves as possible?"
"However, it is not a question of our in fact distributing tasks for the reconstruction in Europe but, rather, a question of the reconstruction being efficient, speedy and well organised, and I hope, Mrs Schreyer, that you will take special care to ensure that the relevant money is spent efficiently and that it does not again benefit the individual Member States and their firms and that you will also, of course, bear in mind the need for supervision by OLAF."
"Thirdly: Mrs Pack proposes that all the States in South-East Europe or, rather, the firms from these states can be involved."
"I must confess that we have had discussions in our group about whether firms from the countries which are not sufficiently willing, or not at all willing, to work alongside us can in fact be involved in the reconstruction."
"That is, in the first place, Croatia and, in the second place, a country which is still not at all prepared to participate, namely Yugoslavia."
"We want to look forward and to also give these countries the opportunity to be involved, along with their firms and companies, and we hope that these countries and their governments will also be prepared to take part in the reconstruction."
"With regard to Croatia, this is a laborious undertaking. We hope that, despite all the difficulties in Serbia or Yugoslavia, there will also be fundamental changes, and for this reason we shall agree to the proposal."
"Finally, I should like to return to what Commissioner Kinnock said."
"We have not become involved in Yugoslavia and, in particular, Kosovo in order to replace one ethnic group with another ethnic group."
"I certainly understand the displeasure, the rage and, indeed, the hatred felt by many Kosovan Albanians towards the Serbian population."
"We will not however tolerate and will not accept that another type of ethnic discrimination should occur with people being murdered and driven from their homes."
"The European Union must make sure that there is co-operation between all ethnic groups in the region as a whole."
"That is the European goal which we must pursue with great efficiency."
"Therefore, my group will also agree to the amendment' s being deferred, because the Council must first do its work."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I was in Kosovo last winter and wrote a report to Parliament' s Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"I visited a number of private aid organisations."
"Their biggest problem was the Commission' s centralist working methods and the unduly long time it therefore took to deal with matters."
"The Commission' s local representative had to ask about everything in Brussels because the people in Brussels were so dreadfully afraid of mistakes being made."
"I would say to the Commissioner, however, that this is not how you combat fraud and mistakes."
"If the work is to be made efficient, it should be delegated."
"People locally need to have powers to make the necessary arrangements to act quickly and efficiently."
"If fraud and irregularities are there, the hammer should fall heavily upon those responsible locally."
"It is therefore quite naturally unacceptable, Mr President, if the chain of command is now to be still longer, that is to say if the agency in Kosovo has to wait not only for orders from Brussels but also from Thessaloniki."
"This must not happen."
"The Liberal Group is shocked by the horse trading which apparently went on when Mr Hombach was appointed and the office located in Thessaloniki."
"We hope this doesn' t cause too much damage."
"We do not want the people who are having a hard enough time as it is managing the construction work in Pristina also having to struggle with additional bureaucracy in Thessaloniki."
"Finally, Mr President, I would urge that, as far as possible, local, civil representatives of the Albanian population are relied upon, that the Albanians' own talents are used and that they are not helped with things they can work out for themselves."
"The most important means of opposing KLA gangs, which are to be stopped and fought against whenever they drive away Serbs, is to mobilise the civil leaders in Kosovo."
"There are in fact parties which have won 80% of the votes cast in elections."
"They are there all the time."
"Their leaders are there all the time."
"They are ready to take over."
"And locally, too, there are leaders who can take over. They are the best means of opposing the KLA, which I have only very, very little sympathy for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have to be careful not to confuse fundamental problems with organisational ones."
"We agree that the Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo should be established in Pristina, but the Agency or the Office for the Reconstruction of Bosnia was in Sarajevo, and still faced enormous problems."
"In naming Pristina, we are not really saying anything other than that an agency for reconstruction in Kosovo should logically and effectively be done with the inhabitants of Kosovo."
"I propose nevertheless that we also discuss the way in which reconstruction will actually take place."
"Now, as far as this is concerned, what we know of the European Union in Bosnia is the enormous bureaucratic weight of the way we function as the European Union."
"In other words, instead of just focussing on Thessaloniki or Pristina, we should learn lessons from the situation in Bosnia, and try to set up autonomous structures which will be able to decide - in Pristina - on the details of the heavy reconstruction, that is: bridges, housing, streets, etc. and, at the same time, to work out the details of the reconstruction of the fabric of society."
"So what programme does this civilian society need in order to be able to, as Mr Haarder said, take control of reconstruction?"
"Let us not leave this - I will not say to the KLA groups - I will simply say to the temptation to take military action which we should perhaps condemn in political terms, but which we can understand after everything that the people have been through, out of fear that a similar situation might reoccur."
"It is true that only democratisation will take us forwards."
"We could cite the example from Bosnia of the ""3000 roofs for Bosnia"" programme."
"This was a very basic programme, which consisted of saying to the population, ""If you rebuild the walls of your house, we will pay for the roof, and if you have already rebuilt your roof, we will pay for your heating."""
"This was a programme designed to get the population active, at all levels."
"I would therefore like to see us think carefully about autonomous decision-making bodies in Pristina, which would give the population the power to decide, in conjunction with us, what needs to be done. I would also not want to see an excess of bureaucracy in Brussels, given the way the European Union functions as a rule."
"Mr President, the situation in Kosovo is characterised by the persistent attempts by the KLA to exploit the presence of NATO and KFOR forces in order to carry out complete ethnic cleansing of the Serb, Gypsy and other minorities, with the exception of the Albanians, living in Kosovo, and to construct its own state by detaching the whole region from the state of Serbia."
"The responsibilities of the European Union and the so-called 'International Community' are huge."
"Already, amendment 2 of Mrs Pack' s report which is under debate today, stipulates EU co-operation with those Albanian Kosovars who are interested in the reconstruction of their state, and that we must help them to participate and contribute to the European Union' s projects."
"But what are these projects?"
"Firstly, the report admits quite openly that it is seeking the creation of a state in Kosovo."
"Secondly, flagrant blackmail is being carried out via the criminal bombings of NATO on the devastated people of Yugoslavia who are being called upon not only to submit ethnically, socially and politically, but also to adopt a style of leadership acceptable to the Americans and NATO in order to have any hope of reconstruction for this devastated country."
"This policy is catastrophic."
"It continues its endeavours to dissolve Yugoslavia through other means."
"It supports the criminal activities of the KLA and seriously jeopardises the stability of its neighbouring countries and of all the Balkan region."
"The unrestrained action by the KLA, under the wings of NATO will, sooner or later, create great problems even in Albania and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia. This is a clear indication of the type of peace which you would like to impose on the Balkans."
"In all honesty, does anybody really believe that the KLA will have disarmed by the 19th of the month?"
"It is perfectly understandable that today we are debating the economic reconstruction of Kosovo, which, however, is directly related not only to expediency policies of the Member States, but also to their efforts to distribute those funds set aside for the rebuilding of Kosovo to the various associations within the Member States."
"Let the predators fighting for their prey begin!"
"Mr President, first of all, I agree with the disapproval expressed by Mrs Pack in her proposal for a report on the Council' s attitude regarding the expected adoption of its position on the legislation in question."
"Indeed, its attitude does not seem to take into consideration the spirit and approach taken by Parliament both in the first amendment of the 1998 Directive and in its Resolution of July this year."
"I share the objections regarding the choice of where to base the Agency in question - Pristina in our opinion and not Thessaloniki - as well as the objections regarding the unilateral possibility, or so it seems - in the Council' s opinion - of extending the activities of the Agency itself to other regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia without even consulting Parliament beforehand."
"And this, at a time when the quarterly inspection and auditing of the Agency' s activities fall to Parliament, albeit after the event."
"Nevertheless, regarding the composition of the Agency' s board, I do not understand the reasons that should lead Parliament to envisage the nomination of the seven independent experts by the Commission only."
"This is in direct contrast to the proposals put forward by the Commission itself which, in conjunction with the committee responsible, has instead envisaged the presence of a representative of each Member State."
"It is not appropriate, in my view, for Parliament to exclude, paradoxically, the Member States that constitute the European Union from a context of decision-making. First and foremost, this context is political and its operational nature comes second."
"This means that it is not a question of pursuing preventative checks as regards the overall aid proposed, even if the amount, EUR 1,900 million over the next five years, would suggest that this is appropriate."
"Mr President, I would first like to express my sincere regard for the work of the rapporteur, Mrs Doris Pack."
"As a committed politician she enjoys great recognition among Balkans experts, for Mrs Pack was and still is ""in situ"" ."
"We can be brief on the setting up of a European Office for Reconstruction."
"A commendable initiative."
"We support the two main strategies advocated by the rapporteur."
"After a dark, repressive decade, there is light at the end of the tunnel again for society in Kosovo."
"The sticking point continues to be whether this applies equally well at this stage to those of the Serbian minority who have stayed behind, as it does to the Albanian majority that has now returned."
"In any case, EU aid should be for the benefit of both population groups, albeit on a proportional basis."
"A much-needed incentive to show mutual tolerance, provided from outside."
"I would like to make a general comment on the practicalities of delivering aid to the sorely afflicted Kosovars."
"Either it can be distributed evenly across the legendary Field of Blackbirds (Kosovo Polje), or it can be put to use through model projects."
"The latter approach is favoured by the sad fact that some regions and towns in the de jure Serbian province had to pay a particularly high price in human and material terms, owing to the fury of Milosevic' s special police units and the regular Yugoslav army."
"Selecting a number of model projects and developing them successfully is precisely what is needed to provide the Kosovars with something concrete to hold on to, for it is progress that is likely to help them gain in courage."
"Furthermore, the restoration of public order in Kosovo is of course an essential prerequisite to the success of all reconstruction assistance, by which I mean EU assistance too of course."
"There is plenty of provocation from both sides."
"On no account should the international community tolerate this, rather it should take a co-ordinated and resolute stand against this on the spot, and under the leadership of KFOR, the organisation that has primary responsibility for public safety."
"We have frequently heard about the faith the West has in the Kosovan parallel social institutions, i.e. the Albanian shadow state of the last ten years, being an ideal starting point for a new beginning for this territorial bone of contention, yet this idea merits critical comment."
"Whilst there are undoubtedly areas of society which would lend themselves to this (think of the underground education system or continued medical care and specialisation), it will not do to simply follow the same line where politics is concerned."
"That is why elections ought not to be a priority for the moment."
"Political calm, allowing the political landscape in Kosovo to take shape, are musts."
"I will end on a lighter note."
"A positive development is the return of a critical Kosovan press, which covers a broad political spectrum."
"It doesn' t hesitate to denounce the misdeeds committed by its own Albanian people in open and severe terms."
"Take the expulsion of the Roma and the Serbians."
"This indigenous display of moral courage certainly justifies having a European Office for Reconstruction in Pristina."
"Mr President, the reconstruction in Kosovo is without a doubt one of the most urgent tasks, but also responsibilities, of the European Union."
"According to the latest reports from the UN, Kosovo is today a completely devastated country in which neither people' s security is guaranteed nor the population' s nutritional needs provided for."
"However, the European Union' s responsibility must this time involve more than merely financing the reconstruction."
"The reinstatement of a democratically just system is a prerequisite for any reconstruction programme, and the EU bears political, just as much as social and economic, responsibility."
"As the negative examples from Russia have shown in recent weeks, billions of dollars in aid often reach only a fraction of the people who are really affected by a crisis."
"The flow of cash must therefore be transparent."
"We must all be given a guarantee that Europeans' tax payments do not trickle away into the accounts of so many political and economic criminals."
"The European Union is alone responsible for ensuring that this money is not misused."
"As Members of Parliament, we have a responsibility towards our electors who are financing this reconstruction with their tax money."
"We depend upon a positive opinion in the population and it is therefore a basic responsibility of the European Union to be able also to explain to those who are helping to finance the reconstruction how the money is being used."
"For this, the European Union this time needs a modern, efficient, rationally managed and also transparent form of conflict management."
"Only under these conditions can we count upon broad support for this project from the European population."
"Mr President, the Commission' s report on the location of the Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo is certainly a positive step because it aims to take into account the experiences of previous reconstruction work in other parts of Europe."
"I think that this is also an opportunity not just to turn our attention to the main issue, that is, that this Agency can operate by drawing on the principles of transparency and efficiency that are crucial given the current situation in the Balkans."
"But I also think it is important and must be stressed that we must now tackle the reconstruction of the social, economic and moral fabric in a context where a broader vision of South-East Europe surely cannot be a dividing factor with regard to locating the Agency' s headquarters in one place instead of another."
"Having heard my colleagues' interventions, I think that we are asking a fair and legitimate question: 'What is the Member State' s interest, which certainly cannot be a priority interest?'"
"Entire regional economies in various Member States have collapsed over recent months through the closure of airports and the events connected to the war in Kosovo."
"I refer in particular to the areas in Southern Italy."
"So I think it is important to make more of an overall assessment, especially in light of an intervention policy which, as I read in the report on next year' s Union budget, provides for a far-ranging reorganisation of the policies concerning small and medium-sized businesses located in border regions."
"I think that the real problem is trying to create conditions which make it possible to include, in a Mediterranean context, a more complete assessment, and one which gives, above all, a broad perspective."
"It does not mean espousing one solution instead of another solution in a parochial way as regards the location of the Agency' s headquarters, but we must keep in mind the clear and well-defined basic options."
"As regards the speed, efficiency and transparency of the activities of this Agency, it is important to try to look at its establishment as a good opportunity for reconstruction, quickly and as a priority, in the current situation in Kosovo. But we also need to create the conditions whereby migration in the Mediterranean will be examined in careful detail."
"Thousands of refugees are now reaching our shores with no destination in mind, while the Member States and the European Union are completely incapable of providing a perspective and a specific response to this problem."
"I think that this is the main issue we need to focus on, in order to avoid the possibility of having to assess other situations similar to Kosovo in the near future."
"Mr President, I think it is important that we discuss a matter today which has to be settled quickly, i.e. how we formally give shape to the reconstruction programme for Kosovo."
"The European Union has a major role to play where this reconstruction is concerned, and we believe that is as it should be."
"However, we do not want the same mistakes to be made as were made in the past with large programmes such as those in Bosnia and in other places."
"That is why we want there to be more supervision, and this Parliament has a role to play here too."
"OLAF must be able to carry out its checks, and that will help us to implement the programme rapidly and effectively, for we are already receiving reports of delays that have occurred in the delivery of the things which are needed to quickly build Kosovo up."
"Furthermore, and this is also in Mrs Pack' s report, the direct involvement of the EU Member States will have to be kept to a minimum."
"Hence our proposal that we should not set up another of the famous management committees but, rather, that we should work together with an advisory committee."
"I consider that to be one of this Parliament' s important demands."
"We have often found in the past that things went wrong because the Member States interfered too much with programmes or wanted to carry out too many parts of the programmes themselves."
"The implementation of a programme must, as far as possible, be managed on-site, in this case from Pristina."
"That is the operational centre."
"It is the people there that must do the real work, and I mean particularly the Kosovars themselves."
"For another lesson we can learn from Bosnia is that too much is done by the international community and too little by the people themselves, which leads me to think sometimes that those countries are being run from outside rather from within. At the end of the day, they are, after all, going to have to do it themselves."
"Kosovo comes under the Stability Pact, which has to do with the proposal to establish the headquarters of the Stability Pact in Thessaloniki."
"I am completely in agreement with Mrs Pack' s proposal as far as that is concerned."
"It makes sense to administer that from within the region too."
"One of the amendments states that the countries of Southern and Eastern Europe should also have the opportunity to participate in the reconstruction projects."
"That too is a good thing."
"I think there is a great deal of expertise and experience available in the region which we can make use of."
"However, my group would make one qualification at this point."
"We assume that when we talk of South European countries and their involvement in the projects for reconstruction, we are not talking about the governments and authorities of Serbia and Croatia."
"We believe it is still too early to make overtures to these two countries."
"We are aware of the situation in Serbia, the problems surrounding Tudjman, the refugee situation in Krajina and the relationship between Tudjman and the government of Croatia and the Hague Tribunal."
"That is why we have certain reservations where the direct involvement of these countries' authorities is concerned."
"Mr President, it is true that the main problem is really how the area should be reconstructed and with what intentions."
"Other speakers also stated the same."
"Mr President, today we have heard many minced words and unclear allusions."
"The Commissioner told us that they are witnessing problems in Kosovo of an 'institutional and legal vacuum' , as he stated."
"How did that vacuum come about?"
"What are the Union' s administration and the rest doing?"
"What is this vacuum?"
"And how do you intend to fill it?"
"You told us that you will carry out an assessment of the damage."
"Just in Kosovo?"
"Not in the surrounding areas?"
"Just for the physical damage and not, for example, for the environmental damage?"
"In other words, you are saying that you wish to reconstruct Kosovo in an institutional, legal, geographic, geo-political and political vacuum."
"I admire you!"
"What is more, you and other speakers are saying all this, yet, at the same time, you are condemning the ethnic persecutions and trying to reconstruct democracy."
"You know very well that none of that is possible."
"The KLA will not prevent you from doing your work with their tanks but by their very presence and the tolerance that you are showing towards them, they will be an obstruction."
"What is more, the KLA is not the biggest danger."
"We have a great deal of past experience, Commissioner."
"I can, of course, recall Greece being in ruins in the wake of the Nazi occupation and the civil war, which was won with the aid of certain countries, and of course, more recently, Bosnia, Russia and Albania."
"Your greatest dangers are profiteering, land-grabbing, the secondary economy, the black market, and the mafia who are in practice trying to build a Kosovo with structures and interests as they themselves see fit."
"And yet, you have not batted an eyelid."
"I heard no mention of those issues throughout the whole debate."
"All this talk about Pristina and Thessaloniki is completely futile when we have this great problem facing us."
"Needless to say, it would be better for those who take the decisions and those who impose them to keep at arm' s length from each other."
"With this in mind, therefore, I must express my pessimism and I expect, of course, some more encouraging comments and answers."
"Mr President, I am sorry, but there is a problem."
"I am not making my intervention as a Non-Attached Member."
"I am making the intervention as a Member of the Technical Group of Independent Members."
"Excuse me, Mr Gollnisch, but this political group does not exist as you well know, or should know."
"Therefore, you are not allowed to intervene on behalf of a group which does not exist."
"I am sorry to disagree with your interpretation, but if that is indeed your interpretation, please communicate it in writing and the Bureau will reply."
"The interpretation of the Bureau is that the approval of the Minutes is sufficient to apply the application approved by the vast majority of this House."
"Therefore, for these purposes, and until further notice, you belong to the Group of Non-Attached Members."
"If you do not want to intervene, you can give up the floor, but let us not waste any more time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our colleague, the rapporteur Mrs Pack, gave a good description of the disastrous situation in Kosovo: the collapse of public services and chaos in the areas of administration and law-enforcement."
"We must recognise the fact that this is simply one of the results of the monstrous aggression committed by the government of the United States of America and its European henchmen in contravention of every rule in international law and also of every political teaching."
"Several of my colleagues have made it quite clear today that whilst ostensibly fighting against ethnic cleansing, what we are actually seeing, of course, is the complete elimination of Serbs from Kosovo."
"That is the reality."
"The civil infrastructures have been systematically destroyed, not just in Kosovo, but in Serbia too, in most instances, with no military justification whatsoever."
"Bridges, roads, waterways, railways, electricity stations, government buildings and even hospitals have been destroyed, not to mention the dead, coyly referred to as collateral damage, or their families."
"All this was done with no more justification than if NATO had bombed the bridges over the Loire to prevent the French police or Gendarmerie from intervening in a suburb of Strasbourg, a sight that we might experience sooner than you may think."
"The citizens of Europe paid for destruction to take place."
"Now they will be paying for reconstruction."
"We look forward to hearing what the United States' contribution will be."
"In the current state of affairs, we approve of limiting invitations to tender and the awarding of contracts to anyone connected in any way with a Member State or Beneficiary State."
"The question of where the Agency should be located is important, but less so than the definition of eligible countries."
"The United States of America and the countries of Europe are unfortunately responsible not only for the destruction in Kosovo, but also for the destruction in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro."
"But it understood, these few thoughts do not represent the slightest approval for a criminal policy which will go down in history as a terrible precedent which may well cause us to suffer as a consequence in the not too distant future."
"Mr President, Mr Kinnock talked at the beginning of his speech about the necessary financial requirements, and today at noon in the vote on the supplementary and amending budget no. 4/99, we shall make 92 million available to the Agency."
"But I am also saying, and this is a request to the Commission, that the piecemeal approach adopted in relation to the supplementary and amending budgets must come to an end, for it has little to do with creative budget policy but is instead reminiscent of creative accounting."
"It would therefore be as well, Mrs Schreyer - in view too of the foreseeable problems with the supplementary budgets for the year 2000 - to find an adequate solution to this issue by December' s Second Reading of the Budget for the year 2000."
"The Council is not even in fact represented from an administrative point of view, and if it has already reached a common position without waiting to hear of Parliament' s position, then it is also a matter here of putting the question of a new culture of responsibility and of better co-operation very much higher up on the agenda for public discussion in Europe."
"But we have some time."
"The Council will not formally be taking a close look at this matter and making a final decision until 11 October."
"Mrs Pack has made it very clear that the amendment to the regulation contains extremely positive signs, namely in connection with the questions of decentralisation, the opening up of invitations to tender, and much more besides."
"But if the compromise over the location of the Reconstruction Agency ends up looking like Mrs Pack has presented it - on the one hand Pristina, on the other hand the integrated arrangement of Thessaloniki - then it is that much more important that basic questions should be clarified; that the entire undertaking should take place under the responsibility of the Commission; that the Agency should not be structured in such a way that, even more than already existing agencies, it straddles individual nation states; that OLAF can ascertain that the job plan is being set out separately; that the budgetary powers of the European Parliament are safeguarded; and that, if the work concerned is extended, the European Parliament will continue to be involved."
"Therefore, it would be good, Mrs Schreyer and Mr Kinnock, if, in the spirit of new co-operation under the five-point programme, the Commission could make a new proposal on the basis of our amendment. In this way, we can achieve a satisfactory solution in terms of the regulation, and this dispute will not be introduced into the normal budget procedures."
"I do not want to introduce it into these but will on principle reserve for myself the option to do so if the Council does not move on the issue."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Pack on her exceptional work which helps us all understand why we need an integrated, as opposed to a fragmentary, European policy for the Balkans."
"The Balkans ought to be top on the agenda of foreign policy within the Union because a stabilised, developed and democratic Balkan region is an essential link for us to be able to have a positive impact on the creation of a more stabilised and democratic Russia."
"A stable, democratic and developed Balkan region is a prerequisite for the Union to have an effective and positive policy in the troubled Caucasian region and oil-producing countries which are threatening the peace and stability within that region."
"A stable, democratic and developed Balkan region makes it easier for the Union to have a positive influence in the Middle East and in Eastern Mediterranean countries."
"However, a stable Balkan region would mean that we too ought to have a stable and long-term strategy for peace, democracy and development, because there must not be any doubt in our minds that up until now the Union has not been a key player in the Balkans."
"To put it more succinctly, we provide the money and bear the cost and the Americans formulate the policy and collect the profit."
"An integrated policy is required therefore; a common development, peace, stability and co-operation strategy for the area, such as is beginning to be outlined by both the Stability Pact and by the Reconstruction Agency, which will be effective once it gets underway, with its seat in Thessaloniki."
"It is only a start, but a good start all the same."
"We must exercise a policy which, for it to be productive, must not involve sanctions or predispositions towards the people in the area, but which must promote democratisation and development as a whole."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this was what our colleague Yannos Kranidiotis was striving for and we Greeks would like to honour him with our work here today by continuing his endeavours."
"Mr President, reconstruction not only in Kosovo but also throughout the whole of the region which is continuing to be hard hit by the repercussions of the conflict is, of the utmost importance."
"The European Union, which, without a doubt, plays a pivotal role in dealing with the problems, rightly decided to widen the scope of the regulation, particularly as regards the Reconstruction Agency in the area."
"Mr President, this is what led to certain misunderstandings."
"It concerns the reconstruction of the region and not of Kosovo."
"For that reason, I am ashamed of the stance taken by the Commission so far."
"I do not believe that anyone imagines that plans for the reconstruction of the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia or of Yugoslavia can be drawn up in Pristina."
"We must look at the long-term problems and deal with those."
"This service, which must be set up together with the Stability Pact in Thessaloniki, since as I said it concerns the reconstruction of the whole of the region, must be authoritative."
"There must be management autonomy in Pristina but this service must be powerful enough so as to be able to overcome any obstacles."
"After all, we are not only concerned with repairing the damage."
"We are not just concerned with restoring the necessary institutions nor are we concerned solely with law and order, but we must give the people hope that we will make a substantial contribution to the economic and social life of the country."
"The rapporteur is right."
"We must be more careful."
"The experience to date in Bosnia-Herzegovina shows that reconstruction efforts were costly and not particularly effective."
"Therefore, this service must now be able to set in motion the reconstruction programme in Kosovo, to bring back the refugees and to also function on the basis of the humanitarian measures adopted so far."
"The financial assistance made available thus far is obviously not enough and should be more, but I believe Parliament will agree that more should be given if this service proves to be more effective."
"It is a very positive sign, Mr President, that for the first time Parliament has become involved in this affair. It has jurisdiction and, mainly through intergovernmental delegation, can monitor the functioning of this service which, in turn, should naturally organise the actual implementation of the supplementary measures to reinstate the refugees."
"It must revive the economy at a local level and it must create free communication between countries and between the regions of the area."
"It is not just about repairing the damage caused by the war."
"It is not just about the rebuilding and restoration of telecommunications."
"It is about our fully re-establishing life in the region and being able to see more clearly what is also happening in Yugoslavia."
"If Yugoslavia were left at the mercy of the current regime, then any hopes of repairing the psychological damage caused by the conflict would be dashed."
"Perhaps now is not the time to analyse why this conflict arose and who made the most mistakes."
"What is certain is that we do not have the right to make any more mistakes."
"The European Union has a role which it must play effectively and which it must take seriously."
"Mr President, I welcomed the dry and energetic style of the rapporteur and the punctuality of Commissioner Kinnock' s reply."
"Indeed, it is not appropriate to make pompous speeches, and Europe' s response to the Kosovo crisis in setting up the Reconstruction Agency in Kosovo is a genuine, operative response."
"I would define the Agency, as it appears, by using four adjectives: agile, efficient, transparent and independent."
"It will not have an infinite life span and will have to involve the local communities."
"It must ensure the public receives as much information as possible, including via regular postings on the internet."
"As regards the headquarters, I agree with the wise meeting point proposed by Mr Swoboda."
"I liked the image of the ray of hope suggested by Mrs Van der Laan, but I would be more realistic."
"There is a considerable glimmer of hope, yes, but the political problem has not yet been resolved."
"How can we really explain our role in the various places in crisis, not only Kosovo, without reviewing the Financial Perspective?"
"By hunting for funds in a disorganised and unsystematic way?"
"It might be appropriate, in the right place, to consider this point."
"In particular, I think that the Mediterranean deserves adequate financial help."
"The Mediterranean is where the future of a new era founded on harmony, peace and international co-operation is in the balance."
"Mr President, I support the Commission' s revised model of operations, and here it will be put to the test."
"Our problem is that our good decisions get watered down on the way, and the coffers begin to leak."
"This principle of feeding off the burden has to end."
"For that reason, I would like to make three points. Firstly, we do not need two administrative bodies for one agency; secondly, decision-making must be carried out where the work is being done, that is to say at the Kosovo Reconstruction Agency in Kosovo; and thirdly, it is important to work in co-operation with the local people and, more particularly, on a multi-ethnic basis, as has been emphasised here."
"Actually, I could put it this way: reconstruction is not a matter of bricks and mortar, but co-operation."
"It is thus a new time for both the Commission and ourselves."
"Three criteria, directness, an unambiguous approach and transparency, give us strength, and will enable us to succeed."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, a lot has been said about the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"You know that this Parliament has gone to the utmost trouble to find a compromise strategy, and we shall stand by this compromise strategy and are prepared to make our contribution to it."
"I should like to touch upon two questions which do not directly concern reconstruction but which are of special importance for the future not only of Kosovo but also of the entire region."
"About 15 days ago, the UN' s special envoy, Mr Kouchner, introduced a new currency to Kosovo."
"I do understand the need for a stable currency, partly for the benefit of the work being done there. What I do not understand, however, is the penalisation of the dinar, the official currency of the state to which Kosovo still belongs."
"The second resolution contradicts the convictions of us all and also the agreement made between the UN, NATO and the KLA."
"The KLA is not being disarmed, at least not completely. Instead, there are still KLA units, only they now put on different uniforms and will still be armed."
"Have we, as the European Union, an opinion on these resolutions, Mr Vice-President of the Commission and, if so, what is it?"
"Thank you, Mr Sakellariou."
"Vice-President Kinnock will now speak on behalf of the Commission, and I believe that this is his first debate in his capacity as Vice-President."
". Mr President, it is true of course that politics is the only profession in which it is possible to lose your virginity more than once!"
"As a maiden vice-presidential speaker, I am in that position again in my life."
"In response to what has been a very high-quality debate, I am extremely pleased to be joined by my new colleague, the Budget Commissioner, Michaele Schreyer, whose presence is evidence of close interest in this issue and its financial and budgetary implications."
"It is extremely useful that Mrs Schreyer has been here today."
"I would like to thank very much the rapporteurs and members of the various committees who have given such thorough and urgent attention to the crucial issue that is before the House now."
"I would also like to thank them for the quality of their contributions and the commitment they have shown in offering their opinions and submitting the report by Mrs Pack."
"As the House will know, the Commission proposal essentially concerns the setting-up of an agency to implement the Community' s reconstruction programmes, initially in Kosovo but later, when circumstances allow, in other regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia like Serbia and Montenegro."
"Clearly the agency' s mandate does not cover assistance in the other countries of former Yugoslavia or other Balkan countries because this structure is the specific European Union instrument for the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"It is designed to maintain the European Union' s necessary control over the reconstruction programme and to safeguard its independence and right of initiative in the process."
"The agency' s work must be clearly associated with the European Union and not diluted in the broader activities of the numerous bodies that are dealing with Kosovo and the region."
"That is not for any reason of insularity; a clear division of tasks is essential in order to ensure proper accountability."
"The Commission' s proposal reflects the need to set up an instrument for the rapid, decentralised and efficient management of reconstruction aid in a way that takes account of the urgency of the situation and the exceptional efforts that are required."
"Honourable Members repeatedly have drawn attention to those realities in this debate and indeed on many other occasions."
"The Commission' s initiative takes past experience into account and, in particular, the difficulties encountered in the first phase of reconstruction in Bosnia which, as the House has rightly recalled again this morning, led to delays in implementing those programmes."
"The Commission' s proposal to set up a European Agency for reconstruction is largely based on Parliament' s recommendations on reconstruction in Bosnia - recommendations which rightly underline the need to decentralise the management of aid by increasing local staff numbers and to provide for mechanisms that are better adapted to the urgency of the reconstruction requirements."
"I would like to make particular reference to certain aspects of the Commission proposal relating to the agency' s structure."
"Following the request to set up an agency made by the Cologne European Council, the Commission' s proposal is largely based on the model of all other existing European agencies: a structure with its own legal personality and decision-making powers and with the Member States represented on a governing board."
"Such a structure will enable reconstruction to be managed by means of specially adapted procedures which are unlike those used in the Commission' s departments."
"It will enable staff to be recruited specifically for the requirements of reconstruction and for a period of time, as Mr Bourlanges sought, that is limited to the tasks in hand."
"The agency will employ staff in ways that are subject to statutory provisions for carrying out public service tasks which the technical assistance office should not and cannot take on."
"As is the case with all other existing Community agencies, the Commission proposes that Member States be represented on the governing board so that their presence ensures full coordination of the European Union' s activities with those carried out in the field by Member States."
"It could encourage Member States to use the agency to implement their own programmes."
"Furthermore, the participation of Member States in the governing board will make it possible to ensure that once the annual programme is decided by the Commission, all the rest of the decisions related to projects will be taken on the ground without referring back to the management committee composed of Member States in Brussels."
"Regardless of the proposed competences of the agency, I would like to make it quite clear that the Commission will continue to exercise its powers and fully assume its responsibilities."
"The agency will not be empowered to determine policy guidelines or to approve the reconstruction programmes."
"It is the Commission that will take, and will be accountable for, the decisions on the programmes to be carried out by the agency."
"Mr President, the location of the agency' s headquarters, as this morning' s discussions again made evident, has led to some controversy in the Council as well as in this House."
"The function of the agency is to ensure efficiency and speed in the management of aid."
"That involves decentralising management and establishing effective cooperation with other operators from the international community in Kosovo."
"Pristina has, therefore, been chosen by the Commission as the location for the agency' s headquarters."
"That is where the provisional administration of Kosovo is based and all the agencies and organisations responsible for reconstruction in the region are located."
"It is Kosovo that is to be reconstructed."
"Logically, therefore, the agency should have its operational base there, although in arguing for that option, everyone will, I am sure, bear in mind the very persuasive points that Mr Cohn-Bendit made in today's debate about previous experience."
"As the House is aware, the Member States agreed to set up the agency' s headquarters and general services in Thessaloniki."
"The Commission has entered a reservation against this decision."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, the establishment of the agency in Pristina is not a mere detail of its proposal."
"It is a basic requirement for the efficient management for the programmes and the achievement of the agency' s objectives."
"Disputation which causes delay is obviously not acceptable in view of the need to find a rapid solution to the problem and the Commission is therefore open to a compromise which maintains those objectives of speed and effectiveness."
"The Commission has already sent a document to the Council presidency and to Parliament in which it proposes a clear functional division of the agency services and staff between Pristina and Thessaloniki, with all the operational services concentrated in Pristina and the agency' s director based there at its centre of operations."
"Finally, I should like to thank Parliament on behalf of the Commission for its amendments."
"The new Commission will obviously study them closely."
"I emphasise, however, that the Commission and Parliament have the same objective: to maximise the speed and efficiency of the Commission' s efforts on the ground in Kosovo for the people of the region."
"As a new Commission, we would like to take a short time to look at the situation and your amendments, in order to be as sure as we can be that we get things right."
"I am certain that the Council will wish to do the same."
"It is essential to involve the people of Kosovo in the reconstruction process and to ensure effective coordination with non-governmental organisations."
"Budgetary transparency is clearly necessary, as Parliament proposes to draw a clear distinction between the contribution from the Community budget and contributions from other sources and to distinguish between expenditure on physical reconstruction and on institution-building."
"Finally, Mr President, the Commission would be in favour of Parliament being consulted before any decision by the Council on extending the agency' s activities to other regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"That would enhance the role of Parliament, which already receives a quarterly report on the agency' s activities and has the important task of giving discharge to the agency' s director for the implementation of the budget."
"I am sure that full advantage will be taken of the slight pause that it is generally agreed is needed if we are to achieve our objective of a speedy and efficient aid effort for the benefit of and with the assistance of the people of Kosovo."
"Thank you, Mr Kinnock."
"Before closing the debate, I will give the floor to Mr Staes for a procedural motion."
"Mr President, I am a newcomer to this Parliament, as an MEP."
"I have followed this debate with a great deal of interest and I believe it was a good debate."
"But still I have the feeling that there is something wrong with the way in which this Parliament organises its business."
"What are we achieving?"
"The Commission has submitted a proposal concerning the establishment of the Agency headquarters in Pristina."
"The Parliament supports the Commission and there is a conflict with the Council."
"What do we see?"
"The Council' s benches are empty."
"So there is no response from the Council. The Council appears not to have been invited to come here and tell us what it is going to do."
"I would therefore like to ask you the following question: could you please convey my wish to the Conference of Presidents that in future, when debates take place on subjects where there is conflict with the Council, the debate is organised in such a way that the Council attends so that we can enter into direct confrontation."
"I think this would benefit democracy."
"We will take note of your observation, Mr Staes, but I must point out that the Council is represented and has not wished to take part in the debate."
"The Council, at ministerial level, is only represented on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the Plenum, but we take note of your observation."
"I am sure others share your view."
"Mr President, since the Vice-President of the Commission has declined to say anything about the questions relating to the currency and to the KLA, may I proceed on the assumption that the European Union has no opinion on these issues?"
"Neil, Commission. Mr President, I understand the import of Mr Sakellariou' s inquiry and normally I would have been very happy to have given him explicit answers to his two very important questions."
"I am sure he is old enough in this Parliament - I am speaking of his experience of course and not his age - to understand why at this juncture I could not."
"I am certain that my colleagues who are specialists in this area will be pleased to give him the information he seeks on a future occasion."
"Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 p.m."
"10th EC-UNRWA Convention (1999-2001)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0010/99) by Mrs Morgantini, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Co-operation, on the proposal for a Council decision approving the text of a 10th EC-UNRWA Convention covering the years 1999-2001, prior to the signature of the Convention by the Commission and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East [COM(1999)0334 - C5-0059/1999 - 1999/0143(CNS)]"
"Mr President, the era of peace and prosperity, to which Mr Arafat and Israeli leaders have referred to since 1993 following the Oslo Accord, is still not here."
"The revival of the peace process after the fall of Mr Netanyahu' s government, the election of Mr Barak and the new Accord signed in Sharm el-Sheikh undoubtedly mark a step forwards in respect to a dark past, after the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. But there are still difficulties to overcome before stable and lasting peace can be achieved and before the Palestinians can live in a Palestinian State, as sanctioned in the UN Resolutions, that I hope will be democratic and will peacefully co-exist with the Israeli State."
"There are a lot of on-going problems."
"70% of the West Bank and Gaza territory is still occupied by the army, the status of Jerusalem has not been established, there is the question of the Israeli settlements and the confiscation of land and water, more than 2,200 political prisoners are still incarcerated and there is the issue of the Palestinian refugees from the first exodus in 1948 and 1967 who amount to around four million."
"Without a positive response to these problems, peace will always be at risk."
"The European Union and, in particular, the European Parliament have always expressed their unconditional support for the attempts to help the Middle East peace process and to assist the Middle East."
"In the Resolution of March 1999 on the peace process and future aid for the Middle East, the European Parliament stressed with good reason that if the Wye Plantation Accords are confirmed - as they have been - the main problems must still be resolved, including in particular the status of the refugees."
"The Commission voted for the need for a steady and rigorous commitment to the refugees and accepted the tenth EC-UNRWA Convention which refers to 1999-2001. This has been submitted to the European Parliament and represents an important contribution."
"The proposed Convention, like the other nine signed after 1972, sets the EC' s contribution to the budget of the normal programmes of the Agency for the next three years, 1999 - 2001, and provides for annual talks on the EC' s contribution to the food aid budget."
"Naturally, the amount of food aid will be the subject of separate talks."
"UNRWA is asking for an overall contribution of EUR 120.82 million for the period up to 2001."
"Part of this contribution will be used for UNRWA' s educational programmes."
"Within the health programme, the majority will go towards the education programme."
"UNRWA' s regular programme aims to help 3,500,000 Palestinians in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. And as I said before, it provides aid to essential social sectors."
"In order to take into account the development of the political situation in the region, Article 6 of the Convention lays down that, at the end of 2000, developments regarding refugees will be re-examined and possible UNRWA programmes concerning the Palestinian authorities gaining more power over their own affairs will also be evaluated."
"However, since the Palestinian authorities only control their own territory in the West Bank and Gaza, we must pay careful attention to UNRWA' s actions regarding the refugees who are still in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan and in all the countries where Palestinian refugees can be found."
"In these circumstances, I would like to emphasise once again that the refugee question is not only still unresolved but is now becoming worse, as I learnt from my recent visit to the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, from the various UNRWA reports and also from our colleague, Mr Menéndez del Valle, the European Union' s representative for humanitarian aid in Jordan."
"However, it is essential for this EC-UNRWA Convention to be adopted and implemented as soon as possible."
"This is particularly important, especially in view of the current crisis in which we are discussing UNRWA' s budget."
"Austerity measures have been introduced which suppress various appropriations for teachers, hospitals and medical equipment which has provoked, amongst other things, strong protests in the Palestinian refugee camps."
"One last matter - while underlining the need to continue providing humanitarian aid through UNRWA, I think that the European Parliament is particularly interested in finding a fair and balanced political solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. This solution must be in accordance with UN Resolution 194."
"In this respect, I think that the greatest efforts must be made to invite the authorities concerned in the region, especially the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, to contribute to this solution."
"Just two more points: the Committee on Budgetary Control has proposed two amendments on greater transparency, which we subscribe to, and finally, there is a legal question of the way in which our vote is requested by the Commission, and this is something which we will have to examine."
"Mr President, it is a great pleasure to speak on Palestine."
"It is extremely important and it is a subject in which I have been very interested for many years."
"Mrs Morgantini has produced an excellent report which I and my group support and the two amendments are very important because they ask for an annual report and for access to the sites and information on the aspects of the financing."
"I should like to raise a few points."
"One is that we are helping 3.5 million refugees."
"I accept that these are people in refugee camps now and I hope that the European Union will play a very positive role in helping them to rehabilitate once they come across from neighbouring countries into Palestine for resettlement."
"I hope the European Commission will take the initiative, with the close cooperation of Parliament, in being more of an active player in the Middle East and not take a back seat and let the Americans lead."
"When we look at the aid we are giving, EUR 40 million, that is not a lot of money."
"I accept it is quite a large part of the EUR 120 million that are being given and 85% of our budget of about EUR 40 million per annum is for education, which I consider the right way forward."
"We are helping to educate half a million children."
"I hope that this proposal will be acted upon quickly because as Mrs Morgantini pointed out there is urgency, teachers are losing their jobs or not being employed and education and medical help is essential."
"I hope that the Commission will do its best to speed this on."
"Mrs Morgantini has really covered this subject extensively."
"I do not want to waste Parliament' s time and I thank the President for giving me the opportunity to speak on this subject."
"Mr President, this report has been approved unanimously by the Committee on Development and Co-operation, and, wisely, with the two amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, so that, rather than just words, we will actually have an economic and financial plan."
"The report has been prepared by Mrs Morgantini, and concerns the signature by the Commission of a Convention with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees."
"The achievement of a just peace in the Middle East, which we advocate in the Socialist Group, is only possible if, together with the negotiations on the items on the peace agenda in this complex conflict, the problem of the refugees is resolved."
"One of the issues to be dealt with in relation to this problem, which is a necessary one although not the only one, is aid for the refugees, without prejudice to the achievement of a permanent solution within the framework of the peace negotiations which goes further than the therapy of aid."
"The role of the European Union in aid to Palestine is undeniable."
"And, in this respect, the communication of the Commission, which has given rise to this report, simply continues our coherent approach to our contribution to peace by means of the said aid."
"This should not be an obstacle to the European Union' s, and in particular Parliament' s, more direct participation in the peace process."
"The problem of the refugees, together with the status of Jerusalem, the problems of water and the settlers, is one of the key factors relating to peace in the Middle East."
"Every effort should be made if we want to reach a satisfactory agreement on the refugees and thereby bring peace closer."
"Between the extreme positions, which demand the recognition of the right to return, ignoring the real problems which, in reality, would be caused by the mass return of refugees and the uncompromising positions, which do not even accept that the problem exists, there are intermediate options which should be studied, developed and implemented."
"One of these options is this report."
"Although we know it is not a definitive solution, we must approve this report as one more European Union contribution to the difficult peace process in the Middle East."
"Mr President, UNRWA ought really to celebrate its fifty-year anniversary by disbanding itself."
"For five long decades the way back for the Palestinians was closed off and the way forward was blocked too."
"All that time UNRWA was doing extremely useful work under extraordinarily difficult circumstances."
"All the endeavours to bring education and health care up to standard, no matter how valuable in themselves, were still unable to solve the political problem of the refugees."
"UNWRA has suffered a great deal on account of financial problems in recent years."
"Increased costs were not covered by additional revenue."
"Consequently, it had no alternative but to develop illegal secondary economies, much to the discomfiture of the Palestinians."
"Unfortunately there is nothing about the refugees in the Wye agreement."
"The Palestinians now feel desperate, forgotten about and left to their fate."
"Uncertainty about the future, high unemployment and restricted mobility cause tension and fear, which creates a breeding ground for fundamentalism."
"Therefore, giving support to UNWRA as proposed does not just serve humanitarian ends but is also of political importance, i.e. by bringing stability to the region."
"Israel must demonstrate more flexibility in the peace process."
"The Arab host countries, in turn, must take responsibility and stop misusing the Palestinian problem for political ends."
"They must assist in integrating the Palestinians into their country."
"The European Union, in its turn, should provide financial assistance here."
"Up until now, Europe has not known how to convert its financial assistance into political influence."
"It has given the refugees financial assistance for 25 years."
"It is high time for Europe to at last bring its political influence to bear in order to make UNRWA redundant once and for all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 1972 the EC and UNRWA have concluded nine agreements concerning the EC' s contribution to UNRWA."
"The EU is the leading donor of economic and financial aid in this region."
"In this way, we shall, in the future, too, have a considerable responsibility for the Palestinian refugees."
"For the period 1999 to 2001, UNRWA has requested an amount of EUR 120 million."
"The major part of this amount - EUR 102 million - is earmarked for UNRWA' s education programme, and EUR 18 million for the health programme."
"We Greens welcome the fact that the new programme is being discussed promptly by the EU Commission and by the Committees of the European Parliament."
"We ought to be agreeing to its submission to the plenum equally promptly."
"Above all, there should be no reductions in the budget, and discussions about the programme' s legal basis should not further obstruct its submission."
"These problems appear now to have been solved, however, just as the justified criticism by the Court of Auditors of the lack of supervision in implementing the old contracts has been removed."
"Transparency is the basis of our budgeting."
"This must be guaranteed even in urgent cases of humanitarian aid, for all we are in fact doing in the end is passing on taxpayers' money."
"The programme is urgently necessary, for health care and the education programme are basic services."
"The education programme has become UNRWA' s biggest single area of activity."
"445 young people are being educated at school and 6000 are receiving training."
"We also welcome health care based on needs."
"This is provided at local authority level, directly to the people, through a network of 123 health centres."
"The Palestinian refugees are in need of this help, for the refugee situation, which has lasted for years, has serious psychological effects on many people. To these are added many forms of social and economic discrimination."
"Now as before, a political solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees is urgently needed."
"Peace negotiations have finally begun again, but cease-fires and status negotiations are not enough because the Palestinian refugees are still ignored."
"We must offer them prospects for the future."
"The EU can contribute a lot here."
"At present, day-to-day deprivation must however be at least partly reduced by means of this programme."
"Our group is therefore fully endorsing Mrs Morgantini' s report."
"The Palestinian refugees can count on our support and our solidarity."
"Neil, Commission. Mr President, it is my pleasure to comment on the fact that in this short debate we have had three maiden speeches including that of Ms Schröder who, at 21 years of age, is the youngest Member of this Parliament."
"It is evidence of the fact that young people are extremely interested in politics."
"At 21 she is seven years younger than I was when I went to the House of Commons."
"I can only offer the hope that Ms Schröder matures better than I did and I am sure that she will."
"Can I begin by expressing the Commission' s gratitude for the thorough report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation and for the support given throughout the consultation procedure for the Commission' s efforts to conclude the Tenth Convention between the Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees in the Near East."
"In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Morgantini for her work."
"The constructive involvement of Parliament' s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and Committee on Budgets also deserves thanks, and I will in a moment comment on the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets about which Mr Khanbhai spoke."
"Since 1972 the Community has signed nine conventions with UNRWA governing the EC contribution to the organisation' s regular and food aid budgets."
"The tenth triennial convention covers the period 1999 to 2001 and provides for a contribution of EUR 120.82 million to UNRWA' s regular education and health programmes."
"It also allows for the annual negotiation of the contribution to the food aid budget."
"That EUR 120 million includes a 5% annual increase which reflects the operative principle of indexation that takes account of inflation and population growth."
"That arrangement has governed previous European Union contributions under the successive conventions and has been repeatedly praised by the United Nations Agency because it prevents erosion in the value of the Community' s contribution."
"The Commission has made efforts to improve and to clarify the Convention being considered before the House today in order to make its application more transparent and also to take into account the relevant agreed provisions in the European Community-United Nations global arrangement."
"Other innovations in this convention including Article 4 on payments, Article 8 on visibility of the Community' s contribution, Article 9 on arbitration and Article 12 on entry into force, all aim at enhancing transparency and accountability."
"I would like to advise the House that the Commission cannot accept the two amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets for two reasons."
"Firstly, the purpose of the draft Council decision is not to regulate an interinstitutional information request."
"It is to approve the text of the EC-UNRWA Convention and to authorise the Commission to sign it on behalf of the Community."
"Secondly, the obligation to inform is inherent in the Commission' s responsibility to implement the Community budget."
"The annual report submitted by UNRWA will certainly be provided to Parliament as well as to the Council."
"Progress on this issue is now urgent."
"UNRWA is facing a severe cash shortfall and we, as donors, have to do our utmost to accelerate the procedure to help out UNRWA and ultimately the Palestinian people."
"The House will be conscious that, in the context of the Middle East peace process and the Oslo peace accords, the refugee issue was specified for final status talks."
"Under those accords, the parties were supposed to have negotiated the final status issues by 4 May this year but sadly that has not happened."
"Let us hope, however, that the signature of the memorandum in Sharm el-Sheikh will reinvigorate the peace process and ensure that the outstanding issues on final status are tackled without great delay."
"I conclude by saying that until the refugee issue has found a just and comprehensive solution, the Union' s support for UNRWA, as a provider of para-governmental services in the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, to alleviate the very difficult lives of 3.5 million Palestinian people in the refugee camps, is absolutely crucial."
"Far from taking a marginal role, the European Union, and therefore, the European Commission will sustain a strong engagement to ensure that the conditions of those people are significantly improved."
"Thank you, Vice-President Kinnock."
"I believe we are all in agreement with the comments which you have addressed to our new colleague, Mrs Schröder."
"There are two procedural motions: one from Mrs Morgantini, the rapporteur, and then one from Mrs Schröder."
"I offer the floor first to the rapporteur."
"Please be very brief."
"First of all, I apologise to the President for not having stood up sooner, but I did not realise."
"I will not do it again. I certainly do not want to show disrespect to the House."
"However, I am afraid I have made another mistake, by speaking too quickly."
"So I apologise to the people who work so hard for us, the interpreters, because one of my colleagues told me that I was speaking too quickly."
"I was emotional but I think that as I am a woman and emotion and reason go hand in hand, next time I will use reason more."
"However, I would simply like to say that I am extremely pleased with the interventions that my colleagues have made because something has emerged very clearly. Despite the need to carry out this programme quickly, the important point is for the European Union and the European Parliament to play a stronger, more active role so that in the Middle East, stable and lasting peace will come about, especially between Palestine and Israel."
"Do not worry, we are all rather new to this job."
"I also believe that I should have congratulated you on your first report to this Parliament and I forgot."
"Mrs Ilka Schröder has also asked to speak."
"I would like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission for the warm welcome and I understand we are both political people."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 p.m."
"Votes"
"The next item is the vote"
"Report (A5-0009/99) - SAB 1/99, 3/99 and 4/99 by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Fabra Vallés, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft supplementary and amending budgets 1, 3 and 4 to the budget of the European Communities for the 1999 financial year (C5-0021/1999, C5-0074/1999 and C5-0130/1999)"

"(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution)"
"Welcome"
"I have just been informed that Dr. Carlos Roberto Reina, the President of the Central American Parliament, and his wife have arrived in the distinguished visitors' gallery."
"We are delighted that they have been able to join us today and I would ask the House to welcome them to the gallery."
"(Loud applause)"
"Votes (continued)"
"Mr President, given the nature of the question we will be voting on, and hoping that we can count on your consent, I would like to ask you if the vote we are about to hold, could be conducted, if possible, by roll-call."
"I appreciate why you are making this request, but I am afraid the Rules are very strict and I cannot allow it."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0013/99) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(1999) 312 - C5-0062/1999 - 1999/0132(CNS)) amending Regulation (EC) No 1628/1996 relating to aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in particular through the setting-up of the European Agency for Reconstruction"
"Mr President, the Liberal Group would like to withdraw Amendment 32 because it has been replaced."
"I would like to ask for a split vote on Amendments 8, 10, 14 and 18 because that would allow us to vote for more of the amendments that Mrs Pack has put forward."
"In view of the very high quality debate we had this morning, that would be very helpful, but only, of course, if you would allow it."
"I always try to be helpful and I understand that new Members are only just learning the Rules."
"The Rules are very clear about when we can allow a split vote, a separate vote, or a roll call vote."
"There are timetables for all these things which your group secretariat really should advise you of."
"While I would like to help, I am afraid I cannot."
"Mr President, perhaps Mrs van der Laan meant a separate vote for each paragraph and not a split vote."
"That is different to a split vote."
"You are absolutely right but equally we have rules about separate votes and the same ruling applies."
", rapporteur. (DE) Mr President, I have been asked to briefly say something about the vote so that colleagues do not have to be attacked at home for something which is not the case."
"I should like therefore to say what we are voting about. We want no delay in providing aid to Kosovo, but we do want more efficiency."
"The Council has proposed an inefficient procedure, and I would therefore ask it to be understood that we accept the headquarters in Thessaloniki as an operational component of the Reconstruction Agency for the whole of South-East Europe with its headquarters in Thessaloniki, but which must be closely linked with the headquarters of the Stability Pact in Thessaloniki."
"That is an important political point."
"I would ask you all to bear this in mind. It is one of the essential points."
"There are also two further points I must make here. We should like to see a simplification of the administration."
"We should like to see more transparency and more flexibility. In fact, these points are to be found in our amendments."
"We should also like the Council to include us as soon as it extends the work into other regions. We must be made a part of this."
"We should also like there, for the time being, to be a time limit of thirty months on the Agency' s work, for the longer we extend this, the more inefficient it becomes."
"We should set ourselves a limit and try to achieve everything by then."
"Another really important point is that OLAF must be deployed..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"You are long-standing Member of the House and you know that we can take points in relation to the conduct of the vote but not political points."
"And certainly not another round of speeches which you are in danger of starting."
"Before the vote on the draft legislative resolution:"
"I should like to ask my colleagues to give their approval in the light of what I said just now and also in the light of what Commissioner Kinnock said this morning on behalf of the Commission and of what we yesterday learned from the Finns, as holders of the Presidency of the Council, to the effect that there is not at present any room for manoeuvre in order to comply with our amendments."
"In order to give both of them the opportunity to consider matters, to acquire greater insight and then to join ourselves in ensuring greater efficiency, I would ask that the final vote be referred back to the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Mrs Pack - can you just clarify one point because neither I or the Secretariat were clear."
"Do you wish to postpone the final vote or refer the matter back to committee?"
"The two are different - we need to know."
"I was told yesterday that I ought to request that the matter be referred back to the Committee so that we might have the final vote taken at a later date."
"It is not a question of a new debate in this Chamber, but only a question of gaining time."
"Whatever you want to call it, proceed in the way you think right."
"Let me suggest that what you want is to delay the final vote."
"Mr President, we would also recommend that the matter be deferred to the next plenary part-session."
"Therefore, no referring back to the Committee, but deferral of the vote."
"That is what we shall support."
". Discussions are already under way in relation to how the EU budget for the year 2000 will be disbursed."
"Initial budgetary plans which have been forwarded to the European Parliament for its consideration have included within them a recommendation that monies for road safety campaigns in Europe be reduced by £1.5 million (EUR 1.9 million)."
"Per annum, this will mean in practical terms a reduction in the overall annual budget for road safety campaigns from EUR 9.9 million to EUR 8 million."
"This is a truly unacceptable state of affairs."
"It is hard to believe that in the fifteen countries of the European Union as many as 7,500 lives are lost simply because people do not use seatbelts in the front seat and in the back seat."
"Every year in the European Union around 45,000 people die and about 1.6 million are injured as a result of road traffic accidents."
"Ever since the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May this year, the European Parliament has power of codecision in the whole area of transport policy matters."
"Other EU institutions will not be permitted by the European Parliament in the future to recommend in any shape or form a reduction in the budgets available for road safety campaigns."
"On a more national front I welcome the strategy of the Irish Government to reduce road deaths and injuries by 20% before the year 2000."
"The Road Safety Campaign which is being put in place includes the following matters: more speed cameras, more breath tests, a penalty point system, stricter enforcement of seat belt law."
"McKenna report (A4-3/99):"
"Mr President, I do not have to tell you what a beautiful and vulnerable coastline the west of Scotland presents."
"Certainly it is one which is particularly vulnerable and this week we have heard yet further alarming reports of leakages from Sellafield which will damage the coast of Galloway, the Firth of Clyde, Argyle and beyond. It is vital that action of this kind be taken as quickly as possible and I am delighted to have had the opportunity of voting for it today."
"- (FR) Marine pollution, whether accidental or deliberate, is a particularly serious threat to the maritime and coastal zones of the European Union' s Member States."
"We have had in the recent past, several tragic examples of accidental pollution in the form of spillages of hydrocarbons and other dangerous substances, particularly chemical ones."
"The members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group think that in this area of accidental marine pollution, the implementation of a community framework for co-operation is justified on the grounds of genuine common interest."
"The proposal that the Commission has presented to us aims to gather together, within a single legal framework, the various actions carried out to date in this area."
"Regarding the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, we have voted against all of those which invite the European Union' s neighbouring countries to make use of the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes in order to make them contribute financially to the implementation of this Community framework for co-operation."
"Indeed, these three programmes make no provision at the moment for any action in this sector, and it does not seem desirable to be encouraging the dispersion of available means at the expense of priority programmes for the economic development of the European Union' s neighbouring countries which are candidates for accession."
"On the other hand, the members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group have voted in favour of all the other amendments, including amendment 22, which limits the Commission' s right of initiative and which allows the ad hoc committee to have control over its agenda, to produce its own minutes, as well as the declarations of interest of its own members."
"It is essential that we curb the tendency which we have seen in other areas: The Commission does in fact tend to set committees up and then try systematically to take complete control of them, in order to make them totally dependent on their views."
"Any committee set up by the Commission must remain autonomous and independent if it is to play its full role, which is that of providing expert advice."
"Jackson report (A5-2/99):"
"The members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group have voted against all the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which aim to turn the Commission' s recommendation into a directive, for three basic reasons: because of the bureaucracy, because of the legal basis and because of the structure of the inspection bodies in the European Union' s Member States."
"Indeed all members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group are in favour of a Europe which encourages co-ordination between the different Member States, rather than a bureaucratic Europe which advocates a strict adherence to the rules and which does not adapt to geographical and cultural differences."
"In terms of the law, we must point out that Parliament' s role is to conform to existing legal bases and not, by any means, to create new ones which are not in accordance with the Treaties signed by the governments of the various Member States."
"Finally, we would like to remind you that the inspection bodies in the different Member States are, for cultural or historical reasons, different."
"We know that the Federalists' tendency would be to replace the inspection bodies in the Member States with a European super-inspection body, far from the reality at the grassroots level."
"As far as we are concerned, the European inspection body must remain as it is, that is, a body which allows us to see if the inspection bodies of the Member States are applying the Community rules in order, of course, to prevent distortion of competition between the different Member States."
"Community rules must be applied fairly throughout the Union so that all businesses are competing within the framework of the Single Market."
"I shall conclude by saying that the members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group will try to ensure that, throughout this legislature, a bureaucratic and technocratic Europe does not develop any further, but that Europe does develop within a framework which is harmonious and accepted by all the citizens of the European Union' s Member States."
"European Council in Tampere (B5-110 and 116/99):"
"Mr President, the resolution which has just been voted on concerning policies of police and judicial co-operation and the free movement of people in preparation for the forthcoming European Council meeting in Tampere, shows some developments, which appear to be positive, in Parliament' s position."
"For example, I noticed that our House has just rejected the original drafting of paragraph 6 of the resolution which stated that it was impossible to achieve the area of freedom, security and justice if the rule for unanimity in the Council was maintained."
"The rejection of this drafting is therefore a positive thing."
"The question is, though, whether this is a lasting reversal of Parliament' s position, or merely a chance vote. Only the future holds the answer to this question."
"In any case, many of the other rulings in this text are not at all acceptable to us, including the one, for example, which, under the pretext of harmonisation and the implementation of a European immigration policy, lowers our defences instead of raising them."
"For example, paragraph 10 states that the European Parliament ""considers it to be a matter of urgency that the European Union, in order to facilitate the integration of citizens of third countries residing legally in its territory, should tackle the principles which govern the status of these people."""
"It is highly praiseworthy to try to facilitate the integration into Europe of nationals of third countries, but there is also another very serious possibility which should be studied; and that is the voluntary return of these people to their own country."
"Now the European Parliament' s resolution, as if by chance, does not mention this at all."
"The paradox is that we have absolutely no need for European co-operation in order to facilitate the potential integration of nationals of third countries."
"This is really each nation' s job, whereas we would need this kind of co-operation in order to facilitate their return to their own country."
"The Eurocrats in office however, have absolutely no desire for a policy which would control immigration, even if this might one day allow them to prove their worth."
"We Independents always stand up for defending basic rights and therefore also support efforts to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union."
"However, we do not understand this Charter as a step in the direction of a European constitution, which we reject because of the centralising effect this would have."
"Any such Charter must also be designed in such a way that there can be no overlap of powers between the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Labour members of the Socialist Group I wish to inform you that we were unable to vote in favour of the Tampere resolution in its final form."
"This is not because we do not sympathise with many of the things contained therein but we felt that some things were in danger of overloading the agenda of this summit and might cause it to fail."
"There are other issues that were examined in this resolution which should be more properly dealt with in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to revise the Treaties."
"For these reasons we felt unable to support the resolution in its finally amended version."
"We consider that the establishment of an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice is of significance for the European Union' s future, and the Council' s initiative in raising the question at the summit meeting in Tampere is welcome."
"The particular resolution with which the European Parliament is dealing contains a series of important standpoints which Finland, as the country which is at present holding the EU Presidency, together with the European Council as a whole, ought to consider in advance of the summit."
"We therefore lend our support to the major part of the proposals which the resolution contains, but with the odd exception."
"In our view, paragraph 3 deals too generally with the integration into the relevant Pillar of the EU of police co-operation and co-operation in connection with criminal law."
"We think that there is good reason for seeing police co-operation above all as being between the Member States."
"With regard to paragraph 19 about providing Europol with opportunities in the operational sphere, we think that this paragraph is to be interpreted as meaning that any such development of Europol co-operation should be for the purpose of promoting the fight against cross-border crime, but must in that case take place within the framework of the Member States' right to full control over police activity within their own borders."
"The resolution on which the European Parliament has just voted, on drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the Union illustrates perfectly the abuses that, as I said in my intervention yesterday during the main debate, we would be risking."
"In almost every paragraph of its resolution, the European Parliament broadens the interpretation of the decision of the Cologne Council in order to boost its own sense of importance, to marginalise national Parliaments and to prepare for the transformation of the Charter into a European Constitution."
"In paragraph 2, the European Parliament claims that responsibility for the preparation of the Charter will fall jointly to the Council and to itself, whereas all the evidence shows that fundamental rights are protected today by national constitutions, and that any activity relating to them should largely, if not exclusively, involve national parliaments."
"In paragraph 3, the European Parliament calls for an ""open and innovative approach to the Charter' s character, the type of rights it should contain as well as its role and status in the development of the Union' s constitution"" , which clearly demonstrates the desire for it to be more than just a collection of existing laws, as the Council wanted it to be."
"In paragraph 4(1) and 4(2), Parliament requests that the number of its representatives in the ""forum"" who have the task of drafting the Charter, should be equal to the number of representatives of Member States; that is to say, at least fifteen."
"At the same time, it is doing away with the need for national parliaments by suggesting that all that is required is ""the appropriate consultation of the leaders of those Parliaments"" ."
"In paragraph 4(3), 4(4) and 4(6), Parliament requests that the future forum should itself determine the competences of its office as well as the organisation of its working parties and secretariat, which would give it a very large degree of independence and which would enable it to take the process in the direction it sees fit."
"In paragraph 4(5), Parliament insists that there be ""contributions from NGOs and from the citizens"" ."
"We know what that means: the entry into the debate of people or organisations who have no democratic legitimacy, chosen according to obscure criteria and often heavily subsidised by the European Commission."
"This will guarantee a mess from which, bearing previous occurrences in mind, the only people likely to benefit are the Federalists."
"This is a perfect example of the start of one of these exercises in manipulating public opinion, which the Federalists have always been so fond of."
"The most astonishing aspect of this manipulation is the attitude of the Council: throughout the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, it had staunchly resisted the grouping together of all the citizens rights scattered throughout the text in any form distinct from the Treaty itself."
"It won the argument at that time."
"Of its own accord, and without consulting anyone, it has suddenly accepted something much worse; the setting in motion of a much broader process of dispossessing national Constitutions."
"We shall staunchly oppose this anti-democratic manoeuvre."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have declined to vote for a motion for a resolution concerning further integration in the fields of freedom, security and justice."
"We believe in just and efficient European co-operation in connection with asylum and immigration."
"We are also believers in improved co-operation to prevent criminal activity in areas such as the trade in human beings, offences against children and money laundering."
"The motion for a resolution includes a desire to transfer police co-operation from the third to the First Pillar, a wish to give Europol operational powers and a plea to set up a common European prosecution service (Corpus Juris)."
"We have voted against giving Europol operational powers because we don' t want it developing into a European answer to the FBI."
"We have also voted against establishing a common European prosecution service."
"We are not in favour of a common European criminal law or authority."
"Criminal activity can be combated just as effectively with the existing instruments, including Europol, and the conventions relating to extradition and to the assistance to be given by one State to another in the administration of justice."
"We have declined to vote for transferring political co-operation from the Third to the First Pillar."
"As long as the Danish reserve in the legal sphere still stands, we are in a special situation."
"We respect the fact that the other Member States wish to transfer co-operation to the First Pillar, but we cannot vote in favour of this as long as Denmark has a reserve in the legal sphere."
"For the reasons stated above, we have declined to vote for the whole motion for a resolution."
"Nor, moreover, can we support the desire that the Tampere Summit should be the starting signal for a new Intergovernmental Conference concerning further integration in the area of law."
"At the next Intergovernmental Conference, it is the institutional changes which need to be concentrated upon. Otherwise, we risk delaying the enlargement process."
"I am voting against the positions and the priorities proposed by the European Commission at the Tampere European Council concerning rights and freedoms."
"The simple fact that it does not envisage regularisation of all people living and working on European soil without proper papers should explain why I have voted this way."
"Designating Europe an ""area of freedom, security and justice"" shows a certain amount of cynicism."
"We do not ask about the background of capital in order to allow it freedom of movement and freedom of investment throughout the European Union."
"The free movement of people though is regulated, limited or banned according to their national and, above all, social background."
"Multinational companies are free to form groups, but the families of immigrant workers are not."
"Complete freedom is granted in cases where it damages employment and society, but it is withheld however when it concerns the most basic sense of humanity."
"The European Charter of Fundamental Rights which the Tampere Summit is supposed to work on will be nothing more than a collection of empty words if it does not at least contain complete freedom of movement, and the individual' s freedom to settle where he wants for all those living and working in the European Union, whatever their original nationality, as well as complete equality of rights, including the right to vote."
"- (EL) The increased Community action in areas of justice and home affairs is a major cause for concern for European citizens."
"It is a direct attempt to fortify strongholds and to tighten control and monitoring mechanisms with a view to exercising command over the citizens and to monitoring their activities effectively as opposed to promoting citizens' rights."
"Of particular concern is the sphere of immigration and asylum where there is a growing trend towards the creation of a fortress-Europe."
"We should show more concern over the attempts both to divert from and replace the Geneva Convention, which is the main source of international law governing refugees, and to implement a ""temporary protection regime"" . We should also be particularly concerned about deliberations to amend the Dublin Asylum Convention, to enforce stricter legislation on the procedure for processing asylum applications and to implement ""effectively"" the removal procedures for those whose residency applications have been rejected."
"The increase in the wave of refugees cannot be dealt with by enforcing repressive measures, but by implementing an international policy which will reduce tensions and will contribute to peaceful political settlement of all differences, and will not resort, as in Kosovo, to criminal military intervention measures."
"It must be dealt with by conducting an international economic and commercial policy which will support economic development of third countries and will contribute to the welfare of the population."
"The proposals regarding the widening of police and judicial powers of intervention in criminal cases, as well as the various proposals concerning the creation of a special European judicial area, constitute the cloak under which Europol can strengthen and widen its operational powers and under which repressive national principles can be formulated, thereby seriously jeopardising fundamental democratic rights and freedoms."
"Widening activities in the exchange of information, filing and processing this information, either within the framework of Europol or directly among Member States, will not only increase the dangers of uncontrolled use of those files but will also legitimise all activities relating to surveillance and placing on file under the pretext of crime prevention."
"In this connection, the creation of ""European Public Order"" based on the Schengen principles would inevitably constitute an undemocratic arsenal which, at any given moment, could be used against political and trade unionist action, to prevent working people from reacting to any unpopular policies of the EU and of the Member States."
"When the underlying philosophy of the proposals in question centres around the meaning of ""law-abiding citizens"" and the need to ""make those who 'threaten the freedom and security of the individual and of society' accountable for their actions"" , we cannot but detect a certain re-emergence of those principles which, in countries like ours, once formed the basis of anti-democratic laws and restrictions and the basis for the penalisation of all political and trade unionist activities."
"It is obvious that under the cloak of the fight against organised crime and certain other types of unlawful punishable behaviour, we are attempting not only to control developments at policy level in the long-term, but also to introduce tougher enforcement procedures for law and order."
"It is no coincidence that, for matters concerning justice and home affairs, the issues of public order and security fall outside the already limited competence of the European Court of Justice."
"Similar difficulties exist for parliamentary control which means that action by the police and secret services and public security standards will remain all the more uncontrolled."
"Increasing co-operation in civil and criminal cases demands total respect for traditions of international civil and criminal law, total respect for democratic rights, and the safeguarding of traditional principles of fundamental and procedural law."
"It is evident that not only must we disagree with but we must also condemn such developments."
"For their sake, working people should not only show opposition to the plans being advocated, but should also expose the hypocrisy of the EU and of the Member States and fight to avert such dangers to the development of their freedoms."
"- (SV) The Area of Freedom, Security and Justice is of significance for the EU' s future."
"The particular resolution with which the European Parliament is dealing contains important standpoints which Finland, as the country currently holding the EU Presidency, together with the European Council, ought to consider in advance of the summit."
"In the main, I support the motion for a resolution, but with a number of important exceptions."
"I think that comprehensive co-operation at European level in the fight against crime is important."
"I do not, however, support the idea of a federal Europe and do not therefore want to contribute to changes in the direction of qualified majority voting within significant areas."
"I think that co-operation in the fields of police work and criminal law ought, in the future too, to be between Member States."
"Paragraph 3 is too general and far-reaching."
"I am therefore voting ""no"" to this paragraph."
"The same applies to paragraph 19 which is about giving Europol the ability to act in various ways at operational level."
"Paragraph 6 deals with qualified majority voting but is too unclear, especially paragraph 6 c, for me to be able to support it."
"Certain parts of paragraph 21 are too far-reaching, especially 21(b) and 21(d)."
"That concludes the vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.46 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Financial crisis in Russia"
"The next item is the Commission' s statement on the financial crisis in Russia."
"Mr Kinnock, speaking on behalf of the Commission, will be the first to take the floor."
"Neil Commission. Mr President, with your permission, I would like to make a Commission statement on the effects of the financial crisis in Russia and on matters relating to corruption and money laundering."
"As the House will know, some stability has been achieved in the general financial situation in Russia since the dramatic fall in the international exchange value of the rouble in August last year."
"Indeed, since the beginning of this year, there has been some encouraging news with the recovery in industrial output, mainly as the result of import substitution, relatively tight controls on inflation and a stronger balance of payments position, produced mainly by a sharp rise in the price of Russia' s oil exports."
"In addition, at the end of July, agreement was reached with the IMF, and other financial institutions, on the resumption of direct loan assistance, and soon afterwards there was an agreement in the Paris Club on rescheduling debt service payments due on Russia' s sovereign debt."
"Talks are now under way in the London club of private-sector creditors."
"The Russian economy has consequently gained a breathing space in the run-up to the duma elections in December and the presidential elections next summer."
"However, by itself, none of this is enough to revive an economy which remains very fragile with rising unemployment and levels of poverty."
"Much more effort is therefore needed from the responsible authorities to promote sustained recovery over the medium-term."
"Adoption by the duma of the budget proposed by the government for the year 2000 will be a significant test."
"In addition to severe structural problems like lack of investment, the public debt, particularly foreign debt, has grown rapidly and at present it is not clear how the authorities intend to service that debt burden."
"With reference to the more specific issues of the flight of capital and money-laundering, I would like to say the following."
"The Commission is aware of the current media speculation and the growing worries about the misuse of international assistance funds provided to Russia."
"Clearly we must await the outcome of ongoing investigations in Europe and the United States of America, and the Commission is naturally following the matter closely."
"In the meantime, the decision about a response to the speculations and the allegations about misuse of assistance funds is primarily a matter for the IMF, the World Bank and the G7 countries, since they are obviously the main suppliers of direct financial assistance."
"Everyone should of course be mindful of the fact that the Russian authorities are responsible for repaying the principal and the interest due on such assistance."
"Moreover, the latest IMF assistance will be cancelled out by debt-servicing payments due to the IMF by Russia."
"It will therefore be a book transaction without any substantial transfer of money."
"Meanwhile Community assistance is, as this House will know, primarily delivered through the TACIS programme which is centrally managed from Brussels."
"The funds concerned are predominantly used to pay EU firms to provide technical expertise and advice for Russia."
"Only a very small proportion of the funds therefore goes to Russia."
"Indeed it is only EUR 4 million out of the total of EUR 140 million."
"That EUR 4 million is obviously directly managed by our representation in Moscow."
"In addition the Community food supply programme for Russia, that was launched earlier this year, is subject to very close monitoring which involves, amongst other things, checks on the use of the funds generated by the sale of relevant food products on local markets."
"Moreover, Russia does not currently receive Community loans, and the lending mandate of the European Investment Bank for countries outside the European Union does not extend to Russia."
"However, the issues which deserve close attention are not confined to alleged misuse of international funds."
"They extend, in the Commission' s view, to the massive outflow of capital from Russia which has in turn obviously contributed to the low level of internal investment and therefore impeded economic growth."
"The Commission has always made it clear to Russia that reversing capital flight urgently and fundamentally requires a more appropriate investment environment and better protection of investor rights in Russia."
"For some time, the Commission has recognised the link between capital flight and corruption and criminality in Russia and we also understand the cumulative threat these conditions pose to the country' s transition to a democratic system and a market economy governed by the rule of law."
"The House will be aware that criminal activity thrives on institutional weaknesses and the fragility of efforts to consolidate the rule of law."
"That is why the Commission has made, and will continue to make, useful efforts to assist Russia in its arduous transition by actions like targeting technical assistance at combating money-laundering and organised crime and supporting efforts to advance the rule of law in general."
"One example of such activities is a study into Russian institutional and regulatory requirements in combating money-laundering that will be launched later this year."
"There is also growing cooperation between the relevant Commission and Russian officials in customs and anti-fraud activities."
"The House will be only too aware of the sophisticated skills of international criminals in taking advantage of different legal and regulatory provisions across the globe and infiltrating economic and financial systems regardless of national frontiers."
"We are therefore faced with a worldwide problem that is not confined to Russia."
"Obviously combating it requires closely coordinated international responses and the Commission is ready to play its full part in that."
"Russia must nevertheless take whatever action it can to put its own house in order."
"The Commission therefore hopes that the Russian authorities will respond to the present situation in a convincing way and it is vital that those authorities cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations in Europe and in the USA."
"The Commission notes with approval that the authorities have decided to send a high-level mission to the USA to liaise with investigators there, I think that is actually happening at the present time."
"Clearly the internal investigations in Russia into these fraud allegations should be actively encouraged."
"The Commission is concerned, however, that the questions raised have been met by only routine denials and have not been properly addressed in Russia."
"Against that background, timely action by President Yeltsin in signing into law the Russian draft legislation on money laundering would be reassuring to the international community."
"Ratification and implementation of the relevant Council of Europe Convention is also essential."
"In addition, the Commission would like to see a speedy resolution of the problems in the Russian banking system, which is obviously at the centre of concerns about corruption."
"Confidence in that system needs to be restored quickly and decisively as a major contribution to the achievement of something like normality."
"Mr President, I do not want to interrupt the debate, but since this debate and statement by Commissioner Kinnock are due to an urgent request by a number of Groups, I should like to ask you also to pass on to the Conference of Presidents the wish that these Groups might therefore ensure that at least a minimum of Members of Parliament is present."
"I find it shameful, in fact, that a statement on an important question is being made here and yet so few Members of Parliament are present."
"I must admit it would have been nice to have seen more people here today."
"I shall see to it that your request is conveyed to the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, can I associate myself with Mr Swoboda' s remarks."
"I had not intended to speak in this debate but I have listened to a very carefully prepared statement from the Commission and I thank Mr Kinnock for that."
"It correctly sums up what I believe is a very dangerous situation developing in Russia."
"What we need at the moment is stability and further investment to allow Russia to develop."
"What is happening is the exact opposite."
"I was in Moscow last November with a group from this Parliament which had gone there to evaluate the need for humanitarian aid, and it became obvious that the country is just not able to put itself in order."
"We as a European Union really do need to take some political initiative to try to help the Russians get their economy back on track."
"The Central and Eastern European countries that were former members of the Soviet bloc have been able to pull themselves together, and improve their economies and their peoples' standards of living."
"This was because we put ownership and the laws of property ownership high on the agenda."
"That is not the case in Russia and the difficulty there, I believe, arises because no one has the responsibility to own anything and therefore take control of their own economy."
"I hope we can therefore take some sort of political initiative to try to make sure that country puts its basic law into proper order."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we perhaps have to remind ourselves that much has happened in Russia: over 5 000 nuclear warheads have been withdrawn from use, democratic institutions have been created, and the media there may criticise the government, and, in fact, dare to."
"It is true the media is more and more passing into the hands of the few, the very people who, as the previous speaker reminded us, have acquired common property for themselves."
"At the same time, however, we must remember that Russia' s leaders are primarily and directly responsible to their own people, the Russians themselves."
"I would like to raise the issue of this ruthless campaign of terror and bombing - the most recent explosion took place yesterday evening."
"The intention of this action is to create instability in the whole area, for the whole vast region, and it is happening at a very awkward time."
"Russia has two elections in the near future, the situation is very tense, the country has a sick president, and the whole economy is in difficulties."
"We must condemn, as we are now doing, those states that are aiding the terrorists in their aim to create new instability in a region where there is enough of it as it is."
"We should not speak of a financial crisis in Russia, however."
"Russia has a political crisis, and that has continued since the country changed direction."
"We can certainly see the reasons for this political crisis, but the situation will not be remedied with money, however much of it you heap on Russia."
"We have seen how things go with money: they go fairly badly."
"With regard to the West, I would really like to bring up another issue."
"We still have no clear policy on Russia, although we have a bulky agreement on partnership and co-operation."
"We have practised collaboration in many ways and we support democracy and civil society in Russia, but, for all that, we do not understand Russia."
"One reason for that is, in practice, we do not know the Russian politicians very well."
"We have concentrated on one person, or one body of people, in fact, on one narrow group of people in power."
"As a consequence, what happens in Russia always takes us by surprise."
"We should therefore broaden the scope of our political contact with Russia, and, this would help us to understand the changes that take place there so unexpectedly."
"We know that our financial aid and food aid have pretty much slipped into the hands of those for whom it was not intended."
"It is the Russian elite that are guilty of this, a group we have had no hold on."
"I think we should discover how, for example, the competition for transporting food aid granted to Russia by Europe was organised."
"I perceived problems there, and I would ask the Commission to give an explanation of this affair."
"In this situation, however, it is necessary to increase co-operation with Russia, and not terminate it."
"The Northern Dimension, medical care, the Nordic regions, etc, will all be important. Now Russia needs from us very concrete proposals on co-operation, and that is why I regard the aspect of the Northern Dimension as so important, and I hope the Commission will act."
"Mr President, this time we are discussing Russia' s financial crisis."
"It is just one of those serious inter-related problems, or crises, Russia is struggling against at the same time."
"These problems have one sole cause: the political crisis."
"In this I am in full agreement with the view of Mr Paasilinna."
"Since the collapse of the socialist system, Russia has had no viable political system."
"The parliamentary elections organised for the end of this year and the presidential elections next year may create a basis for solving the political crisis; at least we must hope they will."
"The international community must be patient with Russia."
"As the political system and the main social institutions do not function properly, some of the aid to the country is getting wasted."
"Aid and assistance to Russia must, however, continue, but we have to learn from experience so that the operation may be as successful as possible."
"The European Union must strive to ensure in particular that Russia can develop a workable democratic system for itself, with viable social and economic institutions."
"To assist the operation it would be of value to establish regionally and locally based contact and co-operation between the countries of the EU and Russia."
"This would provide, on a massive scale, a context for providing Russia with the social and economic know-how the country badly needs."
"There are particularly favourable opportunities for this in border areas between the EU and Russia, as the bilateral agreement on co-operation in neighbouring areas made between Finland and Russia at the start of the 1990s shows."
"Unfortunately, there have been difficulties in communication between the European Parliament and the Duma."
"The meeting of the parliamentary Committee on Development and Co-operation planned for this autumn has been postponed."
"We must hope that it will be organised again as soon as possible."
"The Committee on Development and Co-operation has grown, and it has many new members from our group."
"For this reason, we should make our work more effective to increase, for example, the knowledge our members have of Russia."
"It might still be appropriate to hold a seminar this autumn, one in which we could acquire more expert knowledge on economic and social conditions in Russia."
"In addition, we need a monitoring committee to help members to keep their knowledge of Russia continuously up to date."
"Mr President, in my opinion, the Commission' s report was well-informed and valid, and I believe that the Commission will attend to the issue of the economic crisis in Russia and matters generally connected with Russian relations."
"Mr President, the news that we are seeing at the moment alleging misconduct by the Russian Central Bank comes as very little surprise to many of us."
"It has long been evident that the large sums of money provided to prop up the national level of the Russian economy have not produced the desired effect and that the top-down approach might have appeared simple, but it can be less efficient in the long term."
"We are aware that the gap between rich and poor has become a chasm, that the people of Russia are losing faith in the ideal of democracy and that the infrastructure is crumbling and workers are not paid."
"The West might have done better to have paid the teachers, doctors and miners directly, perhaps."
"If we are to invest further in the Russian economy we have to find the means to support and develop local economic activity - as our colleague has just said - which meets people' s needs and provides a sense of stability and involvement."
"There are many examples of that being developed in areas of social exclusion in the world' s poorer countries at the moment, from which we can learn."
"The emphasis on money laundering and crime is only part of the issue."
"We need to look at how to develop internal investment."
"The example from the West is that you bring in other people to do the investing and they take the cash with them."
"So perhaps we would do well in this House to look at how we talk about issues such as the repatriation of profit to countries producing it, rather than simply extracting the cash as well as the natural resources."
"Mr President, the European Commission has now woken up to the fact that the aid and assistance granted to Russia is being abused."
"However, it has been abused for ten years now, and this is how the basic structures of Russian society have been destroyed."
"Aid has been both used wrongly and granted wrongly."
"We in the European Union have granted it in the wrong way."
"Corruption is a fine word for what has happened."
"The whole of the upper stratum of society is party to this corruption."
"In this we cannot trust the president, his family, the government ministers, or even the central bank."
"It is unbelievable that the central bank has recycled the aid granted it by the IMF through companies that merely exist on paper on the tax evaders' isle of Jersey."
"We just speak of corruption, but we do not say directly that this is a matter of criminal activity."
"The reason for this criminal activity has also been the aid granted by the West."
"The West has given aid for the wrong reasons."
"A typical example is the relief aid granted to Russia last winter in the form of food aid."
"It was meant to help Russia to escape a winter of starvation and survive the sub-zero temperatures at the beginning of the year."
"But this aid has not yet reached its destination."
"We gave Russia relief aid in the form of food to cover the time of the winter frosts, and that food is still on its way to Russia."
"That food is being sold in Russian shops, and thus the price of Russian agricultural produce and food is being caused to tumble, and farmers' hopes of practising their own food production are being dashed."
"Above all, we must say, from the point of view of the taxpayers in the EU, that if we wanted to give Russia' s social sector aid equal to the cost of a pension we should have given it money, not food."
"Food aid was an agricultural policy, which cost us taxpayers a lot more than if a corresponding amount of social aid had been given in the form of money."
"With this in mind, the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament should look in the mirror and recognise their own mistakes."
"Aid has been used wrongly, but it has definitely been given wrongly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when we are declaring that, together with the new Commission, we must give a central role to the European Parliament, it is only natural that we should consider relaunching Parliament' s foreign policy at the same time."
"The crisis in Russia gives us that opportunity."
"Indeed, at a time when the international community and the world press are emphasising the importance of the scandal taking place in Russia, we must take the initiatives necessary for understanding the gravity of this scandal, the explanations of the Russian Government regarding these accusations and our position with regard to the Community' s financial aid for Russia."
"Of course, Commissioner Kinnock' s report is studied and significant, but above all we need to consider the political aspect of what is happening in Russia at the moment. In the near future, all this could destabilise international politics and also the Community' s trade relations with Russia itself, not to mention the serious consequences for the Community' s entrepreneurs who have invested in this country."
"We must remember that the current scandals are rocking the Russian Nomenclature and institutional representatives."
"Moreover, the United States decided in Congress to launch an inquiry to ascertain the use of money given as financial aid to Russia and whether it has been used instead in an illegal way."
"Having said this, the Community' s Institutions must, in my opinion, ask the competent Russian authorities to clarify how funds intended for the development of the country and for its food crisis were used."
"The services of the Commission, which oversaw the aid to Russia, are drawing up a report on the way the funds were used."
"In short, they are requesting a committee of inquiry, made up of the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, the EIB and the EBRD which will verify how much aid was sent to Russia, which funds were used and if it was spent in the planned way."
"Take the TACIS programme for example. Just yesterday, President Prodi referred to the concept of transparency in his Commission and at the same time, co-operation with the European Parliament."
"If this is the first commitment, we must immediately clarify our relations with Russia and clarify the bilateral relations between the Community and the Russian Government."
"If we do all this, we will give our institution political significance and we will regain credibility in the eyes of the world."
"Mr President, there continues to be one financial scandal after another in Russia."
"For example, today's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that last summer the Central Bank of Russia sold as much as USD 3.9 billion of an IMF credit destined for Moscow and USD 4.8 billion in total directly to Russian private banks."
"In so doing, it withdrew a huge quantity of roubles from the country' s public monetary dealings."
"And what is worse, those USD 3.9 billion of IMF money did not even go directly to Russia but were ultimately transferred through accounts in the United States."
"The man behind this revelation is Skuratov, the Public Prosecutor, whom Yeltsin relieved of his office."
"Two salient comments are in order as regards this accusation."
"Firstly, Skuratov has only exposed a very small part of a practice which has been going on for years, and certainly at least since 1990, that is the systematic manipulation of international credits by the Central Bank of Russia."
"Secondly, the International Monetary Fund and the American government, too, were informed about this abuse early on."
"Yet they took no action, under the pretext of the spurious, hence costly slogan: ""Corruption is better than Communism"" ."
"The fraudulent draining away of financial assistance provided by foreign countries, a Russian capital flight over the last ten years amounting to an estimated USD 150 to 300 billion, and a Russian economy which has largely slid back into a barter economy all make it difficult for us to gain a proper idea of the scale of the financial crisis in the Russian Federation."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, it should always be the case that only real Russian projects which have been approved by independent experts should be considered for financial assistance, and only then on condition that careful follow-up supervision is undertaken on an annual basis."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Commissioner Kinnock on his second term of office, which I am sure will be even more distinguished than his first."
"In relation to this particular problem, while we must not underestimate the damage that crime and organised crime can do to Western society. It is important where Russia is concerned that we try to get beyond the headlines."
"After all, to be blunt, crime is a fairly normal occurrence throughout the history of Russia."
"There is nothing new about it."
"We must not forget that Russia is potentially an extremely rich country."
"It has huge natural resources from gold to oil to agricultural land, and yet production has gone down 50% since 1989."
"The key problem is capital flight, whether it is legal capital flight or illegal capital flight."
"After all, the money which stays in Russia, even if it is on the black market, has an economic effect."
"Capital outflow is now about USD 25 billion a year and yet foreign investment is less than USD 3 billion and falling."
"To be quite honest, if the Russians are not prepared to invest in Russia what chance is there that anybody else will do so?"
"We must not lose sight of the fact that any public money we can give is a mere drop in the ocean."
"The key to Russia' s salvation is private investment."
"It is that area that we ought to focus on."
"The answer lies within Russia itself."
"It has to implement proper economic reforms."
"We have to have a viable and fair taxation system."
"We have to guarantee modern democratic law and law enforcement."
"Industrialists have made it clear to us - for example, in the EU/Russia industrialist round table - that they want to invest in Russia."
"After all, given the potential, there is a killing to be made in Russia with the right investment at the right time."
"But repeatedly they all say the same thing: it is corruption that discourages them, investment conditions are very poor because there is no viable long-term tax system, laws are constantly changing , the infrastructure is poor and, most importantly, property rights, including intellectual property rights, are weak and confused."
"Those are the areas we have to focus on."
"I recognise that in the current atmosphere it is difficult to justify EU technical assistance but we must continue that process because of the importance Russia has for us for security reasons as well as economic reasons."
"I am glad to hear what Commissioner Kinnock says because it is important that we focus on a few areas: not only economic improvement but clearly, what we also have to aim at, improvements to civil society which will underpin economic reform and the social aspects."
"I would therefore like the new Commission - and I ask Commissioner Kinnock now - to make an overall evaluation of the efficiency of the TACIS programme and then to report back on how they will improve the programme for the year 2000 budget so we can have greater confidence when we vote in support of the TACIS programme."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Kinnock on his new post."
"I hope for worthwhile and constructive dialogue with him over the next few years."
"As far as I am concerned, two basic questions arise from what Mr Titley has said."
"Russia, as we know, is suffering not only from financial crisis, but also, and above all, from the erosion of basic democratic mechanisms such as transparency, public supervision of the administration and an independent judiciary."
"In a situation like that, how can the difficult process of social transformation take place at all?"
"This is just what I have already been saying - our problem is that, in our action programme, we are setting false priorities for Russia."
"The democratic bases of the market economy must be operating before we can create a free trade area."
"On the other hand, it is evident that banks in the West have also been weak enough to permit money laundering and the mismanagement of money at an international level."
"How can it have been possible for the destination of international credits not to have been understood?"
"How is it that money laundering on such a large scale is possible at all in the West?"
"These questions are also waiting to be answered."
"Thank you to the Commissioner."
"The debate on this agenda item is hereby closed."
"Topical and Urgent Debate"
"The next item on the agenda is the debate on topical and urgent subjects."
"Earthquakes in Turkey and Greece"
"Mr President, the earthquake that struck Turkey in the early hours of 17 August was the worst in over half a century in a region that is prone to such shocks."
"There were at least 40,000 casualties and we extend our deepest sympathy and the hand of support to Turkey at this tragic time."
"The European Union has responded to the disaster with some EUR 45 million of emergency humanitarian aid in addition to bilateral aid from a number of our Member States."
"We must insist on urgent implementation of this Community assistance."
"The immediate need is for practical material assistance such as prefabricated housing, generators and specialist vehicles and equipment. The release of a further EUR 150 million in European Union aid will require the support of this House."
"In due course, given the fact that the European Union is a major contributor of humanitarian relief, it would be most useful for the Commission services and ECHO in particular to explore possibilities for improving the effectiveness of relief organisation in disaster situations."
"In addition, the Commission' s joint research centre should examine ways in which more effective warning might be given of seismic activity."
"However, we do not feel there is justification at this stage for the creation of some sort of new European research institute for this purpose."
"Mr President, amid the tragedy there is one encouraging sign."
"What was also buried in Izmit was some of the enmity between Greece and Turkey."
"Greek rescue teams were among the first to provide assistance in Turkey, a very positive and humane gesture that was reciprocated by Turkey when not long after Athens too fell victim to earthquakes."
"There have been many, other often low-level, gestures of rapprochement between Greek and Turkish people in recent weeks."
"Many of us wish to see progress in the resolution of the various issues which stood in the way of Turkey' s candidacy for the European Union."
"This requires generosity and flexibility on all sides."
"Out of the tragedy of Izmit let us hope for positive and permanent improvements in the relationship between the European Union and Turkey."
"Mr President, I would like to express here the sympathy and consternation of our group in the face of the earthquakes in Turkey and Greece."
"It is an irony of history that the earthquake in Turkey and the earthquake in Greece have brought these two countries closer together at last."
"I will not say reunited as yet, but certainly brought closer."
"It is indeed a rare coincidence that legal proceedings, whose fairness and rectitude I am not one hundred percent convinced of, and a conviction, of which, for fundamental reasons, I am even less convinced, specifically the death sentence against Mr Öçalan, have led to the development of an opportunity to bring a dreadful civil war in Turkey to an end."
"Sometimes this is the case in history; tragic events can set positive developments in motion."
"Therefore, instead of going into details, I would like to basically welcome the fact, firstly, that relations between Greece and Turkey have improved even regardless of the dreadful events, because both Foreign Ministers are prepared to speak to each other."
"I am very pleased to see that many European countries reacted so positively and made aid available immediately when the dreadful events occurred, and the European Union, furthermore, is considering, as a result, how a new beginning in the relationship between the European Union and Turkey can be achieved."
"In recent days I have spoken with some Turkish Members of Parliament, who also clearly expressed their desire for this new beginning."
"There have been a series of changes, new laws in Turkey."
"So it could be that, because of the awful events and a certain rethinking and reconsideration within Turkey, a new beginning will be possible in the next few months in the relationship between Turkey and the European Union, with the help of Greece."
"In all these steps together with, and with regard to, Turkey it is important to proceed in partnership with our Member State of Greece."
"The Foreign Minister, Mr Papandreou, has just established the prerequisites for us to enter into this new partnership with Turkey."
"It will be a long and laborious path."
"But for once it could be written in the history books that these terrible disasters in both these countries were the beginning of a new relationship, even a new political relationship, and possibly even a new economic relationship."
"Personally I shall also strive, as the former rapporteur on Turkish matters in this House, to achieve these new relationships between Turkey and the European Union."
"Turkey is an important strategic partner, but Turkey must also know that it must carry out appropriate changes in its law in order to achieve the prerequisites for clearing the obstacles to its free entry into Europe."
"Entry into Europe is conditional upon legality and respect for human rights."
"That is the only possibility."
"With this in mind, my group will attentively follow the latest endeavours of Commission and Council and will consider them positively, but critically."
"Mr President, the earthquake in Turkey is clearly one of the most dreadful disasters of this century."
"Nothing further need be said about the number of victims."
"We also know that in Turkey in the near future there will be tens of thousands of homeless people who must continue their lives in the earthquake region for years without prospects."
"In these conditions it is naturally very important to reflect more intensely on how we could more preventatively approach this situation regarding earthquakes and Turkey."
"It can never be early enough to initiate fundamental thinking on the earthquake and its consequences."
"There is urgent need for international dialogue on this Turkish disaster to determine the best course for the reconstruction of the country."
"This dialogue could begin between the European Union and Turkey."
"I support what Mr Swoboda said just now, but given the situation we currently have in Turkey, i.e. the willingness to use its relationships with European partners, we should first - in today' s motion for a resolution - speak about aid for Turkey in a much more concrete manner, and show our Turkish friends that we are there for them if they need our assistance, and also convey the impression to them that, they will not be seen by us in a sweeping way as adversaries, as was so often the case before the earthquake in Turkey."
"The proposal of my Group would be that now, in addition to considering how we can best help Turkey in its reconstruction, we must also give additional thought to how we can offer Turkey some prospects for the future."
"While engaging in these reflections, we should also deal with Turkey much more openly and clearly show that, as far as the prospects of EU accession are concerned, we would be genuinely willing to accept Turkey as the thirteenth applicant country, should Turkey approach us."
"We will have enough opportunities to take advantage of this in the next three months."
"Mr President, we all sympathise with Turkey after the traumatic experience it has been through."
"We must, however, strive to see that out of this trauma comes something of a catharsis, so that civil society is reinforced by its great efforts to cope with the aftermath of the earthquake crisis."
"The Turkish Government should be made far more accountable to the needs of the citizen, and the forces of reform such as Mr Selçuk, President of the Court of Appeal, and his colleagues must be everywhere stimulated and supported."
"Such a cathartic effect would certainly allow us in the European Union to formulate a fresh approach to our relations with Turkey and to develop a more positive collaboration in a spirit of true solidarity, and Greece must show itself to be a willing partner in this project."
"Mr President, it appears that Enceladus is furious with Greece and Turkey and, being his inept self when it comes to dialogue and bargaining, he flew into a fit of catastrophic rage, scattering death, sorrow, pain, desperation and havoc around the two countries."
"The catastrophic bible-like scenes in Turkey stretch over some 60,000 square kilometres, almost the size of Belgium and Denmark put together - an expanse which has affected the lives of 15 million people."
"More than 15,000 people lost their lives in the earthquake."
"Every building within 80 to 90 kilometres of the epicentre of the earthquake is in ruins."
"According to statistics, this region once produced 30% to 35% of Turkey' s GNP and provided employment for thousands of workers."
"The purely economic repercussions of the earthquakes are great and it would seem difficult, if not impossible, to expect Turkey to overcome all that without any generous help from outside, without our active support."
"In Greece, the destruction is not so wide-spread but the cost in human lives is grave with 138 dead, 3 seriously injured, and approximately 100,000 left homeless."
"The material cost is huge and the earthquakes cost both Greece and Turkey dearly."
"One particular part of this cost, and perhaps the most tragic, concerns the number of human beings who lost their lives, the number of families who were destroyed and the psychological shock suffered by the whole of the regions' population, who are now filled with dread at the possibility of another earthquake."
"The people in those regions have had to summon spiritual strength to overcome the individual, family and financial disaster and to start building again from scratch."
"Nevertheless, every cloud has a silver lining."
"The earthquakes seem to have destroyed houses on the one hand and built bridges between Greece and Turkey on the other."
"The earthquakes laid the unique foundations for co-operation between the two countries."
"The pain and the disaster have taught us that we can only cope with national disasters through co-operation and peaceful co-existence."
"George Papandreou and Mr Cem, the Foreign Ministers for Greece and Turkey respectively, finally decided to include the issue of Greek-Turkish co-operation in dealing with natural disasters on the agenda for dialogue between Athens and Ankara."
"It appears, as the speaker said previously, that every tragedy has a cathartic effect."
"However, in closing, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return once again to a suggestion which was also put forward by other speakers, that is the need to create a European research centre for the systematic study, research and implementation of new preventative methods for earthquakes."
"Mr President, I will not make further reference to the tragic events of the earthquakes which have shaken the whole of the region, both in neighbouring Turkey and in Greece, at varying degrees, of course."
"We refer to the resolution which we tabled concerning the need for action on a political, ethical and material level."
"I would just like, Mr President, to take this moment to inform you that in Athens, for example, there is now great concern and panic amongst the population derived from irresponsible reports circulating around the country of further imminent earthquakes."
"These are reports from scientific circles both in Greece and in other European countries because, as you know, everybody is following the progress of the earthquakes with great interest."
"I believe, Mr President, that if we were to do anything useful and long-standing - and I would like the opinion of the Commissioner on this - then that would have to be the setting up of that wonderful organisation we have been talking about - the one for the study of earthquakes, etc - which, in turn, would have to have a main code of ethics as regards its constitution and when, where, how and to whom information on earthquakes should be publicised."
"It is one thing to give out information to improve anti-seismic protection, for instance, and another thing to bandy about scientific information, albeit with good intentions, and to terrorise the population."
"And since this is a cross-border issue, Mr President, and the information is circulating from country to country, I believe that we should have some general, serious and scientific regulation throughout the whole of the European Union."
"Mr President, I would also like to say that it is imperative, without further ado, that we find the necessary but carefully monitored financial assistance for Turkey to cope with the problems brought on by this terrible earthquake."
"We will have to check that the aid will be used solely for that purpose and not for others."
"This, if you will allow me to say so, is the unanimous desire of the Greek people who, in a thousand and one ways, have displayed their moral and material solidarity."
"However, with those feelings of solidarity towards the Turkish people, we demand that the earthquake disaster is not looked upon as just an excuse to get financial assistance. We ask that this aid be blocked if the Turkish regime does not fulfil its promises to respect human rights, as in the case of Cyprus and the Kurdish issue, or at least show that it has some intentions of taking specific steps."
"With regard to Greece, as has already been said, the disaster was also great."
"I myself have visited the region. It has instilled a sense of deep anguish for the future among the population, mainly precipitated by our discovery that profitability tends to have transcended safety when it comes to property acquisition."
"Therefore, it is essential not only for Greece but for other seismogenic countries, to take the necessary measures to put up their anti-seismic guard so as to avert similar tragedies in the future."
"It is a fact that although governments and individual people cannot be blamed for earthquakes, the responsibility they bear for the extent of the disasters is huge, as has been proved by the earthquakes in Turkey and Greece."
"We believe that there must be direct intervention, that the necessary funds should be taken from the 2nd and 3rd Community Support Framework in order to introduce a specific mechanism such as the one discussed by other speakers for the anti-seismic protection and for the prevention of disasters caused by earthquakes."
"Mr President, because these were the worst earthquakes ever to hit Turkey and Greece, leaving thousands dead and injured and causing extensive damage to houses, factories and businesses, as well as to the infrastructure of both countries, the European Union must take both immediate and long-term action to deal with the problem."
"As regards immediate action, it could grant generous help at no cost from funds from the unused resources of the legislated expenditure."
"Such swift granting of aid will save lives, mainly of children and the elderly, and will relieve the plight of the homeless, who are already imperilled by winter approaching."
"The cost of the disasters in Greece is estimated to be at least EUR 600 million."
"Of course, EUR 100 million can be drawn from appropriations from the second Community Support Framework not expended by Greece."
"However, there is an urgent need for more long-term measures for tackling the problem at a European level."
"Reliable European and American seismologists have ascertained that South-Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area, including European countries, have entered into a prolonged period of heightened seismicity."
"In my view, therefore, it is quite right to propose the establishment of an organisation but this organisation should not just restrict its activities to the study of seismic phenomena or to earthquake forecasts which, according to seismologists, is scientifically impossible - something that those colleagues who are proposing an institution for earthquake forecasts should be mindful of."
"This organisation should also define regulations and specifications for earthquake-proof construction, appropriate building materials, etc., and should also contribute towards providing informed advice to European citizens on any imminent Acts of God and the best ways to deal with them."
"I note that, aside from Greece and Turkey, other countries under threat include Albania and Italy where, just a few days ago, Mount Etna showed signs of activity."
"Secondly, I believe that we should reincorporate the sadly annulled B4-3400 into the Community budget which provided for urgent aid to disaster victims."
"There should be a high special reserve fund which will be transferred from year to year. It should not be abolished at the close of the financial year and should not have the low amounts that we witnessed in the past."
"Finally, I propose that the various public and private voluntary direct action groups for natural disasters within Europe should unite and conform to a uniform European standard."
"In this way, they can be called upon to intervene immediately in any European country stricken by a natural disaster, working alongside their national counterparts, so that rescue operations consisting all the bodies together can cover a wide expanse and meet all the requirements in as short a time as possible."
"Mr President, it is not that the Greens have no other speakers, it is just that we had a technical hitch, so this is my own contribution."
"As a European of Turkish origin, I definitely wished to comment on the earthquake in Greece."
"I believe my Greek friends will understand me if, as a European from Germany, even though of Turkish origin, I say ""silipitiria"" (my condolences), and I say this on behalf of all people from Turkey."
"Indeed, this earthquake in Greece - enough has been said about Turkey - although it resulted in many victims, has achieved much more than hundreds of motions for resolution could."
"Precisely in this period of peace between Greece and Turkey we have an opportunity, here in the European Parliament, to bring the people of both countries together and to finally purge what they kept trying to teach me, and probably you too, in school in our history books, i.e. that Greece and Turkey supposedly hate each other."
"That is an outrageous lie!"
"In fact Turkey and Greece have a great deal in common, and for this reason you can perhaps understand if I, a Green Member of Parliament from Germany, have made such an emotional speech."
"I wanted to express my gratitude to you and, in connection with the earthquake disaster in Greece, to again express my ""silipitiria"" ."
"Mr President, in the earthquake in Turkey, the devastating tremors within the earth brought to light the devastating situation within society."
"More than 15,000 people had to perish just because unscrupulous building firms, shamelessly making money out of shoddy construction, are protected by people in politics and administration up to the highest levels of government."
"Thus the earthquake often affected the poorest of the poor."
"While desperate people were digging their relatives out of the rubble with their bare hands, the state apparatus showed that it was first and foremost concerned with itself."
"In the Kurdish province there are 500,000 militiamen and soldiers under arms in a war, which the other side ended long ago."
"Meanwhile the sight of a soldier in the earthquake area with a shovel in his hand is a rare one."
"Ankara did not just leave people to their own devices but also confiscated aid funds and hindered the work of foreign NGOs."
"This culminated in the Grey Wolves, the Nationalist Action Party, demanding of the Health Minister that Turkey should reject Greek blood donations for the victims."
"We cannot accept such contempt for people without protest."
"But the fact that both the Greek and the Turkish people decided to offer each other mutual help is a positive sign."
"And so, after the earthquakes, both the Turkish people helped the Greeks and the Greek people helped the Turks."
"Please do not misunderstand me, but the industrialised nations of the West should not take the moral high ground where Turkey is concerned."
"They should rather at last admit their share of responsibility for the political and economic situation on the Bosphorus."
"Only then is the way clear for serious democratic changes in Turkey and for appropriate aid which is actually delivered to the victims."
"The European Union has spent thousands of Euros to assist the victims in Turkey."
"I therefore propose that we send a delegation to Turkey and to Greece to check whether the money has been used for the victims, whether the poorest people, the ones who really need the money, have actually received it."
". Mr President, could I say how grateful I am to the honourable Members from all parties for putting down motions for resolution on the tragic effects of the earthquakes in both Turkey and Greece."
"I also join honourable Members in offering the deepest sympathy of the Commission to all who lost friends and loved ones and all who have suffered injury in the terrible disasters in both countries."
"It is clear that nothing can heal the grief."
"Practical help can, however, ease some of the misery."
"The Commission took speedy action to try to assist the Turkish people and its government in their efforts to deal with the catastrophe."
"The first priority, immediately after the earthquakes, was obviously to try to rescue and care for survivors."
"To this end, and in parallel with the systems provided by Member States and the wider international community, the Commission delivered EUR 4 million for first aid services and equipment through ECHO in two tranches."
"In addition, following a visit by the Finnish Presidency and Commissioner van den Broek to Turkey on 26 August, a financial package of EUR 30 million is currently being assembled to help with the current emergency and rehabilitation activities."
"To permit swift utilisation of the funds, the EUR 30 million will also be allocated through ECHO."
"Emphasis will probably be put on temporary dwellings and repair works for essential public infrastructure like schools and hospitals."
"A more precise picture of needs will result from the joint assessment mission similar to the one that has just been called for, I would presume, that is being undertaken in the disaster areas by ECHO, the Commission' s representation in Ankara, the United Nations and the World Bank acting collectively."
"In the medium to long-term, reconstruction needs will clearly have to be addressed after comprehensive damage assessment."
"Meanwhile the Commission envisages the use of the following instruments to support further rehabilitation and reconstruction works."
"Firstly, from 2000 onwards, Turkey should receive a share which reflects its important reconstruction needs from the MEDA 2 funds."
"Secondly, as this House will know, there are two regulations before the Council and this Parliament that will underpin the European strategy for Turkey."
"Those regulations foresee a total of EUR 150 million for Turkey over a three-year period which the Turkish Government regards as being of significant help."
"This week' s General Affairs Council committed itself to adoption and implementation of the regulations as soon as possible and asks the European Parliament - this is the Council speaking - to take this into account in their consideration."
"I hope that this House will seek to expedite its consideration of the legislation which has been here since last spring as far as my knowledge extends."
"I hope, therefore, that the honourable Members directly engaged in that consideration will not further delay their work."
"Thirdly, the European Investment Bank is asked to make a special effort - we think around EUR 600 million worth of lending - to support reconstruction needs."
"Plainly that will require an additional allocation from the guarantee budget line."
"In addition to these developments, the Commission envisages the possibility of acting in coordination with the IMF in granting Turkey macrofinancial assistance geared towards maintaining the reform process under what are evidently difficult conditions."
"We trust that these short, medium and longer-term support initiatives will be of sustained help to the people of Turkey and we are sure that people right across the European Union will join us in hoping that the arduous task of restoring communities and morale will be successful."
"As the House will know, and as we have heard from several honourable Members in their statements and speeches in the course of this afternoon, the people of Greece also suffered tragic deaths and damage in recent earthquakes and further tremors."
"As this Parliament will also recognise, there are no funds on the budget line for emergency aid within the Community."
"There is, therefore, little that the Commission can do to give material support to the efforts of the Greek people and its government in the short-term."
"However, together with the Greek Government, the Commission will look into the possibilities of reallocating some of the unused Objective 2 resources for reconstruction support in Greece."
"The recent earthquakes, as several honourable Members have commented, were obviously unmitigated tragedies but once again they showed that the human capacity for mercy can be greater than any long-standing divisions."
"In the international effort for Turkish victims, the Greek Government gave instant support."
"When the earth trembled in Athens, the Turkish Government was one of the first to send relief workers and equipment."
"Let us hope that what we have seen graphically demonstrated, indeed movingly in this Chamber this afternoon, and the genuinely humane gestures undertaken by both Greeks and Turks in recent weeks, will lead to the strengthening of relations between the two neighbours and between Turkey and the European Union."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m."
"Mr President, according to today' s agenda, the debate on matters of urgency was supposed to begin at 4 p.m.."
"I arrived at ten to four and as I was entering, I saw my name light up."
"This almost made me out to appear unpunctual in front of Parliament, the Chamber and my colleagues watching."
"I imagine that other speakers would have experienced such unpleasant surprises, too."
"Could you explain, Mr President, how this confusion came about?"
"My expert advisers are telling me that, according to the Rules of Procedure, the action of Parliament and the session president, my predecessor, was correct, as the Agenda stated that the Commission statement on the financial crisis in Russia would take place from 3 to 4 p.m., and the topical and urgent debate would begin immediately after the Commission statement or by 4 p.m. at the latest."
"That means, therefore, in the Agenda which you have before you, an alternative was also given."
"That is the Agenda for the sitting of 16 September."
"I am sorry that you will have to remain here a little longer, but that was correct according to the official running order."
"Dagestan"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B5-0071/99 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Dagestan;"
"B5-0078/99 by Mr Sakellariou, Mrs Krehl, Mr Wiersma and Mrs Jöns, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in the Republic of Dagestan (Russian Federation);"
"B5-0090/99 by Mr Alavanos, Mrs Schleicher, Mr Posselt and Mrs Grossetête, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the conflict in the Autonomous Republic of Dagestan;"
"B5-0095/99 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Dagestan;"
"B5-0103/99 by Mrs Schroedter, Mrs Lambert, Mrs Isler Béguin and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the conflict in the Autonomous Republic of Dagestan."
"Mr President, it is actually a little strange that we closed a debate half an hour ago on the financial vicissitudes of Russia and have now moved on to another problem facing the country. Perhaps we should have organised things a little better here in this Parliament and had an extensive debate on Russia and all the things going on there, in view of its needs and the great importance of the country, also from the European Union' s point of view, in an attempt to get some kind of grip on the situation."
"Once again, I would like to endorse what Mr Swoboda said on the matter."
"Having just discussed the financial vicissitudes of Russia we are now going to discuss the political stability of the country."
"Recent developments there give cause for concern, indeed I might say a great deal of cause for concern."
"Violent conflict in Dagestan, bomb attacks in Moscow, and all this in the midst of rumours about plots and all kinds of theories as to what is supposed to be behind it all, and all the different associations being made, for example with the forthcoming parliamentary elections and attempts by certain groups to undermine this process."
"We lament the violence and the victims and we sympathise with the Russian authorities, who are trying to get the situation under control."
"We repudiate the violence in the severest terms."
"Russia has enough problems as it is."
"Even the political system is under pressure and political violence will only increase instability in the country."
"The negative consequences of this affect us too."
"The violence in Dagestan, the subject we are actually discussing, may spread further through the Caucasus, with all kinds of unpredictable consequences."
"No one is anticipating that either."
"Whilst it may be clear as to why it is in our interests to find a political solution, we only have a limited amount of influence over the internal situation in Russia."
"Indeed the debate we have just had demonstrated this and all we can do is encourage the Russian authorities to restore order with the minimum of violence."
"The Russian authorities must enter into political dialogue with the authorities of Chechnya, who must also take responsibility and stop supporting illegal groups in Dagestan."
"We believe, and this point is also made in the resolution, that the OSCE should be the one to bear this message."
"The EU should concern itself more with the socio-economic development of the region, another point made in our text."
"These are small steps which are unlikely to have a great deal of impact on Russia as a whole."
"But they are things we can do and which will also serve to convey that we have our reasons for wanting Russia to become stable, both in terms of the details we are discussing here and as a whole."
"We must be ready to deliver any humanitarian aid that is required."
"We must provide help wherever we are able to do so."
"But we do not have much of a grip on the situation."
"That is one of the greatest risks which Europe will have to face in coming years and I call upon Parliament, but also the Commission and the Council, to put the debate on Russia and its future in Europe on the agenda, and keep it there."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must be aware of the fact that there is seething unrest in the Caucasus."
"Right now it concerns the tragic fate of the people in Dagestan."
"Most news reports only give us a scant account of the drama taking place in this part of the world."
"We need humanitarian aid there urgently."
"The main thing would be above all for these people in Dagestan to be granted the same autonomy as they already have in neighbouring states."
"So what is happening?"
"There is clearly a lack of objective information on the political situation there, but there is also a lack of respect for human rights."
"The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe must be commissioned to prepare a report for our Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and the task which faces us generally in our various Groups must be directed particularly at obtaining such information as quickly as possible and reliably."
"Regardless of where responsibility lies for the situation in Dagestan, the fact remains that it is a result of the dramatic developments following the fall of the iron curtain and that the countries in this region have only managed with great difficulty to liberate themselves."
"In addition, the political authorities responsible continue to attempt to regulate ethnic groups and to create divisions between them."
"We have seen this in direct proximity to us in Europe in the former Yugoslavia, and now we are observing similar developments further away."
"We must do all we can to extinguish the fire that has been kindled there, so that the people in this part of the world also have the possibility of developing in peace, establishing their own autonomy, and having a future, such as we have already secured for ourselves in Europe."
"We should not forget that a few decades ago we lived through a similar fate here in Europe."
"We were then reasonable and came to an understanding, and it is now our job to help people there in their development, which may perhaps run a similar course, but which can in any case offer them the possibility of a future, in which their existence is secure, and where they can take control of their own destiny."
"Mr President, I think it is only right that we should use most of this afternoon to discuss the smoking heap of ruins that the former Soviet Union has left behind."
"In fact, the conflict in Dagestan has to do not only with the conflict between the Russian army and militant Islamicists from Chechnya but also with Russia' s weakness, with oil in the Caspian Sea and with poverty in the northern Caucasus which is being increased by the lack of economic support from Moscow."
"There are perhaps 30 different peoples in Dagestan with just as many different languages."
"One small group consists of Chechens who are supporting the guerrilla leader Basayev in an attempt to incorporate Dagestan into Chechnya. On the other side there are these fundamentalist Wahabis who want to establish an Islamic state with support from Saudi Arabia and Osama bin Laden."
"So the scene is set and all the ingredients are there for a tragedy of inconceivable proportions over the next few years."
"The local population has so far not supported the Wahabis' desire for an Islamic state, but things can change."
"They are one of the poorest republics in the Russian Federation."
"80% of young people between the ages of 18 and 35 are unemployed, and the average wage is below the Russian minimum wage."
"And in Moscow there is not a lot of interest in the situation."
"Now, the population is receiving a greeting from Moscow in the form of bombings."
"Moscow is supposed to be protecting the population, of course, but is instead perceived by many as the opposite of a protector, namely as the party which is bombing them."
"The problem is that journalists dare not travel to the place."
"They are kidnapped and taken hostage for cash."
"Nor do I think, therefore, that this Parliament is in a position to express a particularly precise opinion about this tragedy which is now unfolding."
"But the resolution says what needs to be said, and the most important thing is that we now promise each other to keep a sharp eye open for any means of helping, any means of contributing to stability in this unhappy part of the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, five year ago it was the Chechen war which concerned us on a daily basis."
"Thanks to pressure from this European Parliament, decisive diplomatic steps were then taken."
"The risk of a major conflagration was already colossal, and they were successful, at the time, in damping things down."
"But there was no follow up action."
"In the action programme on Russia, which has already been mentioned today, this specific region is omitted and, in the dramatic poverty which predominates there, extremists of course have an easy job of it."
"If we have an interest in a concept of security embracing all of Europe, we cannot be indifferent to the situation in the Caucasus."
"As anyone familiar with the region knows, it is more difficult than ever for measures to be taken in the area, and therefore in our resolution we prescribed only a verification mission, to begin with."
"As we know, there is no one at the present time who is prepared to go there."
"Nonetheless, the people there are in real need of humanitarian aid, and this must take priority."
"But even the extension of the mandate of the OSCE mission in terms of finance and personnel should be checked seriously, and I request Mr Kinnock to assign Mr Patten to report to us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the results of this verification, so that we can reach further conclusions."
"I consider this to be urgent, and I consider it to be our important contribution towards achieving stability in these regions."
", Neil, Commission. The Commission is following the situation in Dagestan and the related issues in Moscow referred to by Mr Wiersma very carefully."
"Naturally we deeply regret the loss of many lives and the displacement of nearly 40,000 people from their homes as a result of military activity in the Caucasus region."
"Current information is that Russian troops appear to have secured most, if not all, of the villages occupied by the invasion forces from Chechnya."
"As the House will know, this was the second major incursion from Chechnya since early August."
"Fighting still continues in the border region."
"According to reports available to the Commission, the invasions have not gained any general support amongst the population of Dagestan."
"At present it is not clear whether and to what extent Islamic extremists from outside the region have incited or financed the incursions."
"For the moment, therefore, the Commission, in common with others in the international community, calls on the Russian authorities to use proportionate force both in fighting on the territory of Dagestan and in hot pursuit operations across the Chechen border."
"We also call on the Chechen authorities to prevent such incursions being launched from their territory."
"We also share parliamentary and public concern about what realistically seems to be the terrorist bombings in Moscow and, as recently as this morning, in Volgadansk."
"The Commission joins with the Finnish presidency in expressing its sympathy to the Russian authorities."
"We await the results of the official Russian investigations into the blasts before attributing the blame for these atrocities to any particular group."
"The Commission is reassured to note official statements from Moscow that neither the crisis in Dagestan nor the Moscow bombings will be treated as a cause for declaring a state of emergency and thus postponing the forthcoming duma elections."
"At all costs all parties must ensure that the current situation is not allowed to destabilise Dagestan, cause destabilisation in the longer term, or lead to greater political instability in Russia as a whole."
"Mrs Schroedter raised the question of a hearing with my colleague, Mr Patten, in the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"I will certainly pass on her comments."
"Knowing Mr Patten, I am sure he will respond with alacrity."
"Mr President, unfortunately I have not been informed precisely, and now I would like to ask, whether I have the right to the minute' s speaking time which I had before but did not use, in order to say something."
"Mr President, Mr Kinnock very clearly pointed out the risk that this problem presents for stability in Europe and throughout the world as a whole."
"For there is a real danger that extremist forces may use this to bring about a state of emergency in Russia."
"No one knows exactly what the background to this aggression is."
"What is happening in Russia at present is extremely worrying."
"We naturally condemn any form of extremism, but we must ascertain the precise background."
"As regards Chechnya and Dagestan, this is the long-term damage left by a brutal colonial regime, which we will only get to grips with little by little."
"We must therefore urge most strongly, firstly that Russia must respect its obligations resulting from the peace agreement with Chechnya and must resume reconstruction work there."
"Secondly action must be taken to prevent destabilisation of the ethnic balance in Dagestan."
"With that, the debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Human rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"Kosovo citizens in captivity - B5-0080/99 by Mr Schori and Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Kosovo;"
"B5-0092/99 by Mrs Pack and Mrs Grossetête, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the Kosovo citizens in captivity;"
"B5-0100/99 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation of prisoners and the people who have disappeared from Kosovo to Serbia;"
"B5-0105/99 by Mr Staes, Mr Wuori, Mr Lagendijk and Mrs Rühle, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the Kosovo citizens in captivity."

"Kosovo citizens in captivity"
"Mr President, I shall not use up all the speaking time allotted to me."
"The resolution we have here speaks for itself."
"In addition, this morning we have again spoken extensively about the situation in Kosovo, and about all the things we want to do there to ensure that the country is rebuilt as quickly as possible."
"Of course there are now all kinds of problems that need to be resolved as a matter of urgency and to which immediate attention must be given."
"The resolution goes into this as well."
"I am referring here to the several thousand Kosovars being held captive by the Serbian authorities."
"Most of them were arrested during the military operation against Kosovo, when a state of emergency was declared throughout Yugoslavia."
"The conflict has been over for a few months now, but the people are still in captivity."
"It is true that there is an agreement, on the basis of which the conflict was brought to an end, but it would appear that when this agreement was concluded, the group of people in captivity was forgotten about."
"No agreements were drawn up about this."
"We believe that all those people who were taken captive after 24 March, that is after the state of emergency was declared, must be released as soon as possible."
"Pressure must be brought to bear on the Serbian government as a matter of urgency in order to achieve this, and today' s debate also serves to underline how urgent this is."
"I hope that the Council and the Commission will do all that can be done to help secure the release of these people and their return to their homes as soon as possible, just as all the other refugees who were outside Kosovo have been able to return to their homes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time we have discussed Kosovo today."
"We are now discussing a matter, in which little can be changed unless there is some goodwill on the part of the powers-that-be in Belgrade."
"Unfortunately, neither the Kumanovo Agreement between Nato and the Yugoslavian government nor the UN Resolution which gave the mandate for the international presence in Kosovo made any mention of the situation of the Albanian prisoners in Belgrade and the missing persons."
"Here too we should have learnt from our experience in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Today, three years after Dayton, we still do not know where many of the missing people are."
"On a weekly basis I receive queries from families who are still looking for missing persons, and who have not received any details."
"What sort of people are these who detain thousands of their fellow men for years in inhumane conditions for no good reason, leaving the family members of these prisoners, the wives, mothers and children, in ignorance as to their fate?"
"Perhaps we should appeal to them less as politicians and authorities in this region than as the father or sons they also are."
"Unfortunately we cannot compel them."
"The Serbian regime leaves us no formal means to do this."
"But its conduct goes against any conception of legality, never mind humanity."
"We therefore call on the UN Administrator, Kouchner, and also the OSCE, to seek a way to ensure their release."
"We place our hopes in a sub-committee for problems of prisoners and exiles of the Kosovo Transitional Council."
"But we expect all states in the international community not to lift any of the sanctions against Serbia until, among other things, these prisoners are released."
"It is possible to have peaceful co-existence between Serbs and Albanians, and between Croats, Muslims and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, only if, among other things, the matter of prisoners and deportees is clarified."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this afternoon' s debate is, of course, closely associated with the debate we had this morning on the Pack report and the reconstruction of Kosova."
"Yes, you heard correctly, I am talking about Kosova and not Kosovo, and I do this out of respect for the Albanians whose true homeland is Kosova and who make up 80 to 90% of the population there. They speak Albanian, and Kosova is the Albanian word for Kosovo."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have been to Kosova."
"I devoted part of my holiday to this trip."
"I have spoken to most of the Albanian political leaders and they included Mr Rugova of the LDK, the LBD, the Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats, and also representatives of the KLA."
"I have to say, everyone is hugely grateful for the international presence."
"People are very grateful that UNMIC and KFOR are there but fear a sort of ""over-colonisation"" taking place."
"People are scared that the international bodies will not take enough account of the Kosovan people' s strength."
"Of course some of this frustration can be put down to the fate endured by the Kosovan prisoners, who are sitting in Serbian prisons as we speak."
"After the Serbian reign of terror, with all the murder, fire, and ethnic cleansing that entailed, these people are now left with the fear as to what has become of what are literally many thousands of missing persons and prisoners."
"That is why I give my full support to the appeal made both by Mr Wiersma and Mrs Pack, and to the compromise resolution before us."
"We must adopt this resolution and we must endeavour to reach a solution for these prisoners using all the decisiveness and vigour this Parliament can muster."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the image we have of the Kosovars is perhaps one we have acquired from the international press, namely that the Kosovars, the Albanians that is, have taken over where the Serbians left off and it is now they who are oppressing the Serbians and the gypsies."
"I have been to Kosova and do not believe this to be the case."
"Personal acts of revenge are indeed being carried out and we must condemn these."
"They can never be defended but, ladies and gentlemen, let us not equate such acts of revenge with the ethnic cleansing, the systematic terrorisation there has been over the last ten years."
"Let us ponder that for a moment."
"Mr President, I am very happy to see that our Parliament is finally looking into this matter."
"It is obvious that the international community made a serious mistake by not including the question of Kosovar prisoners in the agreements reached with the authorities in Belgrade."
"We must now correct this mistake."
"I agree entirely with our colleague Doris Pack when she says that this must be a precondition for any lifting of sanctions."
"I agree rather less, though, on the ability of the European Union and the international authorities to intervene in this matter."
"The issue of Kosovar prisoners is a humanitarian issue."
"The European Union is still providing humanitarian aid to Serbia."
"This is the only channel for aid still open."
"I think, and the Commission is in a prime position to intervene at this level, that as the issue of the Kosovar prisoners is a humanitarian one, the European Union could be less zealous in its supply of aid to the Serbian authorities until they have released all Kosovar prisoners."
"I feel that there is something we can do straight away, which is to send a clear message to the authorities in Belgrade, and I ask the Commission to let us know the results of its steps as quickly as possible."
"Burma"
"Mr President, we have called for this discussion on Burma because we are on the eve of the decisions that the Council of the Union must take to renew sanctions against the regime which oppresses this country by means of a cruel military dictatorship and continuously violates the most basic human rights and the rights of ethnic minorities."
"Firstly, we are asking the Council to confirm and strengthen its common position on sanctions. This is the request made by my group and the other groups which have subscribed to the motion for a resolution that we are discussing today."
"Unfortunately, no positive developments have been reported in Burma, but we are witnessing a worsening of the repression, as the resolution says."
"Over the last few weeks there have again been dozens of arrests of Burmese citizens and foreigners who continue to fight for democracy and human rights in this country."
"At this time, we must reconfirm our complete and total solidarity with, and give our sympathy to Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, President of the League for Democracy which obtained the majority of votes in the 1990 elections."
"Despite the limitations imposed on her freedom of movement and expression, this courageous woman is continuing her tenacious opposition to the regime, and we cannot fail to remember the inhuman way she was treated by the regime on the death of her husband."
"This has already been condemned by this Parliament."
"The resolution also asks the Burmese Government to put an immediate stop to the loathsome practice of forced labour which much of the civilian population is forced to do and which particularly affects children and women from ethnic minorities."
"We also denounce, as does the International Labour Office, these practices as a crime against humanity."
"The European Union must consider the situation in Burma to be one of the key areas for its international action in the defence of human rights and democracy."
"We must hold our battle up as an example to all the other similar regimes in the world, but we must also succeed in transforming it increasingly into a coherent, efficient and practical policy."
"The Member States must also join the fight to tackle the Burma question in accordance with the common position of the Council, with the same intensity in all the international bodies: from the UN to the regional organisations which unite the Asian countries."
"Only the isolation of the military dictatorship through sanctions and dialogue with the opposition groups and the ethnic minorities can contribute to establishing democracy in Burma."
"Mr President, in the recent summer months thousands more people have fled Burma in order to escape the violence, the enforced deportations from their own country, the forced labour and the political repression."
"There are now 150,000 refugees in camps, mainly in Thailand but also in Malaysia and India."
"Then there are a further 100,000 illegal refugees in the surrounding countries, in Australia, Europe and the United States."
"This summer I attended a conference in Bangkok held by an international organisation that concerns itself with Burma."
"I got to know many representatives of the refugees again."
"They feel that Europe will gradually start to forget about them and that people no longer really take the situation that has now been going on in Burma for ten years very seriously."
"We know that Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi has now been under house arrest for ten years and that with 80% of the Burmese people' s votes, she is the chosen president."
"We are aware that Burma' s Parliament was disbanded, that dozens of Members of Parliament have been killed, are in prison or under house arrest, or are among the refugees."
"We know that the situation is growing more serious: the Burmese government is stepping up the repression in the shadow of the events in Indonesia."
"In fact almost nothing is being done at the moment."
"Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi has appealed to the western democracies to give her more help."
"I want to appeal to the European Union to follow suit."
"A delegation of diplomats went to Burma just before the summer but came back with nothing to show for its pains."
"The sanctions already in force for Burma are to be extended in October and my group believes that it would be better if they were strengthened."
"The United States has already added an investment freeze to these sanctions."
"Let Europe at last show a united front for once and do the same."
"I notice Commissioner Kinnock is nodding."
"I sincerely hope that he will convey this message and our resolution to the European Council of Ministers, and that measures will at last be taken which will help to bring down the regime in Rangoon and which will enable Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi to truly feel that her actions, which are peaceful ones, are being supported."
"Mr President, to speak of Burma truthfully, crudely and without disguising our words, is to speak of the violation of human and collective rights, of the non-recognition of the results of free elections and the persistence of dictatorship, of human exploitation through forced labour which benefits certain Western multinationals."
"And this is happening in a country which, unfortunately, was the first to benefit from our programme of preferential treatment, which should have had a better future."
"The European Union must continue to act under the Finnish Presidency so that relations with Burma can be re-established as soon as possible, but on the basis of the respect for human rights, the results of the elections and the liberation of the British prisoners who were arrested for defending democracy."
"We must put pressure on the military Junta and not allow them to find ways of circumventing democratic legitimacy, which will make a mockery of it."
"We must find the best way of working out a solution."
"I hope, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the European Union, neither now - with Finland - nor later, allows such a mockery to take place."
"And I hope that all of you - and Mr Kinnock in particular - will also condemn the behaviour of those companies which take advantage of human exploitation in a country which is under a dictatorial system and regime."
"Iran"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only two years ago, in Iran, two Jews were accused of spying for Israel."
"They were sentenced to death and were hanged."
"Today, thirteen Jews and several Muslims from Isfahan, Shiraz and Tehran have been arrested and face the same fate."
"Little is known about them."
"The accused, one of whom is sixteen years old, come from humble backgrounds: a cemetery caretaker, a shoemaker, a ritual performer of circumcisions, a teacher of Hebrew."
"It is hard to believe that these unfortunate people are really endangering Iran' s democracy."
"Since their arrest, there has been no news of them."
"When we start hearing about Jews being arrested and espionage trials, this is a very worrying sign."
"We are worried because we know what conditions of detention in Iran are like."
"This is worrying because no evidence, no specific charge has so far been made public and there has been no due hearing of the case."
"We are worried because the accused do not have the right to mount a defence."
"We are worried, Mr President and also sad, because we were delighted at the prospective rapprochement between Iran and the European Union."
"It is now obvious that this business compromises the rapprochement and until we have obtained guarantees that the rights of these prisoners are being respected, we cannot even consider it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are now hostages coming between Iran and the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fears expressed just now by our colleague Mr Zimeray are justified by the recent death sentences passed on four people, following the student demonstrations which took place in July. These fears are backed up by the hanging last year of a 60 year old man."
"There has consequently been great consensus on the motion for a resolution which will be submitted shortly for Parliament' s approval."
"Its aim is to demonstrate Parliament' s indignation at the procedures which have been applied, and to demand that the basic rights to a defence be respected."
"It asks that international observers be authorised to follow the whole trial in court. And finally, it is restating our desire to maintain dialogue, only to the extent that it would allow for progress in the area of human rights in that country, particularly in order to have these death sentences revoked."
"For this reason, I feel that the amendment tabled by our colleagues in the Greens Group is even clearer than the initial common resolution, and I would like to say that, personally, I am in favour of it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the news last Sunday about the death sentences issued against the four people involved in the student disturbances over the summer in Iran sent a wave of disgust and indignation among the Iranian people and throughout other countries."
"The shock was that much greater because many of us were delighted at the election of President Chatami and at the signals of openness, reforms and respect for human rights which he was giving out."
"The Iranian people could at last begin to hope for a new future and for a time when the period of killing and violence would be behind them."
"Following the student demonstrations in the summer, President Chatami promised open and just trials for those involved."
"It is therefore incomprehensible and deeply worrying that the legal process was held in secret and that the death sentences against four people were published almost en passant in a newspaper interview."
"The light and hope which were kindled among the Iranians following the election is now at risk of going out, and the improved relations between the EU and Iran are at risk of cooling."
"I nonetheless hope that the President can draw strength from the massive support he obtained from the voters in the election and that he will act to ensure that the revolutionary court repeals the death sentences so that Iran might continue along the road to reforms and the development of a civil society."
"This Chamber strongly condemns the death penalty wherever it is practised and will continue to do so."
"Offences against human rights can never be merely a matter of a country' s internal affairs."
"I hope that this message will also be conveyed by the Commission."
"Mr President, distress cannot be measured or compared quantitatively."
"It is quite shocking how the tragedies we have seen in Kosovo, East Timor, Turkey and, in some respect, Greece, have overshadowed the situation in Iran, which has become very significantly worse."
"In addition to death sentences passed at secretly held trials, we have today had news of new harsh political sentences."
"The freedom of the press has, at the same time, been stifled and, in this way, the considerable curtailment of human rights has reached a very critical stage."
"The European Union is having a dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which should not be just critical, but actively critical."
"Mr President, the power struggle in the Islamic Republic of Iran between conservatives and those inclined towards reform continues to rage unabated until today with all the consequences you would expect for the constitutional state, in other words the non-application of the constitutional state' s basic principles."
"Fortunately, critical Iranian newspapers and some Iranian members of government are brave enough today to speak out about these very principles."
"The same applies both to the students under arrest and to the Iranian Jews accused of espionage."
"The extent to which they are prepared to stick their necks out is apparent from the sombre and also dispassionate reports by Iranian political analysts."
"Quote: ""As long as the generally-held view in Iran is one which defines dissidents as people of another faith and which derives the right to decide on whether people should live or die, or the right to take the fate of the country into their own hands, from religion, the country' s political climate will continue to be poisoned and politically-motivated violence is to be expected"" ."
"Unquote."
"There has certainly been no lack of this type of violence in the Islamic Republic of Iran since it was first founded in 1979."
"The murders that took place last autumn of four independently minded souls are still fresh in the memory, and of course we must not forget the extraordinarily brutal treatment meted out by the henchmen from the conservative camp of the supreme lawyer Khamenei."
"The latter and his immediate entourage attempted to conceal their involvement in the grim liquidations of 1998 with utterly vile lies about a Jewish-American plot against the fatherland."
"The international community, and therefore likewise the European institutions, must rally around the indigenous voices calling for open and just trials for the students and Jews held in captivity."
"And so it goes without saying that we support the joint draft resolution."
"Togo"
"Mr President, the ageing dictatorial dinosaurs which stalk across the African sub-continent are dying and a new dawn of democracy is appearing."
"But in one country, a dinosaur has presided over a regime responsible for widespread human rights violations for 32 years."
"President Eyadema would be my first candidate for bringing before the new International Criminal Court."
"The situation there is grave."
"We know about the deaths at the time of the elections."
"We know about the human rights activists tortured in jail every day."
"We need to use the office of the EU facilitator to sort that out, to get an agreement between Eyadema and the opposition parties to take Togo to democracy."
"We call on the Council which will be meeting to make sure that the office for the facilitators is given the resources that it needs in order to be able to do that job."
"Cooperation between the European Union and Togo should only be resumed when Togo fully complies with the provisions of Article 5 of the Lomé Convention."
"In the meantime we should be supporting independent media and civil society groups to bring what help we can to the population."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional co-operation between the states of West Africa has made good progress in recent times."
"A West African economic community on the model of the European Union is beginning to take shape."
"But one of the main impediments to further regional integration is the non-operation of democratic institutions, particularly of the Parliament in Togo."
"The Group of the European People' s Party therefore welcomes the serious endeavours of practically all political forces in Togo to make the development towards democracy irrevocable and to prepare within the next few months for elections to the National Assembly which will be indisputably democratic and free of pressure from the army and the State President and his entourage."
"We are in favour of peaceful transition to a fully functioning democracy."
"We also accept that State President Eyadema will continue his period of office until the year 2003, even though the counting procedures of the last presidential election showed rather more than cosmetic flaws."
"We also call, however, upon the State President and his administration, to agree, in collaboration with all political forces in the country, upon an election procedure which gives the same chances to every political grouping which complies with democratic rules."
"We acknowledge the very constructive role played in this by our former colleague, the French ombudsman, Bernard Stasi, and his two colleagues from Germany and Austria, as mediators."
"In this regard, it is essential that the elections are faultlessly prepared, carried out in a non-partisan way and result in a government freely and democratically elected by the people of Togo."
"The situation in Togo is not new."
"Indeed, since General Eyadema seized power, there have been constant violations of human rights: executions, cases of torture and arrests."
"After the electoral fraud last year which allowed General Eyadema to hold on to power, we are right to be worried about the democratic intentions of this regime."
"The absence of an independent electoral commission, the absence of fair access to the media, the absence of any guarantee of the right to campaign, have all led the opposition, which is in the majority, to boycott next spring' s legislative elections."
"Even if we take the agreement recently signed with the opposition to be a step forward, it is still inadequate, and risks being a meaningless scrap of paper unless it provides a number of guarantees."
"We must bring an immediate end to the impunity enjoyed by those who commit such abuses, and we must also ensure that the authorities do in fact respect human rights."
"The parliament must not only be dissolved, but we must also demand Mr Eyadema' s resignation, before the end of his term of office, so that genuinely free and fair elections can be organised."
"These conditions must be met if the European Union is to resume co-operation with Togo."
". Mr President, I must say that, as I listened to these very high-quality debates in the course of this afternoon, I reflected again on the maxim that if the state of domestic affairs makes you depressed, the state of international affairs will make you desperate."
"None of us can succumb to such pessimism and that is why strong concern and demands for action have been voiced in this democratic House."
"I very much welcome that."
"It shows that there are much better and more lively alternatives to simply surrendering to hopelessness, which is sometimes a temptation, both for political representatives and activists and indeed for the more general public."
"Can I first of all turn to the debates on Kosovo and the various tragedies attending that sad part of the world?"
"The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in the draft resolutions before the House, both in relation to the continuing ethnic violence in Kosovo and the earlier so-called disappearances and the detentions."
"We naturally also join Members of this House in strongly condemning violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim, and we actively support efforts by UNMIK, KFOR and OSCE to establish law and order in Kosovo."
"The Commission obviously shares the deep concern of this House about the fate of the many civilians who are still missing."
"We are therefore directly involved in efforts to determine which of the missing people are still held in Serb prisons and which have been killed during the war and the circumstances in which they died."
"The Union is consequently providing support for forensic investigations into alleged war crimes, and earlier this week the General Affairs Council' s conclusions expressed deep concern that the question of several thousand persons - overwhelmingly Kosovo Albanians - who have disappeared remains open."
"Finally, on numerous occasions, the Commission has condemned the gross failure of the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia, to respect accepted international norms of humanity and minority rights."
"That apparent contempt for international obligations is one of the main impediments to improved relations between the former Republic of Yugoslavia and the European Union and an impediment too to the reintegration of the former Republic into the international community."
"That impediment is likely to stay, as long as the Serb authorities pursue their present policy."
"I move now to the resolution relating to the situation in Burma."
"The Commission, as the House will know, strongly deplores the continued violation of human rights by the military authorities in Burma: in particular, the oppressive treatment of ethnic minorities, the persecution of Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD members, the denial of basic trade union rights and the use of forced labour, the prohibition of freely functioning parties, the countless arbitrary arrests and the continuing state violence."
"We also share concern about the treatment of European Union citizens who have been arrested because of their public engagement in democracy movement activities in Burma."
"In April this year the European Union common position strengthened the October 1998 policy decision by covering transit visas and including a ban on tourist visits by people associated with the Burmese authorities."
"The Commission supported that action and assists the democracy movement and refugees in Burma, including of course by providing financial support for the Brussels office."
"The Council is currently reviewing the common position and its extension, as honourable Members said in the debate, should be decided before the 29 October."
"The Commission has made it clear that although Burma has become a member of ASEAN the European Union cannot agree to Burmese participation in the EC/ASEAN Agreement."
"We use every opportunity to press our Asian partners to urge the Government of Burma to enter into a substantive dialogue with the opposition, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, and with the ethnic minorities and to change its policies radically in order to respect human rights."
"Members are aware that Aung San Suu Kyi recently renewed her call for more comprehensive international economic sanctions against Burma, including unilateral sanctions, whilst the present regime controls the country that she loves."
"The Commission participated in the recent EU troika visit to Rangoon which was undertaken with the aim of clearing the way for the establishment of a political dialogue with Burma as provided for in the Council conclusions of 26 April."
"The objectives of establishing political dialogue are to explain the European Union common position on the human rights situation and on the absence of the rule of law and democracy in Burma and to assist in creating conditions that would be conducive to political dialogue between the governing SPDC military junta and the democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities."
"The European Commission remains committed to maintaining the pressure upon the SPDC, formerly known as the Slorc."
"Meanwhile the international situation continues to deteriorate and no meaningful response has been made to the repeated international calls for the Burmese authorities to take steps towards the promotion of democracy, human rights and national reconciliation."
"The Commission therefore continues to support the renewal of the common position next month and the strict enforcement of the resulting pressures and sanctions."
"I now turn to the situation in Iran, to which attention has again been drawn by resolutions before this House."
"As the House will know, the Commission views the human rights situation in Iran with deep concern, which we share with this House."
"In the comprehensive dialogue between the European Union and Iran, questions directly relating to human rights are always raised by the European Union representatives."
"Whilst the Commission does not have any bilateral contractual relationship with Iran or representation in the country, we associate with the démarche made by the European Union troika."
"The treatment of members of religious minorities in Iran, particularly the Baha' is, was raised by the Union troika during the meetings with the Iranian Government last December and in May this year."
"That pressure will be maintained."
"To come to the specific points relating to violations of human rights raised by Mr Zimeray, Mr Morillon and Miss Malmström, I would like to say that a Union troika démarche concerning the death sentences on four students, which incorporates the views expressed by this Parliament, is being prepared by the Finnish presidency."
"The Commission is also concerned about the trial of 13 Jews from Shiraz on charges of espionage."
"The Union has made a number of representations on the subject, both through the troika and bilaterally."
"It is evident that the recent developments in Iran reflect the internal power struggle between moderate reformists and conservative hard-liners."
"The efforts of the conservatives to regain the initiative and undermine the government must realistically be regarded as a preface to the parliamentary elections which are due to take place next February."
"Meanwhile the Commission considers that particularly in the period leading up to those elections, the policy of the cautious opening of relations with Iran through the comprehensive dialogue, should continue as a way of encouraging Mr Khatami' s government and the supporters of reform, many of whom are showing considerable courage in their efforts for change in extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances."
"I now move to the issue of Togo."
"As the House will know, the European Community suspended development cooperation with Togo in 1992."
"Despite some shifts in the political situation since then, I regret to say that the prerequisites for the resumption of development cooperation and the full normalisation of relations with Togo - respect for democratic principles, the rule of law and human rights - are still not adequately fulfilled."
"However a certain political momentum towards political reconciliation has been created through the Lomé framework agreement that was reached between the government and the opposition in July of this year."
"The progress was made possible through the facilitators provided by the European Union, as Mr Watson just said."
"The Union, therefore, intends to support continued action by the facilitators as well as projects that are related to the full restoration of the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"The Commission welcomes the positive will for progress that was demonstrated by the government in opposition in the framework agreement, but substantial further progress - for example, properly conducted legislative elections that are anticipated in the next year - is required before we can consider resuming regular cooperation."
"The Commission shares the particular concern for the resolution of the general human rights situation in Togo that is expressed in motions before this House."
"It is obviously very disturbing that the offences against human rights reported recently by Amnesty International have largely been confirmed by other sources."
"It has, however, not yet been possible to verify some of the most serious allegations concerning large-scale killings."
"Further investigations would therefore be welcomed by the Commission."
"The House will know that wherever problems relating to human rights occur the United Nations system provides for a number of follow-up mechanisms to promote improvement in the situation."
"Such measures could, in the view of the Commission, be considered in the case of Togo and it would appear that they would certainly be justified."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Lusaka peace agreements"
"The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B5-0070/99 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Lusaka peace agreement;"
"B5-0082/99 by Mr Van Hecke and Mr Corrie, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the Lusaka cease-fire agreement;"
"B5-0084/99 by Mr Miranda and Mrs Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Lusaka agreement on the future in the Great Lakes region in Africa;"
"B5-0094/99 by Mr Van Hecke, Mr Corrie and Mrs Grossetête, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the Lusaka cease-fire agreement;"
"B5-0099/99 by Mr Van den Bos and Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the Lusaka cease-fire agreement;"
"B5-0101/99 by Mrs Maes, Mr Rod, Mr Schörling, Mrs Lucas and Mrs Boumedine-Thiery, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the Lusaka peace agreement for the Great Lakes region."
"Mr President, yesterday evening in a long television speech, President Kabila again reaffirmed his faith in the Lusaka agreements."
"Sadly, there continues to be a huge difference between words and deeds."
"So far, there has been no sign of the hoped-for overtures towards the political parties."
"Worse still, in the course of the last few weeks, a number of prominent opposition figures have again been picked up and put behind bars with no charge whatsoever having been brought against them."
"It is crucial that the Congolese authorities permit political activities to take place, as soon as possible, and make an immediate start on releasing political prisoners."
"For it is only in a constructive and transparent climate characterised by goodwill on the part of all the parties concerned, that the national dialogue will have a chance of succeeding."
"It is, of course, clear that at the present time there are some very divergent interpretations in relation to the forms of the national dialogue."
"There continues to be a great deal of confusion."
"Therefore we still have a long way to go before we have a stable, peaceful and democratic Congo."
"But the Lusaka agreement has lent important impetus to the process."
"We must now take full advantage of this impetus."
"Africa must not disappear from our political agenda, notwithstanding the priority that is understandably being given to the Balkans and East Timor."
"And so we expect the European Union to become very actively involved and we hope that the Commission will do its duty and support the peace process in the Congo."
"Mr President, the Lusaka Agreement is a positive step and, naturally, my group wholeheartedly supports this process which is moving towards peace."
"We will therefore be voting for this resolution because we feel that, from the outset, it provides a response to the Rwandan tragedy and to the need to confront concerns about Congo."
"Having said that, I would like to make two observations."
"Firstly, this agreement is fragile, and no one can guarantee today that we will not be confronted by a major obstacle - here, the several armed groups who are not aligned to any State, are not under anyone' s control, and these groups could, in fact, destabilise the peace process."
"We must be vigilant in this matter."
"Secondly, we feel that Europe must pursue this course of action, take responsibility for its past and uphold its duty to remember."
"Although the Commission has a role to play in this, I feel that the Council should also remain alert to it, because we think that in the future, we will be moving towards a partnership agreement between Europe and these countries."
"It might also be a good idea if, through the Council, countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Portugal and Belgium should face up to their past more productively than they have done to date."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the words spoken by my colleagues show how fragile a peace process is and, at the same time, how important."
"The hostilities and war in the Congo, but also in the region of the Great Lakes and in Angola, are all interlinked conflicts and are not just the cause of dreadful human suffering but will also hinder any efforts to build and develop in the future."
"That is why we must not just watch this peace process from the sidelines and make symbolic gestures."
"We can see that there are different phases to this process."
"An end must be brought to the hostilities."
"We already know how limited the achievements have been here up until now; there is the necessary preparation and implementation to be undertaken by a united military committee that must precede the establishment of a peacekeeping force. In its turn, this force must undertake the disarmament of all armed militias and prepare for national reconciliation."
"Every one of these steps represents an enormous challenge."
"I believe that the European Community and the various Member States have a responsibility of historic importance in this respect."
"That is why, Mr President, Commissioner, I want to make particular reference to the last few paragraphs of our resolution which state emphatically that we must assist with the implementation of the peace agreement."
"But I want to point out that this assistance must not be symbolic. Rather, it must be efficient and it must be tangible."
"Parliament would like to be kept informed of developments here."
"I also want to draw your attention to the shameless export of, and illegal trade in, weapons that various of our Member States are still guilty of."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the conflict which has brought bloodshed to the Great Lakes region for more than a year now appears to be reaching a favourable outcome."
"We are delighted at this of course, but much work remains to be done."
"On the one hand, the Lusaka Agreements must lead, in the short-term to a lasting and verifiable cease-fire."
"In this context, the rapid deployment of international observers is essential and even of paramount importance."
"The European Union must participate in this process alongside the United Nations and the OAU to verify the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country as well."
"Congo must cease to be a mere pawn, in order, once again, to play a genuine role in finding a fair and equitable solution for all parties involved in the conflict."
"On the other hand, it is necessary and even imperative that the Congolese resume dialogue among themselves."
"A debate on national reconciliation must involve civilian society, which is so vital in this country."
"Finally, and this is no doubt a more unusual path, the European Union could begin thinking about concluding a Stability Pact for Africa, modelled on the example of the Balkans."
"Member States who have a special historical relationship with this region must, to my mind, face up to their responsibilities."
"The whole of Africa is calling out to us."
"The recent death of two young Guineans in an aeroplane bound for Brussels, a tragic fate recalled by the President when she opened this part-session on Monday, is a cry of alarm which demands our attention, as European officials, and which must force us to act."
". Mr President, may I again express the Commission' s thanks for the way in which Members have drawn attention to this very important issue this afternoon."
"The Commission considers that the European Union, together with the rest of the international community, must take decisive steps to contain the repercussions of the crisis in the Great Lakes countries which in a variety of ways, as Members have said, threaten the security and stability of the whole of Africa."
"European Union policy is therefore based on the view that the results of the Great Lakes conflict must be dealt with in their three main dimensions: regional, bearing in mind the interests of the neighbouring countries; national, taking account of the interests of the government, rebel groups and democratic opposition; and local, concerning community clashes due to ethnic rivalries and severe social pressures."
"In this context the Union is undertaking significant mediation and dialogue promotion efforts at the different levels of the conflict and the Commission is ready to contribute to the success of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement in the following areas."
"In terms of political support, the European Union intends to continue and to encourage the efforts already undertaken by our special representative for the Great Lakes to facilitate the necessary degree of dialogue between the different factions involved in the DRC conflict."
"The Union intends to continue the promotion and financing of mediation efforts, notably those of the President of Zambia, that made the Lusaka agreement possible in the first place."
"That is necessary in order to try to maintain the commitment of the signatories to respect their obligations."
"The Lusaka agreement foresees an inter-Congolese national debate to allow for the reconciliation of the differing political forces in DRC and to pave the way for a new political disposition in DRC."
"The Commission is also ready to finance the mediation efforts necessary to bring about that national debate."
"Secondly, amongst the efforts that we are undertaking to make, are those related to support for the peacekeeping operations to be carried out by the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity."
"Several Member States are contributing to the 90 United Nations military observers who are deployed in the capitals of the region and at the military headquarters of the rebel groups in order to oversee the implementation of the Lusaka agreement."
"These activities should also support the Joint Military Commission that is in charge of organising the deployment of a peacekeeping or peace enforcement force."
"The United Nations Security Council still has to decide, of course, on the nature of such a force."
"It will then be possible for the Union to consider whether and how to give relevant support."
"Thirdly, in terms of economic and development support, the commitment of the Commission in the Lomé Convention framework could and should be reactivated under two conditions: Firstly, improvement in the security situation in the DRC and secondly, an outcome of the national debate which provides a stable political disposition in the DRC in which the essential elements of the Lomé Convention are respected."
"The reconstruction and development support of the Commission should then focus on the following areas: firstly establishment of the rule of law and the democratisation of national institutions; secondly, demobilisation and socio-economic reintegration of the belligerents; thirdly, restoration of the environment, especially in the Kivu and Orientale provinces; fourthly, reconstruction of transport infrastructure; and finally improvement of health and sanitation facilities."
"Naturally I would also have sympathy for the call made by, amongst others, Mrs Maes for a strict suspension of the gun-running and arms trafficking that are continuing to feed conflict in the region and frequently originates here in the European Union."
"Finally, humanitarian aid is obviously a continuing need and the Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has deployed around EUR 55.5 million this year."
"Our efforts to achieve support and lasting stability will continue, and naturally we will also continue to seek to keep this Parliament fully informed because we value greatly the commitment to our joint objectives in securing stability and continuing peace in this sorely troubled region."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately after this."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.28 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam Present, in the past our Parliament has looked very critically at the situation in Algeria, but our Parliament was also the first which sought contact and dialogue with the Algerian Parliament."
"The result of yesterday' s referendum gives us cause to rejoice, along with the people of Algeria, who are on the road to reconciliation and striving to achieve peace in their country."
"I would like to ask you, Madam President, to convey the congratulations of this Parliament to the President of Algeria."
"Thank you, Mr Sakellariou."
"Your statement was not included in the Minutes, but I am pleased to take note of it."
"Madam President, with reference to a point I made in the debate on Tampere on Tuesday, it has been brought to my attention by my colleague, Mr Camre, that remarks that I attributed to him were not what he intended and the translation into English, and I believe French, was the exact opposite of what he intended to say."
"My criticism of him was perhaps unfair. I would just like to put that straight and I have now done so."
"Mr Evans, this correction will be made. Thank you."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"State of the Louise Weiss building"
"The next item is an announcement and, more particularly, a discussion on the state of the Louise Weiss building."
"Ladies and gentlemen, very quickly, the background in brief. I assure you, it will be brief."
"You will recall that when we entered the building on 19 July, we were, unanimously it must be said, disappointed by the contrast we could observe between the truly extraordinary external appearance of the building - I think it is important to say that too, because it is a building which does our institution credit, seen from the outside - and, unfortunately, all the things we noted on the inside, such as malfunctions, problems with comfort and security, and problems of a general nature, such as those affecting our normal working conditions, either for ourselves, our assistants, officials, visitors or, of course, the media."
"I promised you, as of the day after my election, to do everything in my power to ensure that improvements were made, and as you have been able to see, we have - I am deliberately using we to indicate all of us, because in this undertaking I have had the active assistance of our Secretary-General, Mr Priestley, and all the team in charge of the buildings - we, then, have done all that we could to get these improvements underway at a far from easy time of the year since, in the event, it coincided with the holiday period."
"Mr Priestley set up a working party and we immediately made an inventory of everything we could observe in the short-term and sent this document out to you."
"Many of you wrote to me and I answered you."
"Indeed I hope you received these letters."
"You received an initial letter from Mr Rieffel, our director, but I felt it necessary to answer you personally myself, and so all the Members who wrote to me received a reply."
"Then, on Monday, you received a letter accompanied by a short document summarising the situation we have today."
"Last week, we came to Strasbourg from Brussels for a day, together with the Quaestors, Mr Colom i Naval, the Vice-President responsible for the premises, and all the officials in charge of the matter of the buildings."
"We carried out a thorough inspection."
"I do not know if any of us saw anything of this in the media, but we looked at everything, recorded everything, and made note of both what had been done and what was still outstanding."
"Today, you have just completed your second week of plenary session in this building, and you have accepted my proposal for this discussion in a very constructive spirit."
"The problem is not to express regrets; my goal is rather to ascertain which problems are of legitimate concern to you in order to then see how we can add further improvements to those we have already scheduled."
"To organise our discussion, we take note of all the Members who have signed in."
"I shall take a number of points which have been identified as sensitive areas, so that you can make comments on these points or, of course, on other points."
"First of all there was the problem of disabled access."
"On this subject, with regard to the legitimate request made by our colleague, Brian Crawley, I have the impression - I do not know if he is present today - that the necessary modifications were made immediately, in consultation with him, affecting both his seat in the chamber to enable him to be with his group and the arrangements for his office."
"We have made provision for the position of disabled Members throughout the chamber to be taken into consideration."
"There are still improvements to be carried out as regards access for disabled visitors, which has not been adequately provided."
"We have already made contact with specialist disabled associations who will be able to advise us on the best improvements to be scheduled."
"Between now and the October part-session we will have been able to consult these contacts and have modifications under way by next year."
"Regarding signposting, improvements have been made, and you can shortly tell me whether they are adequate."
"I must point out at this juncture that the ""info help"" system is going to be continued."
"We plan, with the agreement of the Mayor of Strasbourg, to retain the services of the charming hostesses whose presence, I believe, you have greatly appreciated, both for their welcome and for their kindness."
"I hope they can hear you."
"They are to be kept on, not permanently, this is not foreseeable, but at least until the end of the year."
"Now I come to the second important area, Member' s offices."
"These offices are very constricted."
"I am not going to pretend that they can be made bigger, but we are going to try all the same to improve matters."
"The problem with the blinds which were jammed and which were shutting out the light will certainly be sorted out in time for the second October part-session, at the very latest."
"As regards the furnishing of our offices, our Quaestors - may I greet the ones here today - held a meeting on Wednesday and decided that all the offices will be equipped with file cabinets on castors with three lockable drawers."
"This was a request that had been made by a number of Members. This decision was therefore taken."
"(Applause) Next, the problem of the lifts, and their safety."
"Here we noted, I hardly need to repeat it, a number of quite serious malfunctions."
"I have, of course, taken all legal precautions, as you might expect, concerning liability."
"The firm manufacturing the lifts was informed immediately, in accordance with legal requirements, of what had happened."
"The firm carried out some improvements, clearly indicating that it was indeed necessary to improve the opening of the doors so that we do not become trapped for as long."
"However, it seems that numerous problems still remain."
"On the other hand, the ventilation seems to have been improved. This presented problems, not just in the lifts, but just about everywhere."
"My impression here, tell me if I' m wrong, is that the regulation of the ventilation is now just right."
"There is also the problem of the lift décor."
"As you have been able to see, a prototype of light wood panelling has been installed."
"I have received very favourable responses to this and, as it seems to have found general approval, we shall ensure that all six lifts are fitted out with the same décor, giving them an appearance which is a little less harrowing, a little less anxiety-provoking."
"I would ask the Members who are still getting trapped for long periods in the lifts to notify me shortly."
"We thought that was what happened with Mr Prodi, but it transpired that it was something else."
"That would really have capped it all."
"However, I must get a clear picture on this matter, because, as you can well imagine, I shall have to refer it back to Otis, as this is an extremely serious area which goes far beyond the standard improvement of our working conditions."
"Regarding the media, you know that the press made many complaints about the press room and its working conditions."
"Here also, we have made a few improvements concerning the overheating and the installation of the blinds."
"The media are luckier than the Members of Parliament."
"It has been possible to sort out the problem of their blinds but not, as yet, those in the Members' offices, as I have just mentioned."
"Their portable equipment which was previously inoperative can now work in the press room."
"We also modified the positioning of documentation to comply with the wishes of the media."
"There are still a number of things to be done, especially with regard to the offices of the press agencies which are really not very pleasant, to say the least."
"We also plan to equip the former documentation room, which is very bright, with open plan offices."
"The costs would be quite low as we would not be installing partitions."
"There would simply be desks where the press agencies can work."
"Apparently - we naturally made this proposal in consultation with the journalists - they like this idea."
"For the remainder, the television vehicles, access to the car park, here too I hope you have noticed some improvements."
"We have worked hard in this area although we still have some improvements to make."
"Finally, and this is all for the moment, the problem of decoration."
"Our Quaestors are going to ascertain as quickly as possible what can be done that is not too costly and which respects the artistic copyright of the building designers, so that the rather miserable areas can be brightened up."
"Often, it does not take much to change the appearance of an area, without going to extravagant expense."
"Sometimes just a change of colour."
"I am convinced that our team of Quaestors will be particularly creative in this area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us now open the debate."
"We shall be taking very careful note of all you say."
"You should know that I will have to leave at ten o' clock, as I must attend the swearing in of the Commissioners in Luxembourg which is due to take place at noon."
"Mr Provan will then take my place and you may continue until there are no further questions."
"Madam President, I do not want to criticise but to praise the people who put together this quite extraordinary building."
"When you move into a new home, there are always problems."
"There are problems, Madam President, but I appreciate that you,Mr Priestley and the group who dealt with the complaints from the last session recognise them."
"There seems to be a culture of complaining among the Members."
"How many of them had such lovely offices as we have here - and we are only here for four days a week."
"We have beautiful offices, fully equipped."
"Of course they need one or two things done to them, but if we constantly complain, we will get nowhere."
"Having said that, I should like to make one request."
"In Brussels, there is a Members' bar - as is traditional in parliaments throughout the European Union."
"I would like to see a room here where just Members can go to talk amongst themselves in private."
"As regards the car-park, I have had difficulty once or twice in finding my car but I found it in the end."
"I did miss a vote during the week because of the lifts, but I recognise that in due course these matters will be resolved."
"I must say that I admire the technicians and other people who have been criticised here."
"They have taken a lot of stick and have been hurt unnecessarily in many ways. I want to pay tribute to them and all the workers who put together this wonderful building."
"Madam President, I agree with what my colleague has just said in thanking the workers and in expressing her appreciation for what has been done since July to improve the situation, and for the on-going building work aimed at further improvements."
"I would, however, like to mention something I have come across and which I feel should be resolved."
"It does not concern the Members of Parliament, but rather our co-workers."
"In the Tower building, in room 382 on the fourth floor to be exact, I saw an enormous photocopier which one person operates. Well, in this room there are no windows and no air inlets, and we do not know if the extremely noisy machine emits substances which could endanger the operator' s health."
"Now, since this Parliament is involved in establishing important directives on health and safety at work, I would find it extremely contradictory if this situation were to continue, even though only one person is affected."
"In fact, I saw the sign on the door and originally, the room was probably meant for a different purpose. So maybe we are talking about a temporary solution."
"I honestly hope it is temporary because otherwise it really would seem contradictory to allow such a situation to continue."
"Madam President, I too have a request, to thank the city of Strasbourg and the French government for making this building available to us."
"For, in spite of the teething troubles, which are perfectly natural, it is a wonderful building and a worthy setting for the European Parliament here in Strasbourg."
"I would also like to thank you, Madam President, for taking the initiative in helping to cope with these teething troubles."
"I would like to mention one problem, one I hope is not mine alone. This is the limited number of exits from, and entrances into, this Chamber."
"You are familiar with the behaviour of the Members of Parliament."
"Generally, we all leave the chamber together or all enter it together before votes."
"We keep getting queues of people in the aisles."
"This is related to the fact that two access points are simply too few for the large number of Members of Parliament."
"I do not know whether it is technically possible to additionally open one of these privileged access points for the Members of Parliament."
"There is also a problem in that both the main exits lead to the foyer, which is extremely narrow."
"The bridges are there."
"The cameras are waiting there."
"We Members of Parliament are also, by nature, very undisciplined and chat in the aisle, or stand right in front of the exits and talk to each other."
"We could certainly also improve our discipline."
"But I think we should have thought of something to make better use of the broad foyers located at the sides of this Chamber."
"If we should come out there, we ought also to have the opportunity to sit down together somewhere other than in this enormous telephone kiosk."
"I think serious precautions should be taken in the interests of safety, for what if an alarm were to go off?"
"Thank you, Mrs Berger, for this very constructive suggestion, which we are pleased to note."
"Madam President, the acoustics here are so bad that it is difficult to hear the interpreter."
"We cannot hear the translation clearly because the echo here is so bad."
"I request that the volume be lowered."
"Madam President, it is the same point."
"If you speak very close to your microphone most people cannot hear what you are saying."
"It is an indication of what is wrong with the system."
"It is exactly the same in the committee rooms."
"It is the distance of the speaker from the microphone."
"We need to hear what the interpreters are saying."
"I believe Mr Seppänen is absolutely right."
"In the meantime, I understand that I need to speak further away from the microphone."
"Madam President, there are certain quaint eccentricities in the operation of the building and in its catering, for instance, coffee not being served during sessions, no white wine available by the glass, the fact that the pizzas taste like cardboard and the fact that the newspaper shop is about as far away from the entrance where Members come in as it is possible to be."
"Nevertheless those are things we can deal with."
"The design of the building is not entirely to my taste."
"The designer clearly must have had Breughel' s Tower of Babel in mind."
"But I accept that you, Mr Priestley and the people of Strasbourg have made enormous efforts to try and cope with these."
"I agree with Mr Andrews that inevitably there were some teething problems."
"The biggest remaining problem is the lifts, which seem to have a mind of their own."
"If you run very fast - which does not help the handicapped - you might get in before someone inside it closes the door in your face because they are fed up with stopping on every floor."
"Nevertheless, the building is a comparatively good one."
"It is cheap compared to the House of Commons in London, where nearly FRF 1 million has been spent on a desk."
"My main complaint is not about the treatment of Members but about the treatment of staff."
"It seems to me that whoever has been making these decisions has treated the staff, in some cases, rather shabbily."
"Certainly the committee staff who work with me now have to fit three people, three desks and chairs, three telephones and three sets of papers into a room that used to be used by one Member in IPE I or IPE II."
"This is not an effective way of making sure that this institution works properly and effectively."
"The last point I would make is that in many cases we have been blaming the building when it is the politicians we should be blaming."
"The building is here because of decisions made at the Edinburgh Council by Mr Major, who institutionalised our constant peregrinations between Brussels and Strasbourg - beautiful as this city is - to the detriment of our efficiency as an institution that is meant to be working on behalf of the people of the European Union."
"Madam President, I would just like to say first that last week we really got a lot of work done."
"I was very pleased to see how attentive you were, as President, to all the requirements and questions which we or the administrative officials had."
"To the Members I would like to mention really two points, which were mentioned here and which were decided in the College of Quaestors: your filing cabinets have not only been decided upon, they have already been ordered."
"We are assuming that they will also be delivered as quickly as possible."
"Secondly, the matter of the building decoration."
"French law in this connection is very strict and treats this building as a work of art, over which the architects have intellectual property rights."
"But we have decided - intellectual property rights or not - to discuss things with the architects to see if we can make all the dark areas somewhat brighter."
"If it is already dark in the July season, how is it going to look in the December light?"
"We do not want to do that to ourselves or to you."
"I hope we can make the red more pink, the dark blue perhaps light blue or something similar, and the black perhaps a champagne colour, Madam President."
"A third point which seems very important to me and to all of us is safety, something you yourself, Madam President, did not necessarily mention in detail."
"You recall that it was mentioned, and now it has also been decided, that the safety of the building should be retested twice a year, that is, every six months."
"We consider it essential that a building which is used so intensively by so many different groups, and sometimes used in a somewhat chaotic and anarchic manner - this chaos says something for the liveliness of European politics - is also inspected on a very regular basis."
"A body such as the European Parliament cannot itself vouch for safety, cannot be responsible for it; it must be able to delegate it."
"Indeed that is what we intend to do."
"By the way, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the College of Quaestors I would like to ask you, if you have complaints, to formulate them, and come to us."
"With your support, Madam President, matters will be rectified as quickly as possible."
"Thank you, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, and thank you at the same time for the very great help of the College of Quaestors."
"I can tell you that I was most appreciative of it."
"Madam President, while I welcome many of the improvements that have been made, I want to make a point concerning the management side: we would very much welcome some recycling facilities, given the sheer amount of paper that appears every day, much of which is not kept."
"We would like people to look into that please."
"There is an issue that was raised with me by a number of assistants who were refused entry to the public gallery even though there was space."
"We quite understand that the public has to have priority - it is their building too."
"But we would ask that when there is space our assistants should be allowed access: it is not always convenient for them to be in our offices if we have visitors."
"Finally, a minor point that was raised with me by a colleague who had to leave early."
"Could we have water provided during the sessions?"
"People here find the atmosphere in this building very dry, not just politically, but in environmental terms, and we would very much welcome that provision."
"Thank you, Mrs Lambert."
"To wash down the rather indigestible nature of the pizza that Mr Ford mentioned. We are pleased to take note of your comment."
"Madam President, I concur with my colleague, Mr Ford, that of course if we only sat in Brussels, we would not be here debating this building."
"That underlines the problem that we are confronted with the enormous task of managing two buildings across the European Union."
"Nonetheless that is the task that the Council has decided that we must undertake."
"I would, therefore, like to thank the services, Mr Priestley in particular, and all his staff for the strenuous efforts they have undertaken to make this building work."
"This week this building has worked."
"While there have been problems, our parliamentary business has not been hindered by the defects and this is thanks to the efforts of Mr Priestley and others."
"There are significant design defects, particularly in relation to access."
"It is not an architecturally welcoming building particularly to people with disabilities."
"That is going to be a real challenge for us all to overcome."
"On the whole, a lot of the resistance is due to the fact that people just do not like change. They do not like unfamiliar surroundings."
"In my view, it is not appropriate to discuss our own internal business at a full parliamentary session here in the European Parliament."
"We need to find, perhaps, a less formal form of ongoing dialogue with you and Mr Priestley and his services to discuss the issues of accessibility and other issues relating to the internal organisation of this Parliament."
"This session is an illustration that the dialogue between ordinary Members and the administration is perhaps not working as effectively as it could be."
"In conclusion, putting all this in perspective, yes we have problems as Members."
"Our staff have problems too, but this is nothing compared to the problems faced by those we represent."
"I hope we all bear that point in mind."
"Madam President, this Parliament will have an increasingly important role - we said this during the discussions on our confidence in the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi - and I believe that more and more should be known about Parliament' s work in all the nations of the European Union."
"To achieve this, I think that we should improve our relations with the press and that journalists' work should be made easier."
"You have already done a lot and I note that this Presidency is sensitive to the needs of the press and has always been very helpful."
"When the sitting opened, you announced that some initiatives have already been adopted and specific responses have been given to the Parliamentary press but, I repeat, I think that much more needs to be done to facilitate journalists' work so that they can inform the entire European Union about the important work carried out in the Parliament."
"Journalists still do not work under optimum conditions, and so I think it is appropriate, for example, to move the pressroom to the area beneath the Chamber."
"Their current room is still too far away and it is not often easy for the journalists to come and talk to the Members, especially during important sittings."
"I think that thanks to your interventions, we can build on past improvements and continue to improve the situation over the coming weeks and months."
"As a Parliamentary journalist and Member, I would be grateful for any assistance you can provide regarding this matter."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to say to the Members who are thanking the French government or the city of Strasbourg for this building, that they are addressing their comments to the wrong people."
"We were the ones who had the house built so we should be the ones beating our own breast if mistakes have been made."
"But I am not here to offer praise."
"The building is fine."
"It is the many defects I would like to comment on now."
"Firstly, Madam President, if you ever had to send a fax in my office or that of my fellow Members, I could tell you it is practically impossible!"
"You would have to stand on a chair, a swivel chair, to be able to look down on the top of this machine."
"You probably know that most accidents in all the households in Europe happen because housewives are trying to stand on some sort of swivel chair, which should be avoided if possible."
"I would not like to know how much money the insurers of this building will have to pay out in future for all the medium-sized persons climbing up on these chairs."
"People like me."
"I am just 1.60 m tall."
"I' m just not tall enough."
"I need assistance."
"There is a notice on it saying, ""Please do not move"" ."
"Secondly, Madam President, I drive a normal passenger car into the entrance of our car park."
"You cannot get to Level 2 if you don' t reverse in order to take the bend."
"Well, you can imagine what it gets like in the rush hour."
"There are cars coming from the left, from in front, from behind, and there is always someone who has to reverse so he can get round the bend."
"My heartfelt request is that this central reservation is halved in size so that we can enter the car park without having to reverse."
"Apart from that I do not see why I should have to insert my pass twice when entering the car park, once on top and once in the middle."
"That' s just crazy."
"If I have already got in at the top, I should be able to carry on inside."
"I understand even less why, when I' m leaving in the evening or at night, I have to do the same again."
"Once I' m inside, you might as well let me out!"
"The situation is just ridiculous on both counts."
"In the rush hours it is just not feasible."
"Thirdly, in the morning I would like to be able to get my newspaper quickly."
"There is no newspaper stand nearby."
"I still have not found the newspaper stand."
"I always ask someone who knows where the stand is to bring me one back."
"Fourthly, this week I have got into a lift five times and not been able to get out at my own floor."
"I wanted to get out on the tenth floor."
"It wasn' t on."
"Five times that has happened to me."
"Then I thought, ""right, let' s avoid that particular lift"" , and since then I have always tried to take another lift."
"It is, of course, an intolerable situation in this building."
"As the person responsible for a delegation - I chair the South-Eastern Europe Delegation, this has nothing to do with the Louise Weiss building, but with the Salvador de Madariaga building across the way - I would now like to make one more request."
"At least four of the delegation staff occupy a tiny cell, which I previously had to myself."
"The first is talking to Dagestan, the second to Moscow, the third to Macedonia and the fourth perhaps to Cologne."
"Can you imagine it, in a single room?"
"Please could you do something for the members of staff!"
"The present situation is unbearable!"
"Thank you, Mrs Pack, for reporting all these malfunctions."
"Clearly, there is some incompatibility between you and the lift, because five times is really rather excessive."
"All this will be dealt with."
"Mrs President, I believe that if we look for the common denominator in everything we have been talking about here, we would find that there is a problem of inconvenience, which I believe we will gradually be able to iron out. Things will then improve."
"The problem is also that we are being far too sensitive with regard to this inconvenience."
"And we are far too sensitive because we have to come here via a transport system which is also inconvenient and our inconvenience in the face of this transport system is added to the inconvenience that we find here."
"I believe that if we want to deal with part of this inconvenience we will never be able to do so by thinking only of the building or only of transport."
"We will have to deal with the problem jointly and at the same time."
"The problem with the building is not to do with the current team."
"On the contrary, we should be grateful for the efforts that they are making to resolve it."
"And this current sitting demonstrates this."
"Rather, I believe that the responsibility is to be found among previous teams, like, for example, Mr Quintela."
"Mr Quintela is responsible for half - or more - of the problems which have been created in this building."
"I think we should bear this in mind if, at some time, Mr Quintela wants to once again become involved in the works of the Parliament."
"And lastly, Mrs President, I believe that the only way to resolve all of this is to arrange a serious meeting between the SERS, the Parliament and the French Government."
"With regard to the French Government, I think the first thing they should do is find a new representative."
"I do not think that Mr Vaillant currently has the necessary sensitivity to offer the solutions that the French Government must offer."
"Lastly - and perhaps I am talking with my budgetary hat on - I would like to point out that, although we will eventually find out how much it is going to cost - because we will see every last invoice - what we will never know about are the additional costs there may have been because, at the moment, we still do not know exactly how much it is supposed to cost us."
"Thank you, Mr Fabra Vallés."
"In fact, I do not think the problem you mentioned is actually related to the building."
"In other words, the problem you are talking about is actually that of the scheduling of flights to Strasbourg and transport links to the city."
"Thank you for mentioning it, because it gives me the opportunity to make an announcement to you."
"Our visit to Strasbourg, last Wednesday, concluded in a meeting with the Mayor of the City of Strasbourg and his principal assistants."
"I pointed out the serious difficulties which many Members face in attempting to travel to the city of Strasbourg easily."
"I can tell you, Mr Fabra Vallés, that the Mayor was really very interested in my comments."
"He asked me to send him as soon as possible - which I will do, with your help, of course - a sort of summary of the actual situation for all the nationalities represented here."
"This morning I promise you - you understand I cannot achieve the impossible: I cannot promise you daily flights to your own capitals and vice versa - that I will do all I can, with the co-operation of the Mayor and the competent authorities, to appreciably improve the situation in this area too."
"I make this undertaking to you because what I want to achieve, and this is what I am responsible for, is that matters proceed in the best possible conditions, both in Brussels and in Strasbourg, for everyone: Members of Parliament, staff and visitors."
"Madam President, I am pleased that you have already broached the problems relating to communications. Prestigious as this building is from an architectural viewpoint (although it has a lot of space which cannot be used), there are, to my mind, communications problems in addition to what I would say are the building' s defects in terms of convenience."
"Now that we have a French President, I would have expected the French railways to have shown some interest and that the Belgian railways too, together with the French railways, would pull out all the stops to make our journeys here comfortable."
"Madam President, a train service has been axed rather than an additional one laid on."
"That is exactly what we did not need, and it was primarily the officials that alerted me to this fact, for those who have to stay until the end of the part-session can return to Brussels on a quarter to three train and then have a five hour journey ahead of them."
"This means that I will no longer be able to fulfil my evening commitments as I have a speaking engagement this evening."
"So the only other option open to me is to return earlier, which will be very early indeed."
"Had I left at quarter to ten this morning, I would have arrived in Brussels seven hours later, although today, as it happens, I might not have arrived at all for there is strike action going on too."
"But I digress."
"I wanted to point out to you that a five-hour train journey to get here and five hours back seems an inordinately long time in this day and age."
"After all, there are high-speed rail connections now, everything you could want."
"But not here."
"There is a prestigious building here but no high-speed rail service."
"I feel the two should in fact go together, but when I get to hear that the rail service that connects with the end of our part-sessions has been abolished then surely that is the complete opposite of what you would expect."
"Could you please do something about this too?"
"By the way, congratulations on all the small and large improvements that you have already been able to make, following great efforts on your part."
"I have no doubts on that score."
"Thank you for continuing on the subject of Mr Fabra Vallés' s speech and my own response, because when we contact you via your groups, your delegations, in order to draw up what I have called this summary, this inventory, we will be asking you to point out everything which can be improved, in addition to planes."
"I know, for example, that there were flights which Members found very practical which have been cancelled."
"I cannot tell you that they can be reinstated with a wave of a magic wand."
"But at least we will see what can be done."
"I shall therefore ask you to respond in as concrete terms as possible, as Mrs Maes has just done, by saying, for example, ""This train was very good, and it no longer exists."""
"We shall then try to make things easier, even if it is not perfect. I shall be in touch with you."
"We shall see in exactly what form very shortly."
"Madam President, I know you have certainly endeavoured to pick up on all the defects there are here."
"I think, however, we should take care not to put all the defects down to the architects, but we should rather look into our own court."
"There is one thing I find simply unforgivable."
"In countless motions for resolution, all of us in Parliament have stressed that renewable energies were the technologies of the future, the technologies of the 21st century."
"This week the UN presented a report pointing out that energy conservation would be one of the themes of the next decade."
"I find it unforgivable that we call for a One Million Roofs Solar Programme, but we have not invested in renewable energy either in Strasbourg or Brussels and have not adopted the slightest energy-saving procedures here: for example, the vestibules to our offices are lit up day and night and the lights cannot be switched off, and so forth."
"This is precisely what we called for in the Bettini Report seven years ago."
"There have been several exchanges of letters with the Bureau."
"Mr Priestley will inform you of this."
"I was told it would be too expensive."
"That is just incorrect and unacceptable."
"You know the costs of renewable energy would pay for themselves within nine to twelve months."
"How can we explain that to house builders in the Member States?"
"We are encouraging them to have solar roofs installed while we do not do the same with our own roof, even justifying it with the spurious argument that it is for reasons of cost."
"Energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, this is what we recommend day in day out in our resolutions!"
"Madam President, this is a very serious matter, as we lose our credibility if we do not lead by example, if we do not make it clear that these are the themes of the next millennium."
"If we do not put the principle into practice here ourselves, then we will also have lost some of our credibility."
"I therefore call upon you, as a matter of urgency, to correct the most unforgivable mistakes which have been made both here and in Brussels, and to immediately convene a working party to obtain quotes for setting things right."
"In addition, I would like to have an energy efficiency plan for both buildings."
"For I do not think we can afford to squander so much energy here while at the same time telling the general public that they must save energy."
"We are all familiar with the problems of carbon dioxide emissions and so on."
"Madam President, this is a very serious subject, which has not unfortunately been addressed by you here today."
"I would also like to receive an answer from you as to why this was not taken into account in the planning and how we can sort this out in future."
"We must resolve these problems and achieve this with emphasis on renewable energies, energy conservation and energy efficiency."
"I simply think we have a responsibility to the public to set a good example."
"For I believe we are all unanimous here in thinking that environmental problems are problems which we must resolve urgently."
"Mrs Breyer, thank you for mentioning all these very important problems."
"Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, I have to leave you now for the reasons I gave earlier, i.e. to attend the swearing in of the Commissioners."
"I leave you in the most capable hands possible, those of Mr Provan."
"I hope you continue to work well, and have a pleasant weekend. I sincerely hope, and I am convinced, that on October 4, when we meet here again, things will be running smoothly."
"Mr President, I am sorry to have lost the opportunity to bend Madam President' s ear."
"I wanted to ask her to plead with Air France not to switch, as is rumoured, its flight from City Airport to Gatwick - that is if the flight works, because this week it was cancelled."
"I wanted to thank her for being willing to give her personal attention to these matters."
"If we are navel-gazing and examining our working conditions and those of our staff this morning, it is not a question of comfort and convenience, but because we want to be efficient as elected representatives and in spending taxpayers' money."
"Strasbourg is indeed a beautiful city."
"If I was a tourist I would have no problem spending one week out of four here, it would be delightful."
"Many parts of this building are impressive and beautiful, although it is also, in my opinion, grandiose."
"I concur with what has been said about waste and the need for recycling and energy saving and I believe that we must practice what we preach both in the area of health and safety and energy saving."
"I would like to raise three particular points."
"First of all I am unhappy that we have lost one-third of our offices to an unnecessary bathroom."
"Please could I get mine removed and have extra office working space instead?"
"Secondly, in the ladies toilets we are faced with constant flooding, and it is particularly unfair on the cleaners who have to constantly go round mopping up."
"As far as I can see, it is a very simple problem of excessive water pressure so the water spills everywhere around the basin and on to the floor."
"Could someone reduce the water pressure?"
"Finally, could we start the session on a Thursday at 2 p.m. instead of 3 p.m. and have the votes on urgencies at 4.30 p.m."
"This would mean that I could catch the 6 p.m. flight, assuming of course it still exists, to City Airport."
"This might help a lot of people if we could leave on Thursday night instead of Friday."
"I am conscious of the fact that it costs, I think, around EUR 200 million a year extra to have this travelling circus and I am indignant that the European Parliament is unable to decide its own place of work."
"We are wasting taxpayers' money and we are not as efficient as we ought to be as elected representatives."
"I take my job seriously and I am sure all my colleagues have also come here to work, not to treat this place as a club, but to actually do their jobs as elected representatives."
"I want to be able to go back to my constituents and tell them that I am an efficient representative."
"Thank you Mrs Ludford."
"Let me assure you and all colleagues that notes are being taken of this discussion this morning."
"It will be brought forward as a series of proposals to the Bureau, and Mrs Breyer, if she is still here, should recognise the fact too that everything that has been said will be taken note of and will be fully discussed."
"I am of the opinion, which Mr Andrews expressed, that we should not forget how to be grateful."
"We should be grateful for the building, grateful for the working conditions which we now have in Strasbourg after 20 years and more of provisional arrangements."
"We should also be grateful for the style and manner in which our President is taking on board our criticism."
"That is worth repeating."
"I consider today 's question time to be an absolute novelty."
"Such a thing has not existed since the first direct elections in 1979."
"I would like to suggest that this is organised at specific intervals for other matters besides this."
"I consider discussion between the Parliament and the President to be very useful and necessary."
"As regards the concrete matters, I am of the view that this building is certainly very fine and worthy, but it is also necessary, of course, to make full and fitting use of it."
"Here I would like to take up what some Members have already said."
"In order to utilise this building efficiently, we must ensure that we spend the whole of our plenary part-sessions here, including the Fridays, so that we then have an entire week in which, as Mrs Ludford suggested, we can devote ourselves specifically to constituency matters."
"If we do not use this building properly, ending the plenary part-session as early as Thursday and making Thursday the last day of the week, then a backlog of work is created."
"This backlog of work leads to innumerable additional plenary part-sessions."
"Then we have a mishmash of sittings running from one week into the next."
"I propose ..."
"Mr Posselt, we are dealing with the problems of this building and not the problems of the agenda of the House."
"Can we please deal with the matter in hand."
"You have had well over a minute already."
"Can you make the point please?"
"In connection with this I would like to say that it is apparently only thanks to my intervention that it was possible, for example, for the cafeteria, to be opened today, or for certain services to operate."
"I would like to request that it be possible to use all the facilities of this building right through the week of the part-session from Monday to Friday."
"Mr President, I am one of those who believe that this building has made history, both in architectural terms and in the parliamentary world."
"For example, we have the greatest parliamentary chamber in the world at the moment, the best from a functional point of view."
"I know that I am not abiding by the agenda, because this is a sitting for discussing problems and I am not doing that."
"My opinion of this building is positive."
"But I have decided to take the floor because we run the risk of exaggerating the complaints, and anecdotes go down in history as if they were the opinion of the Parliament."
"I believe that we are talking about a piece of architecture which is difficult to understand and, on the other hand, this ""culture of complaint"" - which one colleague referred to - leads everybody to complain."
"I believe that if architecture is a conflict between form, function and space, then this has been resolved admirably."
"I believe that these initiatives to resolve the small problems are excellent but, in my judgement - and it is that of many of our colleagues - we should not forget that they are small problems which will be resolved and we have something for which we should congratulate the institutions, the French State, the architects and the workers."
"I believe it is important to highlight it."
"Mr President, I am one of those who would very much like to thank you, Mr Priestley, the ancillary and administrative staff."
"There have been problems but we have been treated with extreme kindness and courtesy."
"I would like to register my thanks for that."
"When problems arise they get solved."
"Like other colleagues I should like to say that the energy efficiency issue is terribly important and ought to be concentrated on."
"I should like to mention just two minor areas that need improvement."
"Even though I have something like six doctorates from five countries - most of them honorary, I have to admit - the instructions on how to use the telephones and how to set up the voice mail are nearly unintelligible."
"Office supplies - staplers, paper clips and little things like that - are very hard to come by."
"If those who have got the franchise for the newspaper shops could be encouraged to stock up with the kinds of things that efficient offices need. That would help us all."
"Mr President, unfortunately the bad press over this building has again focused attention on the question as to where the Parliament should be based, and this has been the case in the Netherlands too."
"Now I know that this is not the moment to start talking about this and we all know what the Treaty says."
"But still I would just like to seize this opportunity to remind the Presidency as well how difficult it is to explain to our voters why we are always having to move from one place to another, and also that this is something that severely tarnishes the Parliament' s ""dignité"" , to use a lovely French expression."
"I actually have a few specific questions to do with the building that my voters put to me."
"The first question is to what extent this building really was fully financed by France and really was a gift from the French government, for my voters want me to reassure them that the money they pay in taxes, in the Netherlands that is, has not been used for this."
"Secondly, I would like to know how much is paid in rent for this building."
"Thirdly, I have heard that there are plans afoot to buy the building because the rent amounts to rather a lot of money."
"I want to know what stage these plans are at and how much it all entails."
"Furthermore, I trust that all the complaints you have received, including those in writing, will continue to be given due attention."
"I do not wish to pursue this matter any further at this stage."
"Thank you Mrs van der Laan."
"The Secretary-General informs me that you will get a written reply to that specific question regarding the budgetary costs and the financing."
"Mr President, I am going to raise a few points, but my main point is on smoking, again."
"I have raised it several times with the President before and also with the Quaestors."
"I have been asked to write in but I thought it would be worth raising it here as well."
"As an asthmatic who has grave problems when I come into contact with a cigarette at all, I am finding it extremely difficult to move around this building."
"It has got a little better since the last time we were here."
"At least in the corridors people are not smoking."
"But I cannot get in and out of the hemicycle without encountering cigarettes."
"So I cannot do my work properly."
"I have to cover my face with paper towels and run through to my office."
"I had serious asthma attacks here."
"I cannot carry on with the smoking in this building."
"I should be grateful if you could actually do something about it so that at least outside the hemicycle I and other people like me do not have to encounter smoke."
"In the restaurants there is supposed to be a no-smoking area."
"It is not observed and also the no-smoking area is through the smoking area in all the restaurants."
"So if I want to get food I have to queue up in the smoking area or someone has to bring it to my office for me."
"I would also like to see exit signs in case of emergency."
"When the bell went off yesterday several of us did not even know where the stairs were."
"I personally have a great deal of sympathy with your remarks."
"The Quaestors have been asked to look at this again so that they can tighten up the regulations within the building."
"There will be a notice going to all Members regarding smoking and what they can or cannot do within the building."
"So I think you are making some progress."
"I understand that we may be able to have a discussion with the Council of Europe to see if it is possible to negotiate some sort of arrangement with them, but you should recognise the fact that we no longer, technically, have access to that building because we do not pay any rent for it any longer."
"Mr President, there is a slogan ""Black is beautiful."""
"I support it completely."
"At the present time in Germany I see, from region to region, that black is stronger than red or green."
"I consider this dominance to be a good thing."
"But, despite that, we should be a little wary."
"If too much black is used it can be rather dismal."
"There have been improvements to the lifts."
"I am pleased to see them."
"But for a bar to resemble a night club all day long, in spite of the pretty flowery carpet, is surely not a development we can accept."
"We have to be able to drink tea and coffee there."
"We wish to meet each other in full view and not as shadowy figures."
"I consider the business of the stairs to be rather more serious."
"I too have been stuck in the lift a few times."
"I am mobile enough to take the stairs down from the sixth or seventh floor."
"But all the steps there are completely black."
"I have seen male and female colleagues clinging anxiously to the banister, as they did not know where one step began and the other finished."
"We need safety areas, as this can be very dangerous."
"There is a danger of falling."
"Some Members think we should have far more colours."
"I have been working for 20 years in design."
"We should keep to the principles."
"The architects specified slate."
"Slate doesn' t have to be just black, it can be white or silver or grey."
"In other words, we have plenty of opportunities to make improvements using this colour scheme so that we do not have to work in a building in which not only does black express dignity but in which an excess of black leads to depression."
"We should carefully move towards silver and other colours."
"I believe that then we will finally be able to say that it stands for greater visibility, greater transparency, and we can show ourselves clearly instead of hiding ourselves."
"Mr President, I am also one of those who have an enormously positive view of the building."
"I believe that we have a historic building and that we must be the first to respect it and to project a positive image of it."
"And to the symbolic nature of our building, we should add its functionality."
"We should recognise, Mr President, that this building has a significant structural defect. In comparison with the building in Brussels the Members have much smaller offices, not in view of their smaller area in terms of square metres, but in view of the fact that Members have to share all their activities with an assistant."
"Anybody who appreciates the political activity of a Member, and the confidential nature of many of their conversations and activities, will understand that this is possibly the most serious structural defect and, as the President has pointed out, there is possibly no solution to it."
"Anyway, I think that we should continue to work towards trying to find a way for there to be a degree of independence between the Member and the assistant, given that our work requires this independence, with regard to conversations, the issues to be dealt with and also in other areas which are beside the point."
"And finally, Mr President, I would like to make another observation - and I understand that this is not an easy issue to resolve - with regard to any possible improvements to the access to this building from the city."
"There have been times - such as this week' s part-session, which has coincided with the fair - when there has been considerable disruption as far as access to the Parliament is concerned."
"This will happen again and I believe that analysing possible improvements to this access - at least during parliamentary weeks - would be a positive step."
"Mr President, I would first like to express my gratitude for the dynamic way in which the many different problems were tackled after the July part-session, but let us also not forget that this building was under construction for many years."
"For years we have seen from the other side of the water how there was already a great deal in place, which makes it all the more galling that even though it stood empty for so long, there are still so many defects."
"As far as I am concerned, we should not crow too much about this building."
"In the first place, it has been funded by Community money, be it French or European."
"We are talking very large sums of Community money."
"Secondly, I completely agree with those who say that the least we must do therefore, is lead by example."
"Consequently, I find it particularly galling that French legislation appears to focus heavily on the artistic décor in relation to impossible corridors, lights and stairwells, and appears not to concern itself with energy conservation, whilst in my country, for example, at least a third of all new homes are equipped with solar panels."
"There are two small points that I would still like to mention, the first being something strange that happened in July when I was doing a live radio interview from this building."
"I realised that the technicians were unable, at least this was the case at the time, to get an outside line from the radio studio."
"It was too silly for words, but I had to do a live interview on my mobile phone."
"Lastly, on the subject of waste separation, I became aware yesterday morning that although we have two bins for different types of waste in our rooms, which is itself a retrograde step, these two bins are emptied into the same bag."
"Thank you Mr van Dam."
"I do not know where you were when you discovered that."
"Mr President, I believe we can all be very proud of this magnificent building which will soon, I believe, be known throughout the world and which will add to the prestige of the Union."
"Before making a few observations, I would like to draw your attention to the matter of tastes and colours."
"Personally, I like these colours a lot. Perhaps I am in a tiny minority, but even so."
"You know, we could be discussing colours for hours on end."
"Just now a fellow Member said, "" I hope there will be some pink"" ."
"Well, I don' t like pink!"
"So I think we must try to be reasonable, to spend as little money as possible, and then we can all get used to it."
"However, I would like to add a detail regarding the specification."
"When we are told that the disabled access is not suitable for visitors, well, perhaps someone should have thought of that before."
"The specification was perhaps not precise enough, and I find it unfortunate that it is only now that we are noticing that disabled visitors do not have proper access."
"The improvements are going to cost us even more, but it is only because we did not plan things properly beforehand."
"A few thoughts, now, on the lifts."
"They go as far as level zero, there are glass doors which open to the outside, but we have no access to them."
"I would like to know why, as I think it is unfortunate."
"Regarding access by car, even though the red light is extremely unpleasant, I find it reasonable to be obliged to use the badge."
"On the other hand, being obliged to use it and still having to wait minutes on end to get out, I do not see the reasons for this."
"Being checked on entering, maybe, but as we go out? That is beyond me."
"I would also like to ask if it is possible to have a shuttle for our assistants and for the staff when there are meetings which last until 9 in the evening so that they do not have to take a taxi. I find it regrettable."
"Finally, the only thing that really bothers me is the reception as you enter this building."
"Compared with the reception area in Brussels or that in the former building, there is a vast difference, and there should be some thought on providing a far better reception."
"Thank you very much."
"If you have trouble getting into the garage, think of me coming from the United Kingdom with a car and the steering wheel on the other side which is even worse."
"Mr President, I have been fortunate enough to enter two new parliament buildings in the course of my political career."
"The first one was the Flemish Parliament around four years ago."
"In view of the fact that I was the official authorised to take responsibility for the buildings, I am well placed to draw comparisons between the opening of this building and the previous Parliament that I belonged to."
"I must say that I am in fact annoyed about the many shortcomings I have been able to discern in this building, with what I would say is almost a professional eye."
"I feel that the great interest in the building that is very much in evidence today bears witness to the fact that, to my mind, there was too little prior consultation with the Members of Parliament, with those who were to use the building."
"I think that there are lessons to be learnt from that for future reference."
"I want to make three points that may already have been made by some of my colleagues, but which serve to underline how important it could in fact be to bring about total change here."
"Firstly, the offices."
"I think our offices resemble a kind of glorified campsite."
"I think this is a classic example of the injudicious use of the space available."
"I therefore urge that adaptations be made, whatever the structural difficulties."
"But I think many of my colleagues will agree with me on this."
"Secondly, a great deal has been said about colours but I think that many psychologists would support my view that some colour schemes may produce severe depressive conditions, and that this particular colour scheme may be one of these."
"I hope not but time will tell."
"Thirdly, I feel that we are going to have to demonstrate greater efficiency and more streamlined procedures where the entrance to the visitors' gallery is concerned."
"It has been brought to my notice that some people had to pass through five different security points this week, before gaining admission to the visitors' gallery."
"And last but not least, we like to talk about transparency here."
"I believe it is important to talk about transparency, but I would also like there to be transparency as regards the cost price of the building, and I would also like to know what possibilities there are for recouping some of the costs arising from the building' s defects that have been noted here."
"Mr President, as a new Member here, I am not rising to criticise the architecture and decoration of the building, although quite clearly I could."
"I agree with those other Members who think it is absolutely awful, but that is a matter of individual taste."
"I wish to add my voice to the many comments that have already been made and say that I find it absolutely incomprehensible that we are even here in the first place, when we have perfectly good offices, meeting rooms and chambers in Brussels and that it is absurd that the whole ""Euro-circus"" has to come traipsing down to Strasbourg for three, possibly four days a month (5 days this week - I do apologise)."
"European taxpayers have read the extensive press coverage about this building and they possibly think that we are all mad."
"Those people who are in favour of building Europe should not be surprised that the public treat it with great scepticism."
"Regarding the costs, I would like a letter from Mr Priestley outlining the costs."
"Perhaps we should publicise it a bit more, although I suspect that would get us into even more trouble with the electorate."
"My main plea is that since a treaty change was required to bring us here in the first place, surely we can all lobby in our political parties, our Governments, to get a treaty change to take us away and spend the money on something useful that the people would appreciate."
"Mr Callanan, that process has being going on for many years and has not been successful."
"Mr President, in my first speech in this Chamber, I had hoped to speak about linking the banks of lifts electronically to make them more efficient, about ventilation in the bathrooms, about the air conditioning and about the dog-sick carpets in the bar areas."
"But in the interests of time, I will pass that by."
"I would like to respond to the first floor speaker today who asked if any Members had previously had better offices; we had such fine offices here, had we ever had better ones?"
"Well I certainly had a better one before I gave up the day job a year ago, and every single Member of this House has a much better office in Brussels."
"That surely is the key point."
"The reason for all the carping and complaints about this building is, as my colleague, Mr Callanan says, that actually we do not want to come here and we want to stay in Brussels."
"We ought to get that sorted out."
"Just one very brief suggestion for improving the general ambience of the place as long as we do have to come here."
"Our President, earlier on, said that we would look at the decoration of it."
"This building is full of dead spaces and blank walls which are extremely tedious and unfriendly and inhuman."
"I believe that the art museums of Europe have many more pictures and art works than they are able to display."
"They have cellars and vaults full of pictures for which no display space is available."
"Why does this Parliament not contact some of these museums and say that we can provide large spaces of wall on which some of these pictures could be displayed."
"I suggest that this would be a vast improvement in this building."
"Mr President, I must honestly say that this is the first building I have been in where I often find myself thinking, ""How would I get out of here if there were a fire?"""
"It is quite straightforward in certain places, but you cannot get over to the other side if you do not use the narrow bridges with the glass parapets."
"I really should like us as soon as possible to have a very realistic fire drill for all Members of Parliament, tradesmen, visitors etc., so that we know basically how to get out of the place."
"We talked earlier about the lifts being too small."
"There is talk about the staircases and, regarding these, I think it might be worth knowing what kind of materials have been used in them."
"If they can be re-painted, I should like to see the walls there being re-painted as well."
"Certainly I do not think that very much could be seen if the stairwells were filled with smoke, but you do not, in any case, feel particularly safe when it is completely dark and you do not know if the electricity is going to work in an emergency."
"A very realistic fire drill is absolutely necessary, then, before we perhaps discover that there is a real fire. In that way, we might at least be a little prepared and be able to find our way out of the building, as well as see if there are enough emergency exits."
"I am not too familiar with quite specifically what intellectual property law means in French legislation."
"I should be very glad indeed if I could find out what is copyright and what we can attend to in relation to possible costs."
"We are, in spite of everything, only here one week a month."
"Perhaps we can avoid a number of extremely high costs which are not directly necessary."
"One small wish that has been expressed for a number of years by the Scandinavian countries is that we should have access to the Scandinavian press here."
"I do not know if it is possible, but it is clearly desirable."
"It is not something uppermost on my wish list, but a comment all the same."
"Finally, I should like to say that, for Swedish electors, irrespective of which party they vote for, this travelling between two buildings under construction, meaning that irregularities cannot clearly be established, is not in fact defensible. Nor do I intend to defend it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly my thanks for the good things which have quite rightly been mentioned."
"I would like to mention three points."
"Firstly, services."
"The cleaning personnel always used to do their work very early."
"Arriving at the office at half past seven, one could work in peace."
"Now they come much later."
"If one wishes to be on time in the Chamber at 9 o' clock, the lifts are full of cleaning staff who take much longer to get in and out because they have their trolleys."
"Would it not be possible to ensure that the cleaning staff do not carry out their work at a time which is the peak time for the Members of Parliament?"
"The times we work are well known."
"Please give this further consideration."
"The second is again access to the garages."
"It has already been mentioned, but every time we are arriving or leaving with all our luggage, if we take advantage of the travel service, we have to cope with these colossal stairs."
"This is really hard with all your suitcases and papers."
"It is inadequate."
"I request that this be put to an end."
"The third point is the multiplicity of different cards."
"I have kept asking, whether it is not technically possible these days to have a single electronic card for everything."
"I do not know if you have noticed that the card which opens the garage has to be used the other way round to Brussels."
"That means you have to take the thing out every time, then you lose it and so on and so forth, because it gets dropped."
"These things are just unacceptable."
"I maintain that modern technology is such that these things can be combined into a single item."
"Then we wouldn 't have to carry around three, four or five different cards."
"Please look into this once more."
"I am assured that we will have one badge by the end of the year but your point about the cleaning staff is well made."
"I understand that already they have been told not to use the main lifts and should just be using the service lifts."
"But that does not seem to be happening."
"We have a time problem."
"Before you all rush to go, the Secretary-General has agreed that, because so many of you are still on the list of speakers, we will treat any letters that come in rather like an explanation of vote which will be published in the Minutes of today, provided you get your letters in by the end of next week so that you can make your point."
"Mr President, I should like to say one thank you and make four short points."
"The thank you is to the President, Mr Priestley and his team, and our Quaestors for the way they have taken up the points we have been raising since the last meeting."
"There have been many improvements which we have noticed, not least the very helpful guides who are around to help us when we get lost."
"The four brief points: the first is air conditioning."
"Mrs Lynne may have problems with smoky air."
"I have problems with no air in some of the meeting rooms."
"I hope they can get that right."
"If they can get it right for our offices, it should be able to work in our meeting rooms too."
"Secondly, when we leave this Chamber we are met with a scrum."
"I would like to see the area outside the Chamber deemed to be part of the Chamber so that no cameras, assistants, lobbyists or members of the public block us from reaching our offices."
"The area around the back, including the bridges across to the lifts should be seen as part of the Chamber, and not accessible to the public."
"Thirdly, concerning the lifts, I have been stuck twice in a lift - which might not surprise you if you look at me."
"The first time somebody jumped up and down and the lift started again."
"The second time somebody found a bit of plastic, put it into a hole in the wall and that seemed to start the lift up again, but it might have fused the whole system."
"Lastly, I ask that the flexes and loose wires in our offices be looked it."
"This is a health and safety at work issue."
"When I spin round on my desk chair to access my email I am entangled in a mess of wires."
"One of these days there will be a puff of smoke, a loud bang and one of your Members will light up like a Christmas tree."
"No, I do not have a point of order to make, I entered my name a very, very long time ago, right at the start."
"I entered my name at the same time as Mrs Berger."
"My name was already on the list. I particularly wanted to speak too."
"I am afraid that we still have 20 people on the list of speakers, so you are not alone."
"The Secretary-General has agreed that he will take written letters from you that will be published later."
"Then, you could have said so far earlier."
"In that case I would have left the Chamber and followed the discussion from my office, where I could also have got on with my work."
"I am sorry, but I have no control in a debate like this over how long people are going to speak."
"Mr President, I also came here specially this morning to participate in the discussion."
"I would like to know when the schedule was decided."
"I have just realised that in fact this debate was scheduled to run from 9.00 to 10.30."
"I would therefore like to thank you, even so, for letting the Members of Parliament continue to express their views beyond 10.30."
"I shall send you a comment in writing."
"Nonetheless, I shall hope that in three months' time, at the end of the year, we may once again have a meeting of this type in order to ascertain what follow-up there has been to the requests presented today."
"I will certainly pass that message on to the President."
"I thank all colleagues who have stayed this morning."
"The Conference of Presidents decided how long the session would be."
"We have well overrun the time."
"It is very important that we note for the future that this has been a fairly successful session."
"Perhaps we need to do it again."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"Written submissions concerning the Louise Weiss building"
"While I recognise that the building is beautiful from the outside and that my office is more than adequate for the Strasbourg week, I would like to take this opportunity to point out some of my concerns:"
"drawer units in the offices (in the process of being solved)"
"slowness of lifts and colour of the paint (in the process of being solved)"
"poor working conditions for people operating photocopiers"
"poor working conditions for chauffeurs"
"poor working conditions for people working in the Members' cash office"
"poor working conditions for people working in the Members' cafeteria"
"difficulties of movement for disabled people"
"few WCs - which are also dark - (at least in the TOUR building), and which are insufficiently ventilated and cleaned."
"We cannot allow a building, which has cost, and will continue to cost, the taxpayer so much money, to have so many functional problems."
"Madam President, as I was not allowed to speak in the debate, I hereby submit my intervention in writing, as announced by the President chairing Friday morning' s sitting."
"He was right to point out that this debate is not the time to state whether we are for or against having the Parliament based in Strasbourg."
"It is all the more incomprehensible then that he should systematically refuse the floor to MEPs who want to speak in defence of Strasbourg, in response to the attacks on this city which he has allowed others to voice quite freely."
"I protest strongly at this extremely biased way of conducting the debate, which appears to be an abuse of the Agenda."
"We have a British gentleman, Lord Bevin, to thank for the choice of Strasbourg as the seat for the Council of Europe, because he saw this city as a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, and of reconciliation between all Europeans."
"We are now at a time when we must go back to fundamental principles, to rise up and outline for our citizens the horizons of our continent' s peace-loving organisation, which respects human rights and is founded on a European model of economic and social development."
"Bearing this in mind, what do the colours of our buildings' walls or the pressure of our toilet flushes matter?"
"Any citizen listening to us is going to ask us if we have nothing more urgent to discuss than the details of our own comfort!"
"I am not denying that this building would benefit from some improvements."
"Anyone who is keen on the use of new buildings, as I am, realises that it takes some time to break them in; in six months time, we will have forgotten these details."
"I would also like to thank the President, for having shown such great interest in particular problems, and I would especially like to thank and encourage all the staff for their genuine and determined efforts, the effects of which have been very evident this month."
"We are all concerned about putting the European taxpayer' s money to good use, and I was extremely sorry to hear our Dutch colleague leaping to the defence of ""her"" taxpayers in an outburst which she felt was appropriate, but which actually showed utter contempt for any concept of European solidarity."
"Well, I want her to know that my citizens, whom I do not claim to be my own, but whose honour and taxes I shall defend, have, themselves, contributed to the financing of these buildings, and the vast majority of them are extremely proud of this fact."
"Without matching the huge sums spent on the buildings in Brussels, the European Parliament has, henceforth, a worthy seat which is bound to encourage all those who visit it and work there to act with dignity and with a sense of duty."
"I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague James Provan on his excellent chairing of the debate which was the first I attended with him presiding and which proved to be an interesting and useful exercise with the aim of improving the conditions of our working environment."
"I would like to state that, although like many members I too regret the travelling circus between the various homes of the European Parliament, I am perfectly satisfied with my office design in Strasbourg, particularly if a lockable filing cabinet is installed as promised."
"I also value the luxury of a private toilet, unlike Baroness Ludford."
"However, I would like to make a strong plea for the urgent installation of a powerful extractor fan in the toilet to avoid the embarrassment of what might happen if a visiting guest to one' s office avails himself of the toilet shortly after the member has used it (this problem also exists incidentally in the Brussels office toilets)!!"
"I also regret the lack of TV monitor screens in the bar and restaurant areas which should be available to members having a coffee break to follow the debates in progress and, if due to speak, to time their entries back into the chamber appropriately."
"Could it be deliberate policy that TVs are not there to ensure that members stay in the chamber rather than hang around in the bars watching the debates"
"Lastly, I dislike the garish design and colour scheme of some of the carpeting in the bar areas, reminiscent, as pointed out by another Member, of a cheap night-club rather than the desired dignified atmosphere of this house."
"Similarly the beautiful cream coloured carpets used in some of the committee rooms I predict will be irreversibly stained and soiled within 3 months and rendered unusable, making it a very poor and impractical choice of colour and ultimately a waste of resources."
"1."
"""Request to speak"" system"
"This does not seem to work."
"I registered my request by pressing a button on the console but was not registered on the speakers list."
"As a result, I had to revert to waiving my arms!"
"2."
"Lifts - C Bank"
"These lifts still do not appear to be working smoothly."
"Link call buttons to all four lifts: one has to press two buttons to call lifts."
"Programming should be improved."
"The lifts are slow to arrive."
"They stop at floors unnecessarily, overload and jam."
"The outside glass of the building is dirty."
"There is also miscellaneous dirt on the concrete beams."
"3."
"Lifts - Glass near hemicycle (Access to press, radio and TV rooms)"
"Several are out of order."
"They are very slow to come."
"They overload too easily."
"Programming should be improved."
"4."
"Dining Room IPE IV"
"Service is extremely slow (this may be due to the distance between the dining room and kitchen or perhaps there are not enough waiting staff)."
"The food is less interesting than IPE 1 dining room (especially no buffet)."
"The room lacks character (layout and design should be improved)."
"5."
"Quiet sitting areas outside hemicycle"
"More chairs and tables are needed."
"6."
"Bars"
"These need to be accessible quickly and without a scrum."
"7."
"Fire Escape"
"What do we do"
"8."
"Flights to Strasbourg from Scotland"
"Flights via Brussels - overbooking."
"Flights via Paris - lost luggage, tight connections."
"Flights via London City - cancelled flights."
"Flights via London Heathrow - none."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 17 September."
"Statement by the President"
"As you know, on the morning of 21 September, a terrible earthquake, measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale, struck the island of Taiwan."
"Several thousand people were killed or seriously injured and there has been enormous material damage."
"I would like to express, on behalf of the European Parliament, my deepest sympathy and sincere feeling of solidarity towards the victims of this tragedy and towards their families."
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the sitting of 17 September have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, Mr Van Buitenen' s fate has repeatedly come up for discussion in this Parliament and there have been repeated calls for his rehabilitation."
"I want to express how delighted I am about the solution reached, whereby the action being taken against Mr Van Buitenen has been stopped. This means it is now possible for him to be taken on in another position."
"I hope he will be able to work in the Parliament."
"Thank you, Mrs Maes."
"I shall take note of your statement even though it does not relate to the Minutes."
"If there are no more comments, I shall submit the Minutes for your approval."
"(The Minutes were adopted)"
"Madam President, I would simply like to make the Members aware of the fact that, last week, there was a serious earthquake in the Mexican state of Oaxaca."
"Given that the European Union is currently concluding the negotiation of an agreement with Mexico, I would be grateful if this Parliament would express its solidarity and sympathy for the victims of this earthquake."
"Absolutely, Mr Salafranca Sánchez. I shall be happy to do that on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole."
"Madam President, I submitted a question for Question Time in accordance with Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure and I adhered to the time frame contained in Annex II A(13) which stipulates, ""Questions shall be tabled to the President at least one week before Question Time begins."
"Questions not tabled within this time limit may be taken during Question Time with the consent of the institution concerned."""
"However, the question was rejected by the competent service because a term appears on the back of the form that is different to the term used in the Rules of Procedure."
"Firstly, I wonder whether it is correct that a form can amend a ruling."
"Secondly, in any case, the Rules of Procedure stipulates that, even if a question is tabled after the deadline, the question is admissible if the institution concerned agrees."
"Instead, a completely different procedure has been followed."
"Given that the Rules of Procedure were approved by Parliament, whereas the form was produced by internal bureaucracy, I am wondering whether bureaucracy should prevail, or whether what the citizens' representatives voted for should prevail instead."
"Thank you, Mr Speroni."
"There is one point at least on which I can give you satisfaction straight away."
"Obviously, a form cannot amend a Rule of Procedure."
"This being the case, we will look into the matter and see if we can give you a satisfactory answer, particularly on the problem of abuses."
"Agenda"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The draft agenda has been distributed and the following amendments have been proposed or included."
"Relating to Tuesday President."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has requested that the Commission make a statement on the French Government' s refusal to lift the ban on British beef."
"This is an issue which could possibly be raised in the context of the Commission' s statement on food safety which is tabled for Tuesday morning."
"I give the floor to Mrs Lynne, who would like to make this request."
"Madam President, under Rule 111 of the European Parliament' s Rules of Procedure, I propose an amendment to the agenda of this part-session to include a statement by the Commission about the French Government' s refusal to lift the beef ban and its decision to stop UK beef crossing its territory, which is a vital route into Spain and Italy."
"I should be grateful if the statement could be followed by a short debate as provided for under Rule 37."
"The Commission agreed that British beef is safe."
"Scientific evidence proves that British beef is safe."
"The French Government, as far as I know, has no new evidence."
"Stringent safeguards are in place in the UK, yet one state - France - is going to opt out of the Commission ruling."
"It will damage the internal market if this state of affairs is allowed to continue; it will damage the credibility of the Commission and it will further damage British farmers."
"BSE has already cost the UK GBP 1.5 billion in lost exports."
"British farmers have been patient for the last two-and-a-half or three years during the negotiations."
"They have abided by the rules."
"They have even destroyed animals with no sign of BSE."
"At long last the beef ban was lifted."
"Now they are confronted with a new attack on their industry."
"We need an urgent statement and debate."
"I hope time can be made for this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, those of you who have been Members of this Parliament in previous years know that there are very few people in this House who have concerned themselves so labour- intensively and, one might almost say, as enthusiastically with the question of the safety of meat, particularly British beef, as I did when I was the chair of the last BSE Committee."
"A report once said that I ought to know every single cow in Great Britain by name."
"That is not the case."
"Herr Schmid thinks I know every other cow by name, well that is not true either, but I do know at least some of them."
"I am the last person who wants to see unsafe meat anywhere in the European Union."
"This Parliament saw to it that the Committee of Enquiry was set up."
"We took care to ensure that, within the scope of the BSE debate, loopholes which still existed in many areas of legislation on foodstuffs were eliminated."
"Parliament can be proud, on the whole, of what it has achieved in the last five years."
"But we achieved it by working seriously and rationally."
"That means, among other things, doing one thing at a time and in a well-founded way."
"I am full of sympathy for fellow Members when they complain that one Member State is not complying with Union legislation."
"Indeed, I am thankful that my own country, Germany, was not criticised some time ago for a similar attempt."
"Madam President, on your interesting initiative, we will have a comprehensive debate on food safety tomorrow, that is to say, on food safety as a whole."
"There is so much more to it than meat; there is so much more to it than dioxins or sludge or swine fever."
"It is a debate on the safety and quality of foodstuffs."
"This is why we also wish, at some time in the future, to discuss food safety in the European Union with the President of the Commission himself, Mr Prodi."
"If we wish to take away the comprehensive nature of the debate, if we wish to change this debate, then the easiest way to do so would be to add the British beef issue to the proceedings."
"Then tomorrow, we will have yet another debate on BSE."
"I would happily run such a debate!"
"I have no problem with that. I even believe I know the many files almost off by heart."
"I could do it."
"But I do not think that we should do that."
"I believe for a quite different reason that we should not do that."
"Two days ago, the French food agency expressed doubts regarding the safety of British beef."
"I have not yet read any document on the subject."
"I have not yet seen anything in writing on the subject."
"The appropriate committees on agriculture or the environment have not yet had time to look into the matter."
"I would like to have a serious debate on the matter."
"I therefore request, Madam President, that we do not debate the question tomorrow but rather in two weeks time, if it is still necessary, so that the appropriate committees can look into the matter, and that tomorrow we should debate the topic on the agenda, i.e. foodstuffs ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I understand, Madam President, that there was one speaker in favour of the suggestion, and another speaker, who has just resumed her seat, putting forward the idea that there should be a debate on this matter at the end of this month in the second October part-session."
"Are you going to put both propositions to the vote?"
"No, we cannot do this."
"This proposal comes from the Liberal Group."
"It has been put forward by Mrs Lynne and aims to include in this part-session a debate on the subject which has been mentioned."
"We have heard Mrs Lynne speak on behalf of the Liberal Group. We have heard one speaker against, Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"Now, I shall ask if there is a speaker in favour of the proposal."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt did not keep to the subject."
"We accept the importance of a debate in Parliament on food safety but the proposal made was for an urgent debate on the question of whether a Member State has the right to decide for itself in accordance not with Community policy but with what suits its own political aspirations at a particular time."
"This is a very urgent matter and deserves to be debated as a matter of urgency, because it is a threat to the free market."
"If other Member States then proceed to behave in the same sort of way, this could lead to individual items being banned in every Member State in the Community at different times, and there will be no guarantee that the single market, which we worked so hard in this Parliament to bring about and to consolidate, will work properly."
"I agree with the proposer of the motion that this is most urgent and should be discussed here immediately."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Madam President, in my opinion, Parliament should not waste this opportunity of issuing a statement on the mandate for the round of talks with the World Trade Organisation, because the Council of Ministers will give this mandate to the Commission on 13 October, and it would be completely wrong if this mandate were given without knowing the European Parliament' s opinion."
"I would also like to remind you all that only a few weeks ago, when approving the Commission, the Parliament approved a declaration in which it stressed its desire to be involved in influencing the negotiation of international agreements, at the different stages of the negotiations, so it would truly be a shame if Parliament neglected to take advantage of this opportunity."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very sorry to have to contradict my honourable friend, Mrs Hautala."
"At the Conference of Presidents, between the group chairmen, we agreed by a clear majority that we did not want a resolution on the WTO at the present time because we still need to have discussions, and we should not now draw up a summary motion for a resolution just to gain popularity in certain quarters."
"We therefore abide by our decision, also out of solidarity with our vote at the Conference, not to rush the job through now."
"Mrs Hautala, as regards the representatives of Parliament at the WTO Conference in Seattle, we unanimously stated that the European Parliament must be represented numerically by 15 Members of Parliament just as the American Congress claims the right to do, that is to say, this position remains unaffected regardless of whether we adopt a resolution here or not."
"For my group I say: we wish to be represented on equal terms with the Americans but, at the present point in time, we are against a statement from Parliament on the matter."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Relating to Thursday: President."
"Relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance, I have received three requests from the Greens/ALE Group, the GUE/NGL Group and the ELDR Group who would like to enter a new item entitled ""Nuclear Accident in Japan"" ."
"Pursuant to our Rules of Procedure, we must, as you know, in the event that we accept this new item being registered, remove an already existing item."
"Therefore, I shall put the first request to the vote, which proposes entering the item ""Nuclear Accident in Japan"" , which would mean removing the item ""Earthquake in Taiwan"" ."
"Madam President, it seems to me that there has been some misunderstanding here, as there are two proposals: one which proposes that the point concerning the accident in Ustica be replaced, and another which proposes that the point concerning the earthquake in Taiwan be replaced."
"I think there has been a misunderstanding and many Members of this Parliament do not know exactly which proposal they are voting for."
"I am sorry that we are in the process of taking a vote, but this is the situation."
"Perhaps I have not made myself sufficiently clear, Mr Barón Crespo, and I apologise."
"I was talking about the first proposal which aims to replace the item ""Earthquake in Taiwan"" with a new item titled ""Nuclear Accident in Japan"" ."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"I, too, am pleased about the decision that has been made not to fire Mr Van Buitenen, but I would ask you to put the matter on the agenda for the next meeting of the Conference of Presidents, as the grounds for the decision are completely unacceptable."
"Mr Van Buitenen' s crime consists in having given documentation to a President of the EU Parliament."
"That can hardly be a crime!"
"These grounds must therefore be changed, and that is why I would ask you to put the issue on the agenda for the Conference of Presidents."
"Madam President, I have a request for information about a matter of order."
"I am not sure if one is entitled to make an explanation of vote at this stage in this debate, but if so, I would like to say that I think, from the point of view of people in Scotland, it is a great pity that we will debate food safety tomorrow, without including a case where a Member State is defying the Community judgement on food safety."
"That is why I voted for that motion."
"Thank you, Mr MacCormick."
"I think that you will have ample opportunity to raise that point during the debate."
"Madam President, I wanted to express my deepest thanks for dealing promptly with the difficulties which we reported to you during the last part-session."
"I can now use my fax machine as it is located in a position appropriate to my height."
"Thank you very much."
"Madam President, I would like to a propose a procedural motion on the layout of the new Chamber."
"In the old Chamber, the President sat in front of a display of flags which symbolised all the countries of the European Union."
"I see that in the new Chamber, this display has disappeared."
"We can all notice it."
"I would therefore like to ask the following question: Has our House thought carefully about this matter, or has it been quite the contrary, a case of the services taking a decision on their own on a matter which strikes me as extremely symbolic and important?"
"Mr Berthu, I can reassure you straight away in a way which I am sure will satisfy you."
"I have ordered this display which, unfortunately, has been delayed. It will be here tomorrow."
"(The sitting was closed at 5.35 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam, I would just like to mention that my name is not included in the list of those present."
"I was present yesterday and I forgot to sign in."
"Fine, we will record you as being present."
"Are there any further comments?"
"(The Minutes were adopted)"
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"I would like to remind you that in its sitting on 16 September, Parliament postponed the final vote on Mrs Pack' s report on this matter."
"Pack (PPE), rapporteur."
"(DE) Madam President, I should like to ask that we reject the request for urgent debate."
"During the last part-session of Parliament, we did not see any requests for urgent debate because we still wanted to give the Council and the Commission the opportunity to have a proper look at our amendments and to also evaluate them and perhaps even comply with them."
"It is not acceptable that, during the summer recess, we should, in no time at all, have responded to the Council' s request by producing a report, and that the Council should then not even have taken note of what we had proposed by way of amendments, let alone thought of complying with them."
"We expect that, by the time of the next part-session in October, the Council will have told us which of our amendments it has accepted and which it has not."
"At the last part-session in Brussels, Chris Patten told us that he too would examine these proposals and would then present one of his own."
"I believe that if, by means of its proposals, Parliament is speaking up for more efficiency in spending tax revenue, the Council should not do the opposite."
"If, in fact, money ever disappears or gets lost in the wheels of administration, then it is always the Commission which is to blame and never the Council."
"We should like, as this agency gets off the ground, for everything really to be perfectly clear, for the administration to be stringent, for the headquarters of the Agency for Reconstruction in Thessaloniki to be closely linked to the headquarters of the Stability Pact (also in Thessaloniki) and for the Kosovo Agency to be an operational component of this in Kosovo."
"We also want the administrative structures to be so strict that the processes through which money is spent are precisely visible."
"I should like here to contradict anyone who maintains that reconstruction in Kosovo will not be possible if we do not take a vote here today."
"That is nonsense."
"The EU Commission' s Task Force is already working in the area itself."
"It is doing this and, ladies and gentlemen, you all know very well that the Commission never pays up very quickly and that we cannot therefore say: today it issues its instructions and tomorrow it pays."
"It can confer the assignment today, and when, in October, the amount required has been estimated, it will then pay, perhaps in November or December at the earliest - as always, unfortunately, very belatedly."
"We are not the ones who are impeding the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"It is the Council which will be doing this if it does not soon follow us on the path that we have embarked upon here."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee agrees with Mrs Pack' s remarks."
"The Council' s decision is also not anticipated for this week, so that no delay is to be expected."
"What is more, neither the Committee nor Parliament has yet received an official response from the Council to our representations."
"For this reason, I would ask that the request for urgent debate be rejected."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"Public health and food safety"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on public health and food safety."
"Mr Florenz, I can assure you that, in the course of the three-way discussion which we shall have tomorrow morning, I shall notify the President-in-Office of the Council that the European Parliament is actively in favour of the Council being represented at our debates."
"Madam President, Mr Prodi, I know that I was not very forbearing with you at the last part-session."
"I am therefore saying today, quite openly too, that I should like to have heard the speech you made today before now."
"It was very good. If you also really mean what you just said, then you may yet become a hero of mine."
"You have not occupied that position in the past, but I am prepared to think again."
"Until now, I have only wanted to place David Byrne in that position."
"What, then, are we talking about here today, Mr Prodi?"
"You have made it clear. We are talking about the safety of our citizens, about health and about consumer protection in the European Union."
"Let me, therefore, touch upon three points to which you also referred to some extent in your speech."
"First of all, what we call the precautionary principle."
"This must be the dominant goal of the policy of the European Union and of all its institutions."
"I shall give you an example, Mr Prodi, which you will certainly understand. This principle must be as important for us in the European Union and have as high a priority as, for example, the criterion of price stability for the European Central Bank."
"Have you understood this?"
"I hope so, Mr Prodi."
"The Member States have not understood this."
"The Council has still not understood it."
"It is also your task to get this message across."
"We shall do our bit. That you can be certain of."
"The Council and the Member States are still light years away from this attitude."
"Therefore, work together with us in this area."
"Secondly: what does the precautionary principle actually mean?"
"It is about closing the loopholes that still exist in legislation."
"You therefore referred to a White Paper which David Byrne presented at the hearing in the European Parliament and for which we were very grateful to him."
"What ought this White Paper to contain?"
"It must be very ambitious, Mr Prodi."
"I would quote here for you, in summary form only, a number of tasks which must be indispensable component parts of this White Paper."
"These include safeguard clauses for foodstuffs."
"At present, the European Commission is still not allowed to issue any safeguard clauses relating to foodstuffs."
"It only has this right in the veterinary field, and that is a flaw."
"Let us consider the area of supervisory authority."
"When it comes to supervision in third countries, we may not exercise any supervisory authority in respect, for example, of fruit and vegetables."
"This is a shortcoming."
"Consider the so-called rapid alert system, the early warning system."
"This must be improved."
"You touched upon this subject, and I am grateful to you for doing so."
"However, I should also like to tell you how it can be improved."
"It must be made transparent."
"At present, the Member States pass on information to the Commission in confidence."
"This means that you, Mr Prodi, and you, Mr Byrne, have no right at all to inform our citizens about any dangers."
"This must be changed."
"This is not the sort of transparency which you and I value. This is not an instance of keeping the public informed."
"It must be possible to improve the ways in which supervision is itself controlled in the Member States."
"The supervisory office in Dublin must have the ability to exercise supervisory authority in the Member States as soon as there are grounds for suspicion, and it must also have investigative powers."
"We need legislation in connection with feedingstuffs."
"You have referred to this subject, and I say again that we need a positive list and we need supervisory controls in the field of feedingstuffs."
"We do not have any of this."
"We need the duty of declaration, something which I and my colleagues, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Böge, have been demanding since the BSE scandal."
"All this, Mr Prodi, must be achieved by the Commission before the end of 1999."
"It is on this basis that I shall be assessing whether you really want to achieve your ambitious goals."
"You have time before the end of the year to complete this White Paper."
"We in the European Parliament will then have time in the year 2000 to work on this. That is our task."
"We must change and improve the systems of supervision and monitoring."
"We have established that they do not work."
"For example, I am still calling for a dioxin register."
"I have already done this once before in this Chamber."
"We need a dioxin register which also includes other sources of dioxin such as incinerating plants and other facilities."
"In this way, you can see the close, two-way connection between environmental policy and consumer protection and vice versa."
"The two cannot be separated."
"The one is crucial to the other."
"How can it be, Mr Prodi, that fish for human consumption may have higher dioxin levels than meat?"
"You need to change this."
"The reports on residual matter which the Member States have, after a fashion, submitted to the Commission in recent years must be checked more thoroughly and more quickly."
"On the subject of antibiotics, why has more still not been done, Mr Prodi?"
"We have known for months that a number of antibiotics in animal feed produce forms of resistance in humans."
"I therefore urge you to do something now, before the end of the year."
"Mr Florenz has touched on the subject of pesticides."
"There are more and more reports about the damage done to health and the environment by obsolete pesticides which no longer make sense in scientific terms."
"We need regulations to ensure that these are harmless."
"I come now, Mr Prodi, to your, and my, favourite subject, and to the end of my speech."
"This is the third of my three points and concerns your ""agency"" ."
"I put inverted commas around this, however the interpreters may translate these."
"What, then, do we want, Mr Prodi? What do you and I want?"
"We want the best scientific expertise, we want transparency in everything and we want safe and harmless products for the citizens of the European Union."
"Is that what we have then Mr Prodi?"
"I say to you, ""yes"" , we have a large part of this."
"During the BSE scandal, we ensured that the European Union' s scientific committees were restructured and that scientists are now appointed under an open appointments system, that their past careers and financial interests are known about and that the agendas, minutes and also minority opinions expressed are published on the Internet."
"That is what I want."
"I want transparency at a high level."
"I do not, however, want what I fear you yourself want."
"I do not want industry exercising influence."
"You mentioned as an example the Medical Agency in London."
"It has the task of authorising drugs produced through biotechnology, and that is how it earns its money."
"If you make an agency responsible for doing this, then it is also responsible to industry."
"That is the wrong way to proceed, Mr Prodi, and I hope that you too will appreciate this very soon."
"With regard to what you are proposing, we must make it quite clear that we do not only want scientific expertise but also the exercise of supervision."
"If you were to discover today in the Commission, Mr Prodi, that there was a problem area in relation to the protection of plants, then you would have to be able to call upon the scientists to organise an investigation quickly, and I should like to be able to exercise supervision over them."
"Whatever else is created, there must therefore be a body of some kind, a subordinate authority."
"Whether we establish this on your own premises, Mr President, or at the joint research centre which we already have in the European Union or whether we locate it somewhere else, it is all the same to me."
"For me, the important things are supervision and transparency."
"Finally, I would say Mr Prodi (and with this I end my speech) that if we want to ensure that our citizens regain the confidence of which you have spoken, then we must be democratic."
"I assume, Mr Prodi, that this proposal for an agency, as you call it, is to be put before Parliament."
"You said that you had still not decided."
"Then I can only say that you have been lucky!"
"It is this Chamber which must decide, and it is not you in the Commission who decides. In this way, we shall certainly arrive at a satisfactory solution."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Madam President, President Prodi, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to return, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt did just now, to the dioxin crisis and Belgium, of course, without necessarily discussing it as a purely Belgian problem."
"The recent Standing Veterinary Committee of the Union took the decision, a fortnight ago, to lift the embargo on Belgian beef exports, thus recognising the serious nature of the tests and the strictness of the standards which are now imposed by the new Belgian Government."
"The meat produced today in Belgium is henceforth certified as being of excellent quality, and may now return to its former position on the market."
"In fact, it seems to me that the European Union would be well advised to follow this example in promoting systematic testing for PCB and dioxin in all States, as this is not the case at the moment."
"It would be remiss of me not to mention the creation in Belgium of an agency for food safety, responsible for monitoring the entire food chain from beginning to end."
"Victims of a crisis which they did not cause and whose consequences they have no control of, Belgian farmers, moreover, are waiting for concrete evidence of European solidarity, so that this dioxin crisis may be recognised as epizootic, in the same way as the mad cow crisis in Great Britain."
"This, in my opinion, is the price of Community solidarity."
"We must now, four months after the start of the crisis, rise above the emotional atmosphere - you mentioned it too, Mr Prodi - which has often dominated the debate until now."
"It is not, as I said, an acute problem limited to Belgium, but is, indeed, a case with a European dimension."
"What do we want to eat?"
"What level of quality do we want for our consumers?"
"How can we guarantee this quality?"
"It is our way of life, as you said, Mr President."
"To do this, then, the Union must invest more in the safety of the food chain, at every stage of the process, and decide, for example - as we have discussed - whether or not it is useful to create this agency, this notorious independent food agency, supposedly inspired by an American model or some other such thing."
"I note your various proposals, Mr Prodi, particularly citizens' access to the early warning system; and Commissioner Byrne' s proposal on the White Paper."
"Having said that, the questions remain: when will this actually happen?"
"What is the timetable for these proposals?"
"I would also like to ask you a question too: to what extent does the Union, in fact, use, if at all, its own resources, such as, for example, the research centre into health and food safety located at Ispra?"
"As the elected representatives of the citizens primarily affected by all these stakes, which are crucial, this Parliament must play an essential role in this area."
"The vote on the next budget, including a series of amendments designed to draw the initial lessons from this dioxin crisis, will indicate whether we have decided to lead the way or not."
"Madam President, President Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, after hearing Mr Prodi' s proposals, I am utterly astounded by the position of the PPE and the PSE on food safety."
"Perhaps they do not feel capable of putting forward concrete proposals today, but we do."
"That is why we wished to propose a resolution for, throughout Europe, the series of scandals which have occurred means that, today, the citizens and consumers no longer have any confidence in their farmers."
"The quibbling involved in stating that the Committee on the Environment has scheduled a hearing on animal feedingstuffs should not be an obstacle to the debate."
"Of course, one can listen to the experts on a small part of the subject, but the fact remains that we, as Members of Parliament, must take initiatives."
"It seems to me that what the citizens expect of Parliament and the Commission are initiatives."
"Adopting a resolution today would have been a clear sign on this subject."
"From the recent past and its frenzied emphasis on high productivity, we have inherited a situation which, in the agricultural sector just as - too often - elsewhere, has subordinated policy to the major food-processing groups and major distributors resulting in mad cows, dioxin-contaminated chickens, motor oil in cooking oil, sewage sludge in cattle meal, and who knows what else?"
"There is a long list of scandals which show that, as regards agricultural production, European States have been no more virtuous than their American counterparts, even if they have banned hormones."
"We should have the courage to say so."
"The recent attempts by some governments to control these industries are still insufficient."
"What is more, a good number of European States have not taken any action."
"In order to achieve this, we need regulations which prioritise the precautionary principle which the Greens have long cherished."
"In addition, we must agree on the meaning of this principle."
"For us it means getting back to the quality of foodstuffs which guarantees the safety of products intended for consumption."
"We are first of all asking for a list of all the toxic substances which can contaminate our food through pollution, be it of air, water, or soil."
"We are asking for regular tests in branches of industry where there have been problems with toxicity, and inspections in agricultural areas located in the vicinity of firms creating pollution."
"We are asking for traceability at all levels, not just in the labelling of the products that go into the housewife' s shopping basket, but also beforehand."
"We want to ascertain the exact content of products which go into cattle feed."
"Finally, according to this same principle, it is vital to wait for a period before accepting genetically-modified products whose long-term effects on the resistance of plants unsuitable for cultivation are unknown, as little known as the adaptability of weeds to GMOs."
"If the European Union really wishes to show all those who have suffered from past neglect that it wished to draw all the parties involved together and that they can once again have confidence in its policies, it must immediately put forward some very concrete proposals on food safety."
"Madam President, against the background of a predictably fiercer debate about farming products costing as little as possible, a lot of damage has been caused to food production in the EC."
"Many active farmers who were working in accordance with good rural practice had to cease production."
"No details at all have so far been given of the costs of this."
"The massive industrial contamination of feedingstuffs through additives introduced without regard for any maximum permitted limit leaves the consumer with the justified impression that the production of animal feed has degenerated into its mere exploitation."
"Disposing of used sludge and sewage sludge may be a problem, but guaranteeing the safety of animal feed additives must be placed higher on the political agenda than it has been so far."
"I expect the Commission, when it creates a food agency, to specify that animal feed should be traceable back to its origins and to formulate legal provisions which penalise criminal practices and reward working farmers."
"But this has to happen quickly."
"Madam President, President Prodi, it is opportune for us to have a debate on food safety today, at a time when consumers have so many legitimate reasons for concern."
"The Council and the Commission would like to get the measure of this concern, but at the moment, they do not seem to be particularly capable of offering solutions other than pernickety but overcautious regulations, which the sharpest and most unscrupulous people will continue to circumvent, to the detriment of food safety."
"Recent examples provide clear evidence of this."
"So, I would like to take advantage of this general debate to stress to my fellow Members and to the other institutions the need to get back to a few common-sense principles which have been swept away by great theories which are based too much on economic concerns and not enough on human concerns."
"Confidence is not achieved by decree, it must be earned."
"Of course, it may be something innate, especially in the case of country products which are subject to quality rules which are handed down for generations sometimes."
"So, let us take advantage of this in order to recognise and acknowledge as justifiably special the products which are deserving of confidence."
"At least, let us leave those who have forever known and practised their business with the complete confidence of the consumers to continue to do so, without raising the guillotine blade of unsuitable directives above their head, unsuitable because the author of the directives is unable to grasp the reality of the situation."
"These country products, I say to you, should never be penalised under Community regulations, especially not when they are sold as local produce, for their quality is almost certainly the best guarantee of food safety."
"Let me take our local farmers' markets as just one example."
"Of course, the fruit and vegetables that I find locally are not kept in isothermic containers, but at least we know where the products come from."
"If they are not fresh, they rot."
"So, in this case, sell-by labels are not needed."
"On the other hand, when one does not have the privilege of living so close to the production sites, it is necessary to intervene in order to merit confidence, and never to betray it."
"But I worry when I see that the most basic safety measures are not taken."
"Whether it is a case of negligence or deliberate disregard, it is a serious error for which all the parties responsible must be accountable to the population."
"So, in order to ensure food safety in the face of the unknown, I believe that, going beyond the practice of scientific committees which is far too widespread in the United States - and which I deplore, even here in the European Union - with decisions taken behind closed doors, we must, above all, guarantee the consumer complete and accurate information right from the original production sites."
"The transparency of these products, their traceability with details of their production and components, and comprehensive labelling will enable everyone to be kept informed."
"In addition, the use of non-natural components, such as GMOs or hormones must be clearly indicated, even if we want them to be banned."
"How many more scandals must we expect before requiring, without risking incurring fines, recognition of the precautionary principle which, in the field of human health, is the only one capable of guaranteeing consumers the protection they are entitled to?"
"This is the question you must answer today if this debate is not to have been in vain."
"Mr President, the mere fact that there is a need for this debate at all ought, I feel, to instil a degree of humility in all those who make policy at European level."
"After all, Europe has more competence in the agricultural sphere, which absorbs half our budget, than it does in any other area."
"Nevertheless, we have had to contend with what have proved to be particularly severe forms of food poisoning in various Member States in recent years and there is little or no supervision in the agro-industry, which incorporates all manner of filth and rubbish into the food chain."
"My country is now having to contend with the consequences of the notorious dioxin crisis."
"But everyone knows that what is happening in my country is just the tip of the iceberg and that the food safety problem is not confined to one or a few countries."
"Everywhere you look, there are residues of medicines and pesticides in the food chain."
"There are salmonella and dioxin problems everywhere and the list just goes on."
"We do have a large number of European regulations and standards but they are rather fragmented."
"There appears to be a lack of a framework."
"Most importantly, there is no effective supervisory body to ensure that all these regulations and standards are adhered to."
"At the present time, more and more people in my country are asking the question, and rightly so, if it is normal practice for us to foot the bill for the stringent standards adhered to and, especially, for the stringent supervision exercised in our country when other Member States, I regret to say, do not take a blind bit of notice of these standards and supervision."
"It is an either/or situation."
"But since there is a free market and open borders and almost unlimited imports, including those from non-member States I might add, then effective measures must also be taken to impose common safety and environmental standards within the European Union, but also in the countries from which our food imports originate. These standards must then be supervised in earnest."
"As I said, European agricultural policy absorbs half of our budget."
"80% of that budget goes on 20% of agricultural enterprises, which is a very clear sign, of course, that for years European agricultural policy has taken the side of the agro-industry rather than that of the small-scale producers of high-quality agricultural products."
"I believe that some responsibility for the problems we are facing should also be taken at European level, and that the EU should step in with financial aid when large numbers of small-scale farmers and agricultural enterprises in my country fall victim to what in many cases amounts to nothing less than the derailment of European agricultural policy."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, if the PPE did not want this debate to be held today, it was not because it did not consider it important, but just in order to be able to shed light on a number of aspects, to hear the opinions of a number of experts, before making a statement."
"Well, the debate is being held today after all, and as we are here and we have heard President Prodi' s statement, we have been able to take into consideration the things he has announced, i.e. the creation of an independent European food agency, prioritisation of food safety, strengthening of controls, etc."
"We hope however that these proposals are not just empty words."
"A European agency may be effective, but it may also be no more than a group of officials attempting to deal with problems far removed from real events, and this is not what consumers expect."
"Given the many scandals we have seen in the food sector and the growing concern of consumers, passed on, what is more, by political decision-makers, I believe there is an urgent demand for greater transparency, more controls, greater traceability, and especially greater responsibility at every stage of production."
"President Prodi, there is no way around true reform in agriculture."
"I believe that recent decades show that we have been playing the role of the sorcerer' s apprentice."
"So, today, we are faced with food scandals relating to BSE, dioxin, antibiotics, pesticides, and the excessive use of fertilisers as well."
"What scandals we have already witnessed, and how many more are still to come?"
"So, Mr President, you would be specifically to blame if you were unable to propose a real reform in agriculture and, from that point of view Madam President, it is a pity that the Council is not represented here, since agricultural policy is chiefly dependent on the Council."
"It is not possible to progress without carrying out real reform, one more concerned with product quality and respect for the environment."
"True, all this has a price, the price of extensive production, but the agricultural budget is a sizeable one and all that is required is the political will to change the way it is distributed."
"Finally, Commissioner, Commission President, Madam President, we must present a united front in the discussions we are to have with the United States about our relationships within the context of the WTO."
"Madam President, it is very appropriate that the issue which - in restrospect - did so much to blemish the reputation of the last two Commissions should be the subject of the opening debate for this new one."
"I welcome what President Prodi has said today."
"The citizens of Europe have the right to know what they are eating, where it was produced and by what means, and to have these things clearly indicated and labelled."
"Of course, all of us believe that where other countries' products are concerned; but we also need to know it about our own."
"When I asked the Commission representatives in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection a couple of months ago about the reported illegal recycling of sewage sludge into animal feed in some Member States, nobody could define for me what sewage sludge was, where it was being used or why."
"Two separate directorates of the Commission were there - the then DG XXIV and DG VI."
"Everybody looked at everybody else."
"I would like to hear from Mr Byrne today, using this small example initially, whether he has got to the bottom of this problem."
"We are not talking here of a practice of which no-one knew the dangers before."
"It is a disgusting procedure."
"We need to know why and how it has been allowed to happen."
"I hope Mr Byrne, when he comes to reply, will be able to tell us."
"What we need is the ability to act quickly where the law is not upheld."
"In the dioxin scandal, for example, what is needed, it seems to me, is not so much a mad rush to ban a whole range of products - RVOs and so on - as the possibility of discovering whether these things are new pollutants or simply products which have become polluted."
"It we can find that out we are on the way to a better scrutiny of the products themselves."
"A food agency, which some have doubts about, is to me as credible and as necessary as an environment agency, about which there were also doubts at its inception."
"It would provide a benchmark for all Member States."
"For those whose precautionary legislation is defective it would be a boost and a buttress."
"For those who now set high standards, as I believe my own country does, it would be a reassurance that we are all toiling in the same vineyard and on the same level cornfield."
"The tragedy is that in areas where we have a rudimentary common policy, through the scientific committees and the new Veterinary Office in Dublin, some Member States still break ranks."
"We have had a relentless drive to achieve full safety methods in beef production in my country, quite rightly after BSE."
"That led to the end of the beef ban in August of this year, but not, apparently, in France."
"I would like to know now from Mr Byrne how he proposes to validate Community decisions based on scientific advice - as the lifting of the beef ban was - when they are flouted by a Member State."
"Safety issues simply cannot be allowed to degenerate into shabby national politics at the will of any Member State."
"I would like to know how the White Paper will ensure coherent safety standards, proper labelling and precautionary advice."
"We want to see these things implemented in the three-year target period that he has set for himself."
"It would be disastrous if we were left with the politics of retribution and recrimination where we could move towards common European standards."
"It would be absolutely ludicrous if we were to go into the next WTO round unable to set out clear standards ourselves which are the framework of the precautionary principle."
"If we do that we are left exchanging insults on the basis of self-interest and ignorance."
"Europe can surely do better than that."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, it is therefore clear, as you rightly said, that the entire process must be followed from the beginning right through to the consumer."
"In so doing, we have known for the past few years now that cattle fodder is one of the weak links in the food chain."
"I can remember that when the dioxin crisis began in Belgium, in my country that is, people said: how could we have detected that?"
"Nobody had ever imagined that something like that would end up in cattle fodder."
"I now ask myself if there are still a number of things which we do not suspect of being able to enter the chain but which do, in fact, end up there."
"And so I think it is time to set to work on a positive list and, as Mr Florenz said, to ensure that we know what is allowed to be in the food chain and what is not."
"That is my first important point."
"A second important point is this: after months of hard work, my country' s faith has been restored in the European Commission and so, we are starting work using a system that is stringent and that is very expensive, it is true, but that is worth the effort nonetheless; it is one of stringent supervision and stringent standards."
"The tests on cattle have shown that there are a number of cases which do not derive from cattle fodder but do derive from contamination, dioxin contamination, caused by industry and by incinerators."
"We are aware of this in Belgium because we have carried out a great many tests, but what is the situation in the rest of the European Union?"
"Is it not the case that efforts should be made to monitor this in other EU countries as well, and a number of other things too?"
"Was there not a report on incinerators by the European Parliament and should that not be in the hands of someone in the Council?"
"Could we, at long last, be allowed to know what stage we have reached?"
"I had wanted to ask the Council something else and I think it is a pity that they are not present."
"We note that the Commission wants to be strict, not just towards Belgium but also towards the others."
"I hear that there are a number of countries that are nowhere near as enthusiastic and that are putting the brakes on."
"I would certainly like to know who these countries are and why they are taking this line."
"Am I right in thinking that certain Member States no longer want to go as far as the Commission' s proposals?"
"I feel that as the European Parliament we must support the Commission when it takes rigorous, rapid and explicit action."
"Its White Paper certainly must not be used as a delaying tactic."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we are agreed that the EU should no longer be synonymous with rubbish and poison being found in foodstuffs."
"Yet, a food agency does not create any security, and a White Paper ought not to be misused for the purpose of putting off long overdue decisions."
"We need a change of direction in foodstuffs policy."
"In the past, the Commission has made itself too much the mouthpiece of industry and all too often trampled on the precautionary principle."
"You spoke of labelling from field to table."
"All right, but what of the duty to label feedingstuffs?"
"What of the duty to label genetically-modified additives?"
"You know of the loophole in the Order on novel foods."
"What of an Order on novel feedingstuffs, an Order relating to genetically-manufactured feedingstuffs?"
"What of a stamp of quality for foodstuffs free from genetic modification?"
"What is not needed is a mere shunting yard of a White Paper. Rather, what we need here is a quick decision."
"As long as two years ago, the Commission gave us an assurance about these matters. Really, we ought to have had these regulations a long time ago."
"What I am expecting from you here is a clear timetable and a clear statement as to when these legal decisions are to be taken."
"In the field of PCBs, too, more limit values are needed."
"We know from the EPA in the United States that there are further toxic PCBs."
"We also need clear rules and bans."
"It is not acceptable that you should demand more safety in the field of antibiotics too when, at the same time, the Commission permits antibiotics in additives."
"As we have already been reminded, we must finally have a clear positive list in the field of pesticides as well."
"May I say one more thing."
"It is completely irresponsible to speak of industry' s accepting responsibility for its own actions while it postpones decisions about environmental and risk liability."
"We in the European Parliament, and it is to the big groups that I am addressing this remark, must..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mrs Breyer, one minute thirty seconds is one minute thirty seconds and not two minutes."
"If you would like to speak for two minutes, you must argue within your group to be allotted two minutes."
"Otherwise, we are going to get in a complete muddle and off track as far as time is concerned."
"I hope you understand."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with a great deal of attention to the statement from the Committee on Public Health and Food Safety."
"The French delegation is extremely perplexed with regard to the comments we have heard if we put them back in the context of the crisis we witnessed several years ago, the BSE crisis or ""mad cow"" crisis."
"Indeed, following an assessment by the French national food safety agency, France decided last week not to lift the ban on beef from Great Britain."
"I was personally in favour of lifting the embargo with regard to Northern Ireland."
"In fact, there was no BSE there, or virtually none."
"Controls and traceability of products were of an acceptable level there."
"This is not the case in Great Britain: the disease has not been eradicated and the numbers of diseased animals there is still too high to prevent all risks of contamination and to guarantee consumers a healthy product."
"I have also taken note, like all my fellow Members, of the Commission' s intention to create a European agency for food safety and for medicinal products."
"I am resolutely opposed to this initiative."
"Member States must be in a position themselves to establish the level of precaution and food safety they wish for their citizens."
"We saw that the Commission was fully responsible for the slowness of the decision-making process in the mad cow crisis."
"I therefore do not trust the Commission to guarantee my fellow citizens an adequate level of health safety."
"The role of the Commission and the European institutions must, in the specific case of food safety, be limited to negotiating the precautionary principle within the framework of international agreements and to coordinating the policies of Member States and the European Union."
"The sacrosanct principle of the single market and globalisation must not be allowed to undermine the food safety which all the citizens of the European Union are entitled to expect."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dioxin and BSE are different types of problems which have both hit the world of agriculture hard as well as directly involving consumers too."
"These are two matters which have been explained to citizens as extraordinary events, but given the frequency of similar cases in the European Union, in our opinion, we can no longer use stopgap measures but need real solutions instead."
"The latest striking evidence comes from dioxin."
"We have to think of stable and lasting solutions."
"The solutions target specific areas: 1) the consumers; 2) a new agri-environmental revolution; 3) precise political direction which the Community bodies must give."
"Overall, the broadly positive note is coming from the producers and consumers."
"On the one hand, farmers, who have for some time firmly followed the set of rigid production rules, have been guaranteeing and giving their full backing to - as history and current events show - the maturity of consumers."
"On the other hand, a possible way to resolve the problem is linked to consumers themselves, who by now well understand the European policy on brands and typical products which aims to strengthen local European products that are perfectly able to avoid being crushed by international competition that favours standardised food products instead."
"But in this context, we certainly cannot ask the producers to sacrifice themselves in the context of problems which all too often means they give way and are beaten. They lose out in the market through no fault of their own and can only look forward to a prolonged period of trying to win back the confidence that they had gained by hard work and production costs which here again, were all too often undervalued or at least, not given their full value."
"The subject of production costs does not appear either in the regulations on rural development or in the regulations on consumer policy."
"There is not even the barest mention."
"Issues such as dioxin should teach us that, while it is true that farmers who have higher environmental standards should have higher incomes, in the case of food these requirements should also be applied, to an even greater degree."
"So, if it can be proved that the producers had nothing to do with cases like the dioxin scandal, then it is worth considering putting an appropriate price on quality."
"The concept of quality has often been discussed and I too would like to refer to a precise but complex weave of characteristics: hygiene, traceability, safety, specific production - and environmental - characteristics, nutritional value etc."
"Agenda 2000 and Regulation 1257 recognise and emphasise aspects which are connected with moves in this direction."
"Mr President, Commissioner Prodi, I think that the statement you have made today demonstrates that the Commission does indeed intend to provide consumers with full guarantees as regards safe and healthy food."
"Today, I want to touch on three points which appear to me to be crucial if these guarantees are to be lived up to."
"First and foremost, we need effective legislation, at European level too, of course."
"You did indeed refer to 800 basic directives but in fact there are still huge gaps in this legislation."
"It just does not make sense for there only to be PCB and dioxin standards for Belgium, and for it not to be deemed necessary for other European countries."
"Neither does it make much sense to me that we are not to discuss how to proceed with pesticides, antibiotics and with other undesirable contaminants in food."
"I feel I have no choice but to agree with those here present who have called for a positive list to be compiled as regards cattle fodder, for you would not believe how much goes wrong there."
"A second important point appears to me to be the introduction of a sound supervisory system."
"You may say that responsibility for supervision should fall first and foremost to the Member States and indeed it should."
"However, the Committee of Inquiry in Belgium has shown that things are going badly wrong there."
"To my mind, it is extremely important for supervision to be undertaken in the same way in all Member States, for there to be guarantees for this supervision, for the supervisors themselves to be subject to supervision, and for the agency in Dublin to be given more autonomous authority to exercise supervision on its own initiative."
"My third and final point is one that I feel it is very important to touch on in today' s debate, namely that there is a real need for the work of all the departments concerned to be coordinated."
"We are all aware that there are many of them."
"Even though the Commission is being re-organised, it is still the case that a variety of departments are involved."
"President Prodi, Belgium has set up a food safety agency for this purpose."
"I feel it is also important for a coordinating body to be set up at European level, and that there is also a need for reliable, scientific advice, for coherent policy at European level."
"I welcome your announcement about the open debate that is to take place on the setting up of a European food agency."
"President Prodi, if this agency is to be independent of something then, to my mind, it is essential for it to be independent of industrial lobbying."
"When it comes to our food policy, we cannot allow commercial interests to take precedence over the interests of the consumer."
"We believe it is absolutely essential that an agency of this kind should always fall within the Commission' s sphere of political responsibility, and always be under the political control of the European Parliament."
"Equally, we feel it is essential that all the Directorates-General throughout the Commission' s administration should work together in an efficient manner."
"I hope that Commissioner Byrne will be able to fulfil his role as coordinator efficiently and effectively."
"Mr President, it was stated in a previous speech that consumers and the public do not trust producers."
"For our part, we must all swiftly rectify this basic error: this is not so much a matter which concerns producers: these crises are crises of the food production industry and the feedingstuffs industry, for which the producer then winds up involuntarily looking like the responsible party."
"I would like to raise one issue which has not yet been mentioned, and that is the matter of heavy metals in sewage sludge."
"Sewage sludge contains heavy metals, including considerable quantities of cadmium and because of this, in my own home country, and in the Nordic countries generally, this sludge may not be spread on the fields at all, because cadmium gets into the food chain and thereby enters the human body."
"It is inconceivable that it has been possible to use sewage sludge for years in the preparation of feed and in fertiliser, although this was banned in the EU ten years ago."
"Our European agriculture model has received a heavy blow and, because of this, we must swiftly take up these issues."
"President Prodi said that he would also deal with economic matters."
"For this reason, the factories using prohibited substances must be closed immediately."
"Then we would be acting on a sensitive issue, intervening in aspects of the economy, and that would have a very speedy effect."
"Such action, which adds to monitoring and bureaucracy, must be totally transparent, however, so that everyone knows what is actually going on."
"Sewage sludge and waste cannot be permitted to be used in animal feed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, first and foremost, I would like to lend my support to the objection raised by Mr Florenz and the PPE about the Council' s failure to attend this plenary sitting."
"We are part of the three-cornered relationship of Council-Parliament-Commission, but I note that the Council attends rarely, if at all."
"This is scandalous."
"We must search our own hearts."
"I feel that this Parliament behaved in a eunuch-like way yesterday in refusing to link this debate on food safety and the WTO with a resolution."
"I feel there is a need for a broadly based discussion in the public arena about the recycling industry."
"I endorse the comments made by Mr Whitehead."
"We really need to have all the facts about what goes into our food."
"Waste matter must be treated as such."
"If something can still be recycled then it must only be allowed to enter the food chain having fulfilled extremely stringent conditions, and it must always be retraceable."
"President of the Commission, I welcome your proposals."
"In common with Mrs Roth-Behrendt, I too feel very strongly that there should be a dioxin register."
"It is clear that our food contains dioxins that also derive from external sources."
"The situation in Belgium is evidence of this and that is why we must take action."
"Mr Staes, I should like to point out to you that a Parliament in which we have so many female colleagues cannot, by its very nature, be a eunuch!"
"Mr Prodi, we shall judge your good intentions and declarations when they become proposals."
"Until then, we are asking you to do your job better."
"First of all, you yourselves must actively seek out any breaches of the law and not wait around for the citizens to come forward with their accusations."
"In the last scandal, which few speakers mentioned and which concerns the carcinogenic coating on tinned food, we saw no initiative from you nor did we see any ensuing determination."
"Secondly, we are calling on you to be tougher and to make public any legal proceedings against governments who breach the deficient legislation that we have."
"Tell us which governments you have referred to the Court and why, and which companies were responsible for those violations."
"Thirdly, what we are asking for is for you all to be a little more forward-looking."
"We all know what the next scandal will be over: nitrate contamination of vegetables."
"Do you intend to do something about that?"
"Do you intend to say something to the citizens?"
"Do you intend to prepare yourselves for action?"
"As regards the body you wish to establish, do not go looking for other models."
"The best model is probably that of Europol."
"And as for the international dimension of it all, do not turn to the World Trade Organisation."
"For goodness sake!"
"What about the World Health Organisation, Mr Prodi!"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the Commission' s statement on food safety comes not a moment too soon."
"We have been pondering the Green Paper for one and a half years now."
"The Green Paper itself has been in existence for more than two and a half years and, in fact, nothing more has been done in the meantime."
"The BSE crisis and now also the events of the last few months have demonstrated that food safety must be made a priority, but also that such things are only given priority when there are crises."
"We are banking on the fact that this is now going to change."
"Mr President of the Commission, the fact that it was you that provided the introduction to today' s debate gives us cause for hope."
"Your statement was certainly full of good intentions but I only heard a little about the actual measures that are to be taken."
"That is why there are some questions I still want to ask and which I would be pleased to hear answered."
"Firstly there is the matter of the agency for food safety."
"It seems that an agency of this kind is to be something of a deus ex machina, but still we must ask the question: what exactly is its role to be?"
"What would the division of labour be between the proposed agency and the existing one in Dublin?"
"Would it be adequately staffed from the beginning?"
"What would its relationship with the national services and agencies be?"
"Last, but by no means least, to whom would this agency be accountable?"
"My second point concerns the internal market."
"It must now be obvious to everyone that public health must take precedence over economic interests and those of the internal market."
"Nevertheless, the internal market is an established fact."
"What will the Commission do to stop Member States introducing protectionist measures under the pretext of public health?"
"Suspicions on that score are rife."
"I would also refer you to the intervention made by Mr Whitehead."
"My third point is prompted by the dioxin crisis."
"The Commission compelled Belgium to carry out PCB testing but there is no European PCB standard."
"It is an either/or situation: either there is a public health problem or there is not."
"If there is then the whole of Europe is affected, which means that Europe-wide measures must be taken and the same yardstick must be used throughout the EU."
"Hence, my question: will the Commission produce a European PCB standard, and if so, when?"
"I have submitted a question in writing on this but I am sorry to say that I have received no response as yet."
"I also have a question about the distribution of competences."
"I see there are no less than four Commissioners whose competences relate to food safety."
"My question is as follows: how are these responsibilities to be coordinated?"
"Has a system of cooperation been agreed?"
"Who in the Commission is to have the final word?"
"Then, of course there is the international dimension."
"The Green Paper is long behind us and we have the White Paper to come."
"We have prohibitive regulations in relation to hormones in meat and our own regulations as regards genetically-modified organisms, but the question is to what extent the European Union will continue to be able to choose its own policies, and how far the Commission will be able to go in demanding international recognition for the right to autonomy and the right to maintain EU authority over food safety and political choices relating to food policy."
"These are questions which I would be pleased to receive an answer to."
"I lend my support to the comments some of my colleagues have made about the scandalous absence of the Council from this debate."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I have listened with interest to the debate today."
"I have listened with interest to the things which Mr Prodi has said in the past about how we can reach a solution to the crisis with food safety within Europe."
"One conclusion comes immediately to my mind which I do not hear Mr Prodi addressing, and that is the implementation and enforcing of existing legislation."
"Forget about creating new agencies, forget about new rules; why are you not looking much more seriously at implementing and enforcing the existing legislation?"
"If you had done that, then we should not have had a dioxin crisis in Belgium."
"Mr Prodi really has to think about that and perhaps produce proposals for that before Christmas."
"Central to the solutions that he is proposing is the food agency."
"We have to remember, Mr Prodi, that when this Parliament has looked at this problem of a food agency in the past, we have not been absolutely sure about whether this is the right way forward."
"However we, like you, are prepared to listen and consider it."
"But I have to say to you that we will have to ask you some very hard questions before we can be satisfied that you are moving in the right direction."
"The first question will be whether it is a food and drug agency or a food safety agency that you are proposing?"
"The second will be how much power you will devolve from the Commission to this new agency, and perhaps to some of the existing agencies, so that they can do their job better and assist the food agency in solving the problems regarding food in Europe?"
"How will you ensure the accountability of these new agencies?"
"Would you consider, for example, hearings held here in the European Parliament to choose the directors of those agencies?"
"There are many issues that we want to hear from you about, Mr Prodi."
"We would like to hear from you today about them. We definitely want to see them in your White Paper."
"Finally, Mr President, I would say that there is already a confusion in the minds of parliamentarians about who is responsible inside the Commission for key elements of this problem."
"We have Mr Byrne responsible for some issues and Mrs Wallström responsible for others, particularly as regards GMOs."
"You must resolve those issues inside the Commission before you take steps towards creating a food agency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is becoming increasingly clear that problems relating to public health and to healthy food truly are European problems, world problems, and not just one Member State' s problems."
"For that very reason, support must be given to the efforts made by Member States such as Belgium, which is endeavouring to keep the consequences of the food contamination episode to a minimum and to guarantee safe and healthy food."
"I would even go as far as to say that these efforts must be continued at a European level."
"I consider there to be four priorities arising from the dioxin crisis experienced by my country and these are as follows: firstly, Belgium has set up a federal food agency which will become operational at the end of this year."
"I believe that the same course should be pursued at a European level, but that there is no need to set up a new body in the process."
"The work can be incorporated into the existing office in Dublin."
"Secondly, notwithstanding the European Veterinary Committee' s decision that it is no longer necessary for PCB tests to be carried out on Belgian meat, Belgium continues to carry out these tests on meat destined for export."
"I therefore believe that tests of this kind must take place throughout the European Union."
"Thirdly, supervision must be carried out on the basis of the same quality standards."
"It is not permissible for Member States to still be using different standards for ascertaining food quality."
"This distorts competition, which is to the detriment of those who play the game by the rules, if I can put it that way."
"European legislation must provide a quality labelling system and must ensure that tests and quality standards are the same throughout Europe."
"Lastly, a European financing system must be established."
"It is not acceptable for one Member State to bear the brunt financially for a crisis such as the dioxin crisis."
"There are a number of amendments to next year' s budget on the table that will be able to provide the necessary financial room for manoeuvre."
"We hope that these will be adopted during the next plenary session and that you, Mr Prodi, together with your Commission, will give it the legal basis it needs."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, agricultural production of the conventional kind uses more and more chemical substances, additives, auxiliary substances, antibiotics and hormones - I could go on - and our food processing plants resemble chemical factories rather than food production facilities."
"In this situation, supervision at the final stage and the setting of upper limits are no longer adequate measures."
"What matters is that we have supervision over the process as a whole."
"Interestingly enough, supervision of the process as a whole is laid down in the order concerning conventional, organic farming."
"So, in an area where production holds no dangers, we have supervision of the process as a whole, and quite rightly too. I support that as well."
"In the other areas, however, we do not have such controls."
"This kind of final-stage supervision is a direct invitation to criminal wheelings and dealings. Meanwhile, opportunities are taken to blend substances, something which - we must suppose - has led to the systematic addition of toxic substances in the field of feedingstuffs."
"This must be changed."
"The second point I should like to address is the need to restore the close relationship between producer and consumer."
"There is no place for anonymity. I tell you that if I were to behave on my farm in the way that much of industry, including the food industry, does, people would not come back; or, if they did, it would be with a stick in order to teach me a lesson!"
"Then I would have no more customers."
"This close relationship between producer and consumer, together with responsibility on the part of the consumer for his or her own behaviour, must be restored."
"Mr President, Commissioner Prodi, consumers are living ever longer lives and are becoming ever healthier at more advanced ages."
"In spite of this, the subject of food safety is high up on the agenda."
"I believe that producers and consumers are in the same boat here, for the producers are themselves also consumers."
"That is something we sometimes forget in the overall discussion."
"Losses in the cattle and meat industry due to falling sales caused by constant public discussion of these matters are, however, unsustainable in the longer term."
"In Germany, a country in which animal corpses and waste from slaughterhouses are recycled in the appropriate manner, the discussion of animal feed has now become a macabre media spectacle."
"Unappetising pictures, together with headlines about the everyday cycle of horror in disgusting factories, are increasingly marginalising meat production and the practice of keeping livestock on farms."
"The fact is that, in a number of countries, sewage sludge is now also being declared a biomass and animal feed enriched with this is driving the last customer away from the meat counter."
"Feedingstuffs legislation is part of a quite distorted picture."
"I appeal to you and to us all. We can no longer skulk in dark corners."
"That must be our maxim!"
"Should the consumer really be convinced, in the future too, that farm animals have been reduced to the status of interim depositories for dubious feedingstuffs?"
"Is the consumer to go on thinking that we in the EU close down farms and so give up cultivating cereal, but burn the corpses of our animals and use meat and bone meal as animal feed?"
"I cannot begin to imagine that, in this period of innovation, we cannot find new and different ways of disposing of waste."
"Our farmers certainly do not want this policy."
"Should the consumer then continue voluntarily supporting this practice through his consumption of meat?"
"He will simply not do this, and for ethical, moral and emotional reasons."
"Declining to use meat and bone meal as animal feed benefits both producer and consumer."
"Voluntarily refusing to be involved in such processes is something which is already seen to be having a very positive influence upon the way in which meat is advertised."
"I shall say one more thing: as far as I am concerned, food is not superfluous junk."
"Food is now already being wasted, partly because of production costs."
"This state of affairs also has a bad effect upon European agriculture."
"Mr Prodi, it is not acceptable to deceive consumers again, as in the dioxin scandal."
"We need an entirely clear information policy in all Member States."
"The tactic of covering up these matters really must be brought to an end."
"I fully support you when you say that we need a comprehensive system of labelling."
"This should include everything of relevance to the consumer."
"But we also need reasonable prices so that both producer and consumer are in accord with one another."
"Mr Prodi, we are particularly concerned about the fact that, in recent years, matters of vital concern relating to the quality and safety of food and the protection of the health of European citizens are continually in the news, which does not always guarantee valid and reliable information."
"I am particularly pleased that you yourself are here today to inform us about a most important issue, even though I believe that it is too soon since the new Commission was nominated for you and your fellow Commissioners to have come up with specific proposals."
"It is true that there is now an urgent need to set up a system of continuous scientific control not only for the safety, but also for the quality of food."
"Mr President, the Green Paper on food was discussed two years ago, and we are still waiting for the White Paper which I hope will outline specific initiatives and the responsibilities of the European policy on food issues."
"I would like you to tell me what steps you will be taking over the next six months and to clarify who will be responsible for the portfolio for food safety, because I believe that, up until now, there has been some overlapping of competences."
"Now that we are undergoing institutional reform, I would like to know who will be responsible for announcing the relevant information and for tackling the crises when they do crop up."
"As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, I wonder, Mr President, whether you should perhaps look at promoting small producers, so as to ensure better quality goods."
"Unfortunately, all too often, citizens have been informed about everyday issues which concern them when it is too late. For such sensitive matters, preventative action should be taken so that the food chain can ensure the physical and psychological well-being of all consumers and not be an object of exploitation for purely financial interests."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we appear to have lost our elementary knowledge of biology."
"For tens of thousands of years, our forefathers have known that corpses, both animal and human, have to be buried or burned."
"They have to return to the great cycle of nature and become new materials."
"Nowadays, we seem to believe that natural cycles of this kind imply re-use and that animals we shall be eating ourselves should be fed with dead animals of their own species."
"We need to regain a holistic understanding and realise that whatever we put onto our fields we get back in the form of bread and, above all, drinking water, which is also an important form of sustenance."
"What we give animals to eat, we later find on our own plates."
"There is a need for openness and public scrutiny at every link in the food chain. That is our best form of inspection."
"It is obvious that consumer groups, environmental organisations and the media should have free access to farms and to factories manufacturing foods and animal feedingstuffs."
"The European Union needs a clear and precise set of regulations governing food safety."
"This would not distort the market if it were the same for everyone."
"It must cover agriculture, the methods we use for rearing animals, the feedingstuffs and medicines which animals are given and, of course, how the raw materials are handled subsequently."
"It is quite a simple matter to produce a set of regulations but very difficult indeed to monitor compliance with them."
"What is needed in fact is intensive collaboration and interaction at local and district levels."
"The European Union must create some form of supervisory system for supervising the inspectors."
"Mr President, food safety issues have quite rightly dominated much of our thinking and that of Member States in recent years."
"I welcome today' s statement and debate as a recognition of the continuing need for action."
"It is right that public bodies and politicians, whether in local authorities or governments, should play a part in regulating food production and processing."
"The European Commission and we in the Parliament, too, should do all in our power to ensure that consumers Europe-wide can have confidence in their food purchases."
"The BSE problem is one case where, at a European level, stringent conditions were put in place in relation to the export of UK beef."
"These conditions were met, resulting in the recent lifting of the ban which has had such a major effect on agriculture and related industries in that country."
"This came as a long-awaited sign, bringing some relief to our hard-pressed farmers."
"Can it be acceptable then, given that the European Union body responsible judged it the right time to lift the ban, that individual states, without producing and publishing a clear justification in terms of food safety, should maintain the beef ban This decision by the French government last week comes as a particularly bitter further blow to Scotland' s beef farmers, whose herds are predominantly grass-fed and did not have a BSE problem in the first place."
"Mr President of the Commission, there are so many cases of food contamination that there is no way that this phenomenon is arbitrary, neither is it the simple result of human error."
"In our opinion, the main cause is that the social system puts profit before human health, especially when it comes to the profits of large corporations and the health of their workers."
"The problem is further exacerbated by both the liberalisation of trade resulting in the circulation of products which have not undergone any fundamental inspections and the severe competition which has become an excuse for monopolies to seek out more unorthodox ways of cutting costs and increasing their profits. Thus, fundamental quality control is being left to the consumers themselves."
"Neither Mr Prodi' s statement nor the discussions so far have touched on the core of the matter."
"Our problem is not about the confidence or lack of confidence of the citizens."
"The matter will not be resolved with food labelling or White Papers, nor will it be resolved by increasing the directives from 100 to 150."
"If we do not tackle the irresponsibility of monopolies at all levels, the dangers will become even greater."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, I am grateful for the information which you gave Parliament this morning, but I would like to stress the fact that these accidents - those of mad cow disease and dioxin - are not really accidents."
"I believe them to be the consequences of the policies that have been pursued."
"We have a Green Paper on this issue, we will have a White Paper and 800 directives, but the root of this matter, the reality, is that it is a consequence of the economic policies and decisions which have been taken in Europe, and of globalisation."
"In agricultural production, quantity has taken precedence over quality and this has caused the balance to be upset."
"We have abandoned European traditions, we have ended up with extensive and semi-extensive livestock farming and, as Ferdinando Riccardi pointed out a few days ago, Plutarch reminded us in his treatise on animals of some cows who had gone mad as a result of becoming carnivores."
"We have turned our ovine and bovine animals, which are ruminant herbivores, into carnivores, like those animals in Plutarch."
"And not only have we turned them into carnivores, we have tied them up, immobilised them, treated them with unnecessary antibiotics, castrated them, inseminated them, kept them in conditions which are inhumane - and the expression is quite appropriate - for animals."
"We have changed to an earthless form of agriculture. We have abandoned European traditions."
"This is the real cause of the problems we are experiencing."
"And apart from this, whatever happened to animal welfare?"
"We talk of animal welfare, but this welfare must begin with food."
"President Prodi, do you and your Commission really intend to tackle the problem at its source or will you carry on acting as a trouble-shooter and apply stopgap solutions every time a problem arises?"
"I would ask for more investigation, more control and more accountability for those countries which do not comply with the regulations."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, I would like to speak about two basic conditions for improving food safety."
"Firstly, the European inspectorate must be able to inspect whenever it deems it necessary."
"The current situation in which a Member State, in the case of fraud, can hold the key which locks the European inspectorate, cannot be allowed to continue."
"This legislation must be amended."
"Secondly, we must fight fraud relentlessly, and to this end it is necessary that some sectors, which have paid an unfair price for this dioxin crisis, are compensated by means of market measures."
"It is essential that fraud is never rewarded in any way, through direct or indirect measures."
"Food fraud has been committed and, therefore, the Commission must ensure that it does not, through any measure, for the first time, reward fraud."
"Finally, I would like to point out that during the dioxin crisis, there has been a degree of genuine dishonesty between the Member States."
"We must ensure that there is Community honesty with regard to information policy."
"Perhaps this lack of honesty with regard to information is due to the fact that we were in an election period, but I must point out that there was a real war of accusations between certain Member States."
"This is very serious and we require measures which will safeguard this Community trust between the different Member States."
"Mr President, I tried yesterday to get a Commission statement on the French refusal to lift the beef ban but unfortunately the proposal to change the agenda was rejected."
"We need urgently to know what steps the Commission is taking against the French."
"The British farmers are in crisis at the moment."
"GBP 1.5 billion worth of exports has been lost in the UK because of it."
"Commission scientists say they are satisfied, so why are the French flouting the rules?"
"They have no new scientific evidence."
"The BSE crisis happened because the previous government reacted too late to the problem."
"They closed their eyes to it."
"Cows should never have been fed the remains of other cows, but it was not just a problem in the UK."
"Britain is vigilant now."
"Since 1996 no cases of BSE in the eligible age group - that is 6 months to 30 months - have been discovered."
"Some other countries cannot say the same."
"They do not have to adhere to the same rules."
"It is time we had a level playing field."
"Hygiene standards in the UK are second to none, and the ban must be lifted across the EU, including France."
"Mr President, the fact that the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, is present shows that it is indeed the case that European citizens must be able to rely on their food being safe and healthy."
"I am referring to food produced here but also to food imported by the European Union."
"The same safety standards are needed in both cases."
"This will form an important part of the discussions due to take place at the WTO Round."
"What appears to be forgotten is that the food industry is of enormous importance to the European economy."
"On average, a fifth of disposable income is spent on food and drink."
"This means that BSE and dioxin scandals and the like do not just harm consumers and farmers, who are often able to do little about it, but, without a doubt, they harm all the workers employed in the industry too."
"This has many unpleasant consequences."
"That is why I also feel that those who take risks with food must be severely punished."
"On turning again briefly to the relevant section of the food book or the Green Paper, I find that as early as 1997, there were calls for national legislation and European penalties to be harmonised."
"I have the feeling that nothing has happened there yet and that we are simply taking far too much of a softly softly approach."
"When someone infringes an environmental law in the United States the name of the company and that of its managing director are published, and so perhaps we could do something similar in the Netherlands."
"I have just mentioned the publication of the Green Paper."
"However, the Commission now wants to produce a White Paper."
"I have the feeling that this will delay matters somewhat."
"It would be more useful to receive a proper answer to the questions that were already raised in the Green Paper."
"Everyone here accepts the need for integral chain management, but how is this actually carried out in the Member States?"
"What control does Europe actually have over this and what options does it have as regards imposing penalties?"
"Problems arise with the animal feed meal."
"What is being done on that score?"
"It ought only to be permissible for animal feed to contain components of vegetable origin; why is this not so?"
"If this were the case, then the feed would definitely be safe."
"My third point relates to supervision."
"Our system for obtaining scientific advice is now very well organised."
"We must supervise food safety at a European level."
"An excellent idea."
"I am certainly not in favour of a system along American lines."
"It is the government that must be responsible for food safety, fulfilling a coordinating function."
"But what would the Commission do if, for example, food safety controls in the Netherlands were to be improved upon by those of a new agency?"
"Would Brussels be informed?"
"Do you have an opinion on this?"
"All these sorts of affairs are going to have to be better organised."
"Mr President, our common goal is food safety and consumer health."
"I share all the views expressed by my colleagues in the Socialist Group."
"I would, however, like to draw the attention of this House and of the Commission to an often neglected aspect of this whole problem, i.e. the resignation of the parties responsible at the European, and more especially the national, level for the health and safety of consumers."
"Generally, authorities are slow to react. They do not always effect the necessary preventative controls."
"But as soon as a scandal breaks, public authorities go into overdrive, opening all the umbrellas they can, with the primary intention of covering themselves."
"This is the Dr Garetta syndrome, named after the official responsible for the contaminated blood case in France."
"Since then, the people responsible for public health no longer take any risks whatsoever."
"This is called the precautionary principle, in itself a valid principle, but one which authorises all sorts of aberrations if it is used by Ministers or officials whose only purpose is to cover themselves against taking any sort of responsibility."
"So bans are introduced with a vengeance, without any regard for confusion of the farmers or the shopkeepers who are doing nothing wrong."
"I do not have enough time now to expand upon the subject, but I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the need not just for preventive action but also for increasing the accountability of all the official inspectors, all the experts, so that the precautionary principle does not become a principle of refusing to accept responsibility on the part of those in charge of monitoring food safety and consumer health."
"Mr Chairman, Mr President, Commissioner Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the food crises and, most recently, the dioxin crisis have released a wave of uncertainty, yes even of anxiety, throughout Europe."
"How safe is our food?"
"Who can guarantee its safety?"
"Who keeps watch over these matters?"
"The internal market has removed frontiers and border controls, and we are proud of this and happy about it."
"Free trade. A Europe of citizens."
"Europe must now, therefore, also guarantee food safety."
"That is what the people at home are saying to us, and that is what we are concerning ourselves with in the field of consumer protection."
"I would remind you of the Directive concerning Product Liability of a few months ago which inflamed passions in this very Chamber."
"The crisis about dioxin in eggs and meat shows that directives and orders alone are not enough."
"At home, ordinary people are already saying to us: trust is all well and good, but proper supervision is better."
"Europe must accept its responsibility; that is to say, we certainly first need crystal-clear definitions so that we can say that one thing is healthy and the other unhealthy, one thing harmful and the other harmless."
"We need clear, uniform, Europe-wide standards, Mr President of the Commission."
"For us in Germany, sewage sludge is waste and does not, under any circumstances, belong in feedingstuffs."
"Feedingstuffs are to be found at the beginning of the food chain, and they must be as safe as the food itself."
"Healthy animal feed means healthy animals, and healthy animals go on, logically enough, to produce healthy meat."
"That is the farmers' capital."
"Farmers must be able to rely upon manufacturers of feedingstuffs."
"Farmers themselves cannot check up on what feedingstuffs contain."
"Above all, they cannot know whether they contain substances they ought not to contain, for there are no labels specifying these substances."
"Manufacturers of feedingstuffs are liable for their products and they must also be liable for losses caused to farmers."
"What has happened here is not permitted under any order in connection with feedingstuffs. That means that the consumer has been deceived."
"Commission President Prodi, we are reducing cereal production in Europe in order to avoid over-capacity."
"To save money, unhealthy substances are being mixed in with animal feed in order make it go further."
"That can no longer be conveyed to anyone."
"The trouble is certainly to be found in the low prices."
"If, for example, farmers are only able to earn EUR 1.25 per kilo of pork, then everyone wonders how the production costs can be covered."
"So feedingstuffs have to be cheap."
"The issue then comes full circle with consumers asking the question: are we also prepared to pay more for foodstuffs?"
"Food must also have its value."
"We must be prepared to pay more for it."
"Education and the provision of information can contribute to improving and enhancing citizens' relationship with the foodstuffs they eat."
"But responsibility for food safety comes first, and only then can confidence increase."
"Mr President, I have asked my group to again give me the opportunity at the end of this debate to elucidate a number of points arising from it."
"Let me now again emphasise, Mr Prodi, that what you have talked about - and what has also in part become clear from many other interventions - is something which you ought to, if you would, take home with you."
"For us, there are three essential points."
"We need good, proper legislation, and we need it quickly."
"There is one thing you must do in connection with this, Mr Prodi: you must also put your own house in order."
"It is just not acceptable that responsibilities should be scattered among different Directorates-General with the result that no healthy, sensible legislation comes into being."
"It is not acceptable that Directorate-General III should be responsible for processed food, drugs and genetically-modified organisms and that Directorate-General XXIV should also have a portion of responsibility for these while Directorates-General VI and XI should retain a small portion of responsibility for feedingstuffs."
"This is just not on, and I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to regulate the situation in a sensible way."
"Legislative powers belong inevitably with whatever Directorate-General is responsible for consumer protection and health policy."
"What is more, we have established in this debate that we need good scientific advice."
"Many of our colleagues have referred to this and have said that we need an independent, authoritative advisory body."
"I would say again that any such advisory body must not be influenced by Member States or the interests of industry, Mr Prodi, and it ought not to have any powers to lay down regulations."
"This power lies with the European Parliament alone and, in a small number of exceptional cases, with the Commission in its comitological proceedings."
"Nowhere else!"
"We must be in agreement about this."
"We then come to the subject of supervision, Mr Prodi."
"When we have all this - that is to say when we have good, healthy, sensible and integrative legislation, together with good scientific advice - we still need supervision."
"I would ask you to make it clear to the Member States that supervision cannot be had for free."
"In recent years, the Member States have neglected their obligation to implement legislation and supervise production."
"They have never really reported to us about how many supervisors in the Member States supervise what, when and where."
"It is, however, their duty to do this, and you, Mr Prodi, must convey this unpleasant news to the Member States."
"When the Member States in fact carry out what should have been their task for a long time, namely to check that food does not poison us but enables us to live, then we still have a supervisory authority at the Commission."
"We have the Control Office, or the Foodstuffs and Veterinary Office, which reports to Mr Byrne' s department and which has its headquarters in Dublin."
"In the Committee on Budgets, we have just now decided that this body should have more departments so that it can carry out its supervisory tasks."
"I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to lend your support to the idea that this body in Dublin should be able to visit the Member States without warning, that it should have investigative powers and that it should be able to carry out its task of overseeing the relevant supervisory arrangements in the Member States."
"Once these three goals have been achieved, that is to say, once we have designed sensible legislation, have access to scientific advice at a high level and are properly carrying out the relevant supervision, only then are we really on the safe side."
"Then, we shall have a system unlike any other in the world."
"We shall then also be able to go to the WTO negotiations in Seattle and say: everything is above board, we are not practising protectionism, we are enabling our citizens to live healthily and that is what we also want for you in the United States and in the developing countries."
"We want to cooperate in what we do."
"This, however, is our task: that we should put our house in order, as we already have done in a sense."
"It is still not perhaps perfect in every detail. We are, however, getting there."
"We must, then, also make this clear outside the European Union in the negotiations which will begin with the Millennium Round."
"I believe that we shall then be able to say to our citizens: nothing is ever guaranteed in life, but we are providing you with the highest possible levels of safety, well-being and health that, as far as anyone can judge and on the basis of scientific advice, we can offer at present."
"If that is your stated goal, Mr Prodi, then you will be a successful President of the Commission."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate President Prodi on the scientific rigour, but also on the high degree of transparency which characterised his address."
"Obviously, I share the premises of Commission Decision 640 of 23 September 1999 which highlighted that on the basis of WHO findings, dioxin is one of the most carcinogenic substances in existence. This is why the WHO recommends keeping the acceptable daily dose at 1-4 picograms per kilogram of body weight."
"And yet, as a scientist and as a politician, I cannot help but feel perplexed and concerned by the conclusions arrived at in this decision, in other words, a maximum ceiling of tolerance set at 200 nanograms of PCB per gram of fat, both in poultry, in meat and in pig derivatives."
"I wonder, Mr President, who can guarantee - albeit with this point of reference for PCB at hand - that the levels of dioxin present will not harm people?"
"Basically, the danger is not only linked to the levels, but also to other pharmacokinetic characteristics typical of these compounds which have a half-life of around 5.8 years, maybe even 7 years."
"This means that they linger for dozens of years after intake."
"Therefore, after continuous intake, there certainly will be an accumulation which can be dangerous."
"I therefore think that the directives issued by the Commission which you lead should cover permanent checks on dioxin levels but also other pollutants, in all the food we eat. The same goes for the air we breathe and the water we drink."
"Taking all this into account, I think then that clear directives are in the interests of citizens and consumers so that people' s levels of exposure to dioxin and PCBs - which belong to the same class as dioxins - are as low as possible."
"In conclusion, I agree with what Mr Florenz said about a European agency."
"It is something that would be extremely useful, but would achieve little, Mr President, if it were not organised across the Union, as close as possible to the citizens following what I myself suggested to the Finnish Health Minister."
"And so we must have highly specialised laboratories in every European region that are close to the citizens and which can scientifically guarantee what we eat, drink or breathe each day."
"And this can all be done, as I have already clearly said, in specialised laboratories already in place in universities."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, eating and drinking have a high status in the lifestyles of Europeans."
"The clear trend is for consumers to desire and demand high-quality food."
"It is essential that our farmers should produce fresh and natural food."
"European food must correspond to the demands which consumers are increasingly placing on it, and quite rightly too."
"Consumers want food which is safe and healthy and which has been produced and processed in ways that are friendly to the environment and to animals."
"In the end, health is important to all of us, ladies and gentlemen."
"I should like to point out here that over recent years, indeed decades, Austria has pursued another path in agricultural policy."
"I must say that it has proved worthwhile."
"Over 10% of farmers in Austria, in other words 20,000 businesses, engage in organic farming."
"In view of increasing competition and further concentration in the market, the future of the foodstuffs industry lies in the specific promotion and development of quality products and services."
"That is one reason why we cannot, and should not, afford scandals such as the BSE and dioxin affairs, irrespective of whether they were triggered by carelessness, avarice or whatever."
"The image of us all, of farmers and producers, is damaged by such events, and this has consequences."
"Not only does it lead to uncertainty for the European consumer, but it also damages our foreign trade."
"The strength of Europe and that of European agriculture lie in their good reputation."
"I would therefore vigorously urge us to go in more for trademarks and symbols of quality."
"With our guaranteed production methods, we can really only win."
"I would also urge that Europe should not fence off or close its markets, but pursue purposeful agricultural and food policies which are in keeping with the conditions and also the needs to be found in Europe."
"The European model for agriculture, as decided at the European Summit in Berlin, must be given priority in the WTO negotiations."
"I would also call for it to be at last stipulated that all feedingstuffs should be labelled."
"We as farmers can only produce high-quality products if we can also be certain that the animal feed we also have to buy is also in order."
"Labelling is one way to achieve that goal."
"For the consumer, however, this means that quality has its price and that food, including meat, should not be used, as it has been to date, as a lure in supermarkets."
"Madam President, Commissioner Prodi, Commissioner Byrne, the BSE and dioxin crises coupled with the ongoing controversy regarding genetically modified foods have combined to seriously undermine consumer confidence in the safety of food."
"Furthermore, inept handling of these issues by the respective governments and the EU itself has seriously undermined public confidence in the ability of politicians to deal with crises in the food chain."
"For these reasons, I welcome both Commissioner Byrne' s commitment to make food safety his number one priority and also the statement by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, in this House on 23 July, when he said that one of the first tasks of his Commission would be to restore consumer confidence in the safety of food products."
"Hence this debate."
"Commissioner Byrne, I may add, is to be commended for his prompt action in agreeing to produce a White Paper on EU food law later this year and also to tighten up the EU' s rapid alert system for food emergencies."
"However, I would urge the Commissioner to go the extra mile: if he and his colleagues are determined to regain the confidence of consumers and the food industry in the EU' s food safety structures, then he should establish a European food agency along similar lines to the US Food and Drug Administration."
"Such a body could take responsibility for the Commission' s present inspection and enforcement functions in relation to the food hygiene, veterinary and plant health legislation."
"It could also have responsibility for the rapid alert system itself."
"It could be given the role for the authorisation process for GMOs and genetically modified foods while also maintaining a monitoring brief on genetically modified foods throughout the EU."
"Health promotion campaigns on nutrition and diet and the ability to initiate research into food allergy and food-borne disease could also come within its remit."
"I would argue that the list of possible functions is by no means exhaustive, and its accountability could also be ensured if it were required to produce an annual report and if its officers regularly appeared before the Parliament' s Environment, Public Health Consumer Policy and Committee."
"I would urge you, Commissioner Byrne, to give serious consideration to the establishment of an independent food agency along these lines."
"Such an initiative would, in my view, restore not only consumer confidence in food but also public confidence in the EU itself."
"Madam President, from some of the contributions, you would get the impression that all foods are rubbish and constitute a danger."
"That is, of course, as false as if one were to maintain that everything is in order."
"That is just the first thing I want to say."
"In fact, the dioxin crisis was necessary in order to ensure that a number of the Commission' s and the Member States' shortcomings arising out of the BSE crisis might finally be sorted out."
"I am talking about the positive list and the question of open declaration."
"But the question of how, in future, we are to handle the issue of meat and bone meal in terms of an effective recycling system still remains."
"In this connection, it is of course remarkable if, on the subject of labelling, the Member States and also the Commission consider postponing the identification of cattle and the labelling of meat until after 1 January 2000."
"They would not be able to explain the fact to anyone outside."
"There must be clarity about what is going to happen."
"Mr Prodi, an agency is naturally no substitute for a policy, and there can be no question of our seeing a proliferation in the number of agencies, for then there would come a point when we no longer needed the Commission!"
"You cannot, however, go and create agencies where things might become difficult for you in order to evade some of the responsibility and then say, in cases where you can in fact exercise power (as with cartel law): we are doing this as the Commission!"
"These things do not go together."
"As always, discussions are therefore required."
"I believe that we need a rapid alert system and that the Commission must be entitled to intervene in the Member States more quickly than has so far been the case."
"Also relevant in this connection is a framework Directive on Foodstuffs which is worthy of the name and which, in providing preventative protection to the consumer, is easy to read, workable and can be overseen."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, the recent successive crises in the area of food safety have shown in the most convincing manner that the protection of public health must take priority over all other policies."
"In order to make this a priority, however, we need a series of actions which will cover the whole of the issue of safe food for European citizens and not just part of it."
"In general, the following is required. Firstly, from a legal perspective, we need a review of Community legislation on food, animal feedingstuffs, raw materials, additives, preservatives, contaminants such as pesticides, and the labelling thereof."
"We should deal with this issue first in the immediate future, so as to successfully fill the legislative gaps which exist today in the single market."
"Secondly, as far as administration and controls are concerned, we need to draw up measures so that the Commission services can function effectively, without any overlapping of competences, and so that we know who is responsible for what."
"Furthermore, we need effective implementation of the legislative framework, which inevitably means cooperation both at Community and national level, mainly through coordinated action."
"Thirdly and finally, from a scientific perspective, we should widen and further the scientific knowledge and methods we have for the production of safe food and animal feedingstuffs. We should introduce methods of detection and restrictions on various substances which contaminate food, and examine the suitability of various animal and plant-based foodstuffs and foodstuffs based on recycled products such as oil."
"Here, then, are three areas in which action is needed: legislation, controls with constant vigilance and a scientific perspective with constant advancement of knowledge and methods."
"Mr Prodi, we hope that you will act soon and swiftly, because this issue and food safety are prerequisites for safeguarding the health of the European citizen."
"Mr President, in July of this year the House expressed its grave concern over the Belgian dioxin contamination and urged the Commission to act urgently to address the whole issue of food safety."
"It is both welcome and reassuring that from the very outset the new Commissioner, Mr Byrne, has demonstrated an unequivocal commitment to restoring consumer confidence in the food industry."
"The review of EU animal feed legislation in the wake of the recent series of scares is most welcome as it goes to the root cause of problems that have arisen."
"I am pleased that the review will address key areas of concern to Parliament in its July resolution, such as sufficient controls in the animal feed production chain, a register of all animal feed producers, traceability of ingredients in animal feed and the setting of dioxin limits."
"Coming from a region that depends heavily on the fishing industry, I want to refer to Commissioner Byrne' s proposals on dioxin levels."
"It is important that scientific testing look at the dioxin/PCB level of compound feed as an end product, rather than the dioxin level of just one ingredient such as fish oil."
"In this regard, proper consultation of the fishing and aquaculture industries is not only desirable, but absolutely necessary and essential so as to avoid any detrimental consequences for the fishing industry that may be caused by levels not scientifically justified."
"The damage done by the dioxin scare is immeasurable, both in terms of shattering consumer confidence and the economic consequences of tarnishing the image of key industrial sectors and export generators."
"Producers, traders and the entire agri-food business have felt the effect."
"The Commission' s determined effort to restore consumer confidence by putting effective control mechanisms in place is clearly welcome."
"Consumer protection must have absolute priority in all measures regarding food safety."
"Mr President, I should like to apologise to the House for being absent when my name was called earlier, and to thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak."
"Could I say to the President and to the sessional services that it would be helpful if there were monitors in all the meeting rooms to ensure that we were fully au fait with what was happening in the House."
"Madam President, I will be very brief because Commissioner Byrne is going to reply to your detailed questions."
"I think that here, too, the Commission must prove it is capable of working as a team."
"You said that the White Paper must be very ambitious, that it must have a precise timetable and the Commission will undertake to achieve this."
"We must also clarify the matter of the precautionary principle because it is a framework principle which everything hinges on."
"It is unthinkable that without dealing with this aspect we could have rules which would convince all consumers and clarify the system."
"During the debate we must keep in mind - and this is important - all the problems of agriculture and reward quality agriculture, as well as giving a lot of room to the matter raised by Mrs Roth-Behrendt of the relationship between technical and democratic control."
"This is why we have introduced this debate today."
"It is an extremely important issue because we must have - let us call it - an agency, which will take these two fundamental principles into account."
"This agency, this structure - and here I am addressing Mr Nisticò in particular - absolutely must be in contact with the citizens."
"So the monitoring structures must be adapted and be decentralised to a local level."
"We must not create a centralised bureaucratic structure."
"The last matter, which I believe to be of enormous importance for our future work, was raised by Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Thyssen, and is the fact that various Commissioners and various Directorates-General are involved with Parliament."
"I would respond that this is - for better or for worse - our way of working."
"This is a very complex question which not only involves the Committee on Public Health, but also the Committees on Agriculture, Research and Trade."
"We cannot consider simplifying complex matters."
"We must have a coordinator, but also keep in mind that the whole Commission - and there are various Directorates-General - are still involved."
"Our problem is to constantly coordinate this process and not try to reduce it by taking away the role of the various Commissioners."
"We discussed this subject in depth at the meeting of Committee Chairmen and we are trying to improve things because I do not think we can solve the problems by pretending that the competences have been simplified or unified."
"We have to be aware of the complexity and assume the responsibility for coordinating, but make it understood that the other Commissioners also have their responsibilities for this delicate task."
"I now invite Commissioner Byrne to reply in detail to your questions on this debate which I am finding very constructive."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at the outset how pleased I am to have an opportunity to address you this morning on this important issue."
"This is a very timely debate and I am happy that it is taking place at an early stage of the Commission' s life."
"I am particularly happy of course to have my friend and colleague, the President, here with me to discuss these issues with you."
"We speak a lot about consumer confidence, but I would like to say once again that consumer confidence is not an objective in itself."
"The real objective is to achieve food safety as one of the pillars of public health policy."
"I have been giving some thought to how this can be achieved, and that is why I have made the proposal that we should bring forward a White Paper on food safety."
"I am pleased that this has been welcomed by you here this morning."
"The White Paper will contain an examination of important issues that have been raised by you, such as the control of the food chain, the reinforcement of controls, the labelling of foodstuffs, and the improvement of the early warning system so as to ensure that there is full transparency in the rapid alert system and in the early warning system."
"A number of you have mentioned that there is not the degree of accountability or the degree of openness or transparency in relation to the rapid alert system that we would all like to see, and I intend to address that in the White Paper."
"We have had quite a lot of discussion on the issue of a food agency."
"Its model is not yet fully determined, its shape has not yet been finally realised, but we have given some considerable thought to this already."
"I believe that we can have an agency that is independent, that gives scientific advice in an independent way, and yet at the same time can achieve the degree of accountability that all of you here as parliamentarians require and deserve."
"I believe that these two concepts are not mutually exclusive."
"They can both be achieved if we design the shape of the agency carefully and in a proper manner."
"And, of course, I look forward to discussing that with MEPs at the appropriate time and I look forward to the meeting that I will have with the Environment Committee later this month when this issue will be discussed further."
"Greater transparency for consumers is absolutely essential."
"I will also be addressing the issue of traceability."
"Many of you mentioned this issue and it is, of course, of enormous importance."
"There are a number of other issues that we would like to touch on."
"I am conscious of the amount of time I have available to me and I would like to point out that I will be discussing all of these issues in more detail with you at the Environment Committee meeting later in the month."
"First of all, there is the issue of the controversy that has occurred recently in relation to the ban on UK beef."
"Let me say at the outset that I have received preliminary advice on the report that has been presented by the French authorities, and this advice leads me to the conclusion that there is no new evidence contained in that report that has not already been considered by the Scientific Steering Committee of the European Union."
"Bearing this in mind, I have sought to have an urgent meeting between officials from France and the Commission, and this will be taking place this week."
"I have also, last night, sent a letter to the French authorities asking them to reply as a matter of urgency to me, and to set out whatever background evidence they may have that led them to the conclusions that they appear to have reached."
"If there is any new information contained in the reply from the French authorities, that of course will be referred by me immediately to my own scientific advisers and I will seek an urgent analysis from them of these matters."
"The preliminary advice available to me so far is that no such new information is available, but I wish to see if we can resolve this difficulty which has emerged over the last couple of days in a diplomatic and an amicable manner."
"It is for this reason that I wrote the letter last night and asked for the officials to meet one another."
"Finally, I want to bring you up to date on the meetings which I had with the Agriculture Council last week in Brussels."
"I should say that this was the first occasion when a Commissioner with the responsibility for food safety attended the Agriculture Council."
"At that meeting, there were three issues that I focused on and I would like just to briefly refer to them with you this morning because these are issues that many of you have identified as being important."
"The first one relates to the dioxin issue and the Belgian authority' s involvement in that."
"As many of you are aware, the tests that have taken place in Belgium have indicated that in one per cent of the examinations there was a small residue of dioxin and that this dioxin was present not as a result of the animal feed - what the tests were originally designed to determine - but rather from background industrial pollution."
"It is reasonable to draw the conclusion, as many of you have, that if it exists in Belgium, there is a risk that it may exist in other parts of the European Union or, indeed, in other parts of the world."
"I drew the Agricultural Council' s attention to my concern about this and informed the Council that it was my intention to add to the Residues Directive two further substances that are contained in the list of substances at Annex I. The two substances I intend adding are dioxin and PCB."
"In addition I informed the ministers that I wished to have monitoring take place in other Member States to determine the existence and levels - if any - of dioxin as a result of background environmental factors."
"I am happy to tell you that the ministers were very receptive to these proposals."
"I expect movement on this in the relatively near future."
"The second issue that was of concern to me and to which I drew the ministers' attention was the existence of sludge in foodstuffs."
"Some of you have mentioned this morning the importance of feeding stuffs."
"The common factor in a lot of these crises in relation to food, whether it is BSE, dioxin or sludge, is animal feeding stuffs."
"That is why I have focused on this issue as being an important one for examination and remedial action."
"I pointed out to the ministers that there appears to be an argument being advanced that there is some ambiguity in the feeding stuffs legislation in relation to sludge."
"I am not satisfied that such ambiguity exists."
"I have said so."
"I expect Member States not to include residue in feeding stuffs."
"I pointed out to them that it is my belief that consumers are shocked by this development."
"I got a good reception from the ministers and they approved of the views that I put forward to them."
"I expect there to be progress on this front also."
"In relation to the sludge issue, in the event that there is continuing difficulty on this and that an argument continues to be advanced that there is ambiguity, I will have no hesitation in bringing forward legislation to resolve any ambiguity that may exist."
"Lastly, I drew the ministers' attention to the question of GMOs and feedstuffs."
"I propose to bring forward another feed directive in relation to this matter."
"It is the best way to deal with it."
"I informed the ministers of that fact also."
"The final issue I want to address this morning is the question of international trade and the relationship with the World Trade Organisation."
"All of you know that Articles 152 and 153 of the Treaty, as inserted in Amsterdam, give the portfolio for which I have responsibility considerable horizontal rights in relation to the examination of all Community policies."
"My belief is that it is essential that we focus - as President Prodi has said - on health issues and food issues as being of primary importance when we consider matters of international trade."
"I look forward to discussing all these issues with you in the future and, specifically, as I have already said, at the Environment Committee later this month."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Commissioner Byrne."
"The debate is closed."
"Eleventh international AIDS conference in Lusaka"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the eleventh international AIDS conference in Lusaka."
"I would like to begin by extending my gratitude to the European Parliament for bringing up the important theme of AIDS in developing countries and by discussing the conclusions of the International Conference on AIDS in Africa which has just taken place in Lusaka, Zambia."
"The Commission is very concerned about the devastating effects of AIDS in the developing world and the apparent inability to stem the epidemic drastically and provide appropriate care for all those affected and infected."
"The statistics and analysis show convincingly that developing countries and the global community cannot ignore the AIDS epidemic."
"In developing countries, where 90% of all HIV infections occur, AIDS is reversing hard-won gains in improving the quality of life."
"In many hard-hit countries AIDS has already reduced life expectancy by more than ten years."
"AIDS is also rooted in and exacerbating poverty and inequality."
"Its effects are especially devastating for the poor, who have the fewest resources with which to cope."
"I should like to highlight some of the efforts made by the Commission and in particular some of the new initiatives envisaged."
"The Commission has been confronting AIDS since 1987 with widely-debated AIDS policies, strategies, actions, finances and, last but not least, through global and country partnerships."
"By the end of 1997 the EC had committed a total of EUR 200 million to HIV/AIDS projects in most developing countries."
"We are eager to do more both by providing more money, and by working with the countries, our Member States and international partners to devise effective strategies that curtail the spread of HIV, cushion its impact on the health sector and provide care for those already afflicted with AIDS."
"However, we cannot confront AIDS without first acknowledging that it threatens every country and that each country has a core responsibility and potential to protect its populations through political leadership, sufficient resources and effective and equitable strategies."
"Country after country has ignored the AIDS epidemic, denying that the behaviour that spreads HIV occurs within its borders; and country after country has been proved tragically wrong."
"It is particularly important that the authorities of these countries should be clear in their calls for prevention of the spread of the epidemic."
"Hiding the facts will do no good."
"The populations must be clearly informed of the danger they are in and about the possible prevention measures."
"Here I am thinking especially about the younger generation."
"The latest post-Cairo-plus-five international conference on population and development debated the subject of sexual habits and rights, particularly of the young."
"It is necessary to focus more on this vulnerable part of the population if prevention measures are to have an improved effect."
"But political leadership and recognition of the problem of AIDS is only the first step."
"Our joint response to the epidemic must also be sufficiently wide and fair."
"Poor people and poor countries face many pressing problems besides AIDS, and government and international resources are scarce and even declining."
"In a typical developing country it costs as much to treat one AIDS patient for a year as it does to educate ten primary school students for a year."
"Balancing these worthwhile objectives is difficult but essential."
"Therefore all partners should play an appropriate role and do so in genuine partnership."
"This has been the spirit of the EU' s response in the past and will also be at its core in the future."
"Countries are looking for incentives as part of the solution for people to lower their risk and vulnerability even in the most difficult situations."
"Countries have to decide about sustainable and fair financing."
"In addition the international community, including the EU, can assist, for example by lowering the cost of condoms and providing clean needles and essential drugs."
"This should include those drugs that can have sizeable effects on reducing HIV transmission from mothers to children and those that provide primary health care especially for the poorest, most affected and most vulnerable."
"Having mentioned condoms, it must be said that this is one of the best and safest ways of preventing the spread of the epidemic."
"Some people express moral reservations about using and promoting this type of prevention."
"However, I would like to underline that, given the size of the public health problem we are facing, the interests of the population at risk must be given priority over dogmatic positions of principle."
"It is most encouraging that an increasing number of developing countries have already given priority to the interests of their population, but there is still a long way to go."
"AIDS must be even more at the core of our development and poverty reduction efforts."
"We know that higher inequality is associated with higher HIV infection."
"This is especially so in the case of inequality between men and women."
"AIDS spreads more widely where women depend on men' s earnings, are unable to read and have limited legal rights to divorce, inheritance and child custody."
"The EU, jointly with its international and national partners, has been generous and timely in its response to the AIDS pan-demic in several developing countries."
"Our support has not, however, always gone to the most effective interventions, and has not yet reached the level needed to have the impact required."
"We will therefore continue to work with developing countries to ensure that the available knowledge, and our funds, produce better results in the future."
"However, only a joint action can reach the level required and we will therefore step up still further our efforts to coordinate with all those involved."
"Finally, the Commission welcomes the SADC Heads of States' Declaration on HIV/AIDS, which was signed in Lusaka."
"We ourselves look forward to finalising, as soon as possible, the signing of an extra financial package for the regional AIDS Action Plan in the SADC region (EUR 5m) as well as an additional all-ACP regional initiative on AIDS for another EUR 20m."
"These additional resources may appear meagre in view of the problem; however, it should only be seen as an extra effort, providing a further catalyst to EU and global commitments to confront this devastating epidemic."
"We must all work together in this effort."
"Madam President, when the first grave reports about AIDS first inundated Europe and the United States at the beginning of the eighties, some very grave predictions were made as to the extent and the social implications of this disease."
"Now, twenty years on, AIDS is reasonably under control in Europe and the United States, although the situation still gives a great deal of cause for concern in certain areas and amongst certain groups."
"In Africa, however, all our worst fears as regards the disease have been realised and exceeded."
"Although the situation varies from country to country, there are, in fact, a number of countries in which 20-30% of the active population is infected."
"These are mainly young adults, therefore people who are active in economic terms but who also often have family responsibilities; a generation of people who in most countries form the backbone of society."
"When such a group contains so many people suffering long-term illness and who are seriously weakened, and there is such a high number of deaths, then these countries suffer disastrous consequences."
"At the grass roots level of the family, we see the large scale on which families are without breadwinners and children without people to bring them up, whilst at local and regional level the social, health and educational problems are really getting out of hand."
"Madam President, the problems experienced by the older generations, who often have to be cared for by these groups, are on the increase."
"We can see how, at the national level, the economy and foundations of society are weakening."
"That is what we have seen happening in Africa over the last twenty years."
"As a result, everything that has been built up in terms of aid and progress these last 25 years is at risk of being demolished."
"The question is, how can we help the African countries to ward off this fate?"
"I believe it is Europe' s duty to share our knowledge and experience of this disease and to give financial aid to those African countries that want to participate in the process themselves, with a view to supporting them in their fight against AIDS and the consequences of AIDS."
"African countries really got to grips with the situation at the eleventh conference in Lusaka."
"I want to express how much respect I have for the experts and relief workers, including those from the African regions, who made their contribution with such frankness and expertise."
"What needs to be done now in order to tackle the disease in Africa?"
"What can we do to help?"
"My group considers the following points to be essential."
"In each African country, an assessment must be made of the scale of this disease and of the proportions it threatens to assume."
"All efforts must be directed at achieving maximum openness and preventive measures."
"As far as openness is concerned, a lot still has to be asked of African leaders in terms of breaking through traditional African taboos, particularly with regard to speaking out about the dangers of unprotected sex."
"This is not just about traditional African taboos."
"There are certain churches, European ones too, that, to my mind, with all due respect for their teachings, ought to warn against unprotected sex, and that includes advocating the use of condoms."
"Prevention will only be possible if there is honesty and openness."
"Prevention is vitally important and must be encouraged in all sections of the African population, and particularly amongst young people."
"People must grasp the idea that having unprotected sex puts your life at risk, all the more so in present-day Africa."
"This is not about preaching at people but it is about becoming fully aware of the dangers."
"Madam President, when it comes to prevention, it is also important, of course, to avoid a situation in which pregnant women with AIDS pass this disease on to their unborn children."
"There are drugs for this and they must be made available."
"Lastly, Madam President, there is the help we need to give the children who have been left orphaned."
"They must be helped to go about their lives, to pursue an education and to make a fresh start."
"We believe these to be the most important points that need to be addressed."
"That is why it is so difficult to comprehend why the European Commission has reduced the original budget for the AIDS assistance programmes, specifically with regard to third countries."
"I was pleased to hear the Commissioner say that additional resources are to be made available again."
"That is a good thing."
"But I hope that this will also be taken account of in the Budget as soon as possible."
"Do more and do it better."
"That was the theme of the Lusaka conference."
"We call upon the Commission to boost its programmes for Africa with this theme in mind."
"The disease is being tackled successfully in Europe and the United States."
"Let us help Africa to avert the disaster that threatens it."
"My group wants us to become involved here, even if there are budgetary consequences."
"The Africans are our neighbours and we must not abandon them."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in fact the problem cannot be taken seriously enough."
"AIDS is threatening to become a health catastrophe on an unimaginable scale, particularly in the countries of Africa south of the Sahara."
"Children are affected above all."
"According to an estimate by UNAIDS and the World Health Organisation, 7 out of every 10 people newly infected with the HIV virus live in this region."
"In the case of children under 15 years of age, the figure is as many as 9 out of 10. Approximately 83% of deaths from AIDS take place here, and at least 95% of all children orphaned by AIDS are African boys and girls in this region."
"Of the 34 million people infected since the epidemic appeared in this part of Africa, 11.5 million have already died, a quarter of them children."
"At the same time, reference has been made to the fact that all the successes there have been in terms of increasing life expectancy have been reduced to nothing."
"In many countries, life expectancy has even fallen again to the level recorded in the 1960s."
"To put it another way: a child who is born today in an African country badly affected by AIDS has an average life expectancy of only 43 years."
"The situation in Eastern and Southern Africa is particularly dramatic."
"In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, a fifth of the adult population is infected or ill with AIDS."
"This dreadful situation could continue indefinitely."
"However, AIDS is no inevitable fate."
"A number of countries such as Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda committed themselves early on to prevention, and with success."
"It is high time that, where the politics of health are concerned, the emergency brake was put on throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and also in other affected parts of the world."
"Social, political and religious taboos have no place here."
"They must be cleared away; how and by whom is immaterial."
"Trivialising AIDS and making it taboo are a direct route to catastrophe."
"The partnership, AIDS against AIDS in Africa, founded at the Lusaka Conference, deserves firm support from the European Union, both in material terms and in terms of visionary perspective."
"Civilian society, including the private sector, together with representatives of governments, international aid organisations and non-governmental organisations of various kinds have come together in order to declare war on the epidemic."
"They have undertaken to launch comprehensive AIDS or, rather, anti-AIDS programmes in all African States."
"One of the ambitious goals of these programmes is to achieve a 25% reduction in the number of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 newly infected by AIDS, and this by the year 2005 in the most badly affected countries and by the year 2010 in all countries."
"These efforts can and must be supplemented by the European Union and, above all, vigorously supported through cooperation with the ACP countries."
"In fact, the European Union has not been inactive to date."
"Between 1987 and 1997, almost 200 million ecus or euros were spent on HIV/AIDS programmes in more than 90 developing countries."
"This fact should be expressly recognised."
"To this will be added, over the next three years, a further EUR 45 million in the context of a special budget strand for developing countries in regions around the world, together with EUR 20 million for a regional 5-year programme for the ACP countries and additional funds in the context of specific programmes such as those for the ACP countries. These figures do not include, for example, research programmes or co-financing by non-governmental organisations."
"More than in Europe, it is young girls who are especially at risk in Africa."
"Nowhere are there more teenage mothers and nowhere do they give birth to a larger number of infected babies."
"The main effort must therefore be to educate young people."
"This is a task which must be carried out in schools."
"The education campaigns and condom advertising in Tanzania and Uganda have shown that success is possible."
"Above all, the radio must be employed as a means of information to reach everybody."
"Here too, specific measures of support are absolutely necessary."
"Joint efforts in a spirit of partnership are the right path to go down."
"But if these are to be effective, more rather than less resources are needed and, in this regard, I am anxious about the Commission' s, as well as this Chamber' s, financial policy."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen, I hope that your group will help ensure that the decisions of the Committee on Budgets that I have heard about will be revoked or altered in the plenary sitting, while any watering down of the proposals tabled by the Committee on Development will be reversed."
"We must together ensure that whatever it is that we want can also be financed."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to say how pleased we are that this debate is taking place and I also welcome the Commission' s statement, which has a ring of vigour and decisiveness."
"As far as policy in Africa is concerned, the figures speak for themselves."
"AIDS threatens the long-term development of at least ten African countries."
"The epidemic there causes more deaths than do armed conflicts on that continent."
"Two million people have died of AIDS-related diseases, which is ten times the amount of people that have died due to armed conflicts."
"In the year 2001 there will be more than 13 million orphans in Africa on account of AIDS."
"At the same time, there is no, or at least not enough, money to pay for drugs in Africa."
"Of course it is not just an African problem, as the Commission rightly commented."
"The disease knows no boundaries."
"That is why it is our duty to do something about it, and I fully endorse what Mrs Maij-Weggen had to say in this regard."
"Accordingly, there are two issues I would briefly like to go into."
"Firstly there is the problem relating to compulsory licensing, which I believe will also come up for discussion at the WTO meeting soon to take place in Seattle."
"Compulsory licensing must not be allowed to lead to people in Africa no longer being able to afford anti-AIDS drugs."
"This really is a big problem over there."
"AIDS drugs can be produced more cheaply than is the case at present."
"That is an issue that needs to be addressed."
"My second question relates to the financial aid delivered by the European Union."
"I hear reports to the effect that not all this aid gets to where it is supposed to be going and that one of the reasons for this is that this aid, or at least a part of it, is distributed via national governments."
"If that is the case, then it would be worth looking into whether something can be done about this."
"On a final note, I want to add my voice to the appeal made by the Commission."
"I have in mind its appeal to religious authorities to play an active part in preventive programmes, particularly where the distribution of condoms is concerned"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of the fight against AIDS in developing countries has been discussed many times in the European Parliament."
"Yet, since 1996, the situation has further deteriorated - 89% of the people afflicted with AIDS are resident in the 10% of the poorest countries on Earth."
"This is clear evidence of the failure of a policy dedicated purely to limiting the illness without looking into the economic and social reasons for the spread of the disease."
"On the one hand, the economy of African countries is crumbling due to the structural adjustments made necessary by the World Bank and the IMF."
"States are making swingeing cuts in their social budgets, resulting in an inability to provide patients with minimum care."
"The European Union must assist these countries in providing this minimum care, and more, if possible."
"Indeed, we were stupefied to learn that, against the advice of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, the AIDS budget was to be halved, which would be a scandal, given the urgency of the situation, and contradictory to the comments made by Mr Nielson."
"In the majority of African countries, there is no access to screening and, even if it were accessible, surely it is understandable that no one wishes to find out their status when discovering that you are HIV positive means that all you can do is wait to die."
"The fact is, treatment is practically non-existent in most of these countries."
"Confronted with this situation, the Lusaka conference maintained an often inappropriate line, promoting abstinence, moral order and traditional medicine."
"AIDS cannot be fought by ignoring the provision of medical treatment."
"Thus, the States most affected by the disease ought to be able to benefit from compulsory licences permitting them to produce, at reduced cost, the generic anti-HIV treatments effective in preventing the development of the opportunistic infections which lead unavoidably to death."
"Today, this right is not applied due to pressure from holders of patents, from States or multinationals."
"Within the scope of the precautionary principle in health matters, the European Union must therefore defend the application of the entitlement to compulsory licences in the Millennium Round"
"Millions of people dead, millions of orphaned children, we cannot stand by and do nothing."
"This is why, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I ask you to support our proposals, so that we can give developing countries some real means of combating this scourge which is AIDS."
"Madam President, everyone remembers the alarm cry which went out from the eleventh international AIDS conference in Lusaka less than a month ago."
"HIV has become the principal cause of death in Africa."
"In some countries, it affects a quarter of the population."
"We may speak of a risk of humanitarian catastrophe."
"In requesting, therefore, a debate in the European Parliament, I was hoping that we would show that Europe had heard this alarm cry."
"Since then, I have met some of the main NGOs involved in the fight against AIDS in the field."
"Arising from these discussions, there are three essential proposals which I would like to mention now."
"The first, naturally, is to do with the budgetary resources which Europe assigns to the fight against AIDS in developing countries."
"I am not the first to remind you that the draft budget for the year 2000 anticipates a spectacular fall in the level of our aid, a two thirds reduction of the commitment appropriations from EUR 16.5 to 5.5 million, at the very time when, quite the opposite, it is the strengthening of international mobilisation which is needed."
"Consequently, we Members of Parliament shall soon have to face up to our responsibilities in this matter."
"The second area where we can and must improve our intervention involves, in my opinion, the selection of our priorities in the field."
"The Commission favours prevention, which is indispensable, but it underestimates the possible inconsistency of access to treatment."
"For, indeed, how can people be persuaded to go in for screening if they know full well that they will not receive any treatment?"
"It is a situation which promotes fatalism."
"We should therefore, in my opinion, see prevention, access to treatment and research as indivisible components."
"In the third place, there is the necessary question of the cost of medicines and how to enable the countries of the South to have access to these."
"Commissioner Nielson mentioned this problem and, for my part, I would put forward two proposals."
"Firstly, the European Union can and should enter into negotiations with laboratories in order to obtain different prices for North and South."
"Secondly, Europe could in fact play a decisive role at the negotiations in Seattle on world trade."
"In fact, agreements on intellectual property signed within the framework of the WTO allow for States to authorise the local production and distribution at reduced cost of medicines, which are otherwise protected by patent, in ""emergency situations"" . So far this exists only in principle, but surely this is such a case."
"This is the matter of the compulsory licences which have been mentioned."
"In actual fact, implementing this clause exposes the countries concerned to the threat of sanctions by the most powerful groups and States."
"This must cease."
"Then, the European Union could take pride at Seattle by firmly defending the principle of a sort of exception for health, in other words, by demanding that the major imperatives of public health are not threatened by international trade agreements."
"The European Union could, furthermore, assist the countries of the South in preparing their legislation in this spirit in order to counter ultra-liberal pressure."
"Madam President, by adopting these proposals, Europe can affirm its own identity on the international stage while contributing towards giving new hope to millions of human beings."
"Mr President, it is now over fifteen years since the disease we all now know as AIDS came into the public domain."
"Though the number of people suffering from HIV has stabilised in recent years in Europe, the problem of AIDS is still a very real one particularly in the more deprived and disadvantaged urban areas and of course, within the African continent."
"A recent study carried out by an organisation in my constituency called Cáirde points to the fact that 80% of people who contract HIV in Ireland are in receipt of welfare payments."
"Social exclusion and inadequate income, and living in a disadvantaged or deprived area, are all factors explaining why HIV as a disease mainly affects the more deprived communities in urban Ireland."
"There is no room for complacency when it comes to the issue of combating HIV and AIDS."
"Again according to the report of Cáirde, in Ireland almost 3 000 people are HIV positive, and a further 3 000 people are affected when one considers the family members and children of those who are HIV-positive."
"Medical treatments are certainly improving; however, they are not inexpensive and one year' s treatment for HIV illnesses costs an average of between IEP 12 000 - 14 000."
"Public information campaigns must be supported both within Ireland and the European Union, because prevention is the best cure in such matters."
"While medical treatments are improving, and while standards of care, standards of treatment and the cost of such care are paramount in our concerns, if one can prevent transmission of such diseases, then we may go a long way to reducing the number of those affected."
"I believe that the European Commission, the European Parliament and the national member governments should redouble their efforts to publicise the public health information campaign; this should be done either via the respective Departments of Health or through voluntary groups who play such an important role in helping those who are affected by such diseases."
"As a member of the Development and Cooperation Committee of the European Parliament, I recognise that AIDS is rampant, particularly on the continent of Africa."
"Health and education programmes must be targeted at the African continent where the AIDS plague is out of control."
"Mr President, the aim of the eleventh ICASA conference in Lusaka was to set in motion a critical evaluation of the priorities and strategies which have been drawn up so far in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement."
"We are going to have to give particular attention in our debate on this subject to the solutions being proposed by the African scientists themselves."
"As affluent western countries, we must not start talking in a high-handed manner about what we consider to be the best approach."
"For it is heart-rending to think that, of all peoples, it is the impoverished African people who are having to endure this affliction."
"On the occasion of the Lusaka conference some comments worth listening to were made on the question of how to tackle the spread of AIDS effectively."
"A case in point was the courageous contribution made by Professor Nkando Luo, the Zambian Minister for Public Health, who called for high moral standards to be maintained and for responsible sexual behaviour."
"In saying this, she reached the heart of the matter."
"Other speakers in Lusaka also suggested that this is not being made a subject for discussion in all candour, although everyone is aware that the spreading of the HIV virus is due, above all, to promiscuous behaviour."
"It goes without saying that this should never give rise to the stigmatisation of those who are infected with the AIDS virus."
"Compassion and mercy are the key words when it comes to our behaviour towards these sick fellow human beings."
"Cheap drugs and the means to relieve their suffering ought therefore to be available."
"Where this is not the case, as affluent countries it is only right that we should make a contribution."
"But what I have just said relates to curative care."
"Preventive measures are even more necessary."
"If we are to tackle a problem effectively, then we must always begin at its root."
"If we drop the moral standard advocating that sexual intercourse be embedded in a relationship based on mutual trust, in which the man and woman know each other inside out, then it is to be feared that this will bring about disintegration and breakdown in society."
"When people lead promiscuous lives we are not talking about relationships in which respect for the other person as a human being sets the tone."
"This means that we are destroying that which is loveliest."
"The comment made by the South African Zindaka Sibeko during the ICASA conference was telling."
"He said: ""I believe that the longing for marriage raises a painful dilemma these days, for we have been completely robbed of the happiness, the joy that accompanies a wedding."""
"Africa holds up a mirror to Europe in this respect: the selfish lifestyle, in which purely individual sexual pleasure without respect for the other person or responsibility to society is considered the norm, has a very high price."
"Too high."
"Perhaps there is a need for a European version of the Lusaka conference at which we as Europeans would reflect on our principal responsibilities, for the draft resolutions submitted to date do not contain so much as a hint of how badly this is needed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Africa over two million people die every year, four million people become infected and we know that 70% of new HIV-positive people are in Africa. This is obviously a pandemic that is the primary cause of death for a citizen in an African country."
"This is far-reaching and of unprecedented seriousness owing to the way this illness is affecting, in particular, a continent which the European Union has special relations and links with. But in recent years, I think these have slackened and have completely missed the mark."
"I am referring, obviously, to the Lomé Convention, to this partnership pact that is a bit exclusive, a bit special, and that we have always described as the European Union' s response to the former colonies, as well as to other areas, but which mainly addresses the African continent."
"And the response, as Mr Wurtz and other speakers stated, was a bureaucratic response to initially reduce the expenditure linked to the budget as regards investment in the AIDS sector."
"Clearly, the response should be political, which it was not."
"We are undoubtedly dealing with this illness a bit differently, according to whether it is in this part or in the other part of the hemisphere."
"Next week, when we meet our African partners in the ACP Parliamentary Assembly - European Union meeting, we must bear in mind that, while Lusaka was a failure, in part this is definitely down to the fact that we did not pay enough attention to this matter, along with other matters."
"We should therefore organise a large conference on AIDS, but not leave it only to those countries that must then deal with such terrible consequences in practice, but a conference that we have wanted for years, since 1993, on pandemics and AIDS."
"With us there to oversee things, we could meet this situation head on and finally agree on measures that are appropriate for an international authority, given that in this regard the WHO is completely incapable of offering specific responses."
"I think this would be a wise and sensible measure, a measure which, up till now, we certainly have not taken."
"I hope that this will head our agenda next week in the context of the ACP and that it will become, Commissioner, a proposal that the Commission and the European Union will themselves make, so that we can finally approach this matter in a serious way."
"Mr President, the HIV epidemic so far has very often been described primarily as a health-related problem."
"Indeed the health implications are serious."
"In less than two decades, a very short time in the world of infectious diseases, AIDS has become the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa."
"But the implications of this epidemic go far beyond the health sector."
"The loss of young men and women in the prime of their lives is devastating as regards economic development and productivity, education, agriculture and a whole host of socio-economic spheres."
"Hard-won gains in terms of development are being eroded and even reversed as a consequence of this epidemic."
"Reference has already been made in this debate to the demographic consequences."
"Countries where the population grew by 3% or more just a few years ago will experience negative growth."
"If a comparison is allowed, I believe that what several countries in sub-Saharan Africa are going through is something similar to the Black Death in 14th century Europe."
"Mr Nielson referred to the response so far."
"There have been efforts at international level, I agree, but far too limited."
"I welcome Mr Nielson' s suggestions for the budget to be topped up, but more has to come."
"What is needed in the first instance is more money and support in terms of financial resources."
"Here the international community can do a lot."
"Then we have to bring about - and this is primarily the responsibility of the countries concerned - more openness."
"The whole area of HIV prevention has been surrounded by too much silence."
"There has even been a stigma attached to it."
"In such an environment prevention through education is difficult."
"In such an environment people are discouraged from seeking testing and counselling."
"Let us hope that the recent conference in Lusaka represents a turning point."
"What is needed in the future is more funding, more concerted effort and more openness."
"I have personally followed very closely efforts within the international community over the last couple of years to bring about a more concerted fight against HIV/AIDS."
"A joint programme, UNAIDS, was established a few years ago."
"It has done some good things, but efforts within that programme have been undermined by shrinking budgets within the UN system."
"It is my absolute conviction that the European Union has to take a much stronger lead in international efforts in terms of AIDS and HIV prevention."
"Our aid budget is considerable."
"We ought to allocate a gradually bigger share of that budget in support of HIV prevention."
"If we are serious about development we have to do this."
"Otherwise all our other efforts in the area of development will be very much in vain."
"I have four specific questions to ask the new Commissioner."
"Firstly, are you willing to work hard to ensure that a permanent increase in the Union budget will be allocated for HIV prevention?"
"Secondly, are you willing to make sure that whatever the European Union does in this field is well coordinated with other donors?"
"In few areas, I believe, are coordination and cooperation more necessary than here."
"Thirdly, are you willing to make sure that efforts go beyond the health sector, realising that the socio-economic and developmental consequences are so serious?"
"Last but not least, are you willing to seek partnership with the pharmaceutical companies, on the one hand, to speed up work to try to develop a vaccine and, secondly, to make medicines more accessible to the poor of this world?"
"Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for his statement."
"In 1998, Commissioner, 530 000 children were infected with the AIDS virus in Sub-Saharan Africa."
"The startling contrast is that 1 000 children in total were infected by the virus in the whole of Western Europe and North America during that year."
"So we have to ask the question: why does such a discrepancy exist Why are there such stark contrasts in terms of the sheer scale of the poverty of people' s lives in Africa and, of course the resulting lack of proper health services, education, and AIDS treatments."
"Of course, as others have said, the neglect of Africa has very severe economic consequences."
"These include the suffering and death of productive members of their societies and, very importantly, the diversion of women away from employment towards the role as carers, and the diversion of resources in families and communities from savings to care, and indeed, as I am sure you are aware, to the endless funerals that you can witness in countries like Zimbabwe if you stand on a street corner."
"The time has come to invest in programmes that target more effectively the health needs of the people in Africa."
"It is, of course, ironic, as we mentioned in the Development Committee yesterday, that the Budget Committee voted last week to cut the budget line on reproductive health care and HIV/AIDS work by half from EUR 25 million to 12 million, and that we are now discussing the need for investment in this area."
"In rich countries, anti-retroviral therapies are extending the lives of significant numbers of people in wealthy nations."
"But I have to say that these solutions will never be affordable or accessible to the tens of millions of the world' s poorest people."
"I welcome the fact that the European Commission is placing increasing emphasis on giving resources to support the development of an AIDS vaccine."
"Only last week, as I am sure you are aware, the British development minister announced a very large investment in research for that vaccine."
"Early clinical trials will begin in January 2000 in the United Kingdom, and afterwards in Nairobi."
"In countries like Zimbabwe where 20% of the population are positive, vaccines, in my view, are the only hope."
"Meanwhile, in the short term, women are the key to progress."
"Adolescent girls in Sub-Saharan Africa are 6 times more likely to be infected than boys of their age."
"In a recent study in Kenya 25% of girls between 15 and 19 were HIV positive and 4% of boys."
"Women are literally silenced by ignorance, fear and stigma."
"Gugu Dlamini announced in a rally in Johannesburg last December that she was HIV positive."
"A week later, she was beaten to death by neighbours who said that she had brought shame to their community."
"That kind of situation, President, shames us all."
"Mr President, there is also one matter I would like to raise, and that is the relationship of drugs to this problem."
"We are looking at Africa but we must also look around us, to our own local societies."
"Northern Ireland is on the periphery of this Union and it is a peripheral part of the Union and yet we are seeing the start of a terrible spread in our country, greatly linked to drugs trafficking."
"Whether this Parliament likes it or not, when laws are violated there is always a sad reaping to the violation of law."
"The Bible says that if you sow to the flesh, of the flesh you will reap corruption; and that is a fact that has to be faced."
"Nevertheless, there must be infinite compassion for those who have been stricken."
"I am glad that my own church has a programme to that effect and is working hard on it."
"There must be compassion."
"We must sit where these people sit, we must recognise the circumstances that they are in, and we must do everything in our power to seek to help them in their dire plight."
"It is a tragedy that this Parliament is meeting today in the shadow of the fact that our Committee on Budgets is cutting down on aid."
"We should be doing our best to get more finances to deal with this problem."
"Mr President, our position has been very well explained by Mr Wurtz and Mr Sylla."
"I only want to highlight three aspects."
"The first one - and I say this as a medical historian - concerns the fact that, in a continent that has been destroyed by colonisation, which is the case with Africa, it is not an accident that the AIDS epidemic has occurred, but rather it is a consequence of the impoverishment of that continent, and therefore we are responsible, as the former colonial power, for helping Africa."
"The second is that, given the prevalence of AIDS in Africa and knowing that thousands of young people cross the Mediterranean into Europe, via Spain and other countries, and also bearing in mind the incubation period of the disease, which is from five or six to twelve years, we can calculate that a third of these young people are infected with AIDS and are living in Europe."
"This issue, therefore, affects us directly."
"Thirdly and finally, I would like to point out that the most suitable instrument we have - this has been demonstrated by the UN by means of the WHO in the fight against smallpox - is the WHO."
"It is incredible that we have abandoned such an important international instrument as the World Health Organisation."
"Granting of supplementary macro-financial assistance"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0017/1999 by Mr H.-P. Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision providing further macro-financial assistance to Bulgaria [COM(99)0403 - C5-0098/1999 - 1999/0165(CNS)];"
"A5-0018/1999 by Mr H.-P. Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision providing further macro-financial assistance to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [COM(99)0404 - C5-0099/1999 - 1999/0166(CNS)];"
"A5-0019/1999 by Mr H.-P. Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision providing further macro-financial assistance to Romania [COM(99)0405 - C5-0097/1999 - 1999/0167(CNS)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the three draft reports we have before us concerning further financial assistance to Bulgaria, Romania and Macedonia cover much the same ground in terms of content and political perspective so I should like to explain them together."
"What are they about?"
"The Commission proposes granting loans to help the balance of payments in the context of a macro-economic stabilisation programme drawn up by the International Monetary Fund."
"It is intended to grant a sum of EUR 100 million to Bulgaria and a sum of EUR 200 million to Romania, in each case as a long-term loan."
"In the case of Macedonia, a contribution of no more than EUR 30 million in addition to the euro loan of EUR 50 million has been proposed because the country' s financial position has been particularly exacerbated by the conflict in Kosovo."
"In the case of all the countries, the financial assistance is to be provided in two tranches with the second tranche only being released once economic development and reforms have been satisfactorily resumed."
"The amounts I have mentioned for the various States are proportionate, on the one hand, to the estimated deficits in the balance of payments of the individual countries and, on the other hand, to the multilaterally agreed share which the EU has to contribute to these forms of macro-economic financial assistance."
"We are therefore concerned here with comparatively modest amounts."
"Just to support the balance of payments of the six States bordering Kosovo, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have estimated that USD 1.5 billion in financing is required."
"Let me briefly go into details about the three countries which we are now dealing with here."
"For Macedonia, an external financial shortfall to the tune of USD 372 million is expected in 1999."
"Financial assistance is therefore an urgent matter in view of the vital interests which Europe has in stability in the Balkans."
"The dramatic reports may have disappeared from the television screens, but there are still thousands of Kosovan refugees in Macedonia."
"With the economic development since the change of government in 1997, Bulgaria has made some remarkable progress."
"Economic growth has been stimulated again."
"The rate of inflation has fallen."
"Exports have increased and direct foreign investments have been noted."
"However, the balance of payments deteriorated in 1998, with the crisis in Russia being partly responsible for this."
"In Bulgaria' s balance of payments for 1999, a financial shortfall of approximately USD 500 million is anticipated."
"Without the balance of payments loan of a maximum of EUR 100 million proposed by the Commission, the Bulgarian reform programme might be placed in jeopardy."
"Aid from the EU might also make it easier for Bulgaria to make some progress with safety at its nuclear power plants. This is also a matter of some concern for my home country, Austria."
"Because of the conflict in Kosovo, foreign trade has further deteriorated in Romania."
"An additional balance of payments deficit amounting to USD 190 million is in the offing."
"Here too, the laborious process of economic reform must be continued with and supported."
"In order to make further progress, Bulgaria, Romania and Macedonia need our help."
"The planned financial aid which, in the first place, is really a technical process, is also politically significant in connection with the discussion about enlargement of the European Union and, above all, against the background of the destabilisation of South-East Europe because of the Kosovo conflict."
"My own homeland, Austria, borders on four countries which want to join the European Union."
"It, therefore, has a particular interest in the economic and also political stabilisation of Central and South-East Europe."
"Such stabilisation cannot be achieved unless the region makes its own contribution."
"How much would growing uncertainty in Central and Eastern Europe cost in terms of political and financial capital?"
"In the end, how much would it cost us to look on and do nothing?"
"We must therefore commit ourselves, and not only financially but also politically."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists last week lent its support in Skopje to the idea of a Stability Pact in South-East Europe and, above all, took up the themes of democracy, human rights and a civilian society."
"Strengthening civilian society is undoubtedly an important concern but is inconceivable without stable framework conditions for the various national economies."
"I therefore recommend approval of the Commission' s proposals for financial assistance, including the amendments included in the report."
"My amendments to the Commission' s document are a reminder of the goal of macro-economic stabilisation."
"What, however, we must be concerned with, above all, is securing long-term employment and improving the conditions of people' s lives in the countries affected."
"In this context, the IMF' s policy of economic restructuring is often cause for fierce and necessary criticism."
"In the end, programmes in South-East Asia and particularly in Indonesia were to the detriment of poor strata of the population when, for example, subsidies for basic foodstuffs were cancelled."
"In the case of the economic reforms which are on the agenda in the former socialist States, a situation must therefore be prevented in which the burdens of change again affect those in society who are least able to defend themselves."
"It is true that the IMF has improved in many respects, but there is still a great deal of work to be done."
"Accordingly, we are also arguing for having representatives of the programmes join us here in Parliament, or at least in the Committees."
"With my changes, I should also like, however, to go on emphasising that the Commission and the relevant States are obliged to comply with the rules for budget supervision and efficient administration."
"It must go without saying that the European Parliament will be informed appropriately and in good time about any payments made and about the ways in which these are used."
"Finally, steps must be taken to ensure that the macro-economic financial assistance is not misappropriated, as we have seen happen in a dramatic way in Russia."
"The Council has requested urgent procedure in connection with the financial aid to these three countries."
"This means that we must approve them this week here in Strasbourg."
"In commenting upon this, the Committee on Budgets pointed out the basic interinstitutional problems and problems relating to budget policy which would arise if we were to comply with the Council' s request for urgent procedure in the case of financial assistance for Macedonia, since in this case, the Commission' s proposal contains a subsidy component."
"Granting up to EUR 30 million in subsidies to Macedonia throws up budgetary problems of a technical nature."
"The funds specified in Category 4, ""External Actions"" , of the Financial Perspective have already been exhausted by the funds assigned in the draft EU budget."
"The European Parliament must therefore insist upon a corresponding review of the Financial Perspective as a prior condition for granting the subsidy."
"Overall, there ought, however, to be agreement about the fact that aid is quickly needed for Bulgaria, Romania and Macedonia."
"Mr President, I will mainly speak on the same subject the last speaker finished on. What we are concerned with is macro-economic financial assistance for those countries."
"That means that the European Union only acts as an intermediary in obtaining funds."
"The money is borrowed on the international markets and passed on to these countries for their use."
"The European Union can guarantee that the cost of borrowing is less than it would be if these countries borrowed the funds directly from the international markets."
"The aid to be given to Macedonia is the most problematic of these financings, because in this instance it is not only a case of a loan, but also of a grant, to be paid over two years."
"The Council has decided on this form of financing, but it made the decision without the corresponding funds being available. The Committee on Budgets draws its attention to this fact."
"If the Financial Perspective is not revised, we will have to adjust other budget lines under heading 4, ""External Action"" , and in order to secure the aid to Macedonia, we will find ourselves cutting aid to other areas."
"With this kind of financial aid, it cannot be the intention that, in order for one country to receive, money should be taken away from others."
"For this reason, the Committee on Budgets has proposed to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy that it should demand a revision of the Financial Perspective in this regard, and positive reference has been made to this in the report."
"Examination of the Financial Perspective is, in any case, an important matter and is linked in its entirety to the question of what the financial basis is or, in other words, to the fact that the war in Kosovo has brought about a situation which is unexpected and new and which had not been catered for by the Financial Perspective."
"This is also linked directly to an examination of the Financial Perspective, which must be carried out on account of the aid to Kosovo, the funds to rebuild areas of Turkey devastated by the recent earthquakes and on account of the agreement on fishing with Morocco."
"Neither is it unconnected with the fact that at this moment in time there are not sufficient funds available to realise all those projects in Category 4 which the Council and the Commission want to realise and which they have proposed."
"The response of Parliament to the form proposed by the Committee on Budgets is that it is important in connection with this issue to examine the Financial Perspective and in this way also to ensure that general aid from Parliament and from the European Union really does reach its destination and also to safeguard the possibility of bringing these matters to a favourable conclusion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aid that we are calling on to be approved for these three European countries - and I stress ""European countries"" because we are forgetting that we do also have needs in Europe - i.e. in FYROM, Bulgaria and Romania, is both necessary and urgent."
"Firstly, I say necessary because these countries are trying to adjust to a new environment of economic and commercial relations which are causing them problems, particularly in their balance of payments which, in turn, is affecting the general functioning of the market and economic development."
"Secondly, this aid is urgent - and I would say particularly urgent - because following the bombings in Yugoslavia, the whole economic equilibrium of the region was dangerously affected with exceptionally negative repercussions on those countries which fell victim to the intervention, without their wanting or causing it."
"Therefore, this macro-financial assistance is both necessary and urgent and our Parliament must show its support by promoting these Southern European countries."
"The third point which will sway decisions to vote in favour of the Council' s proposal is that the level of financial assistance is relatively low and so it will not affect the economic programme of the Commission."
"As for the difficulty which was mentioned regarding Category 4 of the Budget for FYROM, it is absurd to insist on this aid and not come up with the EUR 30 million."
"In conclusion, Mr President, this aid is necessary, urgent and imperative and yet our contribution is minor compared to the great efforts that these countries are displaying in their adjusting to the new challenges they are facing and which the war has tragically exacerbated."
"I believe this aid merits our unanimous support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, macro-economic assistance for the three countries which lie outside the war zone but which have suffered in the extreme during the war in Kosovo is only right and very important."
"Each of you will be thinking, are there still questions about this issue?"
"Support for lasting, successful development in the countries concerned is, however, urgently necessary."
"Here, I wish to clearly state again on behalf of my group, that we want to do everything to ensure that Bulgaria and Romania are not left behind in the process of enlarging the European Union."
"These countries, and also the neighbouring country of Macedonia, urgently need our political and economic support."
"In this connection, I should again like to remind you that this Parliament has decided here on several occasions that the visa requirement for entering and leaving Romania and Bulgaria, which constitutes a form of exclusion, should finally be removed."
"The Council and the Commission should urgently state their position on this issue at the Helsinki Summit."
"On the question of financial assistance, the Commission and the Council always extol their splendid charitable initiatives in referring to the huge sums given by way of macro-economic aid."
"Have you ever asked, though, how effective this macro-economic assistance is in regard to economically and socially-balanced development in these crisis-racked countries?"
"What basically is the money for? Whose pockets is it really going into?"
"The truth is that not a single euro benefits the people in the region, neither small and medium-sized businesses nor the education and health systems. Nor is the money used to create employment."
"It does not contribute either to the local and regional infrastructure, the reconstruction of which is an important prerequisite for investment."
"No, it amounts to nothing more than bribes for international banking systems."
"It offsets the indebtedness into which the IMF has brought these countries."
"It flows practically direct into the coffers of the international banks and in that way contributes to the further indebtedness of the so-called recipient countries."
"It is also only a credit, even if the conditions are better than those of the EMF."
"Nonetheless, the conditions are: save on health care and on social insurance and pensions systems."
"The result: the further impoverishment of broad strata of the populations of the countries concerned."
"Is that what we mean by stability?"
"Can stability in the region be based upon further indebtedness and further impoverishment?"
"In practice, the macro-economic assistance only contributes to account being taken of the budgetary conditions of the EMF."
"The indebtedness is therefore compounded."
"In other words, we need a change of direction in the structure, and we need politics to again assume priority in this domain and responsibility for economic and socially-balanced development which is genuinely stable."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Members, firstly, for their analysis of the problem and, secondly, for their generally positive reaction to the proposal which is being examined here today."
"I would also like, in my first appearance before this Parliament, to insist once again on something that I insisted on in the Commission, which is the need to establish the best possible relationship between my duties as Commissioner and the people responsible for the corresponding areas in this Parliament."
"I believe that the various interventions have shown that there is no group which, in principle, will stand in the way of aid. In fact I have noticed a position which is clearly favourable to the proposals."
"We all agree that the crisis in Kosovo, which has given rise to this difficulty, leaves us no choice but to make a greater effort."
"However, I would like to clarify certain issues which may help us to understand the Commission' s position with regard to the different proposed amendments."
"Firstly, we are talking about balance of payments aid."
"Balance of payments aid is very different from the provision of funds for normal programmes."
"Balance of payments aid is aimed at boosting a country' s reserves in such a way that it can confront its external payments problems, which always have a compensation: it is always either the provision of services or the supply of goods which is being paid for."
"Therefore we are not talking about funds directed at the budgets of each one of these countries, the aim of which would be to carry out specific actions."
"Clearly, and as a consequence of this fact, they are connected neither to specific projects or programmes."
"We are talking about a financial contribution aimed at confronting these difficulties."
"Secondly, in the case of Bulgaria and Romania, the funds are connected to agreements with the International Monetary Fund which have this same objective."
"In the case of FYROM, the situation is rather different."
"That country is currently negotiating an agreement with the International Monetary Fund."
"It is possible that agreements will be reached, in which case we will cooperate with them, but, in the event that no agreement is reached, we believe that the situation demands the support of the European Union in any event."
"Therefore, whether or not there is an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, there will be support for FYROM, although it must clearly be conditional upon the application of the necessary reform programme so that these funds will be put to specific effective use."
"I would like to remind you that this is not the first time that this type of aid has been granted to these countries."
"It has happened in the past."
"This aid has always functioned efficiently."
"We have never had problems with regard to the repayment of debts, there have never been delays on the part of these countries, and therefore, from our point of view, and in financial terms, they are absolutely viable partners."
"Having made these preliminary comments, I would like to deal with the various proposals put forward by Mr Martin in his report."
"In view of the philosophy that I have explained, I believe that our position is understandable."
"With regard to the first proposal, if I have understood correctly, the intention is something which I share completely with Mr Martin and that is that, ultimately, growth and economic reform should increase employment and improve standards of living."
"In these two respects, we are in absolute agreement."
"Therefore, we would accept a wording which, in place of what has been put forward in the proposal, said ""with a view to increasing employment and living standards."""
"This wording would be perfectly acceptable to the Commission."
"We come to the second point, which is the second Amendment, which intends to establish budgetary control by the Commission with regard to the funds in question."
"Given the difference between these funds and the normal projects which supply money to the budget, I am afraid that, in this case, this idea of budgetary control, which we all accept and defend, is not really applicable."
"In this case, the control must be carried out differently."
"We should control in general terms whether the country is using the funds correctly."
"Consequently, we would be in favour of an idea which seems to us fundamental, and that is that the Commission monitors the reforms which must be carried out in the said countries so that the aid may be used correctly."
"However, we do not believe that this point should be included in the text of the decision."
"The Commission is committed to carrying out this control and it should be done, obviously, in accordance with the evolution of macro-economic factors."
"We believe that this type of control will be sufficient."
"However, as I have said, we do not believe that including the proposed amendment is the best method."
"With regard to Amendment No 3, the fundamental idea, as has been said, is to try to ensure that a proportion of these resources is dedicated to the provision of the basic social needs of the population."
"This raises once again the problem that I mentioned before concerning the nature of this aid. If we were talking about budgetary aid I would have no hesitation whatsoever in accepting your proposal."
"In this case we are talking about financial support for these countries' reserves in order to help them deal with a certain type of counterpart."
"We are not here to discuss whether or not we should support the basic needs of the population."
"Nevertheless, for your peace of mind, I will tell you that these cases are radically different from the case you have mentioned concerning Indonesia."
"Also with regard to the International Monetary Fund' s own plan, in the Fund' s global plan concerning the definition of budgets and expenditure of the said countries, it is clearly established that a certain percentage of expenditure will have to be dedicated to social spending."
"In the specific case of Romania for example - I have the figures here - at the moment, for 1997, 8.3% of GDP is being spent on social expenditure."
"However the condition established in the Fund' s plan states that in 1999, this figure should rise to 10.5% of GDP."
"Therefore, I hope that this addresses the Honourable Members' concerns regarding the issues involving the International Monetary Fund."
"Nevertheless, I do not believe that it falls to the Commission to define internally, with regard to national budgets, how a global budget is to be established given that, as I said before, the Funds in question do not themselves have any particular specific purpose."
"We could clearly say the same of Amendment No 4, which has a similar justification and problems of an analogous nature."
"With regard to Amendment No 3, however, I would like to make an additional point."
"There are specific Union programmes dedicated to this idea of improving administration and dealing with basic social needs."
"Please remember, for example, that in the PHARE programme, 30% of the resources are dedicated to ""Institutional Building"" , which is clearly linked to the whole question of improving administrative functioning which will allow the problems to be resolved."
"These are the reasons why Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 do not seem acceptable to us."
"However, we are in total agreement with Amendment No 5."
"To Amendment No 5, we would simply propose a small correction in terms of style and that is, instead of the phrase appearing after the reference to the International Monetary Fund, we believe it should appear immediately after the word ""Commission"" ."
"Therefore it would be worded, ""the Commission, in accordance with the principles of sound and efficient management, shall verify..."" , etc. In this way we would totally accept your proposal but it would be more correctly worded."
"In Amendment No 6, the Commission is asked to inform Parliament before carrying out the second payment of balance of payment appropriations."
"Again this raises a problem of form and practice."
"The problem is as follows: decisions of this type are based on elements which must be treated, I would not say as secrets, but at least, with a degree of confidentiality and that, therefore, it would not be appropriate, it seems to me, to explain them and discuss them in sessions which are absolutely public and on record."
"Therefore, the problem stems from how we will find a procedure which will inform Parliament of these facts before they happen without involving a public meeting which I believe could cause certain problems with regard to the handling of these issues."
"The formula which I would now propose, and which I can commit myself to, is that, before these payments are made, the Chairmen of the Committees involved in these issues, for example, should be informed, so that Parliament has knowledge of them and there is no problem with regard to the need for confidentiality in relation to certain matters."
"We are in total agreement with Amendment No 7 concerning the provision of information before a certain date."
"Lastly, we come to perhaps the most problematic amendment, in terms of the form it should take, which is the one concerning the additional loan of 30 million."
"The Honourable Members raise budgetary problems and, insofar as this is a contribution of a budgetary nature, they will have to be resolved."
"The resolution you propose involves a revision of the Financial Perspective."
"I would like to distinguish between the two time periods."
"Firstly 1999 and then 2000."
"We are talking about EUR 30 million - 15 for this year and 15 for next year."
"With regard to the 15 million for this year, I can tell you that the figures are laid out in the budget and therefore, we have no problem with meeting these payments immediately."
"The problem concerns next year and, in fact, in the Commission' s decision, if the Honourable Members would like to see page 7, in section 4 which refers to this issue, it clearly states that, given the existing budgetary restrictions, there could be some difficulty and an adjustment in Category 4."
"This is clearly not a new problem therefore. It is a problem that has been noted and you are right to raise it now."
"The difficulty is which solution to adopt."
"Should we adopt a specific solution consisting of revising, by means of a specific Council decision, the Financial Perspective with regard to a specific point?"
"We believe that this would cause difficulty in terms of budgetary authority and analysing the issues individually, in such a way that we are not able to have a global view of the difficulties which we may have to face."
"Therefore, I would ask you not to include this reference to the revision of the Financial Perspective bearing in mind two things: firstly, that the Commission will clearly in any event consider revising the Financial Perspective in the future, taking into account not only this question but also other matters relating to Kosovo."
"Secondly, that logically it will fall to the budgetary authorities, to you as Parliament, to the Commission in its proposals and to the Council in its decisions, to take the decisions which it considers appropriate for 2000 without, at the moment, anticipating the definitive solution."
"ALTENER multiannual programme (1998-2002)"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0016/99) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adoption of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community (ALTENER) (1998-2002) (7122/1/99 - C5-0032/99 - 97/0370(COD))."
"Mr President, ALTENER is part of a multiannual programme of measures in the field of energy policy for the period 1998-2002."
"It is concerned with the important aspect of alternative, renewable energy sources."
"The Commission' s proposal dates from November 1997."
"At the first reading in March 1999, the last Parliament adopted its position on the basis of the draft report by our former colleague, Carlos Robles Piquer."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the legal basis has changed."
"The multiannual energy programme now falls under the codecision procedure."
"On 21 May 1999 - on the basis of the new legal position and directly after the Treaty of Amsterdam had come into force - the European Commission fundamentally altered and revised its proposal on the basis of Parliament' s decisions of 11 March 1999."
"On 28 June, the Council adopted its common position."
"Today, we can see that both the Commission and the Council have, to a large extent, accepted our proposals, and speaking here as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, I should therefore like to say a sincere thank you for the constructive cooperation in this matter."
"At this second reading, Parliament now has to examine whether the common position requires further amendment."
"On 22 September, the Committee on Industry and Energy unanimously adopted a recommendation on this."
"It is a shared goal of Parliament and the Commission to increase the proportion of renewable energy sources to 12% of gross energy consumption within the Community by the year 2010."
"That is approximately double the present figure."
"This is an ambitious goal requiring considerable efforts."
"The compromises which have now been reached are only a step along this road."
"Parliament is convinced that it is necessary for the Member States in particular to make increased efforts."
"The resources we have for the ALTENER programme are so modest that this ambitious goal cannot be achieved."
"The amendments we have tabled - nine in all - call on the Member States to make a voluntary commitment to promote renewable sources of energy."
"A charter should be used to overcome the fact that the European Union Treaty does not contain a specific chapter on energy policy."
"What is more, Parliament wants to include in Article 1, paragraph 1 implementation of the campaign to promote renewable sources of energy already called for by the 1997 White Paper. It also wants to create new instruments and mechanisms to promote rapid and coordinated penetration of the market by all sustainable energy technologies."
"In addition, the Eastern and Central European States and, as the Liberal Group has rightly requested, the Mediterranean States should also play an important role in implementation."
"In Article 5 of the ALTENER programme, Parliament would also like to insert a reference to the new procedures for exercising powers of implementation in order to improve the participation of the European Parliament."
"We are convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that part IV of the programme of several years' duration consisting of measures in the field of energy policy cannot fulfil everyone' s wishes."
"In this connection, I should remind you of the second report being discussed today: the report by Mrs Ahern on energy efficiency."
"I should, however, also remind you that, in implementing alternative sources of energy, we have two major examples, namely water and wind power, which are already proportionately so important that the others, such as solar energy and also utilisation of biomass, will have to be promoted extremely intensively."
"I am very grateful and happy that you, Commissioner, now have responsibility for this important subject for, as a former Spanish Minister for Agriculture, you know that it is possibly much more sensible to reduce the surpluses achieved in the context of European agricultural policy than to make areas available for cultivation which could be exploited for utilising energy from biomass."
"I am aware, however, that there is quite a lot of resistance in this area and that we are encountering opposition from industry and also from those who formulate agricultural policy. We should all be striving, however, to combine agricultural and energy policy in the sphere of renewable energy sources."
"With this in mind, I should like to say a warm thank you for your valuable cooperation and hope that the report will be accepted by a majority in Parliament."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for presenting a really good report."
"We in the Committee have gone along to the greatest possible degree - in fact, unanimously - with the proposal to again take up important requests for changes which arose out of the first reading and which have not been taken into account by the Council although we were very happy - and I say this here too, Mr Langen - that extensive approaches to Parliament were made."
"It is a declared goal of the European Union to double the proportion of renewable sources of energy consumed by the year 2010."
"Parliament and the Commission were already in agreement on this in the debate on the Green and White Papers."
"The Council too has supported their stance in the common position we have before us."
"Although it is clear that the technical potential available from wind power and solar energy, from biomass, from water power and from geothermal energy could cover considerably more than 12% of energy consumption by 2010, we know that achieving just this 12% will require great efforts, judging by growth rates in the past."
"This means that the Member States must do their homework. It also means that the European Union must make greater headway than in the past."
"For this to happen, it is necessary, on the one hand, to facilitate fair access to the grid for electricity from renewable energy sources."
"I would point out to the Commissioner that Parliament awaits the relevant proposals which must be such as to contribute to real market penetration."
"The close connection between conditions of access to the grid and growth rates in the proportion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources is something we can see from the above-average rates of increase in Denmark, Germany and also Spain."
"But what we are concerned with today is the ALTENER programme."
"It is the only EU programme which alone has the promotion of renewable energy sources as its goal."
"This programme is also the main instrument for implementing the Community strategy for renewable energy sources and it is therefore also the main instrument of the breakthrough campaign for renewable sources of energy."
"By means of this campaign, we want to introduce photovoltaic systems with a maximum output of one million kilowatts within the European Union and in developing countries."
"Among other things, 15 million square metres of solar collectors are to be erected. 10,000 megawatts are to be obtained from wind power and a further 10,000 megawatts from biomass."
"This campaign has to be financed from resources of the Member States, privately and with European funds."
"The Commission had earmarked the amount of EUR 81.1 million for the four-year period from 1998 to 2002 in the ALTENER programme."
"According to the Commission' s estimates, the breakthrough campaign alone requires public financing to the tune of approximately EUR 7 billion by the year 2003."
"That is to say, EUR 7 billion which has to come from the Member States and from the European Union."
"We know that this 81.1 million would only be a drop in the ocean, but we cannot, under any circumstances, accept that this sum should again be reduced to EUR 74 million, as specified in the common position."
"I would therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to endorse this position of the Committee, which has been unanimously adopted, in tomorrow' s vote and to also ensure that corresponding decisions are taken in the budget votes."
"Mr President, the promotion of the use of renewable energy sources is of particular importance for environmental reasons."
"The Union cannot meet its environmental targets unless the use of renewable energy sources is actively increased."
"The ALTENER programme is an important part of the strategy to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions."
"Renewable energy sources reduce the dependence on imported energy and an increase in their use will also improve competitiveness."
"Europe must attain a leading position in the rapidly growing area of the economy which is based on new technology for renewable energy sources."
"We must also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive effect on regional development and employment."
"The ALTENER programme is a step in the right direction."
"Mr Langen' s amendments also received broad-based unanimous support in the committee, which is no everyday occurrence."
"This consensus is a good starting point for promoting the use of sources of renewable energy."
"As has been stated here, however, this programme alone is by no means sufficient. An increase in the long-term use of renewable energy sources still requires a lot of research, pilot studies, an exchange of results, the harmonisation of legislation, a change in attitudes, information campaigns and also private and public investment which will pay for itself, but only in the long term."
"The sums used to finance the ALTENER programme are paltry considering the scale of the undertaking."
"In future we will need to investigate how we can increase investment in the greater use of renewable energy sources."
"At the present time, increasing the use of renewable energy sources is mainly the responsibility of the Member States."
"Hopefully, this programme will encourage the Member States to act decisively in increasing the use of renewable energy sources."
"In the list of renewable energy sources, peat has not yet been mentioned."
"It is, however, at least in Finland, an important, sustainable, and slowly renewable source of energy."
"I hope that it can be added to the list of renewable energy sources at some point."
"Mr President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to thank the rapporteur."
"I think we have a fairly broad consensus on this ALTENER programme."
"I also hope that, in the negotiations with the Council, he is able to get at least the EUR 81.1 million we have been talking about."
"It is important, however, that, one day before the debate here in Parliament on the Kyoto follow-up conference in Bonn, and also a few days after the second-worst nuclear accident in history (this time in a hi-tech country), we should also place this ALTENER programme in a wider context."
"It is against a particular background that we are framing energy policy: we want to protect the environment and we want to cut down on CO2 emissions, so we must examine in particular whether the liberalisation of the European electricity market, as is at present being implemented in a number of Member States, is not counter-productive."
"Wholesale liberalisation in Germany is now already putting both biomass and solar projects under pressure and, in the social sphere, it will also, of course, result in our soon finding ourselves with a lot of little Michelin-style incidents because jobs are being rationalised out of existence so that power companies' share prices rise."
"I think it is time to analyse this liberalisation - in both ecological and social terms - and then to consider what are the good approaches."
"Personally, I particularly like the Danish model, where there is transparent access to the grid; there is an energy tax which corrects prices; there are clear targets for renewable energy sources; and there is an almost protected market."
"We also need a protected market for renewable energy sources and for block-type thermal power stations."
"In my view, merely national corrective measures or national ""protective barriers"" of an ecological and social nature are insufficient."
"We must also consider, at a European level, how we might build in corrective features."
"We naturally want this ""feed-in directive"" adopted very quickly."
"I believe we need mechanisms in the field of renewable energy sources similar to those we have today for nuclear energy."
"We need an export guarantee because, all in all, renewable energy sources mean many more jobs and better environmental protection."
"Renewable energy sources should be worth that to us."
"Mr President, the share of renewable energy resources in the production of energy in the EU stands at less than 6%, and hydro-electric power makes up the bulk of this."
"It will be impossible to reach the target to double this figure with the current way of thinking, which would have us believe that oil and gas will last for ever, and if they do not, coal is cheap in any case."
"Far too little money has been devoted to the ALTENER programme."
"It is self-delusory to apply such small sums of money to good ends."
"We are deceiving ourselves by investing so little in a new approach."
"The security of the EU must also be considered."
"By 2020, 94% of the quantity of oil needed in the EU will be imported, as well as 80% of the coal and 75% of the gas."
"If we leave the future of our energy in such a precarious position, we will not be able to provide a secure future for our people."
"Mr President, my congratulations also to Mr Lange, who has shown real interest and enthusiasm in presenting his report and his amendments following on for Mr Robles Piquer."
"I am pleased to see our new Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio."
"We look forward to working with her and we hope she will soon share, if she does not already, our enthusiasm for renewable energy."
"Together with the SAVE Programme, we have in ALTENER II a way of showing the public of Europe that there are rational ways to meet the challenge of climate change: energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy."
"We are asking Member States to pledge their commitment to the encouragement of renewable energy - and they all say, individually, that they have this commitment - by signing a Charter on renewable energy - the EURENEW Charter."
"This would symbolise the added value of working together in the EU on society' s wishes and needs."
"Of course, the environmental benefits of renewable energy are obvious."
"But Mr Langen wisely reminds us of the enormous potential for European industry."
"One needs only to look at Denmark."
"And I fully support his call for the European Renewable Energies Export Council to be strengthened."
"Sadly, we lost one of the driving forces with the sudden death, earlier this year, of John Bonda, but others will carry on his work in the Export Council."
"I must say I am very pleased at the vocational training element of ALTENER II."
"That is to be welcomed."
"The budget is clearly inadequate and has to be increased if this programme is to be properly effective."
"I hope that an indication can be given by the Council in time for the appropriate changes to be made in the first reading of the 2000 budget."
"The emphasis on information dissemination in ALTENER II is very important indeed, and I look forward, if it is available yet, to looking at the Agores Centre on the Worldwide Web which is clearly intended to bring together all sorts of information on renewable energy so that everyone can look it up and can be kept up-to-date."
"Alongside ALTENER, and the research into renewable energy in the 5th Framework Programme, which we hope will be very significant, we need urgent flanking measures such as the ""feed-in directive"" for the electricity market."
"I hope we will hear more about this shortly from the Commission."
"The White Paper raised expectations, and we look forward to the exciting campaign for take-off with its 1 million PV systems, its large windfarm, its biomass and most exciting of all its 100 communities where all the electricity will come from renewable energy."
"There is nowhere in the whole of European Union where renewable energy is not relevant, whether it is Lapland or the Islands of Greece."
"The ALTENER II Programme will work and can work in every Member State and of course, outside the European Union in applicant countries, for example, as well as in the Mediterranean countries where the potential is huge."
"Renewable energy should become the symbol of what is sensible and progressive about Europe."
"This programme will help us obtain that symbol."
"Mr President, Mr Langen, an outstanding report, you have my respect."
"Utilising renewable sources of energy is a model example for the development and use of the most modern technologies which, at the same time, contribute to caring for the environment. However, there is also a second aspect."
"If one looks at those firms in Europe which are particularly involved in this area, it can be seen that these are mainly small and medium-sized companies."
"And, of course, since these small and medium-sized companies have, with these new technologies, made a considerable contribution to the employment policy of securing jobs, it is also a question of continuing to support them."
"In contrast to the big energy concerns in which employees are being laid off, by launching this programme and by promoting alternative energy sources, we are also making a contribution as Europeans to increasing the status of employment policy."
"At the same time, it must, of course, be said that this programme also has a special significance from the point of view of the enlargement of the EU eastwards."
"Of course, we are also concerned with bringing regenerative, environmentally-friendly energy production to these particular countries in order both to promote the protection of the environment and also of course - this must be added in all honesty - to open up new markets."
"To that extent, the resources made available for the ALTENER programme are in no way adequate."
"They must be increased, and the European Council must also be more heavily involved in the export of renewable energy sources. In that way, expertise can be combined and translated more quickly into effective action."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have prepared a speech which essentially repeats what the previous speaker said."
"I am, unfortunately, in the sad position of having to read out to you a message from Reuters news agency which proves the importance of what we are talking about here."
"The message was issued at 3.07 p.m., less than 30 minutes ago."
"It reads: Seoul, 22 injured in accident in South Korean nuclear power station."
"The precise text reads: 22 workers have been injured in an accident in a South Korean nuclear power station."
"They were exposed to radioactive radiation when heavy water escaped."
"This was reported today by the Yonhap news agency."
"Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, last March I already had occasion to say that as a Frenchman, I was and still am in favour of a highly voluntarist policy on energy."
"We must, as far as possible, move beyond the mere declarations of intent which have been heard so many times over the last decade, and find strong concrete applications if we want to achieve this target, a very modest one by the way, of 12%."
"It is only on this condition that the European Union will be able to provide itself with an energy policy which is durable, balanced and fully secure."
"It is of course the European Commission' s task to work towards this."
"To this end, two strategies have been developed through two multiannual programmes: SAVE II and ALTENER II."
"What must be done today, at their second reading is, of course, to renew both of these programmes, but also to improve them, with the help of the opportunities given to us by the Treaty of Amsterdam and by codecision."
"As far as the Langen report is concerned, and this is really what my intervention is about, as well as sources of renewable energy, everyone knows how important these energies are in reducing pollution and in preserving natural resources."
"We are also aware of the difficulties preventing these sources of energy from entering a free market in which more traditional energy resources are often much cheaper, not to mention the absence of measures designed to promote the taking up of new energies on a voluntarist basis."
"This is, of course, why I approve of the amendments tabled by Mr Langen which demand that the Commission plays a more active role in encouraging a strategy of coordinated promotion within the Member States as well as developing Europe' s potential for exporting technologies connected with renewable energy."
"It is true that this will entail additional costs."
"We must bear these costs because they are actually quite modest compared to what is at stake: around EUR 7 million."
"I also approve, of course, of the call for a charter on renewable energy."
"In conclusion, I shall say that the vote for these two reports represents a pledge to the citizens of Europe, showing the European Union' s will to protect the environment whilst reducing our dependence on energy."
"This is also a statement and a measure against the dictatorship of the market and of out-and-out liberalism."
"More specifically, on the threshold of the next world conference on climate change which is to be held in Bonn, this sends out a positive sign of our Kyoto commitment to reduce CO2 emissions."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Langen, the rapporteur, on his report on the adoption of the multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community, Altener II."
"A number of people have made critical comments about the nuclear programme in the Community."
"Fusion power is perhaps technically renewable energy, nevertheless this is not what we are talking about here."
"This is a report that originated with the Commission proposal in November 1997 which the last Parliament considered at first reading, in the Robles Piquer report, in February."
"Now with the Treaty of Amsterdam we have moved over to codecision and we are having a second reading here today."
"The major thrust of the report is the demand for the doubling of the amount of renewable energy to 12% by 2010."
"This is something we clearly support in the Socialist Group, but I am not entirely sure that commitment is accompanied either by the political resources - which is one of the reasons we are asking for the campaign to encourage and foster renewable energy - or, more importantly, by the financial resources."
"The amount that is being allocated is far too small in my view and does not add up in terms of achieving a doubling."
"We have EUR 80 million allocated: EUR 30 million for 1998-99 and EUR 50 million for 2000-2002."
"It seems to me, firstly, that the amount available is far too little and secondly, if we are expecting a doubling of the amount of renewable energy, there should be a sharp increase in the amount of money being made available over a period of time."
"In fact, even this may not be allocated given that Amendment No 5 to Article 1(3) (new), actually says that the amount of money might have to be reduced if it is inconsistent with the financial perspective for the period in question."
"I welcome Amendment No 6 to Article 2(e)(a) (new) about the need to encourage the export of renewable energy technologies from the European Union and to encourage the European Renewable Energies Export Council."
"In conclusion, a number of short points: renewable energies cannot be shoe-horned into the current thinking of energy suppliers, who are trained to see energy production as always being large scale and costing hundreds or thousands of millions of euros in terms of each project."
"Many will be small, community-based schemes which will be site-specific, whether using wind, waves, solar power, combined heat and power or even biomass."
"That means, if we are to encourage lots of small schemes, that we need even more money."
"Secondly, if we are serious about exports we should also pay some attention to renewable energy sources in which we in the European Union have a technological lead, which is not necessarily the case here."
"One of which I am aware of is ocean thermal energy conversion that uses the temperature difference between the cold bottom waters of the tropics and the warm surface waters."
"We have a lead in Europe but we are not encouraging that."
"If we want to export these technologies we need to make sure that the resources are available."
"Mr President, before coming to the point and discussing the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Decision on the application of the ALTENER programme in accordance with the codecision procedure, once the Treaty of Amsterdam is approved, I would like firstly to express my satisfaction, acknowledgement and gratitude for the support that the Commission has received at all times from the European Parliament specifically in the field of renewable energy."
"To this end, I would like to thank Mr Langen who is continuing the work of his predecessor, Mr Robles Piquer, a great promoter of these forms of renewable energy."
"Furthermore, to an extent, both Mr Langen and Mr Robles Piquer have demonstrated that this is not an ideological issue, that we must not mix up questions of liberalism or non-liberalism with what must be our ultimate common objective, which is to promote the use of renewable energy in Europe."
"This is an effort which corresponds to and obeys two key objectives of European energy policy."
"Firstly, an energy policy which respects the environment; an energy policy which takes into account the future of our planet. This must be a characteristic not only of our energy policy but also of any policy worthy of its name on this dawning of the 21st century."
"Secondly, we must examine something which is of great concern in Europe: our dependence on third countries with regard to the supply of energy."
"As soon as we are able to achieve our objective of doubling our sources of renewable energy supply from the current 6% to 12%, we will be less dependent on third countries, some of which may be facing a difficult future."
"I have to say, Mr President, that the first ALTENER programme and later the White Paper on Renewable Energy Sources, which has developed Community strategy and the action plan for 2010, have been possible thanks, and I repeat, to the cooperation between our two institutions, Parliament and the Commission, and that the new European Union renewable energy policy has been put together precisely as a result of a good understanding between us."
"With regard to the ALTENER programme, which is the second bearing this name, we are now confronted with its enlargement and incorporation into the multiannual framework programme for action in the field of energy."
"Please allow me, having congratulated Mr Langen on his magnificent work, to also express my gratitude to all the other speakers during the debate."
"With regard to Mr Langen and the proposed amendments, which have also been mentioned by some of the other speakers, it is my pleasure to announce that the Commission can accept practically all of them, although I will make some particular points with regard to the last three."
"Some will be accepted in their entirety."
"In the case of some others, I will request a different wording which will render them acceptable to the Commission."
"As for Amendment No 1, the Commission has always believed that renewable energy policy and energy efficiency policy are closely linked, as some speakers have pointed out, and that the coordination of these two policies is essential."
"Reference is made to a EURONEW charter, and we must ask ourselves whether it may be premature given that we have little perspective on the strategies and action plans which have already been approved."
"Perhaps we need a little more time."
"Amendment No 3, especially once the working document of the Commission services on the renewal campaign, which has been communicated to Parliament and the Council, has been adopted, is not only acceptable to the Commission but we embrace it with great satisfaction and gratitude."
"Amendment No 4 is acceptable in principle, although the Commission considers that it does not so much constitute a third objective of the programme but rather an expansion of the first objective."
"With respect to Amendment No 6, I would like to remind you of the favourable acceptance by the Commission of the Parliament' s report on the European Union' s new perspectives in the field of the export of technology and services for the use of renewable energy when it was presented in the plenary meeting on 15 January."
"However, it is a question of, rather than requiring a new action, considering whether point 25 does not already reflect this need to prioritise exports in order to improve the position of the European industry, which is world leader in certain renewable energy sources, which some speakers have referred to, because in this field we have clear advantages over other producers."
"This is perhaps where most progress has been made, in Europe and in this field, in recent years."
"Amendments Nos. 2 and 7, as well as Nos. 8 and 9, which have reached us in the course of today, have the support of the Commission in principle, although their wording will have to be revised and adapted to a form which is acceptable to the Commission."
"Amendment No 5 is in accordance with the initial proposal of the Commission."
"It is therefore totally acceptable."
"With regard to Amendment No 10, when it mentions associated Mediterranean countries and Cyprus, I would like to know exactly what we are talking about and therefore tomorrow, when the vote is taken, Mr Patten will raise this question."
"But alternatively, during our future discussions, we could talk about this issue so that we can specify who and what we are referring to, which would be the most appropriate way, from our point of view, to deal with the concern that this amendment clearly raises."
"Mr President, I would like once again to congratulate Mr Langen on his contribution to the continuation and consolidation of the ALTENER programme, since we must remember that this programme is our main instrument, although not from a financial point of view, in the carrying out of the European Union' s strategy on renewable energy."
"It is undoubtedly the main instrument of coordination, control and monitoring of that strategy."
"There is no doubt that a key question in all of this will be the Directive on access to the electricity network for renewable energy sources."
"This will clearly be the key instrument in order to see whether we are capable of promoting the use of this type of energy within our countries."
"As you all know, the sources of renewable energy, in the support systems - apart from hydroelectricity, which does achieve very competitive results when compared to other energy sources - cannot compete with traditional sources of energy."
"Not even in the case of biomass, which is one of the alternative sources which clearly has its place within the framework of the common agricultural policy."
"And it is clearly through the possibility of providing access to the network, through being flexible enough in the proposals that we put forward, which allow us to cover the different instruments which the different Member States have used and which are not homogenous and are different, that we will be able to guarantee that renewable energy is not only maintained but doubled in the coming years."
"I would like to express my thanks once again and say that I hope that the final revision will contain the definitive formula and therefore provide an impetus for the ALTENER programme, which will clearly promote the use of renewable energy in Europe."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m."
"SAVE multiannual programme (1998-2002)"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0015/99) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adoption of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency (SAVE) (1998-2002) (7123/1/99 - C5-0033/99 - 97/0371(COD))."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to welcome Commissioner de Palacio to this House today."
"I look forward to working cooperatively with her."
"I cannot, however, let the information that I have just received about the nuclear accident in South Korea go unrecognised."
"I was very shocked and saddened to hear of the deaths of 22 workers, apparently as the result of a heavy water accident."
"That underlines what we are trying to do here today and the need for changes in energy policy and in the budget for energy policy."
"SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy."
"SAVE II focuses on the non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and therefore does not pay for hardware investments."
"The purpose of the programme is rather to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted and where energy efficiency will be recognised as a market opportunity."
"We have heard about the difficulties of competition and renewable energy, but energy saving also saves money and, therefore, is a good investment all round."
"The SAVE programme was thoroughly and positively evaluated in 1994."
"I congratulate the Commission on the way it was run: credit where credit is due."
"This House gives kicks to the Commission when it sees programmes badly run."
"When a programme is well run and has been evaluated as such, we must also give it credit."
"The evaluation highlighted SAVE as a valuable policy instrument to promote energy efficiency but stressed that a clear and consistent strategy for pilot actions was required; that dissemination of results is the key to long-term success; and that long-term effectiveness requires better on-going monitoring and impact analysis."
"The evaluation also showed that SAVE actions will also indirectly lead to the achievement of the objectives of the non-nuclear energy R&D programme through the creation of a positive environment for the dissemination and implementation of new technology in renewable energies."
"The amendments proposed by this report are a direct result of this evaluation."
"Energy efficiency means lower consumption, the conservation of non-renewable energy sources and reduced dependence on energy imports, but most of all it means lower levels of environmental pollution from harmful substances such as CO2, one of the major causes of the greenhouse effect."
"The European Parliament has often underlined the importance of energy-efficient actions and the Council has also emphasised the need for energy savings and a reduction in CO2 emissions in a series of resolutions."
"However, these announcements have been followed up by very modest proposals."
"The energy savings targets will, in all likelihood, not be achieved by the means foreseen in the SAVE II programme."
"As the Community has so far not been able to agree on what is probably the most effective instrument for the reduction of greenhouse gases - namely, the taxation of energy consumption - the Commission and the Council regard the SAVE II programme as ""an important and necessary instrument"" ."
"Why then make cuts in an already low budget?"
"That is why I have restored the budget figures originally proposed by the Commission which were fully justified."
"Bearing in mind the expected increase in the energy CO2 emissions and the low budget allocated to SAVE II it is rather unlikely that the internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions could be achieved by this programme."
"However, under the energy framework programme SAVE II offers an opportunity to reverse a trend."
"Since at Member State level progress has stagnated, the responsibility for achieving energy efficiency targets and meeting reduction commitments now lies with the Community."
"The Finnish presidency has therefore announced an action plan for energy efficiency during the second half of 1999."
"It is very welcome and important."
"The Commission argues in favour of setting a Community energy efficiency target."
"Given the approximately 1% annual improvement in energy efficiency in final consumption achieved so far, the Commission calls for a target of reducing energy intensity in final demand by a further percentage point per year."
"Given our commitments, as already underlined, it is incomprehensible that the Commission could confine itself to such a target."
"A goal of a further one-and-a-half percentage points should be set in order to develop additional savings potential."
"As you know, Parliament agreed this at first reading."
"I should just like to add two technical points."
"We have, on legal advice, improved the comitology amendments."
"Therefore we have replaced Amendment No 5 by a new Amendment No 13, and Amendment No 11 by a new Amendment No 12."
"This was on legal advice to improve the original amendments."
"I hope that will be acceptable to everyone."
"Mr President, rapporteur, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, for the dynamism with which she has taken up the work of the previous rapporteur Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz on the multiannual programme to promote energy efficiency, SAVE II for the 1998-2002 period, and has prepared it for the second reading in this Chamber."
"In addition, I would like to thank the Commission for the preparatory work it has carried out."
"SAVE, the joint programme for energy efficiency and energy savings, is an important and necessary part of the European Community' s strategy to promote efficient energy consumption and also to reduce CO2 emissions."
"The SAVE programme is to be supplemented as a policy instrument by the specific programme covering issues relating to energy, the environment, and renewable energy technologies which forms part of the fifth framework programme for activities in the field of research, technological development and demonstration."
"A number of objectives relating to the emission of greenhouse gases were set in Rio de Janeiro and Berlin."
"In addition, the EU undertook to comply with a number of important statements on this subject in Kyoto."
"The time has now come to turn the fine words uttered in Kyoto into deeds."
"The EU is in a position to take on the mantle of pioneer and under no circumstances must Kyoto be allowed to degenerate into a pointless paper exercise."
"That is why I would like, on behalf of our group, to urge the new European Commissioner to produce more far-reaching proposals which will enable the Kyoto objectives to be realised."
"What we need is for Commissioner Bolkestein to finally get round to a decision on the eco-tax at a European level."
"Mr President, there is every chance that the EU will fail to meet the objectives relating to the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"The SAVE programme can provide a counterbalance to such developments."
"But then again, one should not expect much of this programme."
"What is more, the budget is very low, which is why our group warmly welcomes the rapporteur' s proposal to increase the SAVE programme' s budget by EUR 4.4 million to EUR 68.4 million."
"However, we must not set ourselves unrealistic objectives."
"It will be possible, between now and the year 2000, to bring about a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of between 180 and 200 million tons by further improving the energy intensity of the final demand by 5% as compared with normal expectations."
"The rapporteur proposes improving the energy intensity of final consumption by one and a half extra percentage points per year over and above the percentage that would otherwise be attained."
"Mr President, our group believes that this is an unrealistic aim."
"Indeed, it has become apparent that one extra percentage point per year will be quite difficult enough to achieve."
"That is why we intend to vote against the rapporteur' s proposal on that point and opt for one per cent."
"Should it become apparent, in the fullness of time, that it is possible to achieve more, then of course we will be the first to raise the target."
"But we must take care not to present households, energy companies and the like with objectives which, of course, sound marvellous in practice but which are just not realistic."
"That would be very demotivating for those who have to do what is necessary to meet these goals."
"My group feels that some of the proposals made by the rapporteur go into too much detail."
"The rapporteur has placed the main stress on legislation."
"We believe that only a framework should be created at European Union level."
"According to the principle of subsidiarity, a considerable proportion of the measures for increasing energy efficiency must be taken at national, regional and local level."
"That is why the PPE group will reject those amendments that prescribe an overly rigid framework."
"Instead of this, I feel that it would be a much better idea to draw up various incentives measures which will encourage governments and the business community to conclude voluntary agreements, for example."
"Experiences in my country have shown that in many cases more is achieved as a result of voluntary agreements than as a result of obligations imposed by legislation."
"It is better to make use of the resourcefulness of the parties involved than to impose obligations on them in this area by means of legislation."
"Mr President, to conclude I would like to touch on another important theme."
"I wish to emphasis anew the importance of the proposal to throw open the SAVE programme to associate countries in Central and Eastern Europe."
"A very great deal remains to be done in Central and Eastern Europe."
"The energy sectors in these countries are lagging far behind the EU Member States when it comes to energy efficiency."
"There is also still a huge amount to be organised in terms of legislation."
"But when it comes to saving energy, these countries stand to achieve so much more than EU countries by employing the same efforts, which is why the returns would be so much greater."
"I therefore hope that energy companies in EU Member States in particular, that have a great deal of experience of projects in the field of energy efficiency, can share their knowledge with these countries and, Commissioner, it is my special hope that these energy companies then have a real chance as far as projects are concerned and are not just shoved aside by American companies."
"May I congratulate Mrs Ahern on so enthusiastically taking up the work which Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz began."
"Energy efficiency is one of the few obvious contributions towards the attainment of the targets set for the EU in Kyoto."
"By saving energy, we produce fewer CO2 emissions and other pollutants."
"We also make our businesses more competitive."
"We can create thousands of much needed jobs and we can allow gas and electricity suppliers to make their money in a more sensible way by selling the services which energy gives us - warm homes, cool fridges and machines which work - rather than selling increasingly large amounts of gas and electricity."
"The main area in which work is needed is actually that of domestic householders."
"They use more energy than industry and they use it in a profligate way."
"That is why many of the measures in SAVE II are aimed at households - better design of houses, more economical household appliances and effective education programmes."
"Unlike Mr van Velzen, I support very strongly the rapporteur' s amendment raising the percentage of savings to 1.5% above what would happen anyway."
"We only have to look at the progress in some Member States, including the Netherlands, to see that this is a perfectly attainable percentage."
"I am convinced that the use of regional and local networks like Federene, Energie Cities and Islenet is one of the most effective ways in which to bring about change, and I hope they will be specifically encouraged in SAVE II as they were in SAVE I. It is important, of course, that we monitor SAVE II and that its achievements are quantified."
"Our committee will shortly be putting in place a mechanism to ensure that we monitor all spending programmes very closely."
"SAVE II could be an example of how funding can be used in other EU programmes such as structural funds and funding for third countries."
"The budget again is inadequate."
"This programme is not enough on its own either."
"I hope, Commissioner, that you will persevere with the philosophy behind the rational planning directive."
"I am pleased that you have done so so far, and we look forward to your next communications on energy efficiency."
"It is very good to start the work of this new Parliament with programmes which can make a difference, both to the environment and, of course, to the competitiveness needs of our Member States."
"Like ALTENER, SAVE II is one of those programmes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost, may I offer the rapporteur my warmest thanks for her outstanding work."
"The Liberal Group considers promoting energy efficiency to be a key factor in the European Union' s energy policy."
"However, if the Union wishes to pursue a credible energy policy, then the time will come when the Commission and Council will, at last, have to draw conclusions from the previous SAVE programmes."
"This is a necessary prerequisite for the third SAVE programme, which has a great deal to offer, being able to achieve the desired effect."
"The liberalisation of the energy markets is currently in full swing, resulting in considerable price reductions."
"According to the economic principles that normally apply, offering energy at lower prices is diametrically opposed to the call for consumption to be reduced."
"Energy-saving measures risk fading away against such a background."
"That is why it falls to us to adopt the SAVE programme so that the liberalisation of the energy markets can go hand in hand with increased energy efficiency within the European Union."
"It will only be possible to secure the effectiveness of the SAVE programme if adequate publicity is given to the initiative and there is substantial follow-up to the SAVE III programme projects and activities which are to be financed."
"This can best be achieved by setting concrete objectives."
"That is why the Liberals will give their full support to amendments 2 and 5 which aim to increase the energy efficiency of the final demand by 1.5 extra percentage points per year."
"If we want to achieve our goals, then we really do need to have the courage to set high standards."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the reference to renewable energy sources, on the other hand, appears to me to be inopportune."
"It can only cause confusion with the ALTENER programme."
"In any case, to my mind, the best thing to do as regards renewable energy sources would be to enter into a preparatory and searching debate about access to the electricity grid."
"I am convinced that governments have an important role to play when it comes to leading by example in matters relating to rational energy consumption."
"This position is in stark contrast to the observation that, equally, government buildings could be described for the most part as archetypal wasters of energy."
"Citizens that have cause to enter government buildings ought to be able to see that saving energy is a concern to which the government gives priority."
"It would thus be a good idea to designate a Mr or Mrs Energy whose specific task would be to strictly monitor energy consumption in government buildings."
"Let us lead by example ourselves in this respect and start by designating a Mr or Mrs Energy in the European Parliament in both Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Simple measures are usually far more effective than long-winded programmes."
"Mr President, a sensible energy policy should aim to change behaviour at every stage."
"So promoting energy efficiency should also be a natural part of any energy policy."
"If we take the Kyoto targets seriously - as we hopefully do - then we must also follow them up with the relevant tools and resources."
"In the programme we have before us, tools and funding are both inadequate and are not given a high enough priority."
"In view of the obligations we have assumed in regard to CO2 reduction, it is urgently necessary to establish ambitious efficiency targets."
"I therefore find it incomprehensible that the Commission wants to enhance levels of final energy by only 1 percentage point per year."
"As Mrs Ahern pointed out, the target ought to be at least 1.5%, and the budget ought also to be larger."
"Unlike the previous speaker, I do see the need for a reduction in CO2 emissions linked to programmes for renewable energy sources, such as the ALTENER programme."
"Linking of this kind means that nuclear power cannot merely be left, as some would wish, to replace existing power stations which pollute the atmosphere with CO2 emissions."
"It is often emphasised that nuclear power is one of the cleanest energy sources and does not discharge greenhouse gases."
"I totally disagree with this."
"Technical progress in recent years has markedly improved the efficiency of renewable energy sources and, instead of giving so many resources to the nuclear industry in Europe as the Community is notorious for doing, efforts to promote renewable energy sources should be strengthened."
"I am also completely in agreement with Mr Van Velzen in believing that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should be permitted to take part in this programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern for her work on highlighting the importance of promoting energy efficiency."
"Greater energy efficiency will mean less consumption in the medium-term, safeguarding renewable energy sources, less dependence on energy imports as well as less environmental pollution."
"I would like to make two points on the draft recommendation for second reading, keeping in mind that the SAVE programme is aimed mainly at strengthening research and the exchange of know how, as well as monitoring the results achieved in the sector (Article 2), despite the limited financial resources."
"My points are that firstly, as for today' s discussion on the proposal to set the improvement of energy intensity of final consumption at 1.5% a year - via an amendment to Recital 15 and to Article 1 - I think this goal is certainly ambitious but not very realistic. It is also harmful for the users who have successfully, and with notable efforts, reached the targets set out in the SAVE 1 programme (1991-1995)."
"As regards this, I would remind you that efficient energy use in the short-term costs firms as much as it does final consumers."
"So we need to carefully evaluate the objectives for improving energy intensity in final consumption."
"We might risk burdening our production apparatus with costs that will cause our firms to be less competitive with regard to other international competitors who are not bound by these obligations."
"Staying with the aim of making our production system competitive and efficient on a global scale, I will now move on to my second point."
"I would like to remind you that it is not always effective to promote efficient energy use using extremely restrictive, even intolerable legislative instruments and standards."
"Saving energy is a complex process, one which needs to develop gradually and is geared to gaining technological and economic knowledge for firms and users alike, but this will take some time."
"So, I welcome the awareness campaigns on subjects linked to saving energy, but I do not see how adopting excessively prescriptive legislation could be the most efficient way of improving the energy intensity of final demand."
"I refer here to Amendment 1 to Recital 11, to new Recital 15a and to Amendment 6 to Article 1."
"To conclude, in the light of these remarks, I would like to draw your attention to the need to carry out long-term cost/benefit analyses on the introduction of measures to reduce energy intensity of the final demand. These are very complex areas where the market and its regulations come into conflict with public welfare considerations."
"These analyses are possible in transparent markets where the individual end user - firm or consumer - can always assess to what point energy use is efficient thanks to gradual progress in the technological and economic spheres, sustained by sound research and as much information as possible."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament once again, and especially Mrs Ahern, for the work it has carried out and the repeated support for the Commission' s policy, specifically with regard to the improvement in the use of energy and the increase in energy efficiency which the SAVE programme is aimed at."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would also like to thank Mrs Ahern and Mrs McNally for having congratulated the Commission on the development of this type of action, which the officials of the Commission will also be grateful for."
"Once approved, this programme will become an important component of the multiannual framework programme for energy, providing a greater degree of transparency and better coordination of our programmes in the energy industry, allowing Parliament to fulfil its monitoring role in the interests of European citizens."
"With regard to the report of the Honourable Member and proposed amendments, Mrs Ahern, I would like to say that, in principle, the majority of them are acceptable."
"In the case of Amendment No 4, as we said earlier in relation to the ALTENER programme, there is a clear need for renewable energy and energy efficiency to go hand in hand."
"All of this constitutes one of the basic objectives of the multiannual framework agreement on energy, which is aimed specifically at improving complementarity and coordination in this field."
"As for Amendments Nos. 12 and 13, which replace Amendments Nos. 11 and 5, which the Honourable Members have referred to, and which refer to the involvement of Committees, I would like to say that they are acceptable in principle but require another more appropriate wording."
"I can say the same for Amendment No 10, which proposes an increase in the budgetary item which restores the Commission' s initial figures."
"With regard to amendments which the Commission cannot accept, I would like to say that, firstly, there is the one which refers to increasing the ambitions of this programme, that is, achieving a saving of 1.5%."
"In my view we should not be setting unreasonable figures but rather discussing achievable and ambitious objectives, because the objective is 1% per year, which will add up and eventually lead to considerable savings."
"For this reason we can accept neither Amendment No 2 nor Amendment No 6, insofar as this issue is concerned."
"With regard to the legal aspect, the SAVE programme is not a legislative programme."
"Legislative action and proposals may be brought into play, but it is not in itself a legislative programme."
"For this reason, we cannot accept Amendments Nos. 1 and 3, nor part of Amendment No 6."
"Honourable Members, the SAVE programme is intended to provide a framework of action in the field of energy efficiency."
"We believe that this formula has worked adequately in the past and that it would not be advisable, even with the best intentions, to add too many details or standards which will ultimately hinder the effective implementation of the programme."
"We therefore require a certain degree of flexibility and for this reason we cannot accept Amendments Nos. 8 and 9."
"Finally, and in the hope of finding a compromise, we can accept Amendment No 7, despite the fact that it presents a little difficulty, requiring some amendments of its wording."
"With regard to two questions which have arisen, firstly, I profoundly regret the nuclear accident in South Korea which has happened just days after the accident in Japan and which has affected a number of workers."
"Secondly, I would like to mention the Kyoto objective, to which energy efficiency is clearly of key importance."
"The Commission will briefly present - it is included in the agenda of the next Council of 2 December - the action plan on energy efficiency, and then we will have the opportunity to discuss these questions in more depth."
"With regard to a final matter which I had left out, which is the participation of some countries in Central and Eastern Europe, I would like to say that currently there are ten countries which are benefiting from the SAVE programmes in order to bring about an improvement in energy efficiency."
"When we compare data on energy efficiency we find differences of 1:5 and 1:6 in relation to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, I will end by congratulating Mrs Ahern once again, thanking all of you for your positive participation in this matter, and Parliament for the support it has lent the Commission in this field and, simply, by saying that we are talking about something very important which is the intelligent use of resources and energy."
"Mr President, I asked the Commissioner if, when writing up the project in this field, she would give particular attention to companies in Europe that have a great deal of experience in this field."
"It seems to me that she is now saying that she is keen to see the budget increased and has also rightly pointed out that the ratio is one to six and that it would be very much worth our while allowing European companies to play an important part in this."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner if she would respond to this."
"Mr President, in fact, in some cases we are providing external support for these countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"And not only is bilateral support from some countries being used - since bilateral cooperation with countries of Central and Eastern Europe is also taking place - but we should take into account the support which they receive via the SAVE programme and other Community programmes, by means of which companies are contracted - which are involved in such areas as support, instruction, education and the spread of good practice - and, clearly, amongst them there are companies from the European Union."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m."
"EC-South Africa trade, development and cooperation agreement"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation (A5-0020/1999) of Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council and Commission Decision concerning the conclusion of the trade, development and cooperation agreement between the European Community, on the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, on the other part (8731/1999 COM(1999) 245 - C5-0154/1999 - 1999/0112(AVC))."
"Mr President, last Saturday, I was privileged to be at the opening ceremony of the Rugby World Cup in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales where I come from and Wales actually won!"
"All around that rugby ground there are adverts for South African fruit companies and for South African airlines."
"We were entertained by singers from South Africa and I thought then how far we have come from those dark days of Apartheid when so many of us, including myself and perhaps one or two of the Commissioners, called for sanctions and boycotts against Apartheid in South Africa."
"Now, the institutional racism and legalised bigotry and prejudice has been swept away and recognition of that momentous achievement now determines the European Union' s relationship with South Africa."
"But, I think we all have to acknowledge, Mr President, that we have had five years of protracted and tortuous negotiations on everything from apples, pears and asparagus to cut flowers, fish, wine, port and sherry, but eventually now we see an agreement and hopefully, a signing on Monday in South Africa."
"I would like confirmation from the Commission that will in fact be the case."
"The European Parliament and Joint Assembly have played a positive role and have offered encouragement and critical analysis and it is very appropriate that this Parliament is the first parliament to give assent to the agreement."
"Some Members States of the Union soon forgot the commitments made to Nelson Mandela in Berlin in 1994."
"It was difficult at times to understand why the response by some Member States was lacking in generosity and understanding."
"South Africa' s GDP is half that of Belgium and only 0.6% of the world GDP."
"And yet the negotiations repeatedly stalled because Member States of the European Union allowed sectoral interest to override any need to support South Africa."
"At the time of the United Kingdom' s Presidency, Philip Stevens, who writes a column in the Financial Times, observed that the European side has been consistently devious, destructive and above all, shamefully protectionist."
"From the outset, it has sought to hold South Africa hostage to its own subsidised farmers."
"Let me now summarise the essentials:"
"The asymmetric nature of the trade agreement is crucial and involves the systematic elimination or reduction of tariff barriers and other duties."
"Europe will open up its markets to 95% of South Africa' s exports over ten years."
"South Africa will open its markets to 86% of European Union exports over twelve years."
"This agreement is unique in that it includes the agricultural sector which, of course, is of immense importance to the South African economy."
"It also acknowledges the potential damage which subsidised agricultural products can do to South African markets, and actually allows South Africa to impose a special safeguard clause in the event of any threats to their own domestic agricultural industry."
"However, I see running through the agreements the protectionism which unfortunately still characterises the common agricultural policy of the Union."
"It is also my view that this agreement should not be seen as a model, particularly for ACP countries currently involved in the new post-Lomé Agreements, and I would like confirmation that is not the Commission position."
"But there are clear lessons to be learnt about the sheer complexities involved in such a project, especially when the mighty EU is your counterpart in very difficult and contentious discussions."
"This Agreement now needs to be translated into practical benefits."
"Finally, let me turn to the regional implications."
"This, I feel, will be the aspect of the agreements which will cause most concern."
"There will be a reduction, naturally, of customs revenues which Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland have become dependent on."
"These duties are sometimes as high as 90% in the case of Lesotho and this, of course, will affect these countries' ability to spend on essential health and education and other social needs."
"There will be adjustment costs."
"It is still very unclear, Commissioner, how these costs will be met and certainly the Conference in Lesotho which the Commission has promised seems to be somewhat unclear also."
"I have had representation from the BLNS countries asking exactly what the position is on that Conference."
"My own interest in South Africa dates back thirty years."
"It continues because the issues at stake are no less important now than they ever were."
"President Mbeki knows that the patience of the people of South Africa is not infinite and he also knows that black impoverished South Africa is desperate to see change."
"When President Mbeki was inaugurated, he said 'our nights cannot be nights of nightmares while millions of people live in degrading poverty."
"No night can be restful when millions have no jobs and are forced to beg and rob to ensure that they and their own do not perish from hunger."
"Our country, South Africa, is beginning a long journey' ."
"This Parliament should give its assent to this agreement in order that the European Union can play its part in that momentous journey."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech in the plenary sitting of this venerable House."
"I am therefore particularly pleased to be able to speak on the subject of South Africa, a country whose development I have followed, since my first visit there in 1981, with concern and with hope and, recently, with confidence."
"Finally, we can establish economically and politically privileged relations with the country in Africa whose stable development is both in our very own interests as well as in the interests of its neighbours south of the equator."
"The forthcoming agreement should be useful to both."
"In nurturing a special relationship with South Africa, we are supporting the economic development there and, at the same time, reinforcing the potential of the country to act as a positive influence on the whole region."
"Politically, we are thereby also paying tribute to the results of a reform process which, unfortunately, has not always proceeded peacefully over the years."
"Many people will remember both the images of the brutality of the police and army and at the same time the rioting by the blacks."
"The first high point in this process of democratisation were the first democratic elections for all South Africans in 1994, the visible expression of emancipation not only for the previously suppressed majority of the population but also, I believe, really for the classes privileged under the old system; a liberation from the self-imposed pressure to justify a system which they themselves knew, at least in their innermost selves, could not be justified and which also isolated them increasingly from people in Europe and North America whom they felt culturally and ethnically akin to."
"This moral and political isolation, economic sanctions and the ever increasing material expense of maintaining the old order led in the end to economic stagnation and political recognition that things could not continue this way."
"I am, however, also convinced that it was an event in Europe which was the final impetus for the De Klerk Government, which took office at the end of 1989, to summon up the courage to implement fundamental change in the system and thereby to abolish itself: the fall of the Berlin Wall as the last visible expression of the end of a system, in whose name even in South Africa freedom and democracy had not exactly been defended, took away from white South Africans the subjective impression that, if there were to be democratic elections in South Africa on the principle of ""one man, one vote, once a vote"" , they would find themselves in a one-party system and, once their property had been expropriated, in an economy under State control."
"A substantial argument, or bogus argument, for the repression of the liberation movement had disappeared."
"In the meantime, the South African Minister for Trade and Commerce - though a member of the Communist Party - was pursuing a free market policy."
"We wish to support this policy of liberalisation of trade and restructuring of the economy including by means of this agreement."
"In addition, an essential constituent part of the Agreement is also the defence by the parties to the contract of the observance of democratic principles, human rights, rule of law and responsible government."
"In order to promote this, the European Parliament must also utilise all its powers within the scope of the agreed structured political dialogue and thus offer South Africa as much support as possible in its efforts at achieving stability."
"In recent years, the Group of the European People' s Party has continually supported the cause of strong cooperation with the Republic of South Africa."
"I therefore expressly welcome, on behalf of my group, this agreement between the European Union and South Africa and at the same time congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kinnock, on her excellent report, which we support."
"In the five years of on-going negotiations, the European Parliament and particularly my own group have called for the speedy conclusion of this agreement and its direct entry into force."
"Even in the South African Parliament, by the way, there is general unanimous approval of the agreement."
"So, as the agreement now stands, in my opinion a fair balance of interests has been achieved on the whole."
"On the one hand, negotiations with a total of 24 rounds are surely not entirely necessary and have been dragged on and on due to sectoral or national interests."
"The rapporteur pointed this out."
"On the other hand, however, this has enabled rapprochement and mutual understanding on both sides in precisely such difficult matters as the agreement on wines and spirits or some agricultural products."
"The asymmetrical trade agreement envisages, among other things, the 95% opening up of European markets to South African exports within ten years."
"I would particularly like to stress, in this regard, that with this free trade agreement the European Union has included the agricultural sector in an agreement for the first time."
"Within the realm of possibilities, i.e. in line with the rationale of the present subsidy regime, a considerable amount has been achieved."
"In the area of spirits, it was surely emotionally very difficult for the South Africans to cope with the fact that, in 12 years' time, they would no longer be entitled to call their own sherry ""sherry"" or their own port ""port"" , even in their own country."
"In August, I attempted to console my opposite number in South Africa by pointing out that although we Germans are not permitted to call German sect ""champagne"" , it still sells well abroad under the name ""sect"" , just because it is good!"
"There is one drop of bitterness for me in the fact that the Council could not bring itself to adopt the agreement as a Community agreement."
"Its present form as a joint agreement means that it will not come into force until all Member States have ratified it."
"Even if many trade-related agreements are already applicable provisionally from the start of 2000, I hope that the ratification process will not be too lengthy."
"As the European Parliament, with our quick adoption of this we are giving a sign for immediate action."
"This should serve as an example to the national parliaments and should also show our sympathy for the new South Africa, which deserves all our support on its difficult course."
"Mr President, I would like to express my agreement with the comments of the rapporteur, Mrs Kinnock."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Kinnock and the negotiators who have brought this agreement into being."
"I would also like to congratulate everybody because finally we have secured, after an enormously long process, the agreement instrument which the European Union is going to sign with South Africa and which must give renewed and definitive impetus to relations between the two parties."
"I have said that the journey has been a long one."
"At times, it has seemed interminable."
"There have certainly been some complex issues, some of which, like the issue of port and sherry, continue to raise difficulties which we hope will be resolved in the coming days."
"But it is also true that there have been times when we have seen behaviour on the part of the European negotiators as well as certain Member States which has been excessively bureaucratic, defensive and at times nit-picking. We have also been concerned to see at times, on the part of our South African counterparts, a tendency to backtrack and to revive questions which we thought had been resolved, all of this causing the process to be delayed more and more."
"Mr President, with the necessary will on both sides to positively resolve any remaining loose ends or interpretations, we are arriving at the point of the parliamentary procedure for approving a rigorous text which is full of hopes and expectations."
"This is an agreement which has taken into account diverse interests, interests which are often difficult to reconcile and which, nevertheless, seem to be providing acceptable responses for all sides."
"It is an agreement which, while safeguarding and providing opportunities for European interests, must above all contribute to the economic stability and progress of South Africa as well as its political and democratic consolidation."
"Mr President, with the signing of this agreement and the support which it lends to the South African process, the European Union is acting coherently."
"It is acting coherently with regard to its duty to defend the interests of its Member States, coherently with regard to the principles of social equality and progress which we claim as our own, coherently with regard to the type of world which we wish to build together, with more balance and more solidarity, but also coherently with regard to the actions which many of us and many of our co-Europeans, for four decades, have maintained in the effort to put an end to apartheid while dreaming of the establishment of a South Africa with a regime which provides liberty and dignity for all South Africans."
"It would have been unforgivable if, when South Africa has dismantled that odious regime, when the South Africans have made history and shown an example by bringing about an admirable reconciliation, successfully overcoming the always difficult transition from a civil war and a dictatorship, the transition from having the profile of a freedom movement to the establishment of a pluralist, democratic and constitutional State, it would have been scandalous if, when the South Africans have not betrayed our trust in their conduct, we Europeans were not able to rise to the occasion and were to betray the trust which South Africa has put in us."
"Mr President, perhaps the thing that most pleases me about this agreement is the fact we have moved from rhetoric to reality and the European Parliament, which has supported and closely monitored the negotiation process, providing impetus and acting as a stimulus, should today commit itself to applying the same energy to the monitoring of its implementation and its results."
"Mr President, Europe was as lavish with its fine words when apartheid was abolished as it proved to be miserly when it came to economic concessions."
"This small-minded mentality did not hold sway in the Commission but it did in the short-sighted European governments that allowed their national profit interests to carry more weight than the welfare of the South African people."
"It has emerged from a recent report by UNCTAD that South Africa' s imports from the European Union are likely to increase more dramatically than exports to this market."
"In so far as this is the case, the agreement is certainly going to have to be adjusted."
"We are going to have to keep a very close eye on the actual implementation of the agreement."
"We must not allow the SADC countries to be disadvantaged by South Africa' s relations with Europe."
"The same applies here: a good neighbour is worth more than a distant friend."
"Indeed, South Africa must give impetus to the development of the whole region."
"Its aggressive expansion in neighbouring countries is doing nothing to further this aim."
"The balance of trade with neighbouring countries is completely unstable."
"South Africa exports seven times more than it imports."
"Just as the European Union has granted Pretoria preferential tariffs, so Pretoria could do the same with its neighbours."
"After all, economic development is essential if there is to be political stability and peace throughout the region."
"Notwithstanding our criticism of the European Union' s position, we attach a great deal of importance to the fundamental objective of the agreement, that is the economic development of South Africa and integration into international trade."
"That is why we support Mrs Kinnock' s recommendation."
"Mr President, as the saying goes: better some of a pudding than none of a pie."
"Mr President, I am pleased to support this initiative on behalf of the European Free Alliance/Green Group in Parliament."
"We thank Mrs Kinnock for her efforts."
"Inter-state and, more recently, inter-regional alliances both within the European Union and with partners outside is an initiative we can pride ourselves on developing enthusiastically."
"Funding schemes such as INTERREG, PHARE and others are a clear expression of this ideology."
"This initiative of itself cannot be expected to resolve overnight, as it were, the problems of economic deprivation in the new South Africa."
"It has to address massive domestic problems including social integration, chronically poor housing for the majority of the population, massive unemployment and an economy that produces only 0.46% of world GDP."
"The concern of most South Africans is that our initiatives take so long before coming to fruition."
"We must ensure that all support schemes can be expedited far quicker than at present."
"An agreement that provides for the full liberalisation of 95% of South African exports to the EU over a ten-year period with tariffs eliminated on 86% of its industrial goods is a very long time to wait for a country facing such acute economic and social problems."
"Tariff restrictions are fine, but should be viewed in the context of the restrictions on third world countries exporting to the developed world being four times as stringent as the tariffs we face when we export to them."
"Inter-regional relationships must also be fostered with South Africa, a country of regions."
"The role that the regions and historical nations of the EU can have in building economic and cultural links with the diverse regions of Africa is vital and should be an essential prerequisite to its future prospects, as will the elimination of its debt."
"The decision of the World Economic Summit in Cologne this year to cancel $100 billion of third world debt was important in this regard and should be a catalyst for further action by all EU countries, not just the few."
"Financial partnership is not the panacea that will cure the problems of South Africa as a whole."
"A whole raft of issues that are crucial to the task of ensuring that South Africa is in a position to maximise the opportunities afforded by this agreement now need to be explored in a holistic way."
"The EU should be looking to develop strategies and training programmes to ensure that the regeneration of the South African economy is sustainable in the long term both economically and environmentally."
"I welcome this initiative."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Kinnock for her report."
"The agreement between the European Union and South Africa, which we are debating today, is of great importance."
"I am all the more favourable towards it because the Council stalled the negotiations at the beginning of the year, which sent out a very bad sign to the South African people."
"In February 1999, our House expressed its failure to understand this rejection, even if the interests of certain European agricultural producers had to be taken into account."
"This could have been done though, without threatening the discussions in their entirety."
"Parliament' s urgent appeal was obviously heard, because the Council finally approved the agreement."
"I am also pleased that at the insistence of the South Africans, the agreement was extended to cover development cooperation, too."
"What we have to do now is to follow very closely the way the agreement is applied to ensure that its most positive aspects contribute to the development of the new South Africa."
"Although it is a ""rich country"" in one of the poorest continents, relations within society there are still very unevenly balanced, to the extent that the UNDP ranks this country 93rd in its human development index."
"52% of annual income goes to only 10% of the population, and unemployment rose from 30% in 1994 to 37% in 1997."
"These disparities reflect the racial divisions which still exist."
"To sum up the situation, and this is what South Africans themselves say, ""Apartheid has been defeated in political terms, but it is still very much present in the daily life of millions of people, in economic and social terms."""
"There is a noticeable, justifiable impatience, particularly among the black population."
"Having showed our solidarity with the movement for freedom from the harsh apartheid regime, we must now support the unprecedented efforts which have led to the RDP."
"Substantial advances have already been made in providing schooling for children, local medical services, access to drinking water and to electricity. Nevertheless, a great deal still remains to be done."
"This agreement means all the more to me because, after years of going on demonstrations for the release of Nelson Mandela, I had the privilege of going to South Africa on the day after he was elected President."
"Finally, we must listen to those expressing their concern about the consequences of free trade."
"South Africa' s preference was from the outset for an agreement close to the measures of the Lomé Convention, and Unctad predicts an unequal impact on the bilateral movements of trade to the detriment of South African products."
"Also, concerns and fears at a regional level in the countries within the Southern African Customs Union have not been given sufficient consideration."
"Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland will be losing a major source of revenue as the entry into force of the agreement will lead to a dramatic fall in the level of the sums currently raised by customs duties in their Union."
"In addition to this, the appearance on their market of produce subsidised by the CAP will represent a real threat to their agriculture."
"The agreement that we are discussing is of strategic importance for both parties. It is also of strategic importance for the peace, stability and development of Southern Africa."
"As well as giving my approval, I would like to finish by putting forward a proposal. Perhaps we could hold hearings in Parliament for the ambassadors of Southern African countries in order to involve them directly in these new relations between the European Union and this part of the world, which is so crucial to the future of the whole African continent."
"Mr President, as a representative of an agricultural country, France, and more importantly of a country which has linked its name and its policies with a particular concept of cooperation with Africa, we cannot go in the direction Mrs Kinnock is leading us, and as a result, we cannot approve the so-called trade and cooperation agreement with the Republic of South Africa, both because of its form and its content."
"The problems of content are quite obvious."
"The first problem concerns the nature of the settlement on the registered designation of origin."
"To grant financial compensation to a country in order for it to stop its improper use of protected names - such as sherry, to give an individual case - sets an extremely dangerous precedent."
"It is obvious, moreover, that if this agreement were ratified by national governments, whose main role, I just mention in passing, has been proven once more, any non-EU country could decide to use a European official designation of origin in order then to negotiate a financial settlement."
"This is absurd."
"The second problem with the content strikes us as being even more serious."
"It concerns the very philosophy, or rather the ideology, implicit in this agreement."
"To claim that the liberalisation of trade is a priori favourable to development certainly adheres to the creed of globalisation which is holding sway everywhere, but reality continually shows these allegations to be false."
"Firstly, it is obvious that poor countries are being dragged further and further down as their borders are increasingly opened up and their essential services increasingly privatised."
"Moreover, the countries which are already dominant today have guaranteed their own expansion within the framework of a planned protectionist system, and it is this protectionism that I hope and pray for."
"The agreement corresponds to an ideology whose sole aim is to mask the pernicious policy of a commercial superpower, the United States, and in this area as in many others, Europe has gone astray as a result of clinging to the Americans' heels."
"As to the form of the agreement, I shall just mention it briefly."
"It gives an additional illustration of the connivance between the Commission and Parliament aimed at divesting the European Council of something that I believe to be its exclusive competence, which is foreign policy."
"For all of these reasons, we cannot give our approval to this agreement."
"Mr President, whilst we recognise the valuable aspects of the agreement as regards trade, development and cooperation between the European Community and the Republic of South Africa, it has raised some critical questions in our minds, as it has in that of Mrs Kinnock, relating to suggestions to be addressed to the Commission and the Council."
"Firstly, trade relations between the European Union and South Africa are characterised by a pronounced dependency."
"The latter depends to a very large extent on the former both in terms of its imports (33%) and its exports (40%)."
"This is certainly not the case the other way around."
"So why then are we not allowing South African products full access to the European market?"
"In this way, the good intentions the Member States had towards South Africa as a developing country in 1994 are evaporating."
"Secondly, an assessment of the Lomé Agreement in 1996 demonstrated that asymmetrical liberalisation of trade is not exclusively to the advantage of developing countries."
"This is because such asymmetry stops them learning how to compete against world prices."
"To what extent does this drawback apply to South African products too?"
"Thirdly, we strongly recommend that the agreement between the European Union and South Africa should not be to the detriment of Pretoria' s excellent regional trade relations."
"If good rules of origin are applied, then South Africa' s partners in the SADC and SACU ought to be able to benefit from the trade agreement too."
"Following on from Mrs Kinnock' s sharp observation that the European Union has ""sought to hold South Africa hostage to its own subsidised farmers"" , my fourth point is that failing to include the wines and spirits sectors in the agreement was a downright omission."
"What will the damage to the European market actually be as a result?"
"On a final note: EU development policy towards South Africa will yield little fruit while Europe is not prepared to make sacrifices to this end."
"In the recent past, work in the field of development cooperation has been placing increasing emphasis on development by integration into the world market, and rightly so in our view."
"However, this trade agreement contains certain elements that will impede South Africa' s integration into the world market."
"All in all, European self-interest appears once again to rule the day."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report that begins by saying that after five years of discussion, hesitation, prevarication, consultation and negotiation, at last, we have a trade agreement between the European Union and South Africa."
"The Dutch would express this more succinctly, Mrs Kinnock, by saying that after five years of moaning, whining and whinging, the die is finally cast."
"The Dutch nationals in our midst will know very well what I mean by this."
"Incidentally, and I agree with Mr Van den Bos on this, the Member States were the major culprits as regards all the moaning, whining and whinging."
"It was not the Commission and it certainly was not Parliament."
"Mr President, whatever the words are that we use to express it in our national languages, the negotiations for this trade agreement were dragged out over a long period of time in an unprecedented manner, which was, as many resolutions in this House have expressed, a poor performance, particularly in view of the courageous transition to free and democratic government carried through by South Africa; a marvellous achievement in an age when there is so much violence in the world."
"That is why South Africa is an example to us all."
"The EU is South Africa' s foremost trading partner, absorbing 33% of its exports and accounting for 40% of its imports."
"That is why this agreement is so important for us, but, more importantly, for South Africa."
"It is a modern agreement which is adapted to the times and is all about the liberalisation of tariffs, the setting up of a free trade area, agreements on economic and development cooperation and agreements on science and technology and on a political dialogue."
"To sum up, it is an agreement that is sure to enable both sides to make progress for a few years."
"It could have been better of course but I think we would be well advised to just be satisfied with it for the time being."
"An asymmetrical trade agreement also has a lot to offer in that Europe is to open its markets to 95% of South African exports and South Africa, in its turn, is to open its markets to 86% of European exports. This will involve 75% of South African agricultural products."
"Indeed, most trading products will soon, or at least in three years' time, be allowed in, subject to as few restrictions as possible."
"Of course, the fact that port and sherry have caused such delay and that, what is more, transitional regimes of 5 to 12 years have been created for this, does not inspire much confidence."
"But neither does this matter a great deal."
"I agree with Mr Gahler and I can tell him that we drink more ""sect"" than champagne in the Netherlands."
"So in the long run, quality, along with price is at least as important as the name."
"Mr President, I have said enough on the detail of this agreement."
"The political aspects of the agreements are, of course, just as important."
"As far as that is concerned, we sincerely hope that this agreement will give a positive boost to the economic development and political stabilisation of South Africa."
"There is still a great deal of cause for concern there, though, for the pace of economic development in South Africa is slackening, as a result of which the fight against poverty, which is to reduce the deprivation suffered by the black and coloured populations owing to years of apartheid, is not making nearly enough progress."
"Poverty is still there for all to see in South Africa and this is leading to a section of the younger generation becoming frustrated and also turning to crime."
"This does not just have a serious impact on the groups concerned for it also, I am sorry to say, holds back a certain amount of investment, which causes economic development to slacken off further still."
"It is important that this trade agreement has, at last, got off the ground now because it will make it possible for the European business community to know what stage it is at in South Africa and the same applies to the South African business community."
"In any event, the Netherlands is soon to send a trade delegation to South Africa and I hope that the other Member States will follow suit."
"South Africa needs new impetus to promote economic growth and drive out poverty at a more rapid pace."
"This would benefit political stability and is what is most needed."
"Mr President, South Africa will enter a new era when the forthcoming elections are over."
"It will be an era in which signs of hope and progress must be translated into economic and social stability and into justice."
"This trade agreement has a positive role to fulfil here."
"My group endorses it and I sincerely hope that positive consequences will indeed flow from it."
"Mr President, with Nelson Mandela' s farewell as President and the election of Thabo Mbeki, South Africa entered a new political era."
"As one young South African who had grown up in Denmark expressed it, ""it is good for South Africa now that Mandela is retiring."""
"It is not good for a democracy to have a god as President, and Mandela was and remains a deity."
"But you do not rebel against gods, not in any case when they have just opened the way to freedom."
"By this, I do not mean that Thabo Mbeki does not have god-like characteristics. What I mean is that the patience shown by the poor towards Nelson Mandela will not be shown towards Thabo Mbeki."
"They are making demands here and now for food, housing, education, that is to say, all the things which we in the western world take for granted."
"For the time being, they remain only criminals. Subsequently, they will rise in rebellion."
"This puts Thabo Mbeki in a quite different situation from his predecessor, but it also puts us in the EU in a quite different situation."
"We should remember this fact and we should also remember the Balkans and what Kofi Annan said in his speech to the UN at the opening of the General Assembly this year: that it is incredible how much we sacrifice to go to war and how little we sacrifice to prevent war."
"That is why it is good that we have obtained the present agreement between South Africa and the EU."
"It is certainly not as good as it ought to be."
"It is not nearly generous enough, and I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kinnock, for pointing this out. Nonetheless, it is there and it binds the EU and South Africa together."
"Hopefully, it will mean that, in South Africa too, it is felt that it is no longer so very far from the EU to South Africa, either physically or psychologically, and that the gap between words and action is no longer so lengthy as, without a shadow of a doubt, it was felt to be in the period after 1994 and up until 1999."
"Mr President, the first thing I want to say is how much I welcome what I hope will be the successful conclusion of this landmark agreement, and I congratulate the rapporteur for her tireless work to get the best possible outcome."
"This agreement is one of the first free-trade agreements with a developing country and so it sets a number of important precedents."
"One of the most significant of these is the fact that it has broadened from a focus on trade alone to a wider emphasis on development cooperation."
"I welcome that, but there are also other precedents it might set which could be less positive, in particular its impact on other countries in the region."
"One key area of concern for these Southern African Customs Union (SACU) countries is the loss of customs revenue, as Mrs Kinnock has said."
"At the moment these countries rely heavily on customs duties which are collected from European imports and shared out between the customs union members."
"We are talking about significant amounts of money here."
"Swaziland, for example, depends on these for up to 40% of all government revenues."
"But, with the free trade agreement in place, products arriving from the EU into South Africa duty-free will also enter the other customs union countries duty-free - there are no tariff barriers between them."
"So there is a very real concern among SACU countries that these products will undercut local goods in their own markets."
"While that might make products cheaper for southern African consumers, the effects on local industries could be extremely severe."
"There is consequently very real concern that the pace and extent of the elimination of tariffs on imports from the EU will exceed the ability of industries in the region to improve their efficiency."
"This points to the importance of getting the timing and the phasing of free-trade arrangements right, in order to avoid negative repercussions on other countries in the region."
"Although South Africa' s neighbours have been promised compensation for the cost to them of adjustments in South Africa, it is far from clear how this will work in practice."
"The European Parliament will, I am sure, continue to monitor this situation to assess what effects are being felt by other countries, and to do all in its power to ensure that appropriate compensation is forthcoming as necessary."
"The agreement also has wider implications for the post-Lomé negotiations, where the Commission and Council are strongly in favour of regional free-trade arrangements to replace Lomé-style preferences."
"I welcome Mrs Kinnock' s recommendation that we do not see this agreement as a model for ACP countries."
"To conclude, while I welcome the fact that South Africa has won a share of significant European markets, I hope we can also learn from the lessons of this agreement and ensure that in future the timing, phasing and scope of free-trade arrangements will reflect more closely the different needs of the participating countries."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperating with South Africa and helping it to put its under-development behind it should be a fundamental duty for Europe, whose ruling classes greatly benefited in the past from the pillage of that country' s mineral wealth and from the exploitation of its poverty-stricken masses."
"I will certainly not join the European institutions in their displays of self-satisfaction as they have even had the effrontery to claim that they contributed significantly to the defeat of the apartheid regime in South Africa, whilst in fact, the great powers, including European ones, were overwhelmingly responsible for keeping a notorious regime in power for such a long time."
"It was the struggle of the black masses which put an end to institutionalised segregation, but unfortunately, they have not been able to end the social segregation which causes that country' s workers and the unemployed to continue living in poverty."
"The only thing that the European institutions are offering South Africa in terms of cooperation is a trade agreement, carefully negotiated so that it favours European business and industrial interests, an agreement which, in South Africa, will only profit the tiny minority of exporters of precious stones and agricultural produce, who were already the main beneficiaries of apartheid."
"Moreover, the signatories to the agreement make no secret of this and say that, I quote, ""The measures on cooperation aim to facilitate the re-structuring and modernisation of South African industry and to stimulate its competitiveness."""
"Well, workers of any country will have understood that this means redundancies and greater unemployment!"
"Our solidarity goes out then to South Africa' s workers, to its underprivileged people and not to those, whether over there or in Europe, who enrich themselves as a result of these people' s poverty."
"Mr President, the agreement reached with South Africa undoubtedly constitutes an overall step forward on a political level for the European Union."
"In this sense, we should feel particularly satisfied. But we do not think the same can be said on a trade level."
"This agreement is somewhat bewildering, leaves questions unanswered, and still has grey areas."
"Many organisations have been unhappy during these five long, tiring years, organisations which are usually involved in the processes of development in Third World countries."
"Moreover, different interpretations and opinions have been expressed by Parliament which wanted an agreement with conditions closer to those of the Lomé Convention, and the Commission itself wanted, how shall we say, an agreement with more conditions attached."
"In our opinion, this is an inconsistent agreement."
"What we really needed were separate agreements where we could work with equal dignity and equal responsibilities."
"However, where this balance could not be achieved, we should have had calmer and certainly more analytical talks."
"The European Union, for example, has recognised safeguard clauses for agriculture in South Africa, and also for sectors competing with the European economy."
"75% of South African agricultural products will benefit from facilitated access on to our markets and, in return, South Africa has taken - we think we can say this in good faith - rigid positions of outright refusal and which are, in certain aspects, incomprehensible."
"I am referring in particular to fish and wine."
"European countries have asked for access to South African waters to be regulated, despite the price concessions on South African exports of fish products, against the wishes of that country."
"South Africa uses European designations for its own products in our markets and in third countries' markets in return for financial help for our sector."
"All this seems excessive and irrational."
"So we, the delegation of Alleanza Nazionale, believe we must vote against. We repeat, though, that in the future we are very willing to support the long and difficult process of growth and development in South Africa in a way that does not create injustice or unfairness."
"Commissioner, it seems that there are still major difficulties in the wine and spirits sector which are preventing the smooth conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and South Africa."
"It is essential that we know if South Africa has taken the necessary measures to ensure that certain basic designations such as Port and Sherry are not used in their imports to the European Community and that in five years time, they will not be used for any export markets."
"Moreover, we do not imagine, Commissioner, that you foresee increasing the current level of imports of South African wine into the European Union - I shall remind you that it currently stands at 320,000 hectolitres - without preserving minimum customs rights, if the whole European industry is not to risk being seriously damaged."
"In order to resolve this problem, I believe that it would only need an amendment to Annex 10 of the protocol to the agreement, and I would like you to be able to give us some fundamental points of reassurance on this matter."
"According to other information though, it would seem that we are obliged to amend this Annex if it were not validated on 30 September."
"I would therefore like to know the Commission' s position on whether this Annex 10 is valid now, six days after the initial deadline, or whether the Commission has proposed an amendment."
"Commissioner, we have the feeling that Pretoria has a quite different understanding of this agreement to that of your services and particularly of its Annex 10."
"We ask you, in any case, not to envisage a conclusion of an overall agreement unless there is already an equitable ""wines"" agreement which is not destructive for either party."
"Mr President, like most of my colleagues here, I too welcome the fact that this agreement has come about."
"Without further ado, we have an important agreement which will make it easier for South Africa to become further involved in the global economy, which will increase political stability throughout the region and which, come what may, will provide a strong boost to our bilateral relations."
"The trade agreement differs from traditional agreements because it takes South African specificity into account."
"That is why the agricultural sector has not been left out and great emphasis is placed on development cooperation, as indeed it should be."
"This agreement creates important momentum."
"But we must not allow it all to end here."
"We must not lose sight of the need for a follow-up."
"Furthermore, building on the dynamic that has come about, further agreements must be concluded in a number of sectors, in the fisheries sector for example."
"Therefore, whilst I share everyone' s enthusiasm for the agreement that has been reached, I am much less enthusiastic about the manner in which it has come about."
"I have lived and worked in South Africa for the past two years."
"I have had to watch Europe being severely taken to task in the South African press on account of corporate and protectionist reflexes which were in stark contrast to the fine declarations of intent about solidarity with the rainbow nation."
"When the Council rejected an agreement concluded by Commissioner De Pinheiro, the question was even openly asked in South Africa if there was still any point at all to concluding such an agreement."
"For a long time still to come, Europe will be identified with port and sherry in the minds of South Africans."
"In that respect, the run-up to the agreement was a lost opportunity; a lost opportunity to rid ourselves of the fortress Europe image."
"The report focuses a great deal on the regional consequences of this agreement, and rightly so."
"The rapporteur has pointed out that some SACU countries will see a sharp decline in the income from customs levies which is so important to them."
"The agreement has tried to anticipate this, due primarily to the pressure brought to bear by Parliament, but we need to remain vigilant."
"This agreement must invite South Africa to promote regional cooperation as well and must help the South African economy to become the driving force for development throughout the region."
"Mr President, I am one of South Africa' s great admirers: I love the landscape, the people and its leaders."
"However, this special affinity cannot and must not be used as an excuse for not setting the same standards when it comes to preconditions as we do for other ACP countries."
"Honesty compels us to recognise that South Africa is having to contend with certain dysfunctions in governmental conduct which include sharp rises in corruption and criminality."
"Good agreements make good friends."
"This agreement bestows on us not just the right but also the duty to continue to press for good governance and an effective approach to tackling criminality."
"Equally though, we must actively support the South African Government in its struggle to reform a society which has first and second class citizens."
"Mr President, only if we succeed in this can we talk in terms of there being a true partnership between Europe and South Africa."
"Mr President, according to the information I have available to me, there are still differences of interpretation between South Africa and the European Union concerning the specific agreement on wines, particularly regarding the use of ""Port"" and ""Sherry"" as designations of origin."
"Following a meeting between both parties at the beginning of September, the European Union feels that the agreement lays down that South Africans cannot use the designations ""Port"" and ""Sherry"" after the specified period of twelve years, which means that they have to start thinking now about alternative names for the South African products in question."
"South Africa, on the other hand, interprets the agreement to mean that discussions to find new replacement names for the designations I have just referred to, on which agreement will have to be reached, only have to be started when those twelve years are up."
"If agreement is not reached on this matter, in its opinion, South Africa would continue to use the current names."
"Faced with such a situation, it is vital to avoid any interpretation which is less clear on the designations of origin ""Port"" and ""Sherry"" , which are in fact European geographical names which must be protected, and which cannot co-exist in any way with brands of wine from other places, which are allowed to use them with impunity."
"Above all, it is essential that, in line with the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of July, the specific agreement on wines should be concluded before the trade part of the agreement comes into force. That is due to happen in January."
"If this does not happen, the agreement' s entry into force should be delayed."
"What is in question here is not our political will to establish close cooperation with South Africa, a huge African country which is now a major trading partner of the European Union."
"What is in question is respect for a fundamental principle of our own long-term survival, that of the designations of origin of our authentic products which are protected, by the way, by the World Trade Organisation, under whose intellectual property laws they are covered."
"If the European Union is not capable of guaranteeing these principles, it will lose face completely in the negotiations which will be held shortly at the World Trade Organisation' s Millennium Round."
"I repeat that it is not the agreement itself which is in question, but whether it is possible to make this cooperation agreement compatible with respect for our own principles and with defending our interests."
"It must be an almost unique situation for an agreement to be ratified by Parliament before it is actually signed."
"Today we seem to be preparing for exactly that."
"I feel honoured and privileged that the subject of this remarkable event is the agreement with South Africa, for which I now carry the responsibility within the Commission."
"In a week from now I will have been in South Africa three times this year."
"My first visit was to celebrate the years of solidarity struggle."
"Speaking in the prisoners' dining hall on Robben Island was a nice experience."
"The second time was when I was representing my country at the inauguration of President Mbeki."
"Now I look forward to taking part next Monday, in Pretoria, in the actual signing and launching of this agreement."
"I want to thank Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteur of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Mrs Kinnock, for the swift and smooth way it has prepared for the parliamentary assent to the outcome of our negotiations with the South Africans and for the very active and committed way it has assisted this process over the years."
"Next week we will sign this agreement in Pretoria."
"Over the last few days we have heard suggestions by some people from some EU Member States that this joyful event might be affected by the fact that the parallel negotiations with South Africa on an EU/South Africa wines and spirits agreement have run into last-minute difficulties."
"Without going into the inappropriateness in principle of these kinds of suggestions, I wish to underline that both sides are working very hard to find a quick and mutually acceptable solution to the outstanding problems on the wines and spirits dossier."
"As a matter of fact, this Thursday negotiators of both sides will meet again in Brussels for a concluding session on the wines and spirits talks."
"I am confident that they will succeed."
"To the question put by Mr Souchet and others on what would be the consequences if a wines and spirits agreement was not reached in time, I have the following remarks."
"This was discussed in July and clarified in an internal declaration made by the Commission."
"Neither the special financial assistance - EUR 15 million - to the South African wine sector nor the duty-free wine quota of 32 million litres should come into play as long as the wines and spirits agreement is not operational."
"We have told this to the South Africans and we might wish to make it explicit in the exchange of letters that will be signed on the provisional application of the trade agreement."
"The trade, development and cooperation agreement that we will sign on 11 October is, in my view, a very good agreement."
"It is a vibrant symbol of the EU' s political commitment to the new post-apartheid South Africa."
"For South Africa the bold move towards a trade, development and cooperation agreement with the EU is a symbol of its commitment to economic restructuring and to regaining its full place in the international community."
"The agreement is one of the most ambitious partnership agreements that the EU has ever concluded with a third country."
"It confirms a clear determination by the EU to support the process of change and reform in South Africa and reflects both sides' desire to further expand their political, trade and cooperation contacts to the benefit of South Africa and indeed the southern African region as a whole."
"The agreement will break new ground for EU/South Africa cooperation in many areas."
"Seen from the specific angle of development cooperation it is my sincere hope that the agreement will contribute to the eradication of poverty and the promotion of prosperity in South Africa with full respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights."
"Mrs Kinnock' s report gives an excellent and largely accurate description of the potential and scope of the agreement."
"On some points though - and please forgive me for making some technical remarks - the wish seems to be father to the thought."
"I will give some examples."
"Contrary to what the report claims on page 8, the regional safeguard does not apply to the whole SADC region, but only to the BLNS countries which belong to the South Africa Customs Union."
"Since these countries will in practice apply the same external tariff as South Africa, it made sense to offer them also the same kind of safeguard protection, but this mechanism does not apply in the whole SADC area."
"It is also not yet agreed that the EU will liberalise imports of South African automotive products within three years, as the report seems to announce on page 9."
"This option has been made dependent on South Africa' s own efforts in this area, which will be reviewed in the second half of the year 2000."
"If the South African side proposes meaningful market openings to the EU, we will be able to fully eliminate our tariffs by the year 2003."
"If not, the EU liberalisation of the motor car sector will take longer."
"In contrast to what the report suggests on page 10, good governance is in strict legal terms not an essential element of the Agreement."
"Our negotiating mandate did not provide for this."
"The Agreement does, however, state that both parties reaffirm their attachment to the principles of good governance and sets this concept in the context of the essential element."
"But apart from some imprecisions of this kind, the report is, I have already said, very accurate indeed and very well written."
"And obviously, I fully share its positive conclusions."
"This brings me back to the challenge ahead - how to implement this agreement as soon and as well as possible."
"Since it is of a so-called mixed nature, we need to await ratification of the Agreement by all fifteen national parliaments."
"I hope that the amazing precedent to be set here this week will inspire your national colleagues to put this Agreement quickly on their working agenda."
"Experiences on other agreements have, however, taught us that it may very well be two or three years before the last EU Member State ratifies the Agreement."
"Under these circumstances, I welcome the fact that Council has decided to provisionally apply certain parts of the Agreement, notably the trade and development sections, as from 1 January 2000."
"During the next few weeks and months, I will closely follow the preparatory process towards this date so as to ensure that the all-important EU trade concessions towards South Africa will indeed effectively kick in on this agreed date."
"As for the other aspects of cooperation, a lot is already legally in place - development cooperation, Lomé, science and technology."
"But for many other aspects and subjects I am confident that the Agreement can provide immediate direction to our ambitions and efforts, even though in legal terms the Agreement may not yet be fully operational."
"Pending the formal ratification process and guided by the agreed text of this Agreement, it is my personal commitment to ensure that existing and upcoming areas of co-operation between the EU and South Africa will be quickly and effectively strengthened and deepened."
"Mr President, I thank the Commission for that response but I did raise the issue of the elements of the support package for the BLNS countries on which it was promised that a conference would take place in Lesotho."
"These countries are still waiting for any kind of confirmation of this conference and have been told by the Commission that it would take place before the signing of the agreement."
"That clearly will not happen, but we do need some reassurance, because they feel that the Commission is letting them down on this point."
"I can reassure you on that point."
"The conference in Lesotho is going to take place on 13-14 October and we are prepared to discuss there with representatives from the BLNS countries, how to structure the support package for those countries."
"So, this is also on track."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"Communication from the President of the Commission"
"The next item is the President of the Commission' s statement on the decisions taken by the Commission at its meeting today."
"Madam President, less than three weeks ago, you expressed your confidence in this Commission."
"At that time, I took on a series of commitments and I am happy to stand before you as proof that a new era of cooperation between our institutions has begun."
"I can see that it does not draw large crowds, but major objectives are never straightforward."
"The new Commission has just ended its third meeting and I would like to summarise its results."
"The first important topic concerns advertising A1 posts."
"Last week, we started to make a series of substantial changes at the highest administrative levels in the Commission, on the basis of a complete cultural change in appointment methods."
"I would especially like to stress that we have stipulated that, at regular intervals, low-level managers and their responsibilities will be coordinated and that the nationality of the outgoing member of staff will not be a factor in the appointment of their successor."
"After transferring a certain number of directors-general last week, we decided today to advertise the following vacant positions: directors-general of the Directorates-General for Enterprise Policy, Agriculture and Education and Culture; vice-directors-general of the following Directorates-General: Education and Culture, Competition and Foreign Relations."
"I insisted that these procedures must be transparent and that after the initial selection, appointments are made on merit."
"This fact is extremely important. This will also enable those outside the Commission to express their views."
"My second point is that the Commission has discussed the situation as regards the implementation of the 1999 budget and noted that there are sectors where we need a transfer before the end of the year."
"The specific proposals only concern the redistribution of commitment appropriations."
"The main aim is to take the burden off amending and supplementary budget 4/99, adopted on 16 September, by proposing the financing of more appropriations in line with the Commission' s proposal made at that time. These are: EUR 98 million for PHARE, EUR 68 million for TACIS, EUR 15 million for humanitarian aid to Turkey, EUR 21 million for Kosovo, EUR 20 million for cooperation with South Africa and EUR 10 million for the environment and tropical rainforests."
"These increases will be financed through the reallocation within Category 4 of EUR 155 million and the transfer from Category 3 of EUR 10 million."
"The third point concerns the Commission' s programme up to the end of January."
"We have stressed the importance of a good work programme."
"In line with this commitment, the Commission has reviewed the areas where a decision of the College must take effect before the end of January 2000."
"In this way, we will be able to communicate our programme commitments to you and to the European Council, so that you can keep it in mind when planning your work programme for the coming months."
"I will present Parliament with the five-year perspectives in January 2000, as we agreed here, after which our annual programming will return to its normal rhythm."
"I would like to add that I will be strict with my colleagues in the way they deal with the Commission services."
"The Commission demands quality, well-prepared proposals and understandable texts, above all - I repeat - understandable texts."
"The Commission is not a secretariat which must follow specific interests."
"We want to renew our role as the driving force of Europe and so we want to act as a College."
"Our programme is the one we proposed to you and we will present it in an analytical and comprehensive way."
"My fourth point is about the report on the competitiveness of European industry."
"The Commission has adopted the annual report on the competitiveness of European industry which deals with structural changes."
"We have also examined some reports devoted to the steel and forestry industries."
"I must add that both myself and Commissioner Liikanen intend to work in such a way that, in future, the Commission can concentrate on the more horizontal issues in business policy, because we now leave discussions on individual industries to other decision-making bodies."
"The fifth point concerns the new strategy for the internal market."
"With the help of a comprehensive report by Commissioner Bolkenstein, we have examined the priorities facing the internal market over the next five years."
"The action plan ended this year."
"The aim of the communication is to establish the potential objectives and the possible actions geared to the internal market over the next five years."
"We are counting on incorporating the most valuable element of the previous action plan, the so-called scoreboard framework of the internal market, and we intend to guarantee that there are sound procedures to assess, monitor and adjust the objectives."
"The Commission will be glad to welcome comments and reactions before making a definitive decision at the end of November, since today' s presentation is included in a communication procedure."
"Therefore, there will be a debate with Parliament and various times for consultation, and only in November will we arrive at a, let us say, operative proposal."
"This is another chapter where cooperation with Parliament is of the utmost importance."
"Just in the last few minutes, Commissioner Verheugen explained how we are starting to prepare the decisions which we will make next week on enlargement."
"This too is just a procedural explanation but it concerns the most important issue we have to deal with."
"Next week, we must approve all the reports on the progress of relations with the applicant countries."
"Commissioner Verheugen has already been in contact so that the parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs can be immediately informed about the situation."
"During next week, we will touch on one of the most important subjects for the whole of the Commission' s five-year term of office: we are starting the actual enlargement process."
"These were the subjects we discussed today, as well as numerous procedural aspects that are always discussed in Commission meetings that it is not appropriate to go into in Parliament."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to reassure President Prodi."
"The difference between the parliament of a dictatorship and a democratic parliament is that the parliament of a dictatorship is always full and the Members applaud, and a democratic parliament is not very full because the Members are working in other places."
"Secondly, I would like to make a comment concerning the reassignment of Directorates-General in the Commission: I welcome the political courage which this Commission has had."
"And finally, I would like to ask a question regarding the budget: bearing in mind that almost all transferrals involve Category 4, that is, the external activities of the Union, and that is one of the points that produces most dissatisfaction in my group and, in general, in the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr Barón Crespo, regarding your first remark, I was pleased by your words on the quality of Parliament."
"As for the second point, I would say that today we are limited to urgent reforms on the matters which are, as we have seen, absolutely extraordinary."
"If we re-read the list of the measures we find Turkey, and all the urgent cases which made it essential to alter the budget."
"We have not in any way reanalysed the major items of expenditure in the budget."
"If we look at that item, then I must say, Mr Barón Crespo, that it is not only external policy expenditure which must be reallocated, but I would say that we must reallocate all items in the budget."
"In all honesty, the structures in the budget are more faithful to their historical origins than to the needs of the future, but I think this is one of the three or four challenges that we must face together."
"So I am not responding to the single item because I do not feel like it, but I accept your invitation, Mr Barón Crespo, because when I myself start to examine the large expenditure percentages, I find that past rather than future needs are dictating our path."
"Clearly, enlargement of the European Union is the most important issue for the immediate future."
"We understand that you have discussed the progress reports which are to be published next week."
"Now, part of this progress towards enlargement - that concerned with cooperation on legal matters and between countries of the EU as it stands at present - is not being overseen by the Commission but by the Council of Ministers."
"All right, so we know this, but will any progress within this area be described in your reports?"
"Or is there a risk of the Council not making it public?"
"It would be very worrying if that were the case and if we in Parliament or our opposite numbers in the countries which are candidates for accession to the European Union were unable to study the progress made."
"Now, another small question by the way, Mr President of the Commission. Have you anything against your letter to Prime Minister Lipponen about the Tampere Summit being published?"
"It has been published in Sweden, and I imagine that you, with your policy of openness, would not object to its being published."
"Prime Minister Lipponen, however, refuses to let it be published in Finland."
"How do you view this?"
"Mr Thors, my attitude regarding this letter is very simple."
"I have absolutely nothing against publication but it must be the recipient of the letter who publishes it, not the sender."
"Therefore this really is a decision that Minster Lipponen must make."
"Since I have not written anything secret to him, because it was not at all necessary, I have nothing against this but I think that it is right for him to make the decision."
"President Prodi, because I know you as an Italian and through the hearings that took place in this Parliament, I know that you have a firm desire to make this Parliament into something more than just a symbol."
"However, I have the feeling that the individual Governments in the various Member States do not share your desire."
"I refer, for example, to the type of administration of the budget funds that we transfer to the various Member States."
"In our case, in Italy, they go via committees within the Ministry of Industry, for example. But it is difficult to have access to them, despite the work we do in the committees, in order to ensure that the funds, in ever greater measures, are transferred to the Member States."
"Can you intervene to make it possible in some way for the European Members of Parliament to follow the course of funds that are given to the Member States?"
"In terms of power alone, no I do not have this power."
"If I am being asked though, it is clear that this cooperation is desirable and I think we must do all we can to make it happen. Also, in the end, these are decisions which must be generally supported so they can be carried through."
"If the two parties which have to go ahead with these decisions have no relationship with each other, the work then becomes useless, or at least disorganised."
"As for the first matter, concerning people' s feelings and indeed the reality that Parliament is becoming very important, this is a process of mutual agreement."
"I therefore think that it is really unlikely for the power given to Parliament to come from a concession. It has always come from a victory too, as well as from the willingness to open up."
"Madam President, Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, boasted that he was instigating some kind of Cultural Revolution in the administration by rotating senior posts."
"I would like to ask why not one of the new directors-general is a woman?"
"Is it really the case that there were not enough suitable applicants, or do you not know how to get them?"
"Why is it that only one of the Commissioners' chefs de cabinet is a woman?"
"It seems to me that we must pay great attention to promotions within the Commission, so that women can also rise in their careers to senior posts."
"I would also like to ask how you intend to guarantee that this so-called glass ceiling is shattered and that women are not restricted to lower levels in the administrative hierarchy?"
"You are perfectly right to ask the question, Mrs Hautala."
"I would only remind you that the cultural revolution needs more time."
"Here we have only changed some posts which it was essential to change because we had to give an example of mobility, for countries and people."
"We had to show that the posts are not anyone' s fixed prerogative."
"So we have made these ten changes which are, however, of fundamental importance."
"I, like you, looked at the issue of women and there have been great difficulties in dealing with this at this stage."
"The problem, however, is worse still, Mrs Hautala, because the situation is very difficult, even with reshuffles."
"Either we really change policy, in employment and career procedures, or we cannot see the matter through to its conclusion."
"So this is one of the themes we must talk about in the cultural revolution, and one that we must discuss with the administration."
"Allow me to make one more remark. The issue of the cultural revolution of the administration goes deeper than we might think."
"I came here from outside the institutions, observed with great curiosity the type of administrative structure in place, and I have to say that we need to discuss the basic philosophy of this administration."
"Every new political and administrative situation created in the world has always found new strength in its administration."
"Here however, the administration has grown by a process of stratification and has not looked to the future."
"The cultural revolution lies here, not in changing only ten directors."
"The major challenge goes much deeper, and calls for us to work intellectually too, in a direction that is still unknown."
"However, in studying all this, I have realised that there has been no effort to create an administration for the duties the Commission must perform."
"Mr Prodi, even though you are new in the job, you have already succeeded in creating a powerful impression. I have been following especially closely your statements about economic policy after the introduction of the euro."
"I should like to ask you whether, in your view or in that of the Commission, there is any type of taxation which will not require a common policy or some form of harmonisation following the introduction of the euro and the integration which that will set in motion."
"Mrs Frahm, this really is a question which would require a conference in order to reply."
"If I understand correctly, you are alluding to the problems of tax harmonisation."
"Just now, in the Commission meeting which has just finished, Commissioner Bolkenstein summarised, in a way I believe to be absolutely correct and precise, why there are some items of fiscal policy which do not need to be harmonised, which thrive on diversity, for example personal income taxes."
"There are other items, such as value added tax, which call for a certain amount of harmonisation, because otherwise, there would be problems with competition."
"There are still more items, on company taxation and taxation on financial revenue which instead must be harmonised where the lack of harmonisation leads to a distortion of competition."
"This is a general statement, but it is clear that within this, a thousand individual items must be created because then each of these general items splits into many specific issues that it is not appropriate to discuss here."
"The basic philosophy, however, seems to be this: there are some subjects which upset or violate competition and so we must have thorough harmonisation."
"This doctrine is simple and also very clear because it is in line with decentralisation, which we believe to be a Commission doctrine that we have all accepted and share."
"Mr President of the Commission, a sorry story of child abuse in a Commission nursery has appeared in the Spanish press."
"This story came to light in 1997 and it would appear that the people involved have still not received their deserved punishment and that the Commission has still not initiated a thorough investigation, nor taken the contract away from the people who have it at the moment and who are responsible for the situation which has been created there."
"There is a series of irregularities in the granting of this contract, as well as irregularities in the operation of the nursery in question."
"The Commission knew that this was happening and has not resolved the problem, nor has it tried to resolve it, and the children, who are the most important concern, have not been sufficiently protected nor transferred to other people with suitable guarantees of care and attention."
"This is a deeply serious issue which, unfortunately, is appearing in the media far too frequently."
"Mr Prodi, what do you intend to do about it?"
"Madam President, I am being made aware of this problem for the first time."
"I think that, given that this matter is so close to home and that it is so serious, the only thing I can undertake to do is examine this matter carefully."
"Madam President, yesterday the European Commission decided to give Paul Van Buitenen an official reprimand."
"Have you, Mr Prodi, and your colleagues, in fact taken account of the opinion held in this European Parliament and by many voters that this whistle-blower deserves the very opposite of a reprimand?"
"Mr Prodi, so far you have been unable to find the time to take receipt of the petition that calls for Paul Van Buitenen' s rehabilitation."
"Now it is almost too late. I would like to try a new approach and present the 6,253 signatures to you here."
"I think it is a shame that this whole business continues to be a millstone round the European Commission' s neck."
"Madam President, we have had an administrative procedure and we now await your petition which will be examined at length."
"(Mr Blokland gave President Prodi the petition)"
"Well, I do not think there is anything more to say."
"Madam President, firstly let me thank Mr Prodi for this initiative today."
"Even if the tone of the communications today is rather low-key, they represent the crossing of a major institutional threshold."
"They are a signal of the new era of which you speak and I wish to welcome that on behalf of my group."
"Can I ask Mr Prodi whether in principle, subject to Parliament and the Commission being able to formalise appropriate arrangements, it would be possible to do this regularly?"
"Next week, if I understand correctly, you will also be available to discuss the enlargement questions, but as a general principle what you have started here today is important and the opportunity to continue this dialogue between our two institutions by appropriate and formalised mechanisms would be appreciated, either through you personally or through other members of the College of Commissioners as appropriate in other part-session weeks, depending on the agenda."
"Madam President, I must say that as things stand, I have no commitments for next week. There has been no agreement on enlargement."
"I thought that Commissioner Verheugen would be coming, but I will certainly be available."
"We are dealing with a very serious and very important question of procedure."
"I think that if the type of information we have to give is to work properly for five years, we must clearly establish when the President will be present, when individual Commissioners will be present and when instead, a written communication will be sufficient, because otherwise we will lose our relationship and it will become trivial."
"I think that the most serious thing is for us to lay down these rules in a small committee."
"Certainly the President is available in all important and necessary cases, otherwise, and quite rightly, the level of debate they say, will drop."
"Of course, if more minor questions are asked, then we will have to lower, quite rightly, the debate to the level of the matters in question."
"Now, in my opinion we have three levels: the President, specific Commissioners devoted to different areas and routine, which must be conducted in the fastest and most transparent way possible - using the Internet or written communications - because it does not merit being the subject of a debate."
"We must preserve direct communication when there is going to be a debate."
"This is what I think and, in this regard, in all the cases where there will be important issues, I will, of course, be happy to be of service to Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr Prodi."
"From my accent I am sure you will not be surprised by my question."
"We in Britain have complied with the beef ban."
"The beef ban has been lifted and now the unilateral action of one Member State is undermining, certainly in Britain, the whole spirit of the European Union project."
"In my region, the West Midlands of Great Britain, there are farmers who have very little left to live on."
"Will you please act urgently to bring pressure to stop this unilateral beef ban by the French?"
"Madam President, in this House this morning, Commissioner Byrne replied by saying that he has asked for urgent clarification."
"If the urgent clarification does not bring any new facts to light, then I will immediately ask for the measure taken to be abolished."
"I think that all this will take place in the space of a few hours and so the formal undertaking made by Commissioner Byrne this morning will be put into practice in the next few hours."
"In this way, we can establish whether the French Government' s decision has been made because of new facts, in which case it will be valid, or whether instead it has been made in breach of the general rules and then it is clear that in some way it must be revoked in the next few hours."
"I should like - very unusually for me - to begin by praising the Commission for meeting in such large numbers here today."
"I think it is a good tradition which is now being introduced whereby the Commission reports on what happened at that day' s meeting, or the previous day' s meeting if it is a Wednesday."
"I think it is something which will help create greater openness about the Commission' s work."
"In this connection, I should like to ask if the Commission will produce the agendas for the meetings of the Commission, together with the most important working documents, in advance of the Commission' s meetings. In that way, there could be something about the documents in the newspapers before the meetings take place and there would be greater interest in the meetings on the part of the press."
"Mr Bonde, within the limitations time imposes, this is already happening, as there is an agenda which is definitely not kept secret."
"The problem is that the Commission works at a really intensive rate and so it is impossible to say, ten days ahead of the Commission' s meeting, what the precise agenda will be."
"However, as regards the important subjects that we will be discussing, the ones that can be prepared in advance, we have already begun to set down the framework for our future work."
"This is a commitment that I just made in my address, that is, to lay out the framework of our work up to the end of the year so that we can work together on major topics."
"Last minute changes are made to the agenda but there is nothing secret about this. It is just difficult to communicate these changes when we ourselves only know that urgent facts have come up a few minutes before the start of the meeting."
"Madam President, Mr Prodi has mentioned the competitiveness of European industry in the course of his introductory remarks."
"He said that this would be high on his agenda and that the need was for structural change in European industry."
"I would suggest to Mr Prodi that many economists believe that the most important factors for competitiveness in industry would be, first of all, a reduction in corporate and employment taxes and secondly, a reduction in the enormous and indeed intolerable burden of regulation which puts Europe at a great disadvantage in relation to other parts of the world."
"We have a European employment programme which is based on four pillars."
"None of those four pillars will make a significant impact on unemployment in the short term."
"The solutions for unemployment are exactly the same as the solutions for competitiveness, that is, reduced employment taxes and reduced levels of regulation."
"What attitude will the Commission take to these points?"
"Mr Helmer, I am very pleased to be asked these questions because, for many years, I specialised in the analysis of competitiveness and industrial economics."
"I fully agree with the points you made: the reduction in corporate taxes and their harmonisation are useful for European competition, as is employment tax."
"However, if you asked me what the primary factor in Europe' s industrial problems is, I would be very frank: the human resources problem as the incentive for entrepreneurship that exists on our continent and, therefore, the whole problem of preparing the financial structures for new entrepreneurship."
"I therefore think that the human factor is top of the list of our problems in developing production and the fiscal factor is extremely important."
"We can give them equal importance if you like, but certainly the human resources issue is, in my opinion, of huge importance for our continent. If we do not take urgent measures using a very broad programme in this sector, I believe that not even reducing taxes, which would represent substantial action and can make a strong contribution, will be sufficient to bring about growth in European industry."
"Madam President, I would like to make a very brief remark."
"I would never judge the matters raised by my colleagues, but I would like to say that these talks with the Commission should perhaps keep to the Commission' s discussion and their decisions, otherwise, we risk running over into another section which will soon begin - Question Time."
"So I think that if we want to make this time meaningful, we must keep it as we initially wanted it to be."
"A quick question to President Prodi on the organisation chart."
"In the second Wise Men' s report, there is a point which concerns national interests which have supposedly been organised to some degree in the Commission."
"I think that for an institution like the Commission there is nothing worse, along with fraud, than this: the thought that there is no impartiality or supranationality."
"Does the policy you have begun concerning directors-general also consist of examining, tackling and facing up to the issue of the Commission' s impartiality and independence?"
"Mrs Napoletano, if we look at people' s reactions, I would say that we have indeed been impartial."
"I have been criticised by everyone, starting with the Italian press, not to mention the Spanish press and the French press, while the Germans have criticised me in speech as well as in writing."
"Therefore, either we have done everything badly or we have done everything well. All things considered, I do not know."
"I would like to stress, however, a very important point - why have we done this?"
"Because there cannot be a truly European body if a specific post has been reserved for thirty years for one country or for twenty years for one person."
"Here the future of what we understand as Europe is at stake."
"So, in these cases, it is likely that mistakes will happen. It is also likely that high-level people will be sacrificed, but do you understand what is at stake?"
"Do you understand what we are facing? We really are facing the future of a structure that must be as international as possible."
"Secondly, by making these decisions I have taken a risk, a very real risk, and this too is a sign for the future."
"I want to be clear that appointments must be made according to merit and sometimes they will upset or overturn certain balances between countries."
"But the future of Europe is at stake here, and it is already an extremely important consequence."
"I have seen it in people' s reactions."
"In fact, after discussing this with the representatives of various countries, with the people who objected, the consequence was this: we must invest more in training the young and we must put more energy into sending high-level officials to Brussels."
"This is what I wanted. To start a chain reaction so that this becomes the best bureaucracy in the world."
"It is clear that this is a challenge, along with what I said before in reply to Mr Cox' s question - to start creating a type of bureaucracy suited to the objectives we want to achieve and then choose the best people which will sometimes mean upsetting the balance between countries."
"However, I think that it is worth it for our future goal."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0030/1999). We will examine the questions addressed to the Commission."
"First part"
"Question No 28 by (H-0465/99):"
"Subject: Measures to check the structural resistance of buildings in Greece The powerful earthquake which recently occurred in Attiki in Greece caused enormous damage to buildings throughout the area, resulting in dozens of fatalities and numerous casualties."
"Can the Commission rapidly earmark funds (for example for residual balances entered against the CSF and other Community programmes) for immediate preventive checks on the structural resistance of not only public premises such as schools, hospitals etc. but also premises on which large numbers of people are employed, (for example factories) throughout Greece, to establish how well they will stand up to major earthquakes?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Alavanos for giving me the opportunity to express for the first time the Commission' s concern for, and solidarity with, the population and the authorities of the Republic of Greece."
"The Prime Minister, Mr Simitis has made an appeal to us and your question, Mr Alavanos, supports this request for aid and solidarity from the European Union and passes it directly on to us."
"Together with Mrs Diamantopoulou, we informed the Commission, this very afternoon, on what action is possible within the framework of the Structural Funds to provide support to Greece and to assist it in terms of reconstruction and repairs."
"I can confirm to the European Parliament that within the framework of the regulations of the Structural Funds, with the appropriations currently available, we are able to offer substantial support to those parts of the Greek population which have been affected. This is around 20,000 households, not to mention several hundred victims."
"I am now able to give the European Parliament the list of areas in which the regulations allow us to intervene as well as how the European Investment Bank envisages the way it will be done."
"The bank will make its decision on this at its board meeting on 7 December."
"Yesterday evening in Tampere I met Mr Partas, the Greek Secretary of State for Regional Policy, in order to ask him to provide us as quickly as possible - and I know that it is difficult - with an assessment and the most accurate figures possible so that we can commit the appropriations which are available to us."
"This is the substance of the answer I wanted to give to Mr Alavanos."
"Moving beyond compensation now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Alavanos has asked a question which has always interested me - I am now thinking of the action that I took in my own country when I was Minister for the Environment, concerned with natural risks - the matter of prevention."
"Prevention is cheaper, always cheaper than having to repair things afterwards."
"My answer is yes, in a general way, without targeting any institution in particular, with the Structural Fund appropriations we can finance studies for the prevention of earthquake risk in Greece as well as other countries as long as the Greek Government asks us to."
"Finally, as I have been talking about the lessons to be learnt from this natural disaster, I would also like to emphasise how seriously - and I have said this within the College - I take the idea of improving the coordination of different countries' resources in terms of the civil defence of their people."
"Personally, I am in favour of the idea of a European civil defence force, which I believe will be extremely useful with regard to the citizens and the problems that still remain. The purpose of this force would be to work better together, more quickly and more visibly, in the event of a natural disaster, both within the territory of the European Union and elsewhere, and God knows, there is no shortage of disasters as current events show."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his substantial and interesting reply and for his sensitivity."
"Firstly, I would, of course, like to ask him if he could have been more analytical as regards the proposals which he himself and Mrs Diamantopoulou made for tackling the issues of the earthquakes."
"My second question, which is the main point of the question, is whether or not the Commission thinks - since we have the Seveso Directive which provides for the protection of workers and citizens around factories from accidents within industrial installations - that it should take some measures to protect all industrial installations from natural disasters such as earthquakes."
"Both in Greece and Turkey, and in the past in Naples, Taiwan and Mexico, we have seen a constant lack of control over industrial installations."
"In view of this, is the Commission proposing to examine such a possibility?"
"The prevention of natural disasters, Mr Alavanos, is the responsibility of Member States."
"As I have just told you though, if any government - because Greece is not the only country concerned by this: we have seen disasters or earthquakes of varying magnitude happen in other countries too, but they had a less serious effect - anyway, if any government asks us, we are able to support and finance, by means of the Structural Funds, preventive studies which would allow us to determine the risks to inhabited areas, as you mentioned in your question, but also to factories, with the secondary risks of industrial disaster that that would entail."
"I am therefore giving a straightforward answer to your question: we will be able to take charge of such a request and deal with it as soon as a Member State presents it to us."
"Question No 29 by (H-0470/99):"
"Subject: Danger of a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan The civil war raging in Afghanistan is in danger of causing a humanitarian disaster, particularly now that winter is approaching."
"Between 100,000 and 120,000 refugees have already been forced into the Panshir Valley and the Northeast region controlled by the military commander Massoud."
"The refugees are fleeing a brutal offensive by the Talibans (villages razed to the ground, summary executions and mass graves, the abduction of women, etc.)."
"Depending on the course of the military operations, the refugees' situation may get much worse should a Taliban offensive force a further 180,000 to 200,000 refugees into the Panshir Valley, which, with the onset of winter, could become a valley of death."
"Does the Commission not think that it must, as a matter of urgency, consider the possibility of providing humanitarian aid in order to prevent a humanitarian disaster?"
"Echo is carefully considering developments in the situation of the displaced persons following the renewed hostilities which have taken place in Afghanistan since the spring."
"The office has on-going contact with the International Red Cross, the United Nations organisations, the NGOs which are present in the country and Echo' s own representative."
"The latter has carried out a mission in Kabul where streams of refugees were recorded in the northern districts."
"Echo' s representative is now in the Panshir valley in order to assess the situation."
"Difficult access to the Panshir valley, the extremely explosive situation and the marked political sensitivity which characterise the situation in the area demand intervention of a kind which will have to be organised between the various humanitarian organisations if errors of judgement and bad decisions are to be avoided."
"What is more, everything we do will have to respect Echo' s neutral mandate."
"Echo has plans to provide aid amounting to EUR 1.5 million to all the displaced persons staying close to the various front lines, namely in the Panshir valley - where there is talk of displaced persons following the fighting in April and May - and in Kabul."
"The fact that this particular aid, details of which have already been submitted for approval, is being provided does not rule out the possibility of further aid being necessary before the end of the year."
"With the threat of difficulties created by the winter, the situation is really becoming acute."
"As regards an agreement with the most representative humanitarian players in the area, the aid will be aimed in particular at consolidating the existing humanitarian structures in the area and at assisting the local population by supporting the displaced persons with medical help, food aid and shelter."
"The practical details of these forms of humanitarian action are being established in collaboration with our partners in the field."
"We are prepared continuously to alter our input, not least against the background of the highly volatile military situation."
"This is an answer for bureaucrats and technocrats."
"In reality, Europe is very slow, it does too little, and I find this neutrality that you mentioned quite scandalous."
"My question concerns humanitarian aid to the Panshir valley, that is, the zone controlled by those resisting the totalitarian and criminal regime of Kabul and the Taliban, whose horrifying treatment of women we are only too aware of."
"We must make a choice."
"There are more than 100,000 people there, men, women and children who, as winter approaches, will experience an unprecedented humanitarian disaster in the Panshir valley."
"So do not talk to us about neutrality!"
"Europe is not neutral in this matter. Europe must choose."
"There are executioners and victims, there are Nazis and Jews, and there are criminals and innocent people!"
"I ask you to give a straight answer to the question of what we are going to do for these women and children who are now hemmed in, in the Panshir valley."
"We expect Europe to come up with a better answer than this."
"Yes, but you are not getting one."
"My answer was not of a bureaucratic nature."
"There is just as much humanitarian concern in focusing on the victims of the conflict, irrespective of the character of the conflict."
"When we are confronted with suffering of this nature and with victims in the numbers we are seeing here, there are obviously factors on both sides of the conflict which may be characterised in the way the questioner has just done."
"Otherwise, the victims would not be in the position they are in fact in."
"And our mandate in connection with what Echo is doing in the field is a humanitarian mandate."
"I ask that this fact be respected."
"I am fully conscious of the fact that it is not always possible to be completely unpartisan, and one can always be taken advantage of by one or the other side in a conflict when one helps the victims."
"However, there is no value in representing the issue as the questioner has done."
"It is difficult enough as it is to be of use in providing humanitarian aid."
"I think that there is really no misrepresentation here."
"As Mr Madelin said before me, this is a dramatic situation; there are opportunities to intervene via the Central Asian countries, and I do not understand why the Commission has adopted this wait-and-see position."
"As Mr Madelin said, this is an extremely dramatic situation."
"I think that the Taliban regime is completely indefensible, which is yet another reason to intervene."
"I had expected some understanding for my line of argument."
"I have not in any way expressed a positive view of the Taliban regime."
"Nor can I be persuaded to."
"I have merely tried to insist upon regard for the conflict' s victims as being the decisive factor here."
"I do not believe that the warring parties, and certainly not the Taliban regime, view what we are doing here in Europe as something which is in support of themselves in the conflict."
"However, it is crucial to our credibility and to Echo' s ability to enter the zones of conflict and come into contact with the people we are to help that we avoid a rhetoric which is confrontational, and that is something I shall go on endeavouring to do."
"Question No 30 by (H-0489/99):"
"Subject: Support for Slovakia What steps are being taken by the Commission to further consolidate and support the positive democratic developments in Slovakia?"
"Mr President, Mr Posselt, I would firstly like to support the basic assumption of your question, i.e. that there has been positive democratic development in Slovakia and that this positive democratic development must be supported and consolidated."
"Directly after the Dzurinda Government took office at the end of October 1998, the Commission, on the initiative of my predecessor, set up a bilateral high-level working party to once again give Slovakia' s preparations for accession the necessary momentum."
"This was seen as a significant sign of support for the democratic new beginning in Slovakia."
"You can see this from the fact that no such group had ever been set up before for any other country."
"After five sessions, this working party completed its activities in September with positive conclusions."
"The positive conclusions concern primarily the political Copenhagen criterion, but I must add that the conclusions of this working party do not prejudice the conclusions of the forthcoming regular report on Slovakia."
"The Commission will now accordingly acknowledge this encouraging development in its forthcoming regular report."
"The Commission will adopt this report on the development of Slovakia on 13 October, i.e. as early as next week, together with the other progress reports."
"The Commission is particularly strong in its support of the non-governmental organisations essential for the development of a mature civil society in Slovakia."
"In the national PHARE programme for Slovakia 1999, EUR 2.5 million were made available for the Slovakian foundation for the development of a civil society, brought into being on the initiative of the Commission."
"This foundation will forward funds to approximately 100 non-governmental organisations for activities, among other things, in the fields of human rights, environmental protection, social work, etc. Mr Posselt, I would, incidentally, like to point out that PHARE resources for Slovakia in the year 1999 reached the level of the previously highest volume to date with almost EUR 70 million."
"In addition, we have established a special fund for projects which are intended to benefit the national minorities, particularly the Romany."
"This special fund has been allocated EUR 2 million."
"Commissioner, thank you for this very clear answer. I am pleased to see you here for the first time in your new role."
"I would just like to ask two questions."
"Firstly, is there also concentrated collaboration with the Slovakian universities, especially as regards academic and student exchange?"
"This is also a question of the expansion of our programme to the associated States. That is what we have the Additional Protocols for."
"Secondly, I would like to ask whether you consider it conceivable that in Helsinki, Slovakia will be ranked among the countries with which discussions are to be held?"
"Mr Posselt, I can answer the second question easily."
"I consider it not only conceivable but I can even tell you right now that I shall be making that proposal at all events and I expect that the Commission will support this proposal."
"It is quite clear that the reason that Slovakia has not yet been included in talks is because there were political deficits."
"These political deficits have been eliminated, and no one - either in Slovakia or outside it - would understand, if there were not now a suitably positive response from the European Union."
"As regards the question about universities, I shall accept that as a suggestion."
"On the spur of the moment, I cannot just tell you what concrete collaboration with universities and student exchange there may be."
"If they do exist I shall notify you in writing; if they do not exist, I shall put it as a suggestion to the competent authorities."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask a question on the economic situation."
"In Slovakia, the package of economy measures has entailed some problems and privations for the population."
"It is therefore important to stabilise the economic situation."
"We know in Europe small and medium-sized businesses are the bedrock of the economy."
"What do you intend to do to expedite economic stability here and especially to establish contact between neighbouring States, located in direct proximity to the European Union?"
"What programmes are envisaged here to get privatisation on the right road too?"
"You know, there were considerable problems with the Meciar Government when privatisation went ahead."
"I believe that there is a great need for economic rehabilitation, and I believe it is extremely important for Slovakia. I would like to thank you expressly for the fact that you are going to propose that the appropriate negotiations begin in Helsinki."
"I believe this is a very important contribution that Europe can make."
"Mr Rübig, I can only agree with everything you have said."
"In Slovakia, it is absolutely essential to quickly work off the deficits which have arisen in recent years."
"One of these deficits is the sluggish progress of the privatisation process, which was also connected with other problems, as you well know."
"The result is, of course, that we still do not have a satisfactory situation with regard to a self-supporting sector of the economy, capable of development, above all in the middle range."
"The Accession Partnership currently under discussion with Slovakia will include appropriate programmes in this area."
"The resources already envisaged for Slovakia will indeed serve, as you know, the development of infrastructure or ""institution building"" , but they can also be implemented as instruments for the regulation and further development of the economy."
"We shall do that through the programme."
"I cannot give any further details at the moment because, naturally, the basic prior political conditions for that must be achieved first."
"Obviously, I shall keep Parliament informed regarding the concrete programmes not just with Slovakia but with other States, for which Accession Partnerships are now being further developed."
"Question No 31 by (H-0498/99):"
"Subject: Aid for civilian population of Serbia With their economy and production in free fall, the people of Serbia are heading for a difficult winter."
"The reprehensible policies pursued by the regime are having severe effects on many innocent people."
"Popular discontent is directed at both the regime and the outside world which is regarded as compounding the suffering with indiscriminate sanctions."
"It is important that the EU does not inadvertently strengthen Milosevic' s position, but that it should make a contribution in the form of targeted, democratically-controlled humanitarian aid."
"In the light of this situation, is the Commission prepared to consider measures in essential areas to assist the Serbian civilian population? Consideration should be given primarily to the growing environmental threats posed by destroyed sewage plants, oil refineries and chemical factories in Novi Sad and Pancevo, for example, and to exempting young students from the academic embargo which is cutting them off from foreign educational institutions and other contacts, making their future bleak and encouraging a brain-drain so damaging to the country."
"Such measures would relieve the Serbian people' s suffering, make it more difficult for Milosevic to demonise the outside world and strengthen democratic forces."
"As a consequence of the crisis in Kosovo, the Commission, via Echo, is providing emergency aid to the most vulnerable population groups in Serbia."
"Aid amounting to EUR 45.1 million has been provided so far."
"Against the background of the growing humanitarian needs which will arise in the coming winter, Echo is considering setting aside a further EUR 10 million for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive programme of humanitarian aid with the following six components."
"Firstly: aid in the form of food and sanitary measures for 770,000 recipients of support in Serbia."
"This figure, which includes 350,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, 120,000 internally displaced Serbs and gypsies from Kosovo and 300,000 socially vulnerable people, has been calculated by the World Food Programme' s and UNHCR' s joint assessment team for emergency food aid which visited the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in July of this year."
"Support for the displaced persons is being provided via the International Red Cross, while the Red Cross Federation and the national Red Cross societies are in the process of extending their programme to provide food stations, to which Echo will continue to provide support."
"Secondly: shelter to individuals who have been displaced recently."
"Echo provides support for the repair of private dwellings and the supply of goods other than food to make it possible to establish adequate shelter for new arrivals driven out of Kosovo."
"Through its contribution to UNHCR, Echo also provides support to families who are housing displaced persons from Kosovo."
"Thirdly: psychological and social support for displaced persons."
"With the help of projects of this kind, attempts will be made to alleviate the trauma caused by the experiences undergone by many displaced persons, especially children."
"Fourthly: emergency improvement of the structures for providing water and sanitation."
"Even if larger rebuilding projects are not undertaken, Echo will make less extensive improvements to the installations concerned in order to prevent health problems from arising."
"Fifthly: support for social institutions."
"The most vulnerable groups in Serbia are to be found in such institutions, and Echo will, to the extent that is necessary, provide help in the form of supplementary food aid (basic food aid being provided by the World Food Programme) and supplementary goods other than food and heating."
"Sixthly: hygiene."
"In the course of the winter, special arrangements will have to be made at certain points to provide heating, among other things."
"Negotiations with the World Health Organisation concerning flu vaccinations and problems with tuberculosis are under way right now."
"Students from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are not - as the honourable Member supposes - excluded from foreign universities or cut off from contacts abroad, because the sanctions in place do not extend to such matters."
"It is true that no EU aid is being provided under the Tempus programme, but that is due to the fact that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia does not fulfil the criteria established by the Council in connection with the PHARE programme to which Tempus is linked."
"In any case, resources have been set aside to support democratisation and promote the institutions of civil society."
"With regard to the environmental consequences of the Kosovo conflict for Serbia, I would refer you to the answer given to question no. 1512/99."
"Thank you for that answer to my question."
"I am delighted by what you said. My question arose from a visit I made to Belgrade about three weeks ago and from renewed contacts I had last week with the democratic movement, all the opposition political parties, private and humanitarian organisations, etc., which had issued a message for help in combating the way in which Milosevic is now demonising other countries."
"Other countries, including the EU, are being regarded as enemies which have destroyed their lives and institutions and which are now even subjecting them to sanctions."
"It is extremely important to destroy this picture, which is false."
"So I am very pleased that Serbia' s democratic opposition and other democratic forces are now getting the clear message that the European Union is ready to do its utmost for the civilian population in its present difficult situation."
"I think that the very size of the EU' s humanitarian aid to Serbia clearly underlines the fact that we wish to make a positive contribution to benefit the population, and we have, up until now, been in a position to identify clear, well-founded needs of a humanitarian nature."
"We have therefore sought to make a contribution in relation to these needs."
"We naturally need to work together with other organisations, and I was therefore careful to report on what we are doing together with the Red Cross, the World Food Programme, UNHCR and others who are involved, including the World Health Organisation."
"This is precisely for the purpose of making it clear that this is a humanitarian operation, but I also think it is a good thing that the population and political circles in Serbia see that the world outside is also prepared to help in this way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I see crocodile tears being shed over the people of Serbia."
"Whilst Serbian academics have been banned from international scientific circles, we are concerned about the fact that students in Serbia have no contact with foreign educational institutions."
"Whilst the European Union, together with the Americans, is slaughtering the people of Yugoslavia, transforming its whole infrastructure into ruins, we are concerned that the Serbian people are heading for a difficult winter."
"I have the feeling that we have here a case of gross hypocrisy."
"In my opinion, the only honourable thing left for the European Union to do for Yugoslavia would be to pay out war compensation for the disaster it caused, and a first step would be to lift the trade embargo."
"I wonder if such thoughts prevail in the Commission, albeit at embryonic stage. I would like to ask whether this flagrant blackmail of promising aid to Yugoslavia once Milosevic goes will ever end."
"I have reported on the humanitarian aid being provided by the EU to those who require it in Serbia, and the other questions in fact lie outside the actual discussion of humanitarian aid."
"A limit needs to be set upon the extent to which humanitarian aid is really going to be provided, and I feel that the proper limit at present lies in what we are doing in relation to Serbia."
"Commissioner, I am sure that you will agree with me when I say that the humanitarian aid which we are giving to Serbia is by no means penalising Mr Milosevic, but those are the criteria for humanitarian aid, and it is therefore right, at least according to your logic, that they should be met."
"Having said this, there is another humanitarian issue yet to be resolved: that of the 3000 or more Kosovar prisoners still being held in prisons in Serbia."
"This is a humanitarian issue, so it concerns you too."
"You have a major bargaining tool, which is the sum of EUR 50 million granted to Serbia as humanitarian aid."
"Are you committed to using this in the near future to ensure that these prisoners are set free?"
"It would be extremely good if what was suggested in the question could be done."
"The money I have mentioned is money we have in fact used."
"The sum of EUR 45 million is money we have spent so far."
"I cannot use it again, and that was the point at issue in the question."
"What we can do in relation to those in prison is to contribute to the international effort to obtain some insight into how they are being treated."
"We shall use all possible channels and contacts to help them in their situation, but the great struggle for power in Serbia, for democratisation and so on is not something which - if I am to have the slightest credibility - I can assume we can sort out using these humanitarian resources."
"Question No 32 by (H-0514/99):"
"Subject: Ban on imports of American hormone-treated meat Will the Commission provide a summary of the findings of those of the 17 scientific committees that have completed their investigations into the risks posed by hormone-treated meat?"
"If those findings do not indicate that the consumption of hormone-treated meat poses any risks, will it explain how this will affect current policies towards the USA and the WTO agreements?"
"Second part"
"I should like to thank the questioner for giving me the opportunity to deal with this issue which is a complex, difficult and sensitive one."
"First of all, a clear distinction needs to be made between the 17 scientific studies and the opinion delivered by one of the Commission' s independent scientific advisory committees."
"In February 1998, following the criticism of the WTO appellate body, the Commission launched 17 studies with the aim of providing additional information concerning risks in areas such as toxicology, abusive use and environmental aspects."
"The studies will be continued as planned and the final results from a number of them are expected to be available by the end of the year."
"However, several studies will, as foreseen, not be completed before the summer of 2000."
"In conformity with the principle of transparency the Commission intends to make the outcome of the studies public as soon as possible after their finalisation."
"The results of the studies concerning residue analysis of meat and meat products have already been made public and can be obtained from the Commission services."
"The Commission also asked its Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health to deliver an opinion on the potential adverse effects to human health from the administration of the six animal growth promotion hormones."
"On 30 April this year the SCVPH adopted unanimously an opinion on the assessment of potential risks to human health from hormone residues in bovine meat and meat products."
"That report has been published."
"This work has been carried out on the basis of the most recent data in the open scientific literature."
"On the basis of this scientific advice the Commission is of the opinion that it cannot propose lifting the ban."
"Any new information which may come to light from the studies or from other sources will be fully considered."
"I listened with interest to the discussion this morning about food safety and have a question to put to the Commission: is it the precautionary principle which is now to be tested by the Commission in connection with the hormone war with the USA?"
"I do not feel convinced that there are scientific proofs to justify our maintaining the ban on imports of hormone-treated meat. Nor did I hear the Commissioner substantiate any possible scientific proof."
"I only heard that the Commissioner did not wish to propose that the ban be lifted."
"Can we be certain that there will in fact be scientific proof to justify continuing with the ban on hormone-treated meat?"
"That is the first question."
"The second question is this: how can one be certain that, in the forthcoming World Trade Organisation negotiations in Seattle, problems do not arise with the USA and, in general, with the negotiations concerning free trade if Europe continues to stand by what is, in my view, an unscientific ban on imports of hormone-treated meat?"
"In response to that question, you will be aware that the precautionary principle operates in circumstances where there is either no scientific evidence available or where the evidence that is available is uncertain in character."
"That is not the situation here."
"The report that I referred to, that was published by the SCVPH in April this year, specifically identified that there were residues of one of the six particular hormones that were being checked for - that is, 17 beta-estradion."
"That particular hormone is found in 80% of the tests that have been carried out."
"This particular hormone is - as described by the committee - clearly a carcinogen."
"Having regard to these circumstances it is believed that the lifting of the ban at this stage would be premature."
"Accordingly, having regard to what I said earlier about the application of the precautionary principle, it seems to me that it would be inappropriate to apply that principle because there is clear evidence available to us from the report from the SCVPH."
"In relation to our negotiations with the WTO, this issue will have to be addressed."
"There has been United States representation on the committee that conducted the examinations."
"That will be stressed to the US negotiators. This is an important issue."
"It is one that has to be addressed between the United States and the European Union."
"One would hope that it would be addressed in an amicable and non-confrontational manner."
"Hopefully that will be done during the WTO negotiation period."
"I would like firstly to welcome the Commissioner' s response but also to push him a little."
"What he said in relation to beef is that free trade is important, but that the health of the consumers should come first and free trade second."
"Will he also reassure us that he will take that attitude in Seattle When we look at the WTO negotiations it often appears that the health of consumers and others is subordinated to the free-trade aspect."
"Both are important, but health is a key issue."
"As you say, both issues are important."
"But in his presentation to Parliament this morning, President Prodi identified both health and food safety as being of primary importance and made it clear that they take precedence over trade."
"However, that is not to say that trade considerations are not important - they are."
"That is the challenge facing the negotiators from the United States and the European Union: to solve the problem."
"It should be solved in a manner that surely can, and hopefully will, accommodate both considerations."
">Questions to Mrs Reding"
"Question No 33 by (H-0463/99):"
"Subject: Availability of the Official Journal Members of the public are not particularly well aware of their rights and should be entitled to receive information about legislation, since it is they who finance it."
"The EU' s Official Journal (OJ), which provides information about EU legislation, is published in an edition of 20,000 copies for 380 million people - is it any wonder, therefore, that the information is poorly distributed?"
"A single copy of the OJ on the Internet would substantially increase access to the information and should be made a requirement under a Free Information Act for the year 2000."
"Will the Commission endeavour, within the next two years, to ensure that there is free access to the entire Official Journal on the Internet?"
"The concerns expressed by Mrs Cederschiöld are shared by the Commission, so much so that the Eurlex system, set up by the Publications Office in April 1998, already deals with it."
"This service offers free access and coverage of the Official Journal for 45 days."
"After this period, texts concerning legislation are stored on the Celex documentary database, which is also accessible via the Internet, but this must be paid for."
"This also contains the Treaties, current legislation, bills in preparation and recent judicial cases."
"As you can see, Mr President, the Commission has taken the initiative in this matter."
"I can only repeat what I have already said."
"All the information that the Commission provides for the public via the Internet is absolutely free."
"There is no cost to the user."
"Of course, installing the Internet itself involves costs, but the Commission cannot supply every citizen with free Internet access so that they can then have free access to information."
"What counts and what is important is that all of the Commission' s official documents are accessible at no charge."
"Moreover, we also have the Europa site."
"Access to this site is also free on the Internet and it is consulted, by the way, by millions of citizens every month."
"As you see, we have already set in place the opportunity to use modern forms of media."
"I would also like to tell you Mrs Cederschiöld, that the Commission obviously wants to expand access to the Internet across all strata of society."
"For example, as the person responsible for education within the Commission, I have already looked at the question, with the Ministers for Education, of how we can ensure that as many young people, as many schools as possible, have Internet access."
"I know that in Nordic countries, it is relatively easy to set up this access, but this is not true for other countries in the Union."
"We must also reach a balance within the Union where Internet access is concerned."
"So, I take what you say extremely seriously."
"Question No 34 by (H-0469/99):"
"Subject: Commission's plans for combating drug abuse and preventing the use of drugs in sport The World Championships in Seville turned the spotlight once more on the issue of drug-use among top sportsmen."
"The use of drugs among top sportsmen may entail greater tolerance of the use of drugs among young people."
"Does the Commission intend to take measures to prevent drug abuse in sport in connection with its efforts to combat drug-use or in other contexts?"
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I am grateful for your answer to the effect that this matter has now been placed on the Commission' s agenda or, more accurately, placed higher up on the agenda."
"Work which prevents young people from beginning to use drugs is a priority area in the fight against drug abuse."
"If we look at sport, we see that this is an activity which attracts a lot of young people."
"Sports stars are often role models for young people."
"It is therefore important that, in this area too, we should actively combat drug abuse."
"Because I think that sport has a responsibility to help prevent drug taking within sport, I wonder if plans are being made for some type of collaboration with the sports bodies in Europe with a view to tackling the problem, which has become worse in recent years."
"Is the Commission planning to cooperate with the sports bodies?"
"Mr Andersson is very aware of the problems inherent in the fight against drug taking in sport."
"I would like to thank him for his intervention and I would like to discuss this matter with him, as he seems to have information which I would like to make use of."
"Let us move on to the specific issue here."
"As you know, Mr Andersson, the Treaty of Amsterdam clearly specifies that there must be a European body competent in this area, but we must also take subsidiarity into account as well as the autonomy of the world of sport."
"The measures that I would like to present to the College and to Parliament will therefore be measures which have the assent of Member States and which will guarantee this autonomy."
"I am also responsible for youth programmes."
"I have already discussed this with colleagues who are dealing with these matters in Parliament."
"I am very aware of the importance of prevention through the work of youth movements."
"Our studies have shown that in most cases, sporting organisations are the ones that young people value most."
"I think then that through these young people, and through sport, we can convey many ideas on cooperation, attitudes of fair play and the elimination of racism and xenophobia."
"Consequently, moving in these directions - fair play, sport and healthy young people - youth programmes will be taking the direction that you would like to see, Mr Andersson."
"Mr Andersson' s question seems very interesting to me, and having been a professional sportsman for the last 20 years, drug taking in sport is an issue which interests me and worries me very much."
"As has just been said, in February this year the World Conference on Drug Taking in Sport took place and it was decided that an international agency to combat drug taking in sport would be created."
"Eight months have passed and this agency has still not been established because one very important issue has not been decided, which is where the agency will be based."
"The European Union does not want the agency to be based in Lausanne, at the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee but, nevertheless, wants to have it in one of the Member States of the European Union."
"Possible locations such as Madrid, Bonn, Luxembourg, Lille, Vienna, Lisbon or London are under discussion."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, in order to achieve our aim, it would not be better to unite all our forces and, with the backing of all the Member States, present a single European candidate as a seat for this agency."
"Commissioner, as a doctor specialising in sports medicine, the issue of drug taking worries me enormously."
"But I would like to ask you one thing. Is the Commission aware of the powerful influence of the links between sport, the media and those with large financial and advertising interests, which induce elite sportsmen to use drugs?"
"Has the Commission established, with the International Olympic Committee, a timetable with regard to the issue of drug taking in sport?"
"I am quite surprised - pleasantly surprised - that so many Members of this Parliament are interested in the fight against drug taking in sport, and are so knowledgeable about it."
"I propose then, that we put all this information together and discuss ways in which we can improve the programmes for fighting drug taking in sport."
"I agree with you, Mr Bautista Ojeda: top sportsmen and women who are not ""clean"" , who use substances from outside sport in order to win, do set a bad example."
"I think that the necessary steps have to be taken as quickly as possible."
"We will be taking these steps at a world-wide level in conjunction with the Olympic Committee; indeed, it is together with this body that we will take our seat within the world-wide agency on drug taking in sport if, as I hope, the decisions go the way we would like them to."
"In parallel though, we must develop a programme for fighting drug taking in sport across the fifteen Member States which the Member States themselves will have to set in action."
"With your permission, Mr President, I shall therefore ask all Members of this Parliament who are interested in this matter to come and meet me so that together we can work out the best way of wiping out this plague."
"Question No 35 by (H-0478/99):"
"Subject: Raising the awareness of European citizens concerning the EU The EU spends vast sums of money printing thousands of information leaflets on its activities."
"This involves, inter alia, using huge amounts of paper, which is not exactly environmentally friendly."
"The low turnout at the last European elections showed, however, that the message about the EU and its aims is not getting through sufficiently to European citizens."
"Will the Commission look into the use of more modern means of communication for this purpose? For example, it could purchase between three and five minutes of advertising time daily between the news bulletin and the sports part of peak-time news on the TV channel with the largest viewing figures in each Member State, so as to put across in simple form the achievements and aspirations of the EU, thereby targeting the broad sections of the population who do not normally read anything, least of all our publications?"
"Questions to Mr Patten"
"The budget allocated to information activities is very small."
"Publications account for only 0.005% of the total EC budget - much less than average Member State expenditure on similar information products."
"The Commission is aware of the scope and possibilities of different communication media and carries out twice - yearly public opinion surveys with two questions, on how citizens are informed about EU affairs and how they would prefer to be informed."
"Now it is interesting to see that TV is used and preferred by over 90% of citizens, so improving and increasing audiovisual information has been a priority for several years."
"Free dissemination of our own production material via the Europe by Satellite service and cooperation with Euronews have proved effective measures, but we cannot go further than this free availability."
"It is up to the communication media whether or not to use this material."
"Publications follow as the second choice of medium."
"For general information, print is still predominant as Eurobarometer shows that access to the Internet is not yet general in most Member States, especially not for the public at large."
"Concerning the purchase of public air time, a wide variety of attitudes exist amongst Member States."
"In some of them, free institutional primetime is available."
"This is very positive and we can profit from it."
"In others, this is perceived as unacceptable political interference."
"You see that respect for cultural values and preferences calls for strict application of the principle of subsidiarity, so we have also to respect cultural differences concerning the information system in the different Member States."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner, whom I welcome in her new capacity to the European Parliament, of which she was once a Member before she was nominated Commissioner."
"I am aware of the efforts being made by your domain and I am aware of the restrictions on the budget."
"I also know that you consider television to be the most effective medium for reaching a wider audience."
"However, I am very mindful of the fact that the problem of lack of information and communication is much more widespread as far as the public at large is concerned, proved by the low turn-out in the European elections."
"The abstention was a spur for this weak European Union to inform and to convince people of its significance."
"People do not know what the problems are and they do not know of Parliament' s efforts, what Parliament is, what it does and why citizen participation is important."
"I suggested advertising on prime time television and, indeed, I asked if the Commission would be prepared to choose the time between the general news bulletin and the sports section of peak-time news because the public at large tend not to change channels at these times."
"I regret that time does not permit me to continue but I am at the Commissioner' s disposal to develop my argument verbally to her in person."
"I understand why you are asking these questions Mr Marinos, because you are yourself a highly regarded professional in the media industry, and you know what works and what does not work."
"If we want to operate in the different Member States, we must respect the letter and also the spirit of national prerogatives."
"We have tried in the past, during election campaigns, to have the Commission and Parliament conduct these campaigns jointly."
"The Commission cannot, of course, take a political stance, but it can take a stance on the information available to the citizen."
"I think that in the future, in order to reach the wider public as efficiently as possible, the Commission and Parliament should join in their efforts to inform the public of what is happening in Europe."
"I would not want this information to be mere propaganda, but I feel strongly that it should be balanced and that it provides answers to our citizens' questions."
"I know that this is much more easily said than done."
"As you will see from the new flow chart of my Directorate-General, this a citizen' s service, which really puts itself at the service of the citizen, and which aims to answer all the questions and meet all the requests citizens may put to it. It does this by using, as Mrs Cederschiöld requested, the most up-to-date technology, but also falls back on the printed word when no other means can be used."
"If we can, in conjunction with the Member States and Parliament, make use of television, we will certainly do so, but we cannot set up access to that medium if it is not felt that there is a demand for access to it."
"Annex II, Conduct of Question Time under Rule 43, part B (3) states that the time limit of 30 seconds should not be exceeded."
"I have now suffered because my question was No 36, a very important question dealing with people in my constituency, and I feel that people should keep to the timescale."
"It is unfair!"
"This was my first time to speak in this Chamber and I have now lost that opportunity."
"I am very grateful for your interpretation but it is no doubt due to the fact that it is the first time that you have spoken in this Chamber."
"This is the second time that I have presided in this Chamber, I have sought information and there is a Bureau doctrine which Mr David Martin should be very aware of, for example, on the time of the intervention, which has been extended to one minute."
"Mr President, Mrs Reding, thank you for your explanations."
"I believe that increasing the awareness of the citizens of Europe is of special importance for the next elections."
"Is it conceivable to create our own program in the field of 'learning entertainment' ?"
"Young people are clearly very enthusiastic about the Internet, and if we could offer the enjoyment of learning in this area with various possibilities such as prize competitions, trips to Brussels, etc. and could encourage schoolchildren to use our program on the Internet, would that not be one goal for the next five years?"
"Mr President, Mr Rübig has spoken from the heart."
"I do see the significance of a policy on information, also after my experience of many years as a Member of the European Parliament, not just in the ""higher spheres"" but also among very young people, among children, who absorb information like a sponge and utilise it throughout their lives."
"I shall certainly strive to ensure that the programmes, the cultural programmes and the youth programmes are applied not just to high schools and universities, but that cooperation between schools is promoted in primary schools too."
"For this, we do not actually need long journeys, as these cost a great deal of money and cannot be paid for."
"But different schoolrooms in different countries can be connected via the Internet."
"This is an idea which is close to my heart and which I will willingly take up."
"I heard what the Commission had to say about Europe by Satellite, but is the Commissioner satisfied that local and regional television stations across Europe are adequately aware of their rights of access to Europe by Satellite?"
"Can they do it easily technically?"
"I find that in the south of England that is not the case."
"Is there anything the Commissioner can promise to do about making sure that local television stations get easy access to the Europe by Satellite server?"
"The honourable Member has given me a very important cue."
"It is true that it is not only the big channels which are important."
"The small routes - the regional TV stations and the regional newspapers, the regional newsmen and - women are also of paramount importance."
"I do not know whether it is technically possible or not."
"If not there should certainly be a solution to that."
"I would very much like you to send my services information about this lack of communication so that we can find a solution as quickly as possible."
"Thank you very much for all your interventions, Mrs Reding."
"Questions 36 to 39 will be replied to in writing."
"Question No 40 by (H-0494/99):"
"Subject: Holding of a first annual EU­India Summit In its report A4-0066/99 of 12.3.1999 on the Commission Communication on the EU-India Enhanced Partnership, Parliament 'calls on the Council and Commission to propose to the Indian Government the holding of an annual Euro-India Summit' ."
"Furthermore, during the debate which preceded the vote on the report the Commission, represented by Mr Monti (Commissioner), expressed its support for such an initiative."
"Can the Commission say what action (including representations to the Council and the Indian Government) it has already taken or intends to take with a view to holding the first of such Summits in the very near future?"
"In more general terms, does the Commission not think - in the light of the various crises and the growing threats posed by the many anti-democratic regimes in the region - that the development of a strategic, political, economic and cultural relationship between the EU and India (the world' s largest democracy) would make it possible, within a single policy, for the wish to establish special political and economic relations with countries governed by the principles and rules of democracy and constitutional government to be combined, in a significant and exemplary fashion, with clearly conceived trade and economic interests?"
"I am aware of the contents of the European Parliament' s report on the Commission' s communication on India, and I am aware also of the honourable Member' s interest in the country, which I fully share."
"When I met Mr Jaswant Singh, the Indian Foreign Minister, last week on 30 September, I emphasised to him that I intend the EU-India relationship to be a very close one reflecting India' s strategic and economic importance."
"During our meeting Mr Singh invited me to visit India, and I hope to do so early next year."
"I intend to push for full implementation of the Commission communication taking into account Parliament' s recommendations."
"I am pleased that a number of joint working groups have already met, or will shortly do so, on topics as diverse as consular affairs and environmental issues."
"In addition, we have regular meetings of ministers and senior officials."
"As for the specific proposal for an annual EU-India summit, this is a decision for the Council."
"I personally believe that we should measure the success of the EU-India relationship through substance, not summits, of which - and I hope the honourable Member will not think this too undiplomatic of me - in general, I believe there are too many."
"Thank you very much for your answer, Commissioner."
"I see that you intend to strengthen greatly relations between the Union and India."
"I think, and here I differ a little from you as far as the last part of your answer is concerned, that there must be a counterbalance to the powerful signals given out by the Union to other parts of the world, which are nevertheless close to India, by organising events such as Summits."
"European entrepreneurs, the European political classes and European public opinion, just like those in India, need a clear sign which only a Summit can provide."
"I would like to ask you then, to determine the views of the Members of the Council, to see if one or more Member States might be interested in organising this kind of Summit quite quickly."
"I want to stress straight away that I totally share the honourable Member' s enthusiasm for developing our relationship with India."
"It is not just that we have a very close economic and trade relationship with India; it is not just that we have a relationship based on historical ties."
"It is much more important than that."
"We have a relationship based on shared values."
"In the last few days there has been a fair and free election taking place in India involving an electorate which is larger than the electorate of North America and the European Union put together."
"India is the largest democracy in the world and has coped with some horrendous problems precisely because it is a free society living under the rule of law, with a fully developed civil society."
"I accept that we have to develop that relationship."
"We have to encourage India' s relationship with the other members of the SAARC, of its regional body."
"I will certainly discuss the Member' s proposal with my Indian colleague and with Member Governments."
"But I do not accept that the only way you can demonstrate the importance of a relationship is through a summit."
"Sometimes there is a danger of them being ceremonial occasions."
"What we really want with India is a lot more - I will not say beef - muscle in our relationship and a lot more substance to it."
"That I am determined to do."
"If we keep putting hormones in beef we will get a lot more muscle in our beef as well."
"The point I want to make to the Commissioner is this."
"While I welcome the question and the answer he has given - I agree with him that too much emphasis on summits is not necessarily a healthy thing - I wonder whether he will consider expanding the India/EU dialogue into an EU/Indian sub-continent dialogue?"
"That is a role that the EU could usefully play - of bringing the Indians, Pakistanis or Bangladeshis, etc. together in that sub-continent to discuss their common problems and, in a sense, act as an external honest broker in dealings between the countries in that sub-region."
"In New York about ten days ago I had an extremely good meeting, together with the Presidency and the Portuguese Foreign Minister; with the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation under their splendid Chairman, the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, who happens, incidentally to have been at my college."
"He has done a terrific job in revitalising that organisation."
"We are involved in trying to support it, not least administratively, as it tries to develop free trade agreements in the region."
"I accept what the Member said."
"There is an important role to play in helping to sustain those regional relationships."
"After all, we do have a certain experience in the importance of regional arrangements to demonstrate here in Europe."
"Question No 41 by (H-0496/99):"
"Subject: Joint service for Community aid to non-member countries There is not time to regale the Commission with the litany of problems being experienced by both North and South NGOs in receiving funding from projects already agreed by the former DG VIII."
"Obviously, the new Commissioner responsible for the SCR (Joint Service for the Management of Community Aid to Non-Member Countries) has been handed an unenviable legacy and I am sure he will be intending to institute reform in this area."
"However, I would like to know what the Commission intends to do about the immediate situation and the real tragedies that are occurring because of the immense backlog that has now been built up?"
"The honourable Member is absolutely right to highlight this important issue."
"As the House is aware, one of my top priorities is to build on recent improvements in the management of European Union external aid programmes."
"In this context I should mention the significant personal contribution of Philippe Soubestre Director-General of the SCR."
"We have a huge responsibility to the developing countries to ensure effective and timely use of European Union aid."
"This is vital for the credibility of our policies and for the wider international image of the EU."
"The honourable Member will know that the Commission' s services have recently made significant progress in eliminating the backlog of late payments on external aid contracts."
"The vast majority of valid invoices are now being paid within the normal deadline of 6 000 days - I beg your pardon 60 days."
"This applies, in particular, to the some 5 000 current projects with NGOs, financed either from the budget or via our delegations from the EDF."
"It is an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life that we never have as much money as we would like."
"This is particularly true in development aid where the available resources are never enough."
"This means, for example, that we have requests for additional support for existing co-financing projects with NGOs amounting to twice the available budget in 1999."
"This may create an impression of delays, but in reality it is an unavoidable consequence of pressure on limited resources."
"Finally, I draw the honourable Member' s attention to recent changes to the requirements for NGOs to provide bank guarantees, which should make it easier to obtain advance payments up to EUR 1 million."
"I could list a number of NGOs and others who have, in fact, waited 6 000 days and are still waiting."
"For example there are landmine clearance NGOs and 'Article 19' - which the Commissioner will be aware of in the UK - who have had problems with lost documents, and with a whole litany of complete chaos."
"Is the Commissioner aware of the huge tensions which exist between the external DGs and the SCR now because of the confusion about tasks, because of the staffing difficulties that DG VIII has, for instance, because of their staff being moved to the SCR?"
"There are underlying tensions which your answer does not address."
"The answer is somewhat complacent about a real crisis situation in the SCR."
"That is added to by the fact that the RELEX DGs are being reorganised."
"That causes even more chaos for the very essential work that we are engaged in with countries outside the European Union."
"I think the honourable Member, who knows as much if not more about the NGO sector as anyone does, recognises the priority we have given to reforming and supporting the SCR."
"We need to recognise as well the problem they inherited - a backlog of 19 billion of commitments, a backlog of 14 500 projects."
"They have been making progress in dealing with those issues and I want to help them with that and not further damage their morale or that of the DGs."
"It is therefore important to understand the difference that exists at the moment between problems caused by applications which cannot be met because of budgetary considerations and the processing of commitments, where the situation, despite difficulties at the beginning of the year, has improved; and it is worth remembering that some of the problems at the beginning of the year had a little to do with the lateness of receipt of commitments in December."
"We all have to work together to try to ensure that the European Union gets the assistance it has promised to those to whom those promises have been made as rapidly and as effectively as possible."
"I am aware of the gap between rhetoric and reality."
"I want to ensure that those who are responsible for managing these funds have all the support from me and from others that they deserve; and I know very well that is an objective which the honourable Member shares too."
"So, I take the question as pressing me to do more but I can assure the honourable Member that I am intent in moving in the same direction as she would like."
"Question No 42 by (H-0516/99):"
"Subject: Commission action to restrict arms transfers and promote disarmament Bearing in mind the forthcoming first annual report on the operation of the European Code of Conduct on arms transfers of 1998, would the Commissioner for External Relations indicate whether he would support an extension of Commission competence to include arms trade issues at the next intergovernmental conference?"
"What action has the Commission taken and what does it intend to take in the future in order to implement the Joint Action and Resolution on Small Arms adopted by the Council and the subsequent EU Development Council Resolution on Small Arms?"
". Member States have up to now on the basis of Article 296 (former Article 223) exempted trade in arms from the scope of application of European Community Treaty rules."
"There has therefore not been any scope for Community action in this field."
"Arms trade is currently dealt with in the context of the common foreign and security policy, with which the Commission is of course fully associated."
"The new Commission will have to consider whether to seek a modification of Article 296 at the next Intergovernmental Conference, taking into account the Conference agenda as well as progress on a new policy on arms exports."
"Following the adoption of the Joint Action, the Commission participated in a series of troika demarches aimed at presenting the Joint Action to all governments and major regional organisations and gaining their political support for its goals."
"A number of specific projects are currently under way."
"The European Union is contributing EUR 500 000 to the UNDP Weapons in Exchange for Development pilot project in the Gramsh district of Albania, which, if successful, might be expanded to other districts."
"A fact-finding mission to Cambodia has put forward a series of recommendations for practical cooperation on the basis of the Joint Action."
"More projects are currently under consideration in the Council."
"I thank the Commissioner for his response."
"I regard consideration as positive and urge him to bring that forward."
"We know that two billion a day is still being spent on the military and on arms sales - 40% of it from Europe."
"All of us therefore have to be more effective in curbing this trade."
"I congratulate the Commission on what it has done in terms of implementing the Joint Action on small arms - the project in Albania."
"I urge the Commissioner to implement the project in Cambodia as soon as possible, and other projects which I know he and his services are considering in a former Soviet Republic and in a South African country."
"I hope that when we look at the review that is taking place in the Council at the moment, we will all be able to contribute in a way that will curb the arms trade and enable more money to be made available for development."
"The honourable Member will know what the Commission' s traditional view has been on the trade in arms."
"He may also have read recently an extremely interesting column in the Times newspaper on the arms trade by Simon Jenkins, which I thought made some extremely important and valuable points."
"As the honourable Member knows, we have had discussions with the United States and Canada about small arms, and I very much hope that we can continue to make progress with specific projects in the way he has suggested."
"I take it from the Commissioner' s answer that he is in favour of regulating the arms trade."
"What is his response to the brokering of arms which is still going on?"
"Recently arms travelled from Russia via Antwerp to the war in Eritrea."
"Would he like to see a tightening up of the regulations to ensure that kind of gun-running cannot occur?"
"."
"Absolutely! As an ex-development minister I formed very strong views about expenditure on armaments as opposed to expenditure on educating people and improving their health."
"The honourable Member knows better than I, though I have some experience of it as well, the damage which has been done to Africa by the illegal movement of arms."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together."
"Question No 43 by (H-0517/99):"
"Subject: East Timor What assistance does the Commission propose to offer to help with the reconstruction of East Timor?"
"Question No 44 by (H-0543/99):"
"Subject: East Timor Will the Commission state what action it intends to take on behalf of the European Union with regard to East Timor?"
"The Commission considers humanitarian aid as the most urgent priority in East Timor."
"The ECHO services of the Commission are relaunching their temporarily halted humanitarian aid projects worth EUR 2 million."
"In addition to that, a series of aid projects worth EUR 3 million is about to be started."
"If necessary, more money - and I want to emphasise this point - can be made available for humanitarian purposes."
"As to rehabilitation programmes, the Commission is in close contact with the World Bank and other leading donors to develop a coherent scheme, thus avoiding the overlapping of donor contributions."
"In an interim period a UN administration will be put in place."
"The Commission obviously intends to participate actively in this phase."
"A procedure has begun to make a significant contribution to UNAMET with a view to help establish administrative structures."
"Mr President, I know that the Commissioner, whom I would like to take this opportunity to greet, has several times expressed his solidarity with the people of East Timor quite emphatically, but I would like to know if there is in fact a programme of aid for the reconstruction of East Timor yet."
"This programme is extremely urgent, and I would like to know if it has been quantified and how much the Commission foresees spending on this plan."
". If I may say so to the honourable Member who in the course of his distinguished career has gained much more experience of this issue I imagine than almost anyone else in this Chamber, there seem to me to be three stages to our assistance."
"Firstly there is the immediate humanitarian assistance which is essential, not least given the systematic trashing of infrastructure and transport by the militias in East Timor."
"Secondly - and this is immensely important and I discussed it at the UN with the Secretary-General and the deputy Secretary-General - there is the question of funding civil administration in the short and medium-term."
"There has not been any indigenous civil administration in East Timor for as long as anybody can remember."
"It is going to be costly to run services in East Timor."
"That is why I mentioned as I did contributions to UNAMET."
"I hope that we will be able to help there and I hope that Member States will be able to help as Portugal has already indicated it will."
"Thirdly, there is the question of longer term development assistance and longer term reconstruction help."
"We are discussing that with the World Bank."
"There was a donors' meeting on 29 September."
"There is going to be a subsequent mission to look at what is required."
"I want to see that we do what is best for East Timor, not just pluck figures out of the air."
"I can assure the honourable Member that is not a way of excusing ourselves from the obligations we have to that part of the world, to that soon-to-be country."
"For years every foreign minister from Europe and North America who has been to Indonesia has had a speaking note about East Timor."
"Now there is an obligation on us to put our money where our mouths have been all those years."
"I hope that we will do it in a way which is sensible and effective and focused and targeted on real needs."
"Question No 48 by (H-0467/99):"
"Subject: Cultivation of flax Does the Commission consider it reprehensible that high-ranking officials at the Ministry of Agriculture should have encouraged practices reminiscent of 'premium hunting' with regard to the cultivation of flax, promoted them through administrative channels, and received perks for themselves and their families as a result?"
"What information with regard to Spain and the EU can the Commission provide on developments in the cultivation of flax, the receipt of subsidies, the monitoring of requirements to guard against fraud, the resultant processing for marketing purposes, and the providential fires at some processing plants?"
"What measures does it intend to implement to protect income aid for farmers under the CAP and shield such aid from fraudulent practices which tarnish the sector' s image and undermine its impact?"
"Mr President, as regards flax cultivation and the problems in Spain in connection with this, the Commission has already, within the framework of the prices package for the year 1996, proposed to the Council that a guaranteed ceiling be established for flax cultivation and, over and above that, that flax - with the exception of flax pulled in the traditional way - be assigned a lower level of support."
"The Council should have adopted a position on this proposal by the end of 1996."
"The Council did not endorse this proposal."
"As a result, the Commission sought to implement other measures so that premium hunting - as it is termed generally - in this area could be curtailed."
"Here, I would like to stress particularly that we introduced compulsory supply contracts between the producers and the primary processors, and we then also introduced the principle that every primary processor requires a licence."
"Finally, in addition, we also introduced a processing commitment for the harvested flax and a minimum yield."
"Besides this, the system of explanations of sowing areas, controls and sanctions was reinforced."
"On top of that, within the framework of the EAGGF statement of accounts for the budget years 1994 and 1995, the Commission services cut back the expenditure declared by Spain by 10% due to deficiencies in the checking system."
"Years 1996 to 1998 are currently undergoing inspection."
"The inspection has not yet been completed."
"We will then see what amounts can be paid out definitively."
"In addition, in February of this year, we asked the Spanish authorities to supervise the conditions of cultivation, harvesting and processing particularly carefully in order to prevent premium hunting."
"Just today I learnt from the newspapers that currently only one region in Spain has acted accordingly in this area and has withdrawn support from various producers."
"We all know, then, that in the Spanish Parliament a committee of inquiry was set up which has looked into these matters as well."
"On the part of the European Union, the anti-fraud office, OLAF, was commissioned to arrange for the Spanish judicial authorities to conduct investigations as to whether the Community aid for textile flax had been administered and monitored properly and whether incidents under assessment were to be noted as criminal offences."
"These investigations are still underway and are being monitored attentively by OLAF."
"But, over and above this, I would like to say in conclusion that we still see a need for fundamental rehabilitation in this area and that the Commission, by the end of this year, will therefore be putting forward a proposal for a comprehensive reform of the aid system and the market organisation system in the area of flax and hemp."
"Let us try to redirect the situation because your reply has also been very general."
"You will know, Commissioner, that the headlines of the entire Spanish press, and not just the largest newspapers, today feature the serious irregularities uncovered by the inspection of the Agriculture Department of the Council of Communities of Castilla la Mancha in the flax processing companies which were in dispute and have been examined and analysed by the Committee which has been mentioned."
"Since you know about this, I would like to ask you what information you can provide regarding the investigation, which I imagine you are also carrying out in your Directorate-General, with regard to flax and premium hunters."
"Do you not have any information of your own?"
"Will you take account of the information supplied by the Agriculture Department which I have mentioned?"
"If the Agriculture Department inspection indicates evidence of serious irregularities in the flax processing companies, should the corresponding subsidies be paid or should we await the conclusion of your Directorate-General?"
"Commissioner, the worst possible approach would be to try to prematurely close an investigation such as this flax investigation, which involves senior members of the Spanish Government in relation to the illegal payment of subsidies and fraud in this aid for the flax processing industry."
"There could be nothing worse than to close our eyes to it."
"Mr President, Mr Izquierdo Collado, I would like once again to remind you that I have given very concrete answers, both to the problem and also to the steps which the Commission has taken with regard to it."
"If today it is reported in the newspapers here that now the competent authorities in individual regions are starting to take action, then this is only welcome and desirable, and actually complies with the request we made to these authorities as early as February."
"Furthermore, I must point out to you that, insofar as it concerns suspicious circumstances which could possibly involve a criminal act, we only have the possibility of cooperating with the Spanish legal authorities on the basis of OLAF."
"This is an area where absolute confidentiality must be guaranteed and so, because of the legal requirements we are subject to here, I cannot name specific names or cases."
"I would also like to point out to you that at the moment a number of years are being investigated by the EAGGF, and if deficiencies in the running of the market organisation system are determined in these spot check investigations, then Spain must be prepared for the fact that a lump sum penalty may be incurred, i.e. that the support payments already paid out are reduced in retrospect by a lump sum - according to the gravity of these deficiencies."
"Commissioner, this question is part of the electoral stunt organised by the Spanish Socialist Worker' s Party in relation to the recent European election campaign in order to attack the then head of the Popular Party list, Loyola de Palacio."
"In any case, Commissioner, despite all of this, it was this list that received the most votes."
"At first they talked about privileged information, but the announcement of aid is published through the European Union, Spain and the regional governments."
"Then they talked of an organised system for the payment of subsidies, but the family relatives of the senior members of the Agriculture Department who received subsidies already cultivated flax before those people took their senior posts, before Mrs de Palacio became Minister for Agriculture and even before Mrs de Palacio knew them."
"They then tried to accuse the then Minister of Agriculture of a supposed fraud in the award of subsidies, but responsibility for the control and payment of CAP subsidies falls to the regional governments, in accordance with the distribution of competences of the Spanish State."
"Good evidence for this can be found in the a posteriori inspections carried out after the election campaign by the Socialist Government of the autonomous community in which this fraud took place."
"Mrs Ayuso, I must remind you that you have used up one minute and 36 seconds and that furthermore you have not asked any question."
"There are various procedural motions."
"I expected this to be the case although, in my capacity as President, I have to behave as if I were, for example, Finnish, which is the Member State which holds the Presidency of the Union for this six-month period."
"Naturally, I do not want to enter into a discussion of intent, not even when the issues relate to my own constituency."
"But I must remind all of you that you must ask questions of the Commission and that they must relate to the matter under debate."
"There are various procedural motions and I am going to offer the floor to the person who asked the question, who is Mr Izquierdo Collado."
"I would ask him not to spend more than one minute in tabling the procedural motion."
"Mr President, I would simply like to point out that, once again, groups in this Parliament and Members, specifically of the Spanish Popular Party, are manipulating Question Time and supplementary questions to the Commission."
"It is truly incredible that this behaviour should reoccur and that every time there is a question from a Member, especially a Socialist, the Popular Party uses Question Time to hide the shame of its government and does not ask the corresponding Commissioner a question."
"This should cease to happen in this Parliament and I would ask that the Presidency, when Members from the Popular Party are seen to behave in this manner, not to wait until the end of the intervention."
"We are not currently sitting in the Spanish Parliament, nor in the Assembly of the region in question, but in the European Parliament, and I cannot prejudge nor anticipate any principle or respect for freedom of expression of the Members."
"I have allowed you a procedural motion in which you have also digressed and indulged in name-calling."
"I would ask you to respect the dignity of this Parliament."
"This goes for all of us, whether Tyrians or Trojans, although I am not sure whether there are any Tyrians and Trojans here."
"I would like to ask a follow-up question to question no. 48."
"The Commissioner made an interesting point."
"He intends to produce new proposals at the end of the year concerning flax cultivation in Europe."
"That being the case, I would like to ask if these will include proposals relating to other fibre plants cultivated in Europe, such as hemp and so on and so forth."
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to specify that as far as I am concerned there are no Socialist or other types of question."
"As far as I am concerned there are only questions which I am called upon to answer."
"Well, just such a clear question has been asked by Mr Mulder."
"Perhaps just now something was lost in translation. I already mentioned in my first contribution that this proposal would be presented in any case by the end of this year and, secondly, that this proposal would deal with both flax and hemp."
"Question No 49 by (H-0479/99):"
"Subject: Possible abolition of the Directorate-General for Fisheries Can the Commission state whether it is the case that, as has been reported in the media and in contradiction to the undertaking given by Mr Franz Fischler, the Commissioner for Agriculture, at his hearing before Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, the Commission has decided to abolish its Directorate-General for Fisheries (DG XIV) - a measure which would clearly be contrary to the interests of the Community' s fisheries industries and, in particular, the interests of fisheries-dependent regions such as Galicia?"
"Does the Commission intend to reverse this damaging decision, as those interests require?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can answer this question very briefly."
"At its meeting on 18 September, the Commission decided the guidelines for the re-organisation of its departments."
"This was previously announced - on 9 July - by President Prodi."
"According to these guidelines, the Directorate-General for fisheries was furthermore set up."
"Thus this decision is also in accord with the explanation which I gave in my hearing to the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries on 30 October."
"Over and above that, the organisational plan for the Directorate-General for Fisheries was adopted by the Commission on 29 September."
"There is therefore also a valid organisation chart for this Directorate-General."
"Finally, at the same meeting, a new director-general for the Directorate-General for Fisheries was also decided, and so it is Mr Smidt who will, in future, be the director-general in charge of the Directorate-General for Fisheries."
"This, I hope, clearly establishes that the Directorate-General for Fisheries does exist."
"I would like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your decision to keep the Directorate-General for Fisheries."
"For my part, I retained my question in order to have the opportunity to hear in this plenary sitting, the ratification of your commitment to the Committee on Fisheries."
"I hope, as I am sure you do, that this decision will prove useful to the development of an economic and social sector which is fundamental for the people of Europe who make a living from fishing, and for European citizens' food in general."
"Mr President, unfortunately, I was unable to find any question in Mr Nogueira Román' s comment."
"So I am unable to give an answer."
"I was following the question in Portuguese instead of Spanish and I am not sure whether there really was a question."
"I did not want to interpret Mr Nogueira' s words."
"There is a procedural motion from Mr Knörr, which I imagine will be the last intervention concerning the procedural problems of this Question Time."
"I am new in this Parliament and I regret that the first question whose reply I was expecting to hear in this Parliament cannot be replied to orally due to lack of time, but I doubly regret the fact that this is due to the attitude of some people who, by raising questions in this House which, in my opinion, do not belong here, deprive us of the pleasure of hearing Mr Fischler speak today of the problem of our fishermen' s daily bread, for example."
"I share your point of view, and the question which was not going to be answered orally, due to the over-running of the previous one, has been included in the end. It was Mr Nogueira' s question."
"I thank Mr Fischler for his response to all of the questions."
"Questions 50 to 86 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m.)"
"Madam President, I am grateful to you for giving me the floor."
"I want to bring to your attention and that of Parliament the tragic and terrible rail crash that took place yesterday just outside Paddington Station in London, in which two trains collided."
"At the moment the death toll is at 26 but is expected to rise - maybe even to double that - and there are many people seriously injured."
"I therefore request, President, that you write a letter on behalf of the European Parliament to the British Prime Minister expressing our shock and horror at the magnitude of this terrible disaster, asking him to and pass on our deepest sympathy to the relatives of those people who have died, and also to the relatives of those who remain seriously injured in the hope that they make a full recovery."
"I would be grateful, in light of this terrible rail disaster, if you would do that."
"Yes, Mr Simpson, I have myself heard the news of this terrible accident and I agree completely with your suggestion."
"I shall write on behalf of all of us, if you agree, to express our deepest sympathy to those who have suffered in this disaster."
"State of relations between Turkey and the EU"
"The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the state of relations between Turkey and the European Union."
"I have received 6 motions for resolution laid down pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, Members of the European Parliament, Turkey is, economically, socially and culturally, a key partner of the European Union."
"Turkey also has, and will have, an important role to play in maintaining peace and stability in our continent."
"This has once again been proven with the recent events in the Balkans."
"It is clear that the Union and Turkey need one another."
"The importance of that cooperation was underlined four years ago, when the Customs Union became effective."
"It is our belief that the Customs Union has benefited both sides."
"Last year, EU exports to Turkey accounted for more than half of Turkey' s total imports, and Turkey' s exports to the Union area in the same year accounted for approximately half of its total exports."
"In this connection, it is worth noting, however, that the financial and institutional cooperation, which was agreed when the Customs Union agreement was made, has not come about in the way that was planned."
"By virtue of the decisions made at Luxembourg in 1997 and Cardiff in 1998, Turkey is involved in the enlargement process."
"Turkey has had created for it, its own strategy for preparing for membership: the so-called European Strategy."
"This strategy involves both a broadening of cooperation in different areas, as well as financial cooperation."
"Finland, as the country holding the Presidency, is endeavouring to enhance the implementation of the European Strategy."
"Two proposals for a Regulation relating to financial cooperation in respect of the European Strategy are at present on the agenda in the European Parliament."
"It will be very difficult to implement the strategy fully without financing."
"As the country holding the Presidency, we appeal to Parliament to debate these regulations in a positive frame of mind, and as promptly as possible."
"As we all know, there was a tragic earthquake in Turkey in August."
"The damage the country suffered as a result, as well as the serious economic damage, underline even more the importance of financing."
"The Union is closely following the development of democracy in her partner in cooperation."
"There are serious failings with regard to human rights in Turkey, including the rights of minority groups."
"We hear all too frequently about, inter alia, restrictions on the freedom of speech. This is not in harmony with our European values."
"We have, however, noted with satisfaction a recent move on the part of the Turkish Government to implement democratic reforms and improve the situation regarding human rights."
"We also wish to encourage Turkey to continue on its path to reform."
"The OSCE Summit in Istanbul on 18 - 19 November will be an important opportunity for Turkey to show that it is trying to improve the situation with regard to generally accepted civil liberties."
"The European Union opposes the death penalty everywhere, and whatever the case."
"It is a common objective of the Union to abolish capital punishment everywhere in the world."
"Under Turkish legislation, it is still possible to pass and implement the death sentence."
"However, the death sentence has not been carried out in the country since 1984."
"We hope that Turkey will refrain from implementing the death sentence in cases where such a sentence has been passed - including the PKK leader, Abdullah Öçalan."
"We expect Turkey to remove the death sentence from its statutes entirely and continue with its moratorium until that time."
"In addition, we would like to remind everyone that non-implementation of the death penalty belongs to the common set of values of the Union, a Union whose membership Turkey has indicated it aspires to."
"Recently we have seen encouraging signs that relations between Turkey and Greece have improved."
"We hold in high regard the contribution that Greece has made to this development, and we consider the dialogue that has started between these countries to be a very positive step forward."
"It has been quite moving to see the genuine show of sympathy and solidarity in both Turkey and Greece, as a result of earthquakes in both countries."
"We hope that the positive climate that has recently developed will be a step towards a more lasting improvement in relations between the countries."
"Increased cooperation breeds trust, which can only lead to reinforced stability in the eastern Mediterranean and the whole of Europe."
"This is to our common advantage."
"Although the dialogue I mentioned awakens optimism in us, difficult questions remain."
"The European Union and the country holding the Presidency give their full support to UN efforts to achieve a lasting and just solution to the situation in Cyprus."
"This autumn we hope to make headway in finding a solution to a problem that has dragged on for too long."
"We believe that Turkey, for its part, can contribute to the process wherein a just solution may be found,"
"When I went to Turkey, two weeks ago, I discovered that the destruction resulting from August' s earthquake was the most extensive in Europe since the Second World War."
"Turkey cannot cope alone with the demanding task of reconstruction."
"There is no full reckoning as yet of the cost of repairing the damage caused, but estimates vary between USD 3 million and 6.5 million."
"The earthquake left 400,000 people homeless."
"At present, they are living in tents."
"With winter approaching, it is no longer possible to live in such conditions."
"The European Union wishes to support the reconstruction work in Turkey."
"We also trust in the constructive cooperation on the part of the European Parliament in this important area."
"During its presidential term, Finland will strive to do its best to integrate Turkey more closely into European structures."
"This aspiration on the part of the country holding the Presidency has been given a good basis by an exchange of letters between Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and the Union' s previous country to hold the Presidency."
"Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit reconfirmed in his letter that he thought the Copenhagen criteria were a basis for Turkey' s aspirations for membership."
"There is unanimity among the countries in the Union with regard both to Turkey' s importance as our partner in cooperation and the need for closer cooperation."
"It is something that has been mentioned by the European Union and individual Union countries in many connections."
"Just a few days ago, Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Chancellor Schröder stated that the Union, for its part, would make a serious attempt to reach a positive conclusion at the forthcoming Summit in Helsinki."
"The central issue will be how to strengthen Turkey' s status as a candidate."
"There must be much active work and goodwill shown on the part of both the Union and Turkey to achieve this."
"We are firmly of the opinion that bringing Turkey closer to the Union will be the best way of aiding the implementation of democratic reforms in the country."
"In this respect, the path of isolation does no more to promote the aims of Turkey than it does the aims of the Union."
"In this there is no doubt that we need the support of concrete action on the part of the European Parliament in matters of financing and general support to develop and consolidate relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is extremely pleased to see that the European Parliament, so soon after the start of its work, is having a full debate on the subject of Turkey, since this is in fact one of the most important political and strategic matters which we have to settle in Europe at the present time."
"Today' s discussions are taking place at a time when relations between the European Union and Turkey have the opportunity to pursue a new course: exactly two months before the European Council meeting in Helsinki, which is expected to make important decisions with regard to the enlargement process as a whole and with regard to Turkey in particular."
"The representative of the Presidency has just given a political analysis of the current situation, which the Commission can fully endorse."
"I would like to add the following thoughts, from the viewpoint of the Commission. Since the European Council meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, relations between the European Union and Turkey have deteriorated, for obvious reasons."
"As you know, Turkey did not see the European Council confirmation that it should be considered for accession as sufficient."
"Shortly after the European Council of December 1997, the Commission discharged the ""European Strategy"" on Turkey' s preparation for accession in all relevant areas."
"This European Strategy was drawn up as a specific, customised introductory strategy with the goal of expanding and deepening the existing Customs Union."
"The Commission proposals were approved politically at the Summit meeting in Cardiff in June 1998."
"Since Cardiff, several meetings on the implementation of specific aspects of this strategy have taken place, but thus far, the lack of appropriate funding has prevented substantial progress, although I must point out that the overall picture is not so black as it is sometimes painted."
"The Customs Union was improved in some areas, and the exploratory talks regarding a possible free trade agreement in the service sector have made good progress."
"The Commission experts visited Turkey in order to improve our general knowledge of Turkish legislation in all the areas concerned."
"Concerning financing, I wish to point out that by the end of this year, Turkey will receive a share of EUR 375 million from the MEDA I financing programme."
"We must in any case make further efforts to fulfil our arrangements with Turkey."
"The Commission would like to encourage the European Parliament as soon as possible to issue its position on the draft regulations, with which the European Strategy should be supported."
"Without this financial support, we are in danger of losing the credibility of the European Strategy."
"Credibility is urgently needed in order to convince the Turkish side that they have to make an active contribution to the implementation of this strategy."
"If we really want to help Turkey in the preparations for accession, as the European Council in Luxembourg wanted it with the European Strategy, then we must also show that we ourselves will make a significant contribution to the achievement of this goal."
"The European Parliament clearly has a key role in this process."
"At this point, I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that the Commission reacted so promptly following the devastating earthquake which shook Turkey on 17 August."
"The decision to make EUR 30 million in emergency aid available for reconstruction was possibly thanks to the speedy reaction of the budgetary authority."
"In future, the European Investment Bank will grant medium-term loans of up to EUR 600 million for reconstruction, and also macro-financial aid of up to EUR 200 million, in order to support the current reforms in close agreement with the International Monetary Fund."
"But we should look to the future."
"As has already been mentioned, the European Council in Helsinki will once again deal with the question of the European Union' s relations with Turkey."
"In this respect, I would like to make it absolutely clear that all accession candidates are assessed according to the Copenhagen criteria, and are all treated equally in this assessment."
"Turkey does not fulfil the political part of these criteria."
"In addition, there are deficiencies in terms of democracy, rule of law, human rights and minority rights."
"However, the question is how we can ensure that the necessary reforms are initiated in Turkey and that Turkey is resolutely and irreversibly on the way to becoming an established member of the family of European democracies."
"I am firmly convinced that this process in Turkey will only get underway and can only be successful if Turkey has the green light to enter Europe."
"Recently Turkey has made some progress, though by no means enough, in the field of democratisation and human rights, and I can point out that this will also be made clear in the next progress report on Turkey."
"Next week, in exactly one week' s time, this progress report will already have been discussed and decided by the Commission."
"This report will indicate, among other things, that in June of this year, the system of special courts was changed and the military judge eliminated from the Turkish national security court."
"It will point out that a number of important legislative and administrative measures have been carried out in order to prevent the abuse of human rights by public servants."
"We expect Turkey to go one important step further and finally abolish capital punishment."
"I would also like to stress that the rapprochement between Greece and Turkey which had been achieved shortly before the earthquake in various matters of mutual interest is an encouraging sign for the future."
"I sincerely hope that the trust achieved between both these countries by means of détente will give them the possibility of addressing the difficult issues of security in the region in the same spirit as in previous discussions."
"As you know, Turkey has decided in favour of Europe and is ready to undertake its obligations under the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I therefore think that, at its forthcoming meeting in Helsinki, the European Council should clarify what place Turkey can assume in the structure of Europe."
"I would like to inform you as early as today that next week I shall be proposing that the Commission issues a recommendation for the Helsinki Summit to the effect that Turkey should also be treated as a candidate for accession on the same basis as all the others."
"This means that Turkey must undertake the obligations of the Copenhagen and Madrid criteria."
"Turkey still has a great deal of work to do, and considerable progress in the political and the economic field is still needed. Still, in view of the enormous strategic importance of Turkey for the future of Europe, for long-term security, stability and peace in Europe it would be a grave mistake to deny Turkey entry into the enlargement process on equal terms."
"The time leading up to the Helsinki Summit must be used by Turkey and by us to agree jointly upon a timetable for Turkey."
"There was already some discussion of this timetable in the exchange of letters between Chancellor Schröder and Prime Minister Ecevit prior to the Cologne Summit."
"This would concern specific measures in the areas covered by the Copenhagen criteria in order to assist Turkey in the fulfilment of these criteria in the medium or long term."
"Appropriate initiatives by Turkey in the run-up to the Helsinki Summit would doubtless increase the chances of success of this European Council meeting."
"I am convinced that this Parliament will play an essential role in the forthcoming debate, particularly when, following the decision at Helsinki to grant Turkey candidate status, the comprehensive process of alignment of legislation, of screening begins."
"I would like to clarify one thing at this stage in order to prevent misunderstandings. We are not now discussing initiating accession negotiations with Turkey, instead we are discussing taking the very first step."
"The very first step involves granting Turkey candidate status so that the process may be initiated and so that we have the opportunity to be able to speak on the subject of starting negotiations in the foreseeable future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the statements of the representative of the Council Presidency and also the representative of the Commission, one must certainly assume that a resolution to grant Turkey candidate status will be brought at the Helsinki Summit."
"I agree specifically with Mr Verheugen when he says that this is one of the most important strategic questions affecting the future of the European Union."
"Yet we ask ourselves: what has changed since December 1997 in Luxembourg, when Turkey was invited to a European Conference and refused the invitation?"
"Let us recall the arguments put forward by Turkey in 1997. They said they were suffering discrimination, because they were not included in the accession process."
"I see Mr Poos, who was present at the time, who belongs to another large group here."
"If we now grant Turkey candidate status - and I say this in all seriousness -, but then start negotiations with all the other Central European countries, as we can indeed probably also expect from Helsinki, then there will be another sort of discrimination because Turkey is being treated differently to the countries of Central Europe."
"How shall we then answer that charge?"
"My group was involved in the drafting of the compromise text of the motion."
"I must tell you, though, that we could not support this compromise text of the motion in this form, neither Item D nor clause 1, because it would give the impression specifically that Turkey' s membership would have a positive influence on security, stability and development in the European Union."
"We do not think it right, to say this at this time."
"We can also see contradictions in the resolution."
"If clause 2 specifies that the Copenhagen criteria must be respected, i.e. democracy, rule of law, human rights, minority rights, and article 3 in clause 3 then specifies that Turkey a long way from meeting these criteria, then we must indeed take note of this."
"We cannot believe, on the basis of a deluded policy, that Turkey is today already so far on the way to being granted candidate status."
"I am speaking in all seriousness, and certainly not for the sake of being controversial. I know how complicated the Socialist Group made matters regarding the Customs Union, and we in the Group of the European People' s Party were then always in favour of it."
"I am not saying that in order to reproach you for the change in your attitude in striving after accession status for Turkey."
"Rather, I am saying it because we in the Group of the European People' s Party were always in favour of having as close a partnership and as friendly relations as possible with Turkey, and that is, of course, still true today."
"We therefore want to establish a forum between the European Union and Turkey in which we can discuss all Community issues."
"I would like to say in conclusion that Turkey of course has a European vocation."
"But if we grant Turkey candidate status now, the question arises as to what we will say to Ukraine or Russia tomorrow if we refuse them candidate status."
"We therefore say that this is not the right time to grant Turkey this status."
"Enlargement to the countries of central Europe must be initiated first."
"Only when that has been successfully concluded can we perhaps take a further step."
"But let us not take the second step before the first and, above all, let us do all we can so that this European Union, this great project of European unification, will be a strong, empowered and democratic European Union in the 21st century!"
"This must take priority over all other considerations because we want a Europe of peace and stability in good, clear partnership with Turkey."
"But the time has not yet come to make strategic decisions regarding Turkey' s membership of the European Union."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to remind you that this Parliament or the previous Parliament decided, on the basis of my motion and my report, that a timetable should be drawn up governing how Turkey and Europe can move closer together."
"This is in complete agreement with what the Commissioner has also said here today."
"With commendable candour, the Commissioner has clearly set forth what he is in favour of."
"I would also like to spell out clearly that my group cannot today say either yes or no to it, because we are familiar neither with the progress report nor with the discussions which the Council is having with Turkey."
"I would however like to say just as clearly that I deeply regret, Mr Pöttering, not that you do not accept the consolidated resolution, that is not the essential thing, but that you are going back on the decision which this Parliament reached with a very large majority."
"I find that lamentable."
"We must pursue this process of rapprochement, which is a difficult one, and which will last a long time - of that I have absolutely no doubt - in the interests of the development of Turkey."
"What has changed within Turkey?"
"Firstly, particularly on the initiative of the Greek Foreign Minister, to whom I should like to pay great tribute, a considerably better, though still not perfect, relationship between Turkey and our fellow Member State, Greece, has been achieved, as well as a step in the direction of finding a solution to the Cyprus issue which is so important."
"Secondly, on the Kurdish question there was, albeit in unfortunate circumstances given the death sentence on Öçalan, still the first step towards a political solution. Also, in the field of human rights, it was not only possible to achieve the release of Akim Birdal, even if only for health reasons, but there were also some legislative changes, which will hopefully also be put in practice."
"I do not want to exaggerate matters, I do not wish to paint a totally rosy picture, but there are changes which we must respond to."
"What should a country make of it if we keep saying ""You must take this step and that step,"" and then, when it does take these steps, there is no real positive answer and no sign of recognition?"
"My criterion and our criterion in the Social-Democrat Group is as follows: by sending a positive sign can we reinforce the positive changes which are emerging in Turkey, or not?"
"That is the crux of the matter."
"Secondly, what do the human rights organisations say?"
"What do the representatives of the Kurds in Turkey say?"
"Whoever you speak to in Turkey, even in the field of human rights, even with the representatives of the Kurds, you will hear the message loud and clear: relations between Turkey and Europe are improving!"
"This is our opportunity to be able to take more action, this is our chance to be able to do more to bring about the appropriate changes in Turkey!"
"In this spirit, Madam President, I would like to make it clear. We shall give an equally clear response to the clear statement by the Commissioner when we have all the facts and all the documents."
"But we have one goal as Socialists and Social Democrats and that is to change things and relationships in Turkey in such as way as to be able to speak of real democracy, freedom and respect for human rights there."
"If a signal is given in Helsinki, then it must have that as its goal, and it must give full support to those who fight for human rights in Turkey."
"In this spirit, on behalf of my group, I am hoping for a good decision in Helsinki."
"Madam President, the central question seems to be whether this Parliament and the European Union show themselves to be sufficiently self-assured to confirm Turkey' s status as a candidate."
"A failure to do so will provoke a serious crisis in our relations with Turkey."
"Nobody wants special treatment for Turkey and nobody should ignore the series of problems over the treatment of the Kurds or over the situation in Cyprus."
"My group believes that the discipline of candidate status will involve Turkey in more serious preparation for membership, a stronger dialogue and greater exposure to European Union culture and politics."
"Parliament has certainly been dragging its feet on this issue, as the MEDA programme and the financial support for the European strategy show."
"The Liberal and Green groups have tabled an amendment calling for the clear prospect for membership to be opened up."
"This would encourage the forces of progress and reform within Turkey and increase the leverage of the European Union upon Turkey' s future development."
"This position is supported by the Cypriot and Greek governments and Parliament would be reactionary should it fail to be in the vanguard of progress here."
"I plead to all those who want Turkey to modernise on the basis of its European traditions to support our amendment."
"Madam President, in his speech at the formal opening of the new legal year in Turkey on 6 September, the Senior Judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal, Sami Selçuk, strongly denounced the country' s constitution."
"With the words, ""Turkey is a country with a constitution but it is not a constitutional state,"" he condemned the Turkish constitution."
"The constitution apparently protected the rights of the state at the expense of the freedom of the citizens."
"""We need more democracy and more citizens who are allowed freedom of thought without being restricted by the laws of the land,"" said the judge."
"He spoke in favour of widespread democratic reform and also fundamental restructuring of the political system."
"He is right."
"His demands are identical to our expectations."
"I am even convinced that the majority in this House is also in favour of a democratic Turkey, in which human rights and minority rights are respected."
"It is my conviction, too, that we are bound to support democratic circles and their modest successes not just on moral grounds but also because a democratic Turkey, which can solve its own problems within Turkey, will be advantageous for the internal security of the European Union."
"By means of our policy we could make a contribution towards ensuring that the proponents of a European democracy in Turkey may be successful and that the hawks who are against Europe may be the losers."
"In other words, at the present time, we need a policy which assists Turkey whilst maintaining a critical attitude and a policy which induces it to settle obvious issues such as the Kurdish question, the Cyprus issue or the human rights problems speedily and humanely."
"This cannot be the policy of the exclusion or the isolation of Turkey!"
"Therefore, whatever the timetable or the exact procedure, in Helsinki a sign must be given towards the people of Turkish and Kurdish origin and towards democracy in Turkey."
"I cannot as yet say anything for sure on behalf of my group on the integration of Turkey, because we are still having discussions, but for me personally, it means as Mr Verheugen has already said, that it has candidate status for accession to the European Union. Its integration is urgently necessary, not just for the democratisation of Turkey, but also for peace and stability in the Balkans and in South-Eastern Europe."
"The Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou yesterday said at the University of Istanbul, ""We want Turkey in the European Union right now!"""
"Nothing further need be said!"
"I think he made it perfectly clear!"
"Madam President, our group is in favour of a European vocation for Turkey and the possibility of its eventual accession."
"It is also in favour of a more open policy as regards granting financial assistance, provided this aid can benefit in particular the plight of its many earthquake victims."
"This does not mean, however, that we agree with the delegate of the Finnish Presidency or with Mr Verheugen or with the joint motion for a resolution being tabled in the European Parliament."
"We believe that we, the European Union, must be a community of principles and not a cynical political entity pursuing geo-strategic policies which, to a large extent, come from Washington."
"Why did we lay down certain conditions for Slovakia and refuse to grant it applicant status."
"Was this a bad thing for Slovakia?"
"And why did we do the same for the Baltic States on the grounds of respect for minorities?"
"Was this a bad thing for the Baltic States?"
"Were we not aware that Slovakia and the Baltic States had made specific progress?"
"So why should we change our standpoint as regards Turkey?"
"Mr Verheugen said that it is up to us to provide Turkey with an incentive, a signal or a symbol to help set in motion the democratisation process in Turkey."
"Have we not already done this?"
"Did we not do this with the Customs Union?"
"Did we not do this with the proposal for the European Conference?"
"Did we not do this with the MEDA programme?"
"We had no response."
"Therefore, I believe that we must insist on the preconditions and demand that specific progress be made by Turkey."
"Finally, I would like to mention that I was disappointed to hear the three groups referring to the Greek Foreign Minister' s statements and standpoints to endorse their argument for intensifying relations unconditionally."
"I myself do not wish to comment on this."
"It is not an area on which I would like us to comment. However, I would like to say that Mr Swoboda is wrong to say that progress has been made on the Cyprus issue because Mr Papandreou said so."
"No progress has been made on the Cyprus issue!"
"We also heard Mr Ecevit saying that there will be no intercommunal agreements unless Mr Denktash' regime receives official recognition."
"No progress has been made on the Cyprus issue and no progress has been made on the Kurdish issue!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it will seem incredible or maybe simply a coincidence, but just yesterday evening, I was given a statement on behalf of the Kurdish authorities on the continuation of the armed struggle."
"In my opinion, this should be condemned in the name of both democracy and mutual civil respect of populations."
"I am saying this because this is the real Turkish problem, along with the relations between us as the Community and the Turkish State."
"Before the Öçalan case, nobody questioned the wisdom of the best possible relations with a State which had always declared its desire for an ever-closer cooperation with the Community, even to the point of asking to accede."
"Mr Poettering himself stated just now in his report that at the time of the customs agreements, he was in favour of this step."
"On the one hand, both as a Catholic first and as a politician second, I must stress the need in Turkey for more genuine respect for civil rights and fundamental values, especially as regards human rights. But on the other hand, we have to consider that all the commitments made by Turkey to the Community in recent years in terms of foreign policy, cooperation, economy and also in the cultural field, have always been honoured."
"So in my opinion, we need to press both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, as well as ourselves in this Parliament, to make sure that all the agreements made with the Turkish State are upheld and complied with. And also that the competent Community bodies continue the timely and very thorough task of checking that the democratisation process and the peaceful resolution of the differences with other States are actually going ahead and are not mere words spoken by the Turkish State."
"If we continue with the goal of enlarging the Community and, at the same time, of ensuring it complies with fundamental principles and values, this institution will assume its true role once more, which is fundamental in terms of foreign policy and international credibility."
"Madam President, the terrible earthquake of 17 August took place in the very region of Turkey that has the highest per capita income."
"The three provinces in the disaster area account for no less than 17% of the country' s industrial production."
"One in every hundred workers in the region did not survive the earthquake."
"One in every four inhabitants lost relatives and their homes."
"Who in Europe could not feel pity for the victims of this disaster?"
"There is no doubt that a helping hand was and continues to be provided."
"Indeed this is our moral duty from a Biblical point of view."
"One of the offshoots of the disaster was a sudden change in the worldview of the Turks."
"The spontaneous assistance provided by their traditional arch enemies Greece and Armenia refuted the Turks saying that a Turk will only find friends among fellow countrymen."
"The earthquake made people painfully aware of the great shortcomings of the ostensibly powerful state machinery in Turkey."
"Non-governmental organisations had their hour."
"Since then, calls for sweeping political and social reforms have been on the increase. These have come from people at all levels of society and even from President Demirel himself who only last Friday refrained from describing the Turkish constitution as democratic."
"On the other hand, prominent representatives of the Turkish business community are suppressing these positive noises."
"They are not saying a word about the dangerous polarisation between state and society, whilst at the same time, the gulf between rich and poor is widening."
"The aforementioned industrialists are endeavouring to defuse this explosive situation by calling for people to join forces for a civilian society."
"What attitude should the European Union adopt towards Turkey, a country at odds with itself?"
"Certainly one that bears witness to genuine good neighbourliness, which includes providing political and economic support."
"Offering the prospect of membership of the European Union is not on the agenda yet though."
"In any case, we still await progress reports."
"It is precisely Ankara' s unaltered, hard military line as regards the Kurdish question, notwithstanding the PKK' s request for dialogue and the fact that they gave up the armed struggle, that underlines how important it is for us to assess Turkey' s compliance with the accession criteria."
"The still unresolved question of Cyprus is another reason worth mentioning."
"Madam President, the Commissioner' s statements displayed nothing but utilitarianism."
"He spoke of economic criteria, of strategic criteria and of security. He made absolutely no mention of democracy and human rights."
"In Turkey, the death penalty is still in force, and neither individuals' rights nor peoples' rights are respected."
"Apart from the Kurdish question, there is the question of other minorities too."
"Antidemocratic rulings are still present in the legislation - for example, Article 155 of the penal code and Article 8 of the so-called Anti-terrorist Law."
"So before giving Turkey candidate status, I think we should verify that Turkey is making the necessary legislative changes."
"Only then will it be able to take the path to accession."
"I was a member of the committee established by the Council of Europe to monitor the Öçalan case, and I have to say that the penal process completely transgresses democratic rules."
"I therefore think that it is too soon to grant Turkey candidate status."
"Madam President, we have of course, listened with great interest to the European Commission' s proposal to grant Turkey candidate status."
"But the problem you are now confronted with is that whilst, as a politician, you obviously have to act when the going is good, you also of course have to ask the question as to what will actually happen next once a country has been granted candidate status."
"For we are not talking about political dealings here but about preparations for a country to become an EU Member"
"You only have to look at what effort it is costing the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the inevitable question to come to mind as to what the Commission' s offer will mean to Turkey."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner if we are proposing to leave Turkey in this position for decades?"
"Would it not make far more sense to achieve things little by little and to continue to work on the process we have set in motion in order to bring it to completion."
"Mr Swoboda' s little list of developments in Turkey was of course extraordinarily lean."
"As things stand we are proposing to grant candidate status to a country that does not yet fulfil the Copenhagen criteria in any way, shape or form, so as to send out a positive signal from Helsinki."
"I am absolutely convinced, Madam President, that it will not turn out to be a positive signal from Helsinki but that it will, on the contrary, become one big source of frustration."
"Moreover, what is the state of play as regards the European Union' s own preparations for the future membership of Turkey?"
"How much thought has been given to the implications it will have for our borders?"
"How much thought has been given to the implications it will have for our agricultural policy and for the deepening of the European Union that we are currently working on?"
"We are simply going to have to answer all these kinds of questions."
"It is time for us to deepen the Union."
"It is time we started pondering questions of this kind now that this proposal, which is completely premature, is to be put forward in Helsinki."
"I hope that we will come to see the error of our ways as far as this is concerned, for it would be extremely frustrating, for the Turkish Government and the Turkish people too, if we were to grant a status which will not offer any real prospect of membership for decades."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Representative of the Council, it is clear that today' s debate on EU-Turkey relations is a limbering up for the negotiations to be held at the Summit meeting in Helsinki at the end of the year."
"The direction these negotiations will take has not yet been specified."
"During the last round of talks, the Finnish President of the Council, Prime Minister Lipponen, stated in Athens that he did not yet feel ready to make specific recommendations."
"Also in Athens, Chancellor Schreider, following his meeting with the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Simitis, stated that he thought it would be a mistake in a public debate and at a press conference to mention the conditions that Turkey must meet in order to be considered a candidate country. I believe, this suggests Madam President, that Turkey must meet certain conditions before it can be considered a candidate country."
"Public debate is certainly the biggest flaw of democracy."
"Governments can negotiate behind-the-scenes but Parliament cannot have this luxury of silence."
"I believe that we all, or at least most of us, agree on certain basic issues."
"We want Turkey to have a positive European vocation."
"We want Turkey to be given generous humanitarian aid for the earthquake tragedy."
"Finally, we all, or at least most of us, know that, in Turkey, individual freedoms, freedom of the press, the prison service and methods of police interrogation bear no correlation with democracy or with European culture."
"I cannot forget the comment of the Prime Minister of Luxembourg during the Luxembourg Presidency when he declared, quite justifiably, that Europe cannot sit at the table with torturers."
"Madam President, the anachronism of the regime was demonstrated by the sacrifice of the Turkish people themselves in terms of human lives during the earthquakes."
"This could not have happened in a country with a fully functioning legal system, democratic control and freedom of the press."
"I consider very optimistic the remarks of the Commissioner that, by the time the Helsinki Summit comes around, Turkey will have fulfilled the criteria laid down by the Copenhagen Council to become a candidate country."
"The Greek people showed their heartfelt sentiments towards the Turkish people during the earthquake tragedy and I believe that the Turkish people also have heartfelt sentiments towards the Greek people."
"The Greek Government has stated that it is prepared to accept the progress made by Turkey towards candidate status provided that Turkey can show some signs it intends to fundamentally change its attitude."
"Turkey has shown no signs of this."
"It still persists with the partition and military occupation of Cyprus."
"It still persists with its threats of war against Greece if Greece should enforce the international law on territorial waters."
"As long as Turkey persists with these, it will not be possible."
"What has been said here about Mr Papandreou acknowledging that Turkey has made progress on the Cyprus issue is totally wrong."
"I can assure you that Mr Papandreou made no such statement."
"It is not right that such statements can be distorted just to impress."
"If Turkey does show signs of progress, then of course we will welcome it with open arms, but it must show some signs."
"The ball, Commissioner, is in Turkey' s court and the next move must come from them."
"Europe has given it sufficient encouragement yet we have not seen, on an official level, and not from the Turkish people who are also suffering under the regime imposed on them, the response Europe needs to proceed to the next phase."
"We would need to have the necessary response and then, of course, we can proceed with the issue of Turkish candidature."
"As an MEP for London, I am glad to represent many Turks, Turkish Cypriots and Kurds."
"That leads me to insist that the chief obstacle to Turkey' s accession is not prejudice or discrimination."
"The EU is not a Christian club."
"Europe is culturally richer for having Muslim citizens and residents, and I welcome that."
"The chief obstacle to Turkey' s entry is its inability to meet the political criteria laid down at Copenhagen, especially regarding democracy, human rights and the rights of minorities, especially the Kurdish people."
"And it is patronising and insulting to treat Turkey differently from other candidates as if suggesting Turkey is second class and incapable of aspiring to European political standards."
"The main cancer in the Turkish system is the repression of the Kurdish people."
"This has distorted the Turkish State and justified its militarisation."
"Hundreds of thousands of people have died and millions have been evicted from their homes."
"The PKK has committed some atrocities but these have been far outweighed by those perpetrated by the Turkish army."
"There is insufficient response to the PKK' s ceasefire."
"Our mistake is to perceive Turkey more as a strategic military ally than as a political partner."
"We must intensify our relationship and contribute to constructive change, but must not say yet that Turkey is on track to join."
"That is why I cannot support my own Group' s Amendment 1."
"Madam President, it is clear that both the Council and the Commission are determined to grant Turkey candidate status within the European Union."
"In our opinion, this once again shows that total hypocrisy is an underlying principle of the European Union, with its double standard policies of selective sensitivity towards human rights and respect for international law."
"Personally, I am not surprised by the proposals brought by the Council and the Commission."
"When the Union itself can bomb Yugoslavia, an independent country, it cannot have any problem with the bombings carried out by Turkey on Kurds in Iraq."
"These double standard policies, based purely on the financial and political interests of the powers that be in the European Union, are making us turn a blind eye to what is happening in Turkey today; that is, Turkey' s refusal to acknowledge democratisation and respect for human rights, not to mention the violations of all the principles of international law."
"The prisons are full, the tortures and the executions are continuing."
"The Turkish regime has ignored the gestures of the PKK who actually sent some representatives to Turkey, just as a sign of peace, and called a cease-fire."
"Nevertheless, this means nothing to the Turkish regime."
"It still insists, at all costs, on a military solution to the Kurdish question, and on enacting genocides on Kurdish people."
"Cyprus is still suffering the invasion and occupation of the Turkish troops and yet, we are still turning a blind eye to it."
"If we vote in favour of the proposal of the Commission and the Council, then rest assured that this will not in itself encourage democratisation."
"It will, however, encourage Turkey to reinforce the current inhuman, objectionable policy it is pursuing and to intensify the incursions against Greece and the incursions against humanity."
"A few days ago, in the EU-Turkey joint committee, the representative from the Turkish delegation told us, ""This is how we are; we are a democratic country."
"Take us or leave us"" ."
"So well done!"
"Keep it up and you will indeed be the ones receiving the human rights prize!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French, Flemish and Italian Members of Parliament in the Coordination of the European Right are in favour of establishing a relationship with Turkey based on mutual respect, mutual benefit and non-interference in internal affairs."
"However, they are resolutely opposed to the integration of Turkey into the European Union where this would be in the interests neither of the Union nor of Turkey."
"The Turkish nation is a great nation, but it is distinct from the nations of Europe in terms of its origin, its language, its history, its culture, its religion and its institutions."
"The main part of its territory and population is in Asia."
"The integration of Turkey into the European Union would cause insoluble problems: immigration aggravated by demographic differences, economic competition aggravated by differences in earnings and labour costs."
"We must finally rid ourselves of these internationalist delusions which seek to extend the Union indefinitely, without taking national identity into account."
"We must also find a way out of the humiliating impasse that we have been keeping Turkey in for years."
"We must have the courage to say that the pre-eminent role of Turkey is to serve as a bridge between Europe and Asia, between East and West, and not to attempt integration which will be damaging for all the nations involved."
"Mr President, I think that as far as the thorny and complex matter of relations with Turkey is concerned, we should begin by stating the fact that relations between the European Union and Turkey have been in hibernation for the last two years."
"Turning to the representative of the Commission, I would like to ask: is this situation really in the European Union' s best interests?"
"I believe, Mr President, that we must make ourselves clear, and be able to distinguish between what we can actually do and the promises we would like to make. I think that one of the messages that we have to put across in Helsinki - and I am directing this remark to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council - is that the climate for negotiating in Luxembourg must be improved."
"How can we do this?"
"Well, we have to bring Turkey closer to the European Union and the European Union closer to Turkey on the basis of actions which are concrete, tangible and resounding."
"I do not think that dodging a question that we will have to face up to sooner or later is a good idea."
"We cannot put this off any longer."
"Do we want Turkey to become firmly anchored in the democratic system of Western values or not?"
"What are we prepared to do in order to achieve this?"
"Turkey has been a loyal ally of the European Union and deserves a clear and honest answer."
"I think that within the European Union, we must face up to this situation with clarity, not by replacing reality with a reality of our own invention, because when all is said and done, that produces nothing but discontent and frustration."
"I shall direct these remarks, for the sake of this clarity, to the Commission' s representative because in the end, the Commission' s decision will be definitive, or at least will have great bearing on the way Heads of State and Government see the matter."
"Is the Commission going to propose more of the same to the European Council, or will the Commission, on the basis of the requirements of the Copenhagen criteria and of its own conviction about the Turks, offer the Turks the chance of not missing the boat in the future?"
"I would like the Commission to give a clear answer as to what the terms of their proposal will be."
"Mr President, I sincerely believe that the most important factor in relations between the European Union and Turkey is to avoid making U-turns and complete shifts in policy."
"It is essential not to give out wrong or unrealistic messages either to the Ankara Government or to the Turkish people, and to base our position on two principles."
"The first one is that relations between the European Union and Turkey are vital to both parties, now and in the future, in all areas and at all levels. Secondly, that the European Union must give priority to promoting Turkey' s democratisation in an intelligent way."
"To achieve this, we have to use the means available to us - the Association Agreement and certainly the Customs Union too."
"The European Union must demand that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria, but we must not add new ones."
"I was perturbed to hear how Mr Poettering, on behalf of the European People' s Party, added a so-called cultural criterion to our relations with Turkey."
"What was he referring to?"
"To the fact that there are unavoidable cultural differences between Europeans and Turks, which prevent Ankara from having the chance that their country might join the European Union?"
"I am radically against this unacceptable view."
"We can require that there be political principles, democracy, respect for human rights, and fair treatment of minorities and of the Kurdish people, and that international law be respected."
"But to add other criteria would certainly not be European in the best sense of the word."
"I would therefore like the EPP and Mr Poettering to make their position clear on this matter."
"Turkish public opinion, a progressive public opinion in terms of politics, society and business, requires that we give a clear message. But this message includes a rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey and at the same time, a push for the democratic values which today are still not being fulfilled."
"Leyla Zana is surely the most striking example of what I am talking about."
"Mr President, Europe has a lot to offer Turkey and vice versa."
"That is why I agree with the Commission that Turkey should be granted candidate status and will be welcomed providing it fulfils the strict Copenhagen criteria."
"We must help Turkey with the preparation process."
"However, it is essential for Turkey to undertake radical reforms itself, not just in words but above all in deeds."
"Supreme authority must fall to the government and no longer to the military."
"As long as Turkey infringes human rights and Ankara attempts to resolve the Kurdish question primarily by military intervention, there is not the remotest possibility of its actually becoming a member of the EU."
"The resolution we have before us articulates this view, Madam President, particularly in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3."
"However, I consider paragraph 9 to be unacceptable because it suggests, unjustifiably, that Turkey is attempting to resolve the Kurdish problem by peaceful means."
"If only that were true."
"Mr President, I concur with all the speakers who have pointed out that the current changes in Turkish policy are completely inadequate."
"Nonetheless, as a Member of Parliament of Kurdish origin, I advocate financial aid and economic cooperation, and I also support Turkey in its integration into the European Union, on condition, however, that the Helsinki conditions be fulfilled, i.e. the question of Cyprus, the human rights issues and the Kurdish question must be settled politically, capital punishment must be completely abolished and all prisoners must receive a general amnesty."
"Kurdish identity must be recognised!"
"Mr President, the European Union is a Union of democratic constitutional States that contribute to the strengthening of the international rule of law both amongst themselves and in their relations with non-EU countries."
"That is why the European Parliament wanted Article 6, which contains such wording, to be included in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Article 7 even provides for the suspension of those Member States that do not abide by Article 6."
"It therefore follows that negotiations on accession to the European Union cannot be undertaken with countries that are not full constitutional States."
"We have had prior experience of this with Slovakia."
"We adopted a very clear position at that time."
"Slovakia did not satisfy the political criteria established in Copenhagen."
"Commissioner Verheugen is also absolutely right in saying that Turkey does not satisfy the political criteria, and certain consequences flow from that statement."
"Of course, we cannot compromise the character of the European Union on geopolitical grounds and for reasons of Realpolitik."
"We cannot allow a State that is not a constitutional State to determine our common future; there cannot even be negotiations on that point."
"We must give the character of the Union due consideration."
"The Council has politely said that Turkey is doing its best to become more of a constitutional state."
"The Right Honourable Member, Mr Swoboda has scratched around for some ideas, with a view to showing that there really is some truth in this."
"He himself will not be too happy with the list he has submitted."
"What actual evidence is there that Turkey is doing its best?"
"Could we cite its dealings in relation to Cyprus or the Kurdish question, or the treatment meted out to Christian minority groups in Turkey?"
"Could we cite the fact that command is being taken of the police, who have become a law unto themselves at local level, or the fact that the role of the army is under review?"
"Could we cite the changes that are afoot as regards religious freedoms?"
"I would like to see either the Council or the Commission produce a documented report on the positive steps that Turkey has taken, together with an overview of the points which still need to be worked on."
"There is one point on which we, as the European Union, fall short and that is the completion of the Customs Union in financial terms."
"Immediately after the earthquake, the Greek Government made very friendly noises about Turkey' s becoming a member but I do not think we can take them at their word."
"The litmus test for the Greek Government consists in their willingness to lift the blockade on the financial aspects of the Customs Union."
"That is the only real contribution the Greek Government can make and any friendly noises it might otherwise make are completely empty gestures."
"We want them to put their money where their mouth is."
"Nor must the European Union disappoint Turkey in this respect."
"Fond words about the earthquake do not help either, for it did not alter the constitutional state in any way."
"Mr President, we are going to have to leave Turkey in no doubt about all this."
"There must be no doublespeak!"
"Mr President, the chairman of the Group of the European People' s Party expressed his sympathy with regard to my own group, because at the time we made heavy weather of the decision on Customs Union."
"I would like to return this sympathy on the grounds of the ease, with which the Group of the European People' s Party has undergone a complete U-turn in its position since the agreement on Customs Union."
"Mr President, I have listened attentively to what the President of the Council and also Commissioner Verheugen have said on the subject of the possible candidacy of Turkey in Helsinki."
"I would have welcomed it if it really had been an honourable position of the European Union with regard to Turkey."
"But I am afraid that we are re-establishing a policy which, for decades, has permitted us to hide behind the Greeks and say that the Greeks would never agree to it."
"Now, as the Greeks are showing that they would agree under certain circumstances, we must, in fact, come clean."
"We must really ask ourselves in all conscience if we want to have Turkey in the European Union or not."
"Nuances of wording, whether it concerns one candidate for one candidacy, as in this case, or whether we should establish a new category of candidates, who are indeed valid candidates but with whom no negotiations are held, will by no means be beneficial to our relationship with Turkey."
"My last remark concerns a matter in which nuances of wording once again play a role."
"We are always talking about the Kurdish question, but we never talk about the Kurdish people."
"This is a people of between 12 and 20 million individuals, who nowhere, either in Turkey or in other countries, can enjoy their freedoms, human rights and rights as citizens."
"We must support the cause of these people."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-office of the Council, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the tensions, the insecurity and the instability are all enemies of development and prosperity."
"We Greeks seek the consolidation of peace and stability throughout the whole of the South-Eastern Mediterranean."
"It is therefore evident that we consider closer rapprochement between Turkey and the European Union a positive development."
"I ought to stress the point, so as to avoid any misunderstanding, that the rapprochement of Greece and Turkey, despite the historical antagonism and the fundamental differences, is in fact one of the most significant issues in our country' s foreign and security policy."
"Turkey' s vocation within Europe, however, is a debate of great interest within the international community."
"Any positive development depends solely on Turkey itself."
"Provided that Turkey conforms to the prerogatives and duties imposed on those states wishing to join the European Union, and provided it subsequently fulfils the criteria and follows the programme stipulated in the joint decisions in Copenhagen and Luxembourg, then it could progress with its European goals."
"It is unfortunate that Turkey' s behaviour both nationally and internationally is a far cry from that of stable Europe."
"As regards democratisation and respect for individuals' rights, the gap is major."
"Internationally, Turkey is known for its lack of stability, persisting with actions which promote rather than prevent destabilisation of the local geopolitical environment."
"International Law cannot accommodate threats of violence, political blackmail by the larger States or disputes over borders and obligations arising from involvement in the international arena. Nor can it accommodate countries adopting defiant stances in the international arena."
"In particular, the stance taken by Turkey in relation to the Cyprus issue proves that nothing has changed, despite the distorted view propagated by the international press during the disastrous earthquakes."
"Turkey wants to join the Union, but it wants to do this without changing anything in its internal functioning and approach."
"Is this possible when it does not respect international law?"
"It is self-explanatory that one cannot justify such preferential treatment, such behaviour and such forfeitures of rules and principles within this Community."
"It would be wrong for other applicant countries and would set an unpleasant precedent in the framework of enlargement and of current and future....."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I think that this debate and the motion that we are discussing today fully demonstrate Parliament' s wish to give out a clear, strong and friendly signal of cooperation, a signal which takes note of the Greek Government' s changed position with regard to the Turkish Government."
"However, we must also find the courage to admit that now, Parliament is waiting for the Copenhagen political criteria to be complied with, even before there is compliance with the Copenhagen economic criteria."
"The Copenhagen political criteria are ethical criteria which represent the real identity of Parliament and the European Union."
"The European Union bases its own identity on the fact that it follows the principle of the rule of law, which is much more important and significant than being able to mint a common currency or have a common defence policy."
"The ethical criteria mean human rights, democracy and respect for minorities."
"I think that the summary we have made in our motion is a fair one, and that we should impose it on Turkey."
"Candidate status and the cooperation signals are fine as long as we have the courage to repeat first to ourselves that it will be difficult to welcome Turkey into the European Union while the Turkish Government continues to ignore the Security Council' s resolutions on the invasion of Cyprus, while it continues to deny the existence of a Kurdish minority by referring to them generically as terrorists and until the threat of the death sentence no longer hangs over Öçalan."
"I think that in our reasoning, we should rise above a purely economics-orientated approach and reading."
"We must demand genuine results at a democratic level, and this is a guarantee required not only by our Treaties but above all by our peoples, especially the Turkish people."
"Mr President, in a historical context the European Union is a baby."
"In its infancy it questioned the eligibility of British membership and rejected its application to join."
"At that time many thought Greece or Spain - I suppose these days all that is forgotten - would never qualify for membership."
"Over the last ten years we have witnessed huge changes."
"Membership has expanded to 15 Member States, Parliament is beginning to acquire political power and will, I hope, cease to be a mere talking-shop."
"Turkey' s application has to be judged on the basis of the following criteria: Turkey' s strategic geographic and economic position and how this impacts on Europe;"
"I appreciate the fears of those who worry about Turkey' s Islamic population."
"The reality is that there are large numbers of Turks living in Germany and France, large numbers of Muslims - including Turkish Cypriots - who live in Britain."
"The populations of Kosovo and Albania are predominantly Muslim."
"The religious complexion of Turkey is a matter of historical accident, like Spain under the Moors for a few hundred years."
"Turkey' s culture is distinctly European and its religious complexion should not devalue its European identity."
"Let us look ahead over the next 10, 15 or 25 years and examine what is in Europe' s best interest: what will contribute to the prosperity and peace of this family of nations that we call the Europe of today."
"Let us not be hypocritical, and let us ask ourselves what is the intellectual basis for excluding Turkey."
"Young Europeans, socially mobile and far less religious than us, expect us to develop a Europe of opportunities for work and prosperity that we can all enjoy."
"Turkey cannot join the EU today; but geography, culture, history, security and common sense . . ."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in introducing my proposal, I would like to remind you of the European Parliament resolution voted on 18 June 1987."
"In this resolution, there were four points which constituted inescapable obstacles in examining the possible accession of Turkey to the Community."
"Let me remind you of these four points."
"Firstly, the refusal of the Turkish Government to acknowledge the genocide previously committed against the Armenians; secondly, its reluctance to apply the standards of international law in its dispute with Greece; thirdly, the maintenance of Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus; fourthly, the denial of the Kurdish problem."
"Nothing has changed since then."
"Of course, the resolution we are voting on today does repeat some of these points, but we must insist absolutely on the fact that the current situation in Turkey is not acceptable to us nor in terms of the Copenhagen criteria, as indeed highlighted in the third paragraph."
"It is up to Turkey to change its attitude if it really wishes to join the European Union."
"It is up to them to change."
"Obviously, for us, there is no way around the question of Cyprus, and Turkey cannot conceal the Kurdish problem."
"These are key issues."
"We must remain firm in our demands if we wish to be credible and if we want Turkey to change."
"We know that democracy can be strong in a country, as history has recently shown, only if this country is able to recognise the rights of minorities and to respect them."
"Mr President, the European Parliament is called upon to make give a fundamental, open and honest evaluation of past and future policy on Turkey."
"Turkey is and remains an important partner of Europe."
"But this partnership is not strengthened by now offering the prospect of accession to Turkey."
"We need pragmatic steps on the way to an autonomous European Union Policy on Turkey."
"We said yes to Customs Union."
"But in this House the financial services of the Customs Union were blocked."
"I am asking for these pragmatic steps to be implemented at the earliest possible juncture."
"We need Turkey as a reliable partner in a geostrategically unsettled region on the edge of Europe."
"An autonomous policy on Turkey cannot, however, have Turkey' s accession to the European Union as its objective."
"The prospect of accession, Mr Verheugen, which the Helsinki Summit will open up and which you have described here on behalf of the Commission, is, we are firmly convinced, clearly the wrong way to go."
"We are pleading emphatically in favour of an autonomous European Union policy on Turkey, based on the three pillars: partnership in security matters, close economic integration and ongoing dialogue on political, economic, cultural and democratic issues."
"The admission of Turkey into the European Union would excessively overstretch the European Union and would impose radical political change on Turkey, which it cannot fulfil in the foreseeable future and, I know, does not even want to fulfil."
"Therefore, the admission of Turkey would lead for a variety of reasons to a qualitative change in the European Union and to an inevitable standstill in European efforts for integration."
"The Ankara Agreement is not a sufficient reason for this as, since this Agreement with the EEC, in three amendments to the Treaties, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty, Europe has documented its willingness and capacity to transfer further competences from the national to the European level and thus deepen Europe."
"My group is, therefore, in favour of an autonomous policy on Turkey just short of accession."
"We want these high level relations with Turkey for reasons of security policy, economics and politics."
"But we also want to deepen Europe further and not let it be undermined by accessions which we cannot cope with."
"Mr President, I must confess when I hear phrases about Europe being overrun and overwhelmed it fills me with absolute horror about the quality of the debate in this Parliament."
"However, this debate has puzzled me somewhat and therefore I would like to put a question to Mr Sasi and Commissioner Verheugen, namely: What is the difference between what is going to happen in Helsinki and what happened in Luxembourg?"
"In Luxembourg we confirmed Turkey' s eligibility for accession to the EU."
"I understand we are talking about confirmation of Turkey' s candidate status in Helsinki."
"However, whenever I ask Commissioner van den Broek if Turkey is a candidate, he says the Commission regards Turkey as already being a candidate."
"So what exactly is new in Helsinki?"
"All candidate countries of course must meet the Copenhagen criteria and Turkey is surely no different."
"None of the applicant countries meet the Copenhagen criteria yet, otherwise by definition they would be members now, so what is the difference with Turkey?"
"Meeting the Copenhagen criteria is not a static process - it is a dynamic process."
"We are working with the other applicant countries to help them meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"Human rights problems in Latvia and Slovakia would never have been dealt with without the positive prospects of European Union membership and Turkey should be treated in the same way."
"We have to be actively involved in order to improve the implementation of the European strategy."
"We need to harmonise Turkey' s legislation to the acquis and we need to work with Turkey to build a civil society."
"We cannot do that unless we do what we did with the other Central and Eastern European countries and are prepared to spend the money we have promised: that is the crucial factor."
"We have to become involved as we promised to do in the Customs Union and in the association agreement, and we must work to make Turkey ready for European Union membership, just like all the other applicant countries."
"Mr President, the impassioned and fascinating nature of the debates held last week in Brussels within our group, as those being held right now in this Chamber show, if proof were needed, the importance of the matter before us today."
"In this light, there is a wide consensus in favour of according Turkey a special position due, specifically, to the history and geography of Europe."
"As a result there is some agreement on the need to intensify the relationship between the European Union and this country."
"Yet, even though we must acknowledge the progress that Turkey has made towards rapprochement, doubts remain as to its ability and even its intention to meet all the Copenhagen criteria."
"The time has come to get rid of this ambiguous position."
"This is why our group has suggested that a discussion forum be set up, uniting politicians from the European Union and from Turkey, naturally, but also representatives from elsewhere in society."
"The objective would be to look in depth into the matters which are still problematic, those involving respect for human rights and minority rights, of course, but also matters relating to economic relationships, and in this respect Europe must fulfil its commitments regarding the Customs Union and expedite the establishment of the appropriate financial protocol."
"In consideration of the geostrategic importance of Turkey and the role it continues to play in the defence of Europe, it seems to us, finally, that it would be appropriate also to table a discussion of questions of security and foreign policy."
"Establishment of a forum of this type seems to me the only way to respond to the questions that remain without hypocrisy."
"Mr President, I think that the new position which has been outlined for Helsinki on relations between the European Union and Turkey is a good one, and that it should perhaps be made more urgent, by stating even more firmly, the two principles on which - I believe - our approach is based."
"The first is that Turkey has the right to become part of the European Union and that we need Turkey for our project, which will not be complete unless Turkey is incorporated into it."
"The second is that in order for Turkey to be integrated, it must meet the same requirements accepted by the other Members of the project."
"I am convinced that we need Turkey not just for reasons of security but also to regain the credibility and universality of the project of European construction."
"A large secular State with a majority Muslim population will prove that the Europe we are building is not a Europe with a Christian outlook, but is rather one based on universal values relevant to every citizen of Europe, of any faith or of none at all."
"This Europe that we are committed to is capable of sharing values with other great groups of humanity from whom a project based on a religious outlook would separate us."
"If we state emphatically that Turkey' s place is ready for them, that we are waiting for our fellow European Turks to come and join us at the Union' s table, we must state, just as firmly that there will be no weakening of the conditions set out in Copenhagen."
"We must do this because we acknowledge that Turkey has a long way to go, basically in the area of human rights and of the rights of their various peoples and minorities, whether they are recognised as such or not, who make up the population of that country. Turkey also has a long way to go in terms of the way it acts towards Cyprus."
"We must make Turkey aware of this firmly but without exaggerating or caricaturing things, by describing their shortcomings and the obstacles they must overcome without shying away from them, but neither must we portray these difficulties as insurmountable."
"The European Union must see their shortcomings, even the most serious ones, as problems, and we will be committed to helping Turkey to find solutions to them, always bearing in mind the fact that our shared objective is to achieve the integration of Turkey into the European Union."
"Mr President, the subject of relations with Turkey is difficult and complex."
"We cannot hide from the true situation of a country which, however, has always sided with NATO."
"Turkey must still make a lot of progress, embrace western democratic values, and resolve the question of relations with Greece and Cyprus."
"But to facilitate this process, I think that serious consideration should be given to President Poettering' s proposal to establish a timetable of regular meetings between Turkey and the European Union in order to discuss democracy, the human rights of minorities, economic and social development and foreign security policy."
"There is a long, long way to go, but open dialogue between the partners, which will be strengthened with the forum proposed by Mr Poettering, cannot and must not stop."
"Ending talks would mean increasing the risk of a growing Islamic extremist presence in Turkey. This would have a destabilising effect in the Mediterranean region."
"So we favour continuing talks between the European Union and Turkey, but invite Turkey to make actual progress."
"A policy of promises is not sufficient."
"We need a policy of concrete facts, we need respect for human rights and we need the abolition of the death penalty. However we know that the Kurdish question does not only involve Turkey."
"Respect for the human rights of the Kurdish minorities also involves Iran. When we speak of respect for human rights and guarantees for the Kurds, we have to look beyond the Turkish borders because otherwise it would only become a political propaganda tool."
"So I think that the proposal to continue the dialogue should be supported but, I repeat, Turkey must give real proof that it is adhering to European democratic values."
"Mr President, the Turkey of today is not the accession candidate of tomorrow."
"We are worlds apart as regards capital punishment, human rights, minority rights, democracy and rule of law."
"Scarcely less deep are the rifts on important matters such as economic, social and environmental legislation, to name but a few areas."
"The continuing military occupation of part of Cyprus is no contribution to peace and security in Europe."
"There is no getting around these facts."
"Anyone who says otherwise is, in the best analysis, hypocritical."
"No trust is to be gained by means of hypocritical set phrases, either in Turkey as our partner, or with our citizens at home."
"Therefore, we cannot say yes to substantial passages in the compromise resolution before us."
"If the relevant sections are not deleted from the text then we shall reject the whole resolution."
"Turkey' s membership of the European Union is not really an important contribution to the future development of the Union."
"To put it correctly, we are making a contribution to greater clarity in Turkey and on behalf of Turkey."
"At the same time we retain our credibility in the eyes of our own citizens."
"In order to make further progress along the long road which Europe and Turkey must travel to become closer, we urgently need credibility."
"In this sense, we can support everything that has been mentioned many times today."
"This includes, for example, the requirement to take the European Union' s financial commitments towards Turkey under the financial protocol seriously and not just verbally, but also to make the necessary funds available."
"In so doing we will be showing both our own citizens, and also Turkey and the citizens of Turkey, that we take invitations and declarations of belief seriously. We do wish to be partners in future!"
"This is however conditional upon our not proceeding to the second step before taking the first, as one may already have supposed on many occasions today."
"Mr President, when Romano Prodi was presenting his programme, he told the European Parliament that we had 20 or even 30 years of enlargement in the Union ahead of us, during which time the number of Members would rise to 25 - perhaps more than that."
"His time perspective was a realistic one, and remains so."
"I fear that many countries, which are much closer to possible accession than Turkey, were given the impression years ago, from many quarters - and I do not mean Parliament, but government representatives - that full membership for the Baltic Countries, Poland and Hungary, for example, would be possible by the year 2002 or 2003."
"The internal development of these States, and, above all, their ability to fulfil the obligations of the Union in order to acquire Union rights, may not be sufficient for such speedy accession as they themselves would hope."
"We must make one thing clear for ourselves, however."
"In my opinion, it is not honest to say that developments in Turkey remain inadequate, when we mean that Turkey cannot be a Member at all."
"No, in my opinion, we have to say, as Mr Sasi, representing the Council here, said, that we must see a lot more development in Turkey, but that we wish to show goodwill."
"In other words, we shall not exclude Turkey."
"Furthermore, the Union must take stock of the burden of enlargement, when, in a few years' time, Poland, with its population of almost 40 million, one quarter of which still derives its livelihood from agriculture, becomes a Member."
"And the Union' s potential is not boundless, either, which is why it is easy to agree with the words of Mr Poettering: yes to a reformed Turkey in the future, but that time is not now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the premise, which is repeated again and again here, according to which Turkey would have to fulfil specific conditions to become a Member of the European Union, is a false one."
"Just imagine if the Turks were actually to fulfil the criteria!"
"We, in the European Union would be in no position whatsoever to integrate Turkey."
"That is the reality!"
"For we have a principle in this European Union of ours, the socialist principle of redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor."
"We call it economic and social cohesion."
"If Turkey were to become a Member of the European Union, then of course Turkey would also have a claim in having this principle respected."
"The European Union would be completely overtaxed by this."
"What we are planning now, is already a show of strength of the first order, i.e. integrating the Poles, the Czechs and Hungary, whom I would have in the European Union tomorrow rather than the day after."
"But we cannot yet integrate Turkey too."
"And as regards identity, as this is an argument which keeps being brought into play, I think that if Turkey is European, then Ukraine and Russia, at least, should first belong to the European Union, and that is impossible too."
"But it is equally impossible to integrate Turkey."
"We should dismiss this thought."
"We should not string Turkey along any longer. It is just unfair and thoughtless."
"It is not we but our children who will have to pay the price."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for their valuable opinions."
"I would like to stress that political situations have to be exploited to promote peace, stability and human rights."
"Now we have this opportunity."
"The Kosovo crisis gave us a concrete picture of how important it is for us to build cooperation and peace in Europe."
"That can only happen through commitment to European structures, and we know that Turkey has an important part to play in promoting stability in South-East Europe."
"The other major event has been the earthquakes in both Turkey and Greece."
"They have generated a sprit of goodwill between the Greek and Turkish people and laid the groundwork for closer political relations between these countries."
"We therefore have an opportunity for better cooperation to take the place of estrangement."
"I believe that closer cooperation will also aid real development in Turkey."
"I believe that will mean that, in Turkey, improved human rights, democracy and political climate will be seen as absolutely vital steps to take."
"I also believe that it will give us the opportunity to make headway on the Cyprus question, as Turkey has an indisputable influence on that issue, and its cooperation will be needed for progress to be made here."
"Mr Verheugen of the Commission referred in his speech to Turkey' s possible candidate status."
"In this regard, it has to be said we still have a lot of work to do before the Helsinki Summit in order to reach a conclusion here."
"We have work to do in the Union, but it is also important that Turkey gives out positive signals during the whole of this process that the country is on the right track for development and that the position of democracy and human rights in Turkey is being strengthened."
"The Copenhagen criteria have been discussed here."
"Regarding these, it should be stated that they are a condition of the opening of talks."
"We are now discussing Turkey' s candidate status."
"If candidate status can be approved, the Copenhagen criteria will be an important path for Turkey to follow for its development, and they will be an ideal vehicle to take that development in the right direction: towards the values that we advocate here."
"I would also like to emphasise Turkey' s importance with regard to the stability of the region that surrounds it."
"I believe that if the Islamic countries see that Turkey' s new road towards Western values offers it greater economic opportunities and better political operating prerequisites, it will serve as an important example to the Islamic countries surrounding it, and it may also in this way have a stabilising influence on developments in Europe' s neighbouring regions."
"I value the motion for a resolution proposed here very highly, and I would like to say that I am particularly satisfied that Parliament is promising to act swiftly in matters relating to the Turkish question."
"Once again I would like to appeal to Parliament that the regulations on funding be dealt with in Parliament as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Parliament very sincerely for a debate which assists both the work of the Commission and the decision which we have to make."
"Permit me to answer a few of the questions which have been asked."
"Firstly, there is no question today or next week or at Helsinki of giving Turkey the prospect of acceding to the European Union."
"Turkey has had this prospect for decades."
"The fact that it has been confirmed again and again, most recently in Luxembourg in 1997."
"Turkey is already part of the process of enlargement of the European Union."
"Therefore it is indeed I and nobody else, who is responsible for Turkey, including within the Commission."
"This is indeed part of the enlargement process."
"What we are talking about today is only a tactical change."
"In Luxembourg, the decision was taken, to select a different form of approach to the time of negotiations for Turkey as opposed to the other applicants for accession."
"This Luxembourg decision has not proved to be manageable because Turkey perceives it as discrimination."
"If I am asked whether we will ever live to see Turkey as a Member of the European Union, I say I do not know."
"If I am asked, whether we will get to the stage of negotiations with Turkey concerning accession, I again say I do not know."
"But we will never find out if we do not now try to start Turkey along the path which will perhaps bring it to a position where, if it wishes, it can enter into accession negotiations with us."
"Candidate status does not mean that we are negotiating about accession but that we are checking what needs to happen for the Copenhagen criteria to be fulfilled."
"Everyone here in this House has agreed that we want a democratic Turkey, a Turkey which respects the rights of minorities, a Turkey which protects human rights and a Turkey which makes a contribution to peace and stability in the whole region."
"All the speakers have wished for this."
"Perhaps someone could please answer the question how we can move the process forwards other than by discussions with Turkey!"
"The Helsinki decision that I would like to see would mean that we engage in very serious dialogue with Turkey, engage in the harmonisation of legislation, and tell Turkey specifically what needs to be changed."
"Only when these changes have taken place, only then will it be possible to discuss negotiations."
"I guarantee you that no one is going to come here and say, ""We want to begin accession negotiations with Turkey now"" , if the political Copenhagen criteria have not been absolutely clearly fulfilled."
"This means that Turkey must already have changed in the direction of democracy and rule of law before we can start accession negotiations."
"Hopefully that makes it quite clear what the real question is here!"
"For years, Turkey has been answered in the form of the arguments which I have heard again here today and which I would like to sum up in the phrase ""not thus and not now!"""
"Now is the time for truth!"
"This expression ""not thus and not now!"" can no longer continue in this way!"
"Anyone who does not now recognise that this is the hour of truth and that we must now provide Turkey with a clear and honest answer, may have to face the possibility that none of the things we are asking of Turkey will be attainable. Rather, a quite different development will set in for which responsibility will also have to be taken in any case; that is to say, responsibility will have to be taken for the fact that Turkey will no longer be seeking to join the Community of democratic values in Europe but will be following its own path in a quite different direction."
"One should then also be prepared to accept the responsibility for this, if one wants this."
"A last word on the cultural aspect."
"I do not dispute that there are cultural differences between Europe, which is overwhelmingly typically Christian, and this part of Europe and Turkey, which is typically Islamic."
"I do not dispute that."
"But if you just imagine how the world may develop in times to come, then the answer to cultural difference can surely not be that cultures should shut themselves off from each other, the answer can only be that cultures must open themselves up to each other!"
"Cooperation between Europe and Turkey could be an encouraging and promising example of how cultures living side by side as neighbours can find a joint path towards achieving peace, democracy and rule of law, and also opportunities for prosperity, for their people."
"I ask the European Parliament, to offer us the possibility in this spirit to discuss matters credibly with Turkey and to contribute credibly towards achieving changes in Turkey."
"This involves strictly keeping our commitments, including our financial commitments towards Turkey."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 12 noon."
"Middle East peace process"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statement on the Middle East peace process, followed by a debate."
"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to you today on the present situation regarding the Middle East peace process, and the role of the European Union in it."
"It has been gratifying to hear, after a gap of many years, positive news on the progress the peace process is making."
"Much has changed since the last spring."
"Six months ago we were in a situation in which the implementation of the Wye River Accord, signed in October 1998, had come to nothing."
"The Israeli Government, owing to internal political pressures, was unable to secure the implementation of the treaty, and the country ended up going to the polls prematurely."
"The ending of the mid-term stage of the Oslo Agreement on May 4 this year made the situation more uncertain."
"The Palestinians had said they would unilaterally declare the existence of an independent Palestinian State on that day."
"When, at the same time, a heated election campaign got under way in Israel, the situation looked likely to come to a crisis."
"There was a general atmosphere of disappointment and uncertainty."
"Furthermore, people were afraid that terrorist attacks would increase."
"Today, the situation is to a large extent different."
"The result of the Israeli parliamentary elections and the election for Prime Minister in May was a turning point that made it possible to restart work on settling the conflict."
"Israel' s new government has given an assurance to the international community that it will strive in earnest to attain peace with its neighbours."
"There is always a hint of the unexpected associated with political developments in the Middle East, however."
"What is different about the situation at the end of last year compared with this spring is that this time there is some cause for hope."
"We have a display of increased political will, of the capacity for direct talks and the timely implementation of agreements."
"I know that the European Parliament closely follows the development of the Middle East peace process and that there is a good deal of expertise here in matters relating to the region, as shown by the study published by the Parliament on the subject."
"I shall concentrate on developments since last spring."
"That was when Parliament last issued a statement on the matter."
"Finland, as the country in the Union to hold the Presidency, has consistently considered the Middle East peace process to be one of the most important issues in the common foreign and security policy."
"We follow the development of the peace process carefully and are in close contact with all parties."
"The Finnish Foreign Minister visited the region on 1 - 5 August."
"The Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, is right now in the region, on a visit which will take in Israel, the Palestinian areas, Syria and Lebanon."
"Furthermore, we have regarded the comprehensive network of contacts set up by special envoy Miguel Moratinos, as well as his vast expertise, as being of immense benefit."
"His work has been very valuable from the point of view of EU transparency, visibility, and contact for discussions."
"The European Union has made an important contribution to developments in recent months."
"We have always encouraged the parties involved to take part in discussions and negotiations."
"In addition, we have always tried to create opportunities to generate a climate of opinion that is favourable to the peace process and we have worked to ease tension."
"A good example of this is the declaration made at the Berlin European Council, which, in my opinion, played an important part in reducing tension in the spring."
"It is hoped that the EU will be more active in the Middle East peace process in many contexts."
"It is true that we are in a very influential position."
"Europe has a solid, one thousand-year-old Mediterranean connection to the Middle East and an unparalleled knowledge of the region."
"We are not trying to compete with the United States or any of the other players in terms of whose role is more important, but seek close dialogue with them."
"The prospect for the near future would appear to be that, with regard to the Palestinian track, both sides will discuss the matter directly with one another, without any appreciable participation on the part of others."
"There is broad consensus among the Member States of the Union regarding the basic issues and objectives of the Middle East peace process."
"It has solidified during the last decade, which has meant that the role of the Union in the region has gathered strength."
"We are already now the largest donor of aid to the Palestinians, which is visible, from the political point of view, in the important contribution we are making, for example, to the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee to coordinate Palestinian aid, to be held in Tokyo in mid-October."
"Economic cooperation and expert technical assistance in certain matters relating to the permanent status negotiations, and in the area of good administration, are those areas where we have been of help and where we are ready to act in the future also."
"In addition, the European Union believes it is very important to have projects involving the cooperation of citizens, which would bring individuals into contact with each other in a positive way."
"This kind of cooperation has quietly gone on during all the years of the cessation of peace."
"The current stage of the political peace process can be regarded as having once more got under way with the agreement made at Sharm el-Sheikh last month."
"The international community supports the agreement made by the parties involved."
"The implementation of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum has got off to an excellent start, with Israel and the Palestinians fulfilling their obligations to the letter."
"The implementation of the agreement, through tangible practical action, will be the best way to rebuild trust between the sides."
"The agreement will create a new belief that the principles of Oslo have not been forgotten."
"In my view, there will be a need for faith and trust."
"The parties have purposefully left the most difficult and sensitive issues to be solved later."
"The one-year deadline set by the parties for signing a permanent status agreement is an ambitious one."
"However, determination, the consistent building of mutual trust, and the right attitude will make the objective achievable."
"The European Union is prepared to assist with every means at its disposal, should the parties so desire."
"The Syrian track has ever greater opportunities to start negotiations and thereby achieve peace, as both sides want peace."
"They only feel they should wait for someone else to make the first move."
"The opportunity must be seized, and we are ready to offer our services to all parties."
"I believe it is only a matter of time before talks begin."
"In the rapid developments that have taken place in recent weeks, the Lebanon track seems to have been somewhat excluded from public attention."
"It is vital to bring about more stable conditions in Lebanon for her to develop favourably."
"We hope that a political solution for the Lebanese track can be found quickly, and we are ready to assist as best we can with regard to this track."
"I have, up till now, examined the peace work mainly from the political standpoint."
"Politics has the main role in achieving peace, but, at the same time, economic and other types of regional cooperation will play an important part in increasing trust and, above all, securing the peace that has been achieved. This will be handled on a multilateral track."
"It still has not succeeded in living up to the expectations we had of it as a factor in supporting the peace process, but I believe that it offers every prospect of success."
"Indications of that are EU cooperation with the Mediterranean countries within the framework of the Barcelona Process and moves to continue the MENA series of Summits next spring."
"A just, comprehensive and lasting peace will bring with it, not only changes in regional cooperation, but also pressures for change within the countries themselves."
"We were glad to see the parties preparing to reconcile themselves to unavoidable bilateral compromises demanded on both sides."
"Now is no longer the time for harsh words."
"We earnestly believe the changes in the Middle East to be only for the good, if only people get to enjoy the fruits of change."
"Finland, as the country holding the Presidency, fully understands that there is an opportunity for profound change and will continue, together with our partners, to promote peace and the common interest with every means at our disposal."
"It gives me particular pleasure to call Commissioner Patten."
"I believe it is your first major statement to Parliament on behalf of the Commission."
"Welcome, Commissioner."
". I am delighted at this early opportunity to which you refer to discuss this extremely important subject with you as members of a parliament which, after all, has taken a long and keen interest in the efforts to bring peace to the Middle East."
"You have chosen an opportune moment for this debate."
"Hopes for peace in the Middle East are higher now than they have been for many years."
"The election of a new and more constructive government in Israel and the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum last month have set the stage for a relaunch of the peace process."
"There are clear signs too that both sides mean business."
"The first troop withdrawals, prisoner releases, and yesterday' s agreement on the opening of the safe passage route between Gaza and the West Bank, all show that both Israelis and Palestinians have begun again their efforts to reach a permanent peace."
"The permanent status negotiations have recently started once more."
"The differences are not to be underestimated."
"But with political will on both sides, they need not be unbridgeable."
"The European Union will do all it can to help the parties meet the February deadline for concluding an umbrella agreement."
"We also believe that the permanent agreement should be concluded within the target period of one year, as Minister Sasi said, as stipulated in the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum and as called for by the European Council in Berlin."
"So what can we in Europe do to stand by the peacemakers?"
"It is right that we should match their renewed political commitment to move forward with practical support from the European Union."
"That, as the Presidency has just made clear, is what the Union collectively is doing."
"President Ahtisaari is in the Middle East, a point made by the Presidency, Ambassador Moratinos has been accompanying him and will I know continue to work hard to maximise the European Union' s contribution in the coming vital months."
"We are also pressing ahead with the implementation of projects such as the construction of the Gaza seaport and the safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza: projects which are invested with political and social as well as with economic importance."
"We are also hoping for an early relaunch of the Syrian and Lebanese negotiating tracks, and will continue to assist the parties with a view to early resumption of these crucial talks."
"But peace in the Middle East has a broader dimension - it extends wider than the talks between Israel and the Palestinians, central though they are."
"That is why we are keen to revitalise the multilateral talks and regional cooperation."
"The Presidency and the Commission have renewed their call for a monitoring committee meeting of the regional economic development working group to take place as soon as possible."
"This is, of course, chaired by the European Union."
"After three years of impasse, this would bring Israelis, Egyptians, Palestinians and Jordanians together again at official level."
"We are taking other practical steps which are calibrated to the new political climate."
"The Commission has stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs."
"We will propose to Member States next month financing of more than EUR 20m for such projects."
"This package includes renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels."
"The first generation of people-to-people projects, 17 of them in all, costing some EUR 5m, will start soon."
"Members will recall that the European Union, as the Presidency said, is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East."
"Let me say a word about our assistance to the Palestinians, a subject in which this Parliament has taken an appropriate interest."
"In general, we look to both Israelis and Palestinians to improve their performance in removing obstacles that prevent international aid from achieving its goals."
"The Palestinians, for their part, need to persevere in the path of sound institution-building including, and I stress this point, budgetary transparency."
"In addition, Israel must find more effective ways of reconciling its legitimate security concerns with the urgent need for genuine Palestinian development."
"We are pleased to have recently reached agreement on the update of the tripartite action plan."
"This plan, honourable Members will recall, details Israeli, Palestinian and international donor obligations in the framework of the assistance efforts to the Palestinian Authority."
"The improved political climate should, I hope, allow for more progress on these matters."
"We have consistently pressed for the building of sound and accountable institutions in the Palestinian Authority."
"I am pleased to report, therefore, that President Arafat has endorsed the recently published report on strengthening Palestinian institutions, prepared by the independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations with substantial European Union assistance."
"President Arafat has appointed several senior ministers to a special committee."
"They will meet the task force, including President Prodi, in Brussels next month to discuss the implementation of the report' s far-reaching recommendations."
"We will also continue discussion on these issues at the upcoming meeting of the ad hoc liaison committee for assistance to the Palestinians - the meeting in Tokyo - which is the international donor mechanism."
"We will press for the next meeting of this committee to be held in Portugal in line with the understanding reached at the Frankfurt meeting last February."
"I have every confidence that we shall succeed in that."
"In view of our major share of total assistance to the Palestinians of over 50%, most future donor coordination meetings should, in our judgement, be held within the Union, co-chaired by the European Union Member State hosting the meeting."
"I am happy to report that the tenth convention between the Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency was signed last week."
"The Commission has already initiated the first payments under the new convention."
"This will allow us to help deal with UNRWA' s severe cash shortfall and to continue our crucial support to the Palestinian refugees."
"Let me also express my gratitude to the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and indeed to the whole Parliament, for the very thorough report and for your support, in the framework of the consultation procedure, for the Commission' s efforts in finalising the convention."
"I would like to pay particular tribute to the rapporteur, Ms Morgantini."
"Let me also thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, as well as the Committee on Budgets, for their support for the convention."
"I have given you a summary of the efforts we are making with the presidency to help bring peace at last to the Middle East."
"We look to the parties to carry out in actions what they have put their names to on paper."
"In exchange, Europe will continue to play its full part in the peace process."
"But let me also stress that we intend to continue working closely with the United States, not as competitors, but as partners, in this matter."
"We recognise the crucial role of the United States, which has wrestled for so long and with such tenacity to bring peace to this troubled region; and I pay warm tribute to those efforts - for example, to the negotiating skill and determination of the Secretary of State."
"It was Yitzak Rabin who famously remarked that you do not make peace with your friends."
"No-one underestimates the scale of the challenges ahead: peace will not come tomorrow."
"But peace will come - of that I am sure; with time and with patience, allied in equal measure to the will of the parties to achieve it and the will of outsiders to help bring it about."
"We have today a new chance for peace in the Middle East."
"Our task is to do all we can as Europeans to give that peace a chance and to hasten the day of its arrival."
"That is what we, with your active support and encouragement, intend to do."
"Mr President, many of us feel that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum represents a milestone in the Middle East peace process that we all want to see."
"The simple truth is that it is not possible to find absolute truths in a dispute whose origins are interwoven with the very roots of our civilisation."
"This is exactly why the determination that Israelis and Palestinians are now showing in the way they are developing and applying their agreements is opening up an amazing opportunity for hope."
"Further proof of this feeling is the way the recent stumbling blocks relating to the introduction of the 45-kilometre corridor which will unite Gaza with the West Bank, have been overcome in the last few hours."
"But, as Mr Patten put it so well, we must not underestimate the difficulties lurking on the horizon, which will certainly trip us up in critical situations - hopefully these will only be fleeting - during which we should all bear two things particularly in mind: firstly, that the way forward must always be dialogue between all those involved, which is genuine, open and direct."
"Particularly given our own current historical context, there is no possible justification for the use of violence, wherever it may come from."
"We do not have to resort to the figures on commercial exchange, investment and cooperation in development to see how important a role the European Union plays in the region, but the European Union' s proven economic solidarity must be valued as highly as its ability to contribute efficiently to a peaceful solution to the conflict."
"I share Minister Sasi' s recognition of the efficient work done by the European Union' s special envoy, Ambassador Moratinos."
"Nevertheless, the fact that we have mentioned it so many times does not mean we can stop discussing the lack of vision of our contribution, as Europeans, to the peace process."
"This is another area for which the European Parliament must accept responsibility in line with its stated desire to contribute to developing a common foreign policy for the European Union."
"Given this context, I think that this House should have two immediate objectives: to set in action the parliamentary structures of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum, bearing in mind that this could be a very useful instrument for securing peace."
"Mr President, after decades of war, conflict, refugee columns, occupation, terror, despair and bitterness, we are now finally seeing some light at the end of the Middle East tunnel - a tunnel which has locked the region' s inhabitants into a situation of mistrust and antagonisms."
"Through the Wye River and Sharm el-Sheikh Agreements, the new political situation in Israel, a decisive PLO leadership and, not least, a deeper insight into the Arab world, a new situation has been created which prepares the ground for a real and sustainable solution in the region' s interests."
"Seldom have the prior conditions for progress been as good as they are now."
"It is Israelis and Palestinians who are the main players."
"They themselves have the key to this solution."
"Today' s leaders are conscious of their historical responsibility."
"In this situation, it is very important that both sides refrain from unilateral undertakings which might jeopardise the process."
"With commitment and disquiet, indefatigable diplomatic energy and enormous financial commitments, the surrounding countries have followed the Middle East drama for more than half a century."
"As has been evident here, the EU has a growing and important role in the region."
"I fully support the Presidency' s and Commissioner Patten' s constructive attitude here today."
"Our new Parliament is today sending out a new and clear signal of vigorous and sustained support for the peace process which must open the way to progress, democracy, respect for human rights and hope for the future for all people in the region without exception. And, not least, it will open the way to peaceful co-existence between Israel and the independent State of Palestine."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists unanimously backs the multi-party resolution which has been set out here."
"Mr President, this motion celebrates the good news, the successful ending of the Sharm el-Sheikh negotiations and the agreement of safe passage for Palestinian goods, vehicles and people."
"But the safe passage is physically just a narrow corridor through which freedom of movement, a central tenet of European Union philosophy, is hedged about with many necessary security constrictions."
"May these soon ease as confidence builds up."
"Free trade also needs fair pricing in order for the producer and the seller to make due profit, as well as honest labelling of product origins and processes to satisfy the customers' requirements on health and choice."
"Both these key free trade elements have been absent in part or in whole from Palestinian export trade, particularly in textiles and in agricultural products."
"Conflict has dominated the trade agenda too."
"This motion calls for an end to all trade obstructions."
"Only then can three close neighbours - Israel, Palestine and Jordan - build real prosperity for all their peoples."
"Yes, there are risks involved, but what a prize to win."
"I commend this motion to Parliament."
"Mr President, this resolution does not evoke the same feelings."
"In fact, we all welcome the developments that have taken place since Mr Ehud Barak was elected Prime Minister of Israel."
"We welcome the relaunch of the peace process and the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum, which came into being after what were certainly laborious negotiations and which, to this day, has had the respect of all parties. The protocol that was signed yesterday concerning the link between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan is also a cause for celebration."
"We may be in optimistic mood but we are still troubled."
"The new Israeli Government is persisting with its policy of colonising Palestinian areas and remains the hostage of the Likhud party, which multiplied the number of settlements in order to prevent people from returning to the Palestinian areas."
"As far as these settlements are concerned, both in the Syrian Golan Heights and in the Palestinian areas, we want to draw the Commission' s attention to the matter of the preferential tariffs that Israeli products attract."
"Commissioner, we need to ensure that these preferential tariffs also apply to products from the settlements."
"The previous Commission took certain precautions to this end."
"More attention must be given to these measures, otherwise we will be giving de facto encouragement to those pursuing a policy of colonisation, and that when the European Community together with the rest of the international community, the United States included, has constantly condemned this policy and we are all aware that Israeli settlement policy is a major obstacle on the long road to freedom and a true Palestinian state."
"Mr President, I am convinced that we must make the most of every opening and every chance of building peace through the assertion of the human, social and political rights of each individual or people."
"The situation in the Middle East is still a long way from this, but without doubt, the election of Ehud Barak as Prime Minister of Israel and the Palestinian' s peaceful choice have given peace a chance."
"This was shown by recent developments in the reworking of the Oslo Accord at Sharm el­Sheikh."
"But for peace, or at least possible justice to materialise, the Israeli authorities need to take more steps - some colleagues have already said this - not only because of the Palestinian-Israeli question, but also because of the Lebanese and Syrian question."
"The occupation of southern Lebanon must end and Syria' s land must be returned, as laid down in various UN resolutions."
"Of course, this is all in the interests of the security of the Israeli State."
"However, the security issue cannot hide the illegality of the military occupation or bombings of civilians, which happen in southern Lebanon, or the existence of prisons like those in Qian."
"But the Palestinian question is still at the heart of the matter."
"In March 1999 in Berlin, the European Union reaffirmed the Palestinians' right to a sovereign, democratic State that will peacefully co-exist with the Israeli State."
"In Sharm el­Sheikh, the conflicting parties undertook to lay down the final State by 2000."
"To achieve this, it is imperative that Israel realises that for the Palestinians, a sovereign state is not a generous concession but a right."
"Above all, Israel must not take any action that will change the territorial and demographic order of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem."
"Still today, we hear news of Palestinian houses that have been demolished, confiscated land and the growth of colonial settlements."
"On 25 September, the military administration gave the go-ahead for the confiscation of Palestinian land belonging to 79 villages, in the Green Line area of cultivated and inhabited lands."
"The same happened in the village adjacent to Hebron."
"In East Jerusalem, men and women' s identity cards are confiscated to reduce their numbers in an operation that the centre for Israeli human rights has called 'silent deportation' ."
"Moreover, there is still the Palestinian refugees tragedy."
"Well, the UN resolution must be implemented."
"Of course, the opening of the corridor between Gaza and the West Bank is extremely positive, but Israeli checks make it difficult for men, women and goods to pass through."
"The European Union has a large part to play here."
"The European Union has played a positive and important role in the peace process in everything it has done and I think that it should continue to do so. In this sense, our role, the role that the European organisations are also performing, is essential."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to say that I very much appreciate the comprehensive statement made in the debate this morning by Commissioner Patten on the many complex issues which remain to be contended with in this very difficult area."
"The outlook for the future in terms of securing a permanent peace agreement in the Middle East is, I believe, now more promising than ever."
"There have been key developments taking place in this regard, which have been mentioned by others."
"The new Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Barak, has put in place a government with a sufficiently strong majority to allow him to resume negotiations in the peace process with adequate parliamentary support for his declared intention to get the peace process moving forward again."
"In fact President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak have already signed the memorandum to implement the Wye River Accord and to resume the final status negotiations."
"A number of measures have already been implemented under the Wye River Accord, including the transfer of control over specific territories as well as the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners."
"Our Union must continue to play an active role in putting in place and consolidating a permanent peace agreement in the Middle East."
"The European Union is right to support a negotiated settlement in the Middle East which reflects the principles of the transfer of land for peace, which ensures the collective and individual security of both Israeli and Palestinian peoples."
"In this context I welcome the decision by the Palestinian National Union to reaffirm the nullification of the provisions of the Palestinian National Charter, which called for the destruction of Israel."
"They have also reaffirmed their commitment to recognise and live in peace with Israel."
"I am convinced that the creation of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of existing negotiated agreements is the best guarantee for the security of Israel."
"I support the right of the Palestinian people to form a state, but one which comes about on the basis of negotiation and goodwill of all interested parties and not one which is brought about as a result of coercion."
"The implementation of the Wye River Accord seems likely to proceed."
"The real difficulties will arise within the framework of the final status negotiations, which includes the contentious issue of Jerusalem, control over water rights and the return of refugees."
"Progress on these issues may be hindered by developments on the ground, such as the expansion of settlements or terrorist attacks."
"I welcome the statement of the Palestinian authority which has declared that it will take action against terrorism while Prime Minister Barak has informally given an understanding that he will try to limit the expansion of settlements."
"Prime Minister Barak has also vowed to end his reign of occupation of Southern Lebanon within a year."
"Peace talks between Israel and Lebanon which have been frozen since 1966 - and the conditions in which Israel' s withdrawal from Lebanon is achieved - will be of particular importance for the safety of UNIFIL personnel who are based there."
"In addition to questions relating to the sovereignty and security between Israel and Lebanon, the return of refugees will be of particular concern to Lebanon, whose ethnic balance is disturbed by the fact that there are 250,000 Palestinian refugees on its territory."
"Finally, I believe that Syria, which seeks complete restoration of the Golan Heights, has announced that it is willing to renew peace talks with Israel, but only from where they broke off in 1966."
"The issue has stalled there."
"I believe that the European Union and the United States working together will do their very best to get the talks under way."
"We must continue to be very active in encouraging movement on both sides."
"European discussions about the peace process in the Middle East often tend, in our view, to be remarkably one-sided."
"They would have you believe that the major stumbling block is solely down to a failure on the part of the Israelis to be accommodating and cooperative."
"On the other hand, the West makes remarkably few peremptory demands of the Palestinian authorities."
"The Arab world itself often stays completely out of the picture."
"In this respect, there is no doubt whatsoever that the present joint motion for a resolution represents an improvement on certain previous resolutions."
"The key to an accurate understanding of the long, drawn-out Arab-Israeli conflict still resides in the fundamental question as to how it began, in other words the cause of it."
"Well now, the cause certainly does not lie in what is termed the Palestinian question."
"This exists, of course, but this extraordinarily poignant question is, in turn, a legacy of the war that the Arabic States waged in 1948/49 against the recently proclaimed Jewish State."
"The big test facing the peace process is likely to be the question as to whether the Palestinians will be able to introduce sound administrative structures."
"The Palestinians definitely deserve all the help both the Israelis and Europe are able to give to this end."
"This kind of interaction will also promote mutual understanding, which is an essential step towards real peace in the Middle East."
"As a matter of fact, paragraph 11 of the joint motion for a resolution links up perfectly with this idea."
"Lastly, both parties, Israelis and Palestinians, should themselves make it known if they require the European Union to act as a political mediator in the peace process."
"Mr President, as Europeans, we have a special, historic responsibility in connection with the peace process in the Near East."
"This responsibility cannot however involve our judging the current political strategy or the Palestinians and expressing our opinions on democratically elected politicians in Israel."
"As Europeans, we must remain neutral in this conflict and support both sides equally in their efforts."
"We are therefore, like the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance rejecting motions for resolutions which express views which are increasingly critical of the Israeli Government but which do not go into the problems of the other side."
"As Europeans we cannot afford to take sides in this conflict, thus losing our credibility as negotiators."
"Mr President, I think that the debate taking place here shows the unanimous welcome this Parliament accords to the progress in the peace process noted in the Sharm el­Sheikh Memorandum."
"It is a complex process - Commissioner Patten reminded us of this - and yet today, we have important deadlines and timescales during which things should happen which will bring us within sight of a definitive solution; that is, the recognition of two independent, sovereign states which can co-exist in a situation of mutual security."
"I think that we must now reconfirm our commitment and make an exceptional effort which will supplement that of the contracting parties which clearly nobody can replace."
"But I think that within this framework, the European Union can perhaps play a more political role to help resolve controversial points."
"We have been reminded of the negotiations between Israel, Lebanon and Syria on the Golan Heights and the items on the agenda which have not yet been dealt with."
"However, I think it is important that no unilateral action is taken on these items which will compromise the negotiated solutions and I think that the two societies must immediately work together - Israel in a move towards security and the Palestinians in a move towards peace and prosperity."
"I do not think there is anything that cannot be resolved."
"I would like to make a final remark on the extremely delicate question of Jerusalem and its status, which naturally requires that both the Palestinians and the Israelis find a solution."
"I want to say that there is nothing that cannot be resolved, and to back this up, I will give my city, Rome, as an example which shows that within the capital city itself, it is possible for two States to co-exist."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I would like to say that we are very satisfied by this Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum which will strengthen the tiring peace process in the Middle East, and we hope that it will bring it to a conclusion."
"In the Liberal Democrats' opinion, Europe must continue to give its firm backing to the peace process and cooperation in the Middle East."
"But it must make commitments, not just on an economic level, but also on a political and cultural level and acquire a stature and political weight recognised in the region and the rest of the world."
"However, in defending the right to self-determination we believe that all parties must be urged to make real commitments against terrorism to ensure people' s security."
"Mr President, obviously we are delighted at the change in policy promoted by the new Israeli government of Mr Barak and the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum."
"Today, we must support by every means possible those forces in both Israel and Palestine who wish to come to a definitive agreement."
"In this context, the Israeli Government must refrain from creating new installations unilaterally, carrying out expulsions of Palestinians and maintaining its settlement policy in East Jerusalem."
"We also think that it is important to continue and intensify the Community ""People-to-People"" programme mentioned in paragraph 11 of the resolution."
"Peace between these two States, Israel and Palestine, will be a lasting one only if their economy develops within the framework of regional cooperation favouring development which is sustainable and equitable for all parties - cooperation which prioritises the most vulnerable territories."
"We are thinking, for example, of the problem of water."
"The European Union must target this objective."
"It must also initiate the negotiation of Euro-Mediterranean Agreements with Syria and Lebanon and update the agreement signed with Jordan."
"The statements by the Council President and Commissioner Patten seem to us to be heading in the right direction."
"Mr President, developments in the Middle East have taken place according to the motto, ""two steps forward and one step back"" . Nonetheless, it is true to say that we have come a long way since the beginning of the 1970s when I first became interested in the problem."
"At that time, the Palestinian people and the PLO were completely marginalised."
"The only people who took them even slightly seriously were the European Left."
"I must point out that it was only when the right-of-centre Netanyahu lost the election that the peace process got under way again."
"Even if there are grounds for optimism now, it has to be said that there are still a number of unsolved problems."
"There is the problem of the status of Jerusalem."
"There is the problem of international contact for the Palestinians via Gaza and that of an international airport on the West Bank and, not least, the question of resources for migrants."
"There will now be the important task of keeping both parties on the track of peaceful development."
"I think that the EU can play an active role if it is prepared to use economic incentives and keep a careful watch on whether the agreement is being adhered to."
"This will be a form of development in which human rights can be strengthened on both sides and in which my friends on the Israeli Left may perhaps see their dream fulfilled."
"Everyone is entitled to a homeland!"
"Mr President, in the Basque country we have examined with interest the whole Palestinian peace process, because we also support in Euskal Herria the need to overcome the current political conflict through democratic settlements."
"We are much concerned about the fact that the impression most people get from the current talks in the Middle East is a positive one."
"As a matter of fact there is no real peace process going on because the most important issues to be tackled have not been agreed upon."
"We would like to stress at least three of them: firstly, the continuing colonisation process, both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank."
"Secondly, the situation of Jerusalem, Al Quds - that is to say, the wish of the Barak government to make the city the indivisible capital of Israel. And, finally, the lack of solutions for the Palestinian refugees living outside their country, who have the right to return to their home."
"As Minister Sasi says, now Israel has no major reasons for not resuming the negotiations with Syria that they left off in 1996."
"If these negotiations are successfully settled, we are sure that negotiations between Israel and Lebanon will follow."
"Meanwhile, Israel does not respect the Accords signed with the representatives of the Palestinian people."
"There is only one solution - a solution based on the peace process, that also takes into account also the will and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people."
"Mr President, we are all delighted that the peace process in the Middle East has been relaunched. Nevertheless, we know that the history and circumstances of the conflict are dramatic and that, over the years, various initiatives which seemed to open up a future of hope, have ended up being blocked as a result of intransigence, a lack of political will or the short-sightedness of one of the sides involved."
"This is why serious obstacles to achieving a peace which is just, such as the constant establishment of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory or the lack of respect for what East Jerusalem means to Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims in general, have made the road to peace a difficult one. Peace is a concept which should not be defined as merely the absence of war."
"In order to ensure that, this time, the way forward for hope which has opened up after the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum is not closed in the future, the political sensitivity and intelligence of the new Government of the State of Israel, whose security we want to see guaranteed, must come up with measures which are capable of creating a lasting confidence on the Palestinian side, so that the peaceful way forward, recently reopened, reaches its final goal as soon as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday in Jerusalem, Israelis and Palestinians were signing the Agreement to open the road between Gaza and the West Bank, a free passage through Israel connecting the Palestinian territories."
"This corridor, today, is more than a symbol, it is a reality, fragile but tangible."
"The way opened up a month ago by the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum finally puts the Oslo and Wye River Accords back on track."
"This phase is essential for a fair and lasting settlement of the conflict."
"The Accords recognise the Palestinians' right to self-determination, as a State, but also guarantee the right of Israel to live in safety within secure and recognised borders."
"The European Union, itself a unique example of cooperation between nations formerly at war, must serve here as a model and as a catalyst, promoting trade with the region and why not, in the longer term, creating an internal market for the whole of the Near East."
"Did you not speak, Commissioner Patten, of multiplying, revitalising multilateral cooperation in the region?"
"The objective may seem to be a distant one, but it is one worth pursuing."
"The European Union must associate itself with this; its vocation and its interest require it to be present wherever peace and democracy must be consolidated."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome the fact that, according to your statement, there is again movement in the peace process."
"Nonetheless I would like to stress that the terms of the present agreement fall considerably short of those of the Wye Agreement."
"I am disappointed by these repeated relapses to agreements already signed."
"It is so much more gratifying that the Commission is taking the political initiative in supporting the Gaza seaport, the connection between the West bank and the Gaza strip and the ""People-to-People"" projects."
"I consider the working party on regional cooperation important in taking forward the multilateral negotiations of the Madrid Process."
"As Greens, we are requesting a Council and Commission Initiative on the disarmament process in particular and on environmental protection."
"We ask Israel to make the joint use and fair sharing of resources with Palestine possible, especially in the area of ground water and drinking water supplies."
"The peace process between Israel and Syria requires stronger support from the EU."
"The situation must not be allowed to deteriorate into a two-way blockade!"
"Mr President, the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum is a new interim agreement."
"It does not contain anything new and is insufficient as regards its content."
"The two parties have agreed on the implementation of commitment which had previously been signed but which had not been followed up."
"It is not peace, and it is premature to cry victory."
"Nonetheless, this recent agreement has considerable political significance - it marks the end of the deadlock in the peace process after years of stagnation, even sabotage, by the Netanyahu Government which never accepted the terms of the Oslo Accord."
"This is why it is important for the European Parliament to consider it favourably and to call on the parties involved to implement it in its entirety and in good faith."
"The motion for resolution is balanced and fair."
"It is a useful reminder of the statement of the principles of the European Parliament on the Israel-Palestine conflict."
"I am sorry that paragraph 7 of the PSE motion for resolution on the freeze on settlement has not been included in the compromise text."
"Observation of this condition by Israel is, in fact, essential to establishing confidence."
"The Palestinian counterpart, however, is found in paragraph 8 in the form of a clear and unambiguous undertaking to fight terrorism."
"The European contribution to peace in the Middle East is expressed not only by means of economic and financial aid, it is also by adhering firmly to the political principles of a fair and lasting solution that we shall ultimately leave a European imprint on the final settlement."
"Mr President, I can agree with what a lot of other people have said here, namely that something positive is finally happening."
"The road between Gaza and the West Bank is an example of this."
"There is, however, a very great deal which remains to be done."
"Where, for example, settlements are concerned, we want a more powerful wording for draft Amendment No 1."
"It is very important indeed that it be emphasised that it is Resolution 242 which is the foundation for the whole peace process and that Israel must definitely vacate the areas which have been occupied since 1967."
"An important part of these areas is, of course, Jerusalem."
"I think it is important to note that Israel, or its predecessors, in fact accepted the principle that Jerusalem is an international concern."
"When the United Nation' s partitioning plan was accepted, it was also accepted that Jerusalem should be an international city which should not belong to any of the Jewish or Palestinian States decided upon in accordance with the partitioning plan."
"The EU must persistently emphasise that it is unacceptable for Israel to treat Jerusalem as if it were its own private concern."
"It is an international interest, not least for the three big world religions."
"Finally, the matter of the refugees."
"Through its contributions of one kind or another to the war in Kosovo, the EU has, in practice, accepted a war in order to guarantee that refugees might return to their own land."
"In Palestine, there are also millions of people outside the region who, in accordance with the United Nations' Resolution of more than fifty years ago, are entitled to return there."
"It is absolutely crucial that this principle should be maintained."
"The people concerned should have the freedom to elect either to return or to receive compensation."
"Most of them have already found other lives and are certainly unlikely to exercise the right to return to precisely the houses in which they once lived."
"The principle must, however, still be held to. Otherwise, there is unlikely to be any final resolution of this problem."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having been the President of the Europe­Israel delegation under Netanyahu, today, following the election of Ehud Barak, I wish to express how pleased I am to see the peace process under way again."
"Barak made the promise; now, he is keeping his promise."
"As we say in French, let us not deny ourselves this pleasure, let us salute Israeli democracy."
"But at the same time, let us not be deceived."
"It will not be easy, none of it will be easy."
"There will no doubt be crises, deadlocks, and I wish to say today that it is necessary, and it will, in future, be necessary, to trust the negotiators and, perhaps, within this Parliament, undertake in future months not to proliferate resolutions which offer little instruction, at every hitch along the way."
"I shall end by expressing a second wish."
"It is that the European Union should cease to be a mere provider of funds and should take on a real political role in the Middle East."
"Perhaps the Commissioner and the Council President will tell us how it may find the means to do that."
"Mr President, Members of Parliament, I realise that we are all taking quite an optimistic view of the future of the Middle East peace process."
"The opportunity for progress is a real one, and we have to try to seize it."
"The Union is prepared to participate in promoting negotiations both financially and politically."
"Nevertheless, as many speakers have stated, immense challenges lie ahead that no one should underestimate."
"The most difficult and sensitive issues are still unsolved."
"If the period following the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991 had been put to better use, there might now be a solid trust between the parties."
"Now, instead, the one-year time limit set by them for the signing of a permanent status agreement seems fairly ambitious, as, indeed, is generally agreed."
"I only wish to say that if the parties so desire, the Union is ready to assist with every means at its disposal"
"As Minister Sasi said, this has been a very helpful debate."
"It has underlined the concern of Parliament and of the entire European Union to play a constructive role in the Middle East."
"Several speakers: Mr Galeote at the beginning of the debate, and Mr Schori - pointed out that after some rather and difficult, gloomy months and years there was at least a hint of dawn on the horizon."
"I think that is true, and it was reflected in what most honourable Members said."
"Of course Mr Poos is correct in saying, with all his knowledge and experience, that - and I paraphrase him - 'it is a little too early to open the champagne' ."
"There is more work to do."
"We intend to do what we can to assist the process and I want to express once again my gratitude to Ambassador Moratinos for all that he has been doing in the region to contribute a great deal of assistance on the part of the Union."
"Perhaps it is just worth emphasising once again the strength of our economic relationship."
"We are, of course, the largest economic partner of Israel, and it is worth recalling as well the total aid to the Palestinians."
"European Union assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip from 1994 to 1998 totalled EUR 1.5 billion and European Union assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency during the same period totalled approximately EUR 505m."
"That is a very substantial commitment by any standards."
"The honourable Lady who spoke on behalf of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Parties - we know one another from different pasts - referred to the importance of fair as well as open trade between the region and the European Union."
"When I saw Foreign Minister Levy in New York a couple of weeks ago, I said to him that I did not think that our relationship should be drowned in orange juice - there are important trade issues we have to resolve, of which orange juice is one."
"There are more comprehensive issues that we have to resolve, and I am sure we should aim to do that in the next few months."
"Mr Collins, speaking about halfway through our debate, said that he thought there was a more promising outlook in the Middle East."
"I think that reflected the consensus, during the discussion, that there is the opportunity of carrying things forward more helpfully, and we certainly intend to do all that we can in the Commission to contribute to that process."
"Thank you, Commissioner Patten."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 p.m.)"
"VOTES"
"Madam President, on behalf of the radical and non-attached Members of Parliament present, I confirm that we will not be taking part in the final voting until the matters of the rights and prerogatives of all the elected Members of this Parliament have been resolved, and until all the 626 Members of Parliament are allowed to have the same rights and duties."
"We hope that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will find a suitable solution as soon as possible which will enable all European citizens to feel fully represented in this Chamber."
"Proposal by the Conference of Presidents on Parliament' s calendar of part-sessions for the year 2000"
"Madam President, I only got to see the Conference of Presidents' proposal for the European Parliament' s calendar of part-sessions for the Year 2000 once the deadline for submitting amendments had elapsed."
"I then became aware of the fact that one plenary part-session in Strasbourg, namely the one due to take place on 12 June 2000, falls on Whit Sunday. This is an official Christian festival and therefore also a public holiday in some EU Member States, that is to say in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden."
"I have never known the European Parliament to meet on such a day before."
"I bitterly regret that the existing proposal fails to take account of this important tradition."
"In view of the aforementioned considerations and the practical problems that may arise as a result of organising a part-session on what is actually an official holiday in many Member States, I would ask you, Madam President, to find a fitting solution."
"Madam President, I hope to appear on the screen for less than ten seconds."
"On Amendment No 1 the Commission has always been of the opinion that renewable energy policy and policy on energy efficiency are intimately linked and must be closely coordinated, but we wonder if a charter on renewable energy is not premature."
"We accept Amendments Nos 2, 7, 8 and 9 in principle, but we think they could be reformulated."
"We are delighted to accept Amendment No 3. We can accept Amendment No 4 in principle although we do not believe this is a question of adding a third objective for the programme, but rather of clarifying its first objective."
"Amendment No 5 is fully acceptable. We are happy to accept in principle Amendment No 6."
"Amendment No 10 is the one with which we have the most difficulty. Having had the opportunity to consider this amendment we are now of the view that it should be rejected for two reasons."
"Firstly, the ALTENER programme is open to participation from countries in line for accession."
"This is not the case with the associated Mediterranean countries in question."
"Secondly, the amendment refers to a recital and makes no corresponding reference to the article in question, which is, I think, Article 7."
"Accepting this amendment would, in our judgment, be inconsistent and confusing."
"Thank you, Commissioner Patten."
"I would have liked to ask the Council for any comments, but, as you can see, this would be rather difficult, which I sincerely regret."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0015/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency (SAVE) (1998-2002) (7123/1/1999 - C5-0033/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Ahern)"
"I am afraid that we cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 6."
"They seek, in our judgment, to introduce an unrealistic objective, increasing energy intensity to 1.5% over and above what would otherwise be achieved."
"There is another reason why we find them difficult to accept, and that is because they seek to make SAVE a legislative programme."
"With regard to Amendment No 4, we are happy to accept this."
"There is a clear need for complementarity in the fields of energy efficiency and renewable energies."
"On Amendments Nos 5, 11, 12 and 13, we accept all of those in principle, subject to some rewording and I think the last two replace Nos 5 and 11."
"We are prepared to accept Amendment No 7 in principle."
"Amendments Nos 8 and 9 we do not find acceptable as they would make the programme too inflexible, and Amendment No 10 we fully accept."
"Relating to Amendment 5"
"I thought this had been explained in plenary yesterday."
"These are technical readjustments, on legal advice."
"Amendment No 5 from the Commission was a commitology amendment and we reworded it."
"The Commission has already indicated that they need some rewording, so we have replaced, on legal advice, Amendment No 5 with Amendment No 13 and I would request your patience with this."
"If you want to vote Amendment No 5 through that is fine but we have had indications that the legal position is that we should reword it somewhat."
"So Amendment No 13 replaces Amendment No 5 and Amendment No 12 replaces Amendment No 11, on legal advice."
"If you could sort that out please, Madam President, because we really need to get a clear legal text."
"Mrs Ahern, you are putting me in a difficult position, because, normally speaking, I must put Amendment No 5 to the vote and then, if Amendment No 5 is rejected, Amendment No 13."
"I think the message is perfectly clear to all Members and I must keep to the Rules of Procedure, because we cannot just change the order of voting which has been envisaged in the middle of a sitting."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Recommendation (A5-0020/1999) by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council and Commission Decision on the conclusion of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community, on the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, on the other part (8731/1999 - COM(1999)245 - C5-0154/1999 - 1999/0112(AVC))"
"I would like to ask the Commission to confirm whether its position on South Africa is the same now as it was when the Commission presented it to Parliament, as I understand that there is some discrepancy."
"If there is any discrepancy it is entirely unknown to me."
"We are positive about the report which Parliament is considering and we are positive about the agreement."
"We do not think that there are any problems with it."
"That is quite clear then."
"According to what I have heard today, South Africa is refusing to sign the agreement on wines."
"This was an absolute prerequisite for the signing of the whole agreement."
"I would like the Commission to tell me what it thinks about this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you can well imagine, this is neither the time nor the place to start a debate."
"In fact, the vote is under way."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Report (A5-0017/1999) by Mr H.-P. Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision providing further macro-financial assistance to Bulgaria (COM(1999)403 - C5-0098/1999 - 1999/0165(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0018/1999) by Mr H.-P. Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision providing supplementary macro-financial assistance to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (COM(1999)404 - C5-0099/1999 - 1999/0166(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0019/1999) by Mr H.-P. Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision providing supplementary macro-financial assistance to Romania (COM(1999)405 - C5-0097/1999 - 1999/0167(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Joint motion for resolution on the International AIDS Conference in Zambia"
"Madam President, there is a rather serious problem."
"This motion for a resolution says in paragraph 15 in the Italian version that 'religious authorities are invited to cooperate fully in implementing prevention programmes and to participate constructively in the AIDS prevention scheme' . This seems completely normal and reasonable."
"The French and English versions stipulate that religious authorities are asked to cooperate unreservedly, which already from a lexical point of view, differs from the Italian version. But above all, they are asked to participate in 'the distribution of condoms' ."
"Now, it seems quite incredible and inexplicable for religious authorities to personally distribute condoms."
"Do you realise that in the French and English versions this is what it says!"
"I have not been able to read the text in the other languages of the European Union, but first of all, I would like to know whether there has been a political misunderstanding which has caused the Italian version to be wrong, or whether the French and English versions are wrong."
"However - but this is another issue - I wonder if each time Members of Parliament have to vote, they really can be expected to read the texts in fifteen languages, because if this were the case, Parliament would have to meet every day of the month."
"President Pasqua has already stressed the problem of the lack of translations."
"Our group is today stressing that there is not only a lack of translations but also inexact translations."
"I would like a clarification and, obviously, if the French and English versions prove to be correct, I will withdraw my signature from this proposal."
"(The Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for resolution on Turkey"
"Madam President, there are more problems as regards the different language versions of the text."
"At any event, concerning the resolution on Turkey, an essential verb has been left out of the first paragraph of the Dutch language version."
"It is ""to apply for"" in the English version but has been left out in the Dutch."
"I would like to point out that the English version is used as the point of departure and that the following phrase should be added to the Dutch version: kan in aanmerking komen om het lidmaatschap aan te vragen (may be eligible to apply for membership)."
"Yes, I can tell you that it is the English version which is the authoritative version."
"Madam President, I have to comment on the same thing."
"It is very, very misleading, as obviously most Members have mentioned, in paragraph 1, and that is the most important paragraph of all."
"The printed text reads: voting on the first section, second and third section."
"This is misleading insofar as in this sentence both the ""first"" and the ""second section"" refer to the first half of this rather long paragraph. The difference between the ""Vote, first section"" and the ""Vote, second section"" is only that the words ""to apply"" should be added in the one instance and omitted in the other."
"If the words ""to apply"" are missing, then this of course completely changes the meaning of the sentence, because it then reads as if Turkey is in fact eligible for membership."
"If ""to apply"" remains, then it is saying that Turkey has the right to apply for membership."
"This is the ""first section"" in plain language. Anyone voting in favour of the first section will want to remove the words."
"Anyone voting against where it says here in the text ""first section"" will want to have the words ""to apply"" included in the second section."
"I therefore request, Madam President, that exceptionally in this case you should read out what we are voting on so that everyone is clear as to what they are voting on."
"That is exactly what I was going to propose to you, Mr Friedrich."
"I think it is very important."
"It is important that every Member should be clear as to what they are voting on."
"I shall therefore first read out exactly what we are voting on."
"Madam President, I will not hold you up long."
"It is patently obvious that in such an important matter you do not need us to advise you to please read the individual points out first."
"Since the Group of the European People' s Party is backing out ..."
"...I do not know about the Austrians, but, since the Group of the European People' s Party is backing out, we naturally thought about whether we should have the vote today."
"I am however in favour of giving the Commission and Council an orientation decision today by means of our vote, as to the direction they should move in."
"I would only ask, Madam President, that we may have a separate vote on paragraph 7, because I have an oral amendment on it."
"I shall come back to this later."
"If you agree, Mr Swoboda, I think it would be better, or clearer, for you to give me your oral amendment when we get to the vote on paragraph 7."
"Madam President, I would just like to say that the same error which Mr van Velzen mentioned has also been committed in the Greek translation. The words ""to apply"" have been omitted, which are vitally important."
"I would like to point out to my Greek colleagues and to you all that there has been an error in translation."
"Relating to paragraph 7"
"Madam President, once again, when voting on the calendar of part-sessions for the year 2000, we have had to withstand an assault of amendments tending to reduce the length of the plenary part-sessions in Strasbourg."
"This behaviour is all the more intolerable as it is intended to invalidate an intergovernmental agreement almost before the ink is dry, i.e. Protocol No. 12, integrated into the Treaty of Amsterdam which has just been ratified by the various Member States."
"This arrangement, furthermore, was perfectly in line with the decision of the Court of Justice on 1 October 1997."
"Finding it impossible to reduce the number of part-sessions, opponents to Strasbourg are now seeking to reduce the number of days in each part-session, achieving the same result by a different route."
"This would be, in our opinion, just as much a violation of the spirit of the Treaty and that is why we are pleased to see that these amendments have been rejected."
"But let us also take this opportunity to recall our position of principle on the Brussels mini-sessions."
"These are, as the Treaty specified and as the Court of Justice reminded us, additional sessions - let me specify ""additional"" - which can be scheduled only if the normal Strasbourg part-sessions have been held regularly."
"The mini-sessions are thus additional sessions, obviously indicating, according to us, that they can be held only if the regular agenda for Strasbourg is overloaded."
"This being the case, it is clear that we cannot know as of today, when voting on the calendar for the year 2000, whether the agenda for the plenary part-session in November 2000, for example, will be overloaded and whether it will be necessary, therefore, to add a mini-session on 29 and 30 November, i.e. in more than one year' s time, in precisely fourteen month' s time."
"In taking such decisions, the European Parliament violates the spirit of the Treaties and I hope there will be governments capable of restoring order."
"The very disappointing turnout in this year' s European elections provided dramatic proof, if proof was needed, that this Parliament' s visibility and relevance to the people of Europe need to be enhanced."
"I think two proposals relating to the calendar gave us an opportunity to improve both our working methods and our contact with the citizens."
"The proposal to shorten Strasbourg sessions to four days would have meant that MEPs could have been back in their constituencies for longer periods meeting groups, individuals and organisations and getting across the message about what we do here in Strasbourg and Brussels."
"The proposal to have a mini-mini-session in Brussels on a Wednesday - when, of course, MEPs are already in Brussels for Group and committee meetings - would have allowed the President of the Commission to come to Parliament and report on the outcome of the Commission' s weekly meeting, and thus demonstrate to the citizens that the Commission is responsible to Parliament and raise our profile by getting major Commission initiatives announced inside this institution."
"I regret that both proposals were rejected today, but I am sure colleagues will come back with future proposals at a later date."
"Madam President, I have asked for the floor so that the Minutes will show that the five radical Members of Parliament present - Mrs Bonino, Mr Dell' Alba, Mr Della Vedova, Mr Dupuis and Mr Turco - have not taken part in the vote on the calendar for 2000 or in the following votes."
"As Mr Dell' Alba reminded us at the start of voting time, we will not be voting because we do not intend to support a situation which discriminates against millions of European citizens, whose representatives are denied the ability to fully exercise their own parliamentary mandate."
"Mr President, I would first like to say that I am very happy about this vote on the calendar, not because of an administrative compromise, like Mr Berthu, but because I am convinced that only by fully using the working week can our capacity for work be maintained, that means not turning Thursday in to the last day of the week."
"Secondly, it pleases me because I am of the opinion that Strasbourg is the autonomous, democratic and anti-centralist face of the European Parliament with significance as a symbol of Europe."
"I am therefore, as a European, grateful for this vote and I would like to say very clearly that we must ensure that this is not now undermined in practice."
"I share the opinion of Mr Martin that we need free time."
"That problem is not solved by using the Fridays but by the way we structure our work in committees and groups so that we can timetable working weeks without any sittings, which can be used for any one of the three types of work, but the great majority of us will spend in our own constituencies."
"."
"(DA) We have voted for the proposal to have part-sessions lasting four days in which Fridays are omitted."
"It is our view that there is no serious political content in the Friday sittings, which are used for matters which might just as well be dealt with on an administrative basis."
"We should have liked the Groups in the European Parliament to have been able to agree to use Fridays for political debate, but this has not happened."
"Europol personnel (C5-90 and C5-89/1999)"
"- We voted against these two Council decisions regarding Europol employees on a point of principle."
"The Europol Convention was passed in the national parliaments of Member States without any true debate."
"The ratification of the Convention was merely a rubber-stamping exercise as it was impossible for the national parliament to propose any amendments."
"The European Parliament - the only one of the EU institutions which is directly elected by the citizens - was also not consulted at any stage during the two years of negotiations on the Convention' s content."
"This was in spite of the provisions in Article K6 of the Maastricht Treaty that EU ministers regularly consult Parliament on the principal developments in justice and home affairs and ensure its views are ""duly taken into consideration"" ."
"But the most disturbing aspect of all is that Europol officers will, in effect, be above the law."
"In May 1997, EU justice ministers reached agreement on a protocol granting immunity from prosecution for Europol staff for any ""words spoken or written or acts performed by them in the exercise of their official functions"" and for unauthorised or incorrect processing of data."
"This immunity would continue even when somebody stopped working for Europol as ""all their official papers and documents and other official materials are inviolable"" ."
"These powers of immunity are extraordinary and not analogous to those enjoyed by any police force within the EU."
"Such powers are an insult to the rule of law and not in the public interest."
"Veterinary and phytosanitary matters (C5-100, C5-101 and C5-102/1999)"
"On the occasion of these technical votes on veterinary and phytosanitary matters, I would like to recall how important it is for the Member States of the European Union to retain sovereignty, at the national level, with regard to their freedom to assess and decide all food safety matters."
"Indeed, States must retain the absolute right to protect their population."
"We have a perfect illustration of this today with the decision of the Commission to lift the embargo on British beef, and the refusal by France and Germany to apply this decision."
"In the opinion of the French it is clear that if 3,000 cases of ""mad cows"" are still being recorded in Great Britain every year, despite all the precautionary measures which have been taken, then there is something in the transmission of this disease which has not yet been fully understood."
"In these circumstances, our national food safety agency in France, approved by the French Academy of Medicine, considered justifiably that France must maintain its embargo."
"If we did not have this national agency, and if we had replaced it with a European agency, as some people are today requesting, then we would be deprived of objective information, and we would not have this expert opinion on which to base our reluctance."
"However, the fact remains that the governments of European countries, particularly the French Government, have put themselves in an impossible situation by adopting the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The new Article 95, modifying the former Article 100(A), prevents any Member State from implementing, on its own initiative, derogations to Community regulations in the field of public health, and force them to come and request the Commission for any derogations, justifying their case by presenting ""new scientific proof""."
"Well, it is clear that in the ""mad cow"" business, we are not adding any new scientific evidence in relation to the elements which the Commission already has in its possession."
"All we have is an alternative interpretation of the principle of caution: as ever, the Commission places a high priority on the freedom of movement of products, and it is interesting to note that, for once, France is placing a higher priority on the food safety of its citizens."
"It still remains that the inconsistency between the European Decision to lift the embargo and the refusal by the French to do so creates an intolerable situation which, less than six months after the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam, proves the fecklessness of those very people who supported it."
"A few more events like this, and perhaps the French will understand the usefulness of taking at home the decisions which are to be applied at home."
"Recommendation for second reading of the Langen report (A5-16/99)"
"Mr President, in connection with the ALTENER programme, I would like to draw your close attention to the Nordic energy economy."
"The exceptional climate in Europe' s peripheral areas makes its own demands, which the EU has to take account of."
"The use of peat is a bonus in Nordic energy policy."
"For example, the Finnish marshes are an important natural resource, and peat bricks meet approximately 7% of Finland' s energy requirements."
"6,500 people derive their livelihood either directly or indirectly from peat production."
"Up till now, peat has not been classed as a renewable energy source, like wood."
"In fact, peat is a natural renewable resource whose cycle for regeneration is longer than that of wood."
"Estimated emissions from the use of peat as an energy source would decline considerably if the whole life cycle of its use and its renewable nature were taken into account."
"The use of peat is essential with the increase of the use of wood to produce energy."
"Without the parallel use of peat, the volume of planned wood-burning boilers will not be sufficient nor will the operation be lucrative."
"Thus, the exceptional use of peat must be taken account of when examining energy taxation in Europe."
"A healthier and cleaner energy economy requires that peat should be included among renewable sources in the future."
"."
"(FR) As I already had the opportunity to say last March, I am in favour of a voluntarist policy on energy."
"We have gone beyond the stage of the declarations of intent which we heard throughout the last decade, now it is time for the words to be applied in practice."
"It is only on this condition that the European Union will work in this direction."
"It must give impetus to a movement in favour of the rationalisation of European energy policy."
"To this end, two strategies were worked out in two complementary multiannual programmes within the framework programme of actions in the energy sector: SAVE II (promoting more efficient use of energy) and Altener II (promoting sources of renewable energy)."
"The time has now come to renew these two pre-existing programmes."
"The European Parliament must take advantage of the codecision power conferred on it by the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to approve them."
"With regard to SAVE II, the Council has accepted a number of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament at the first reading."
"In addition, a number of amendments have taken into account the recent resolutions of the Council and the positions defended at the time of the Kyoto Conference."
"However, the Parliament wished to re-present some amendments which were discussed in committee, particularly the important amendment on the degree of improvement in energy efficiency."
"In fact, considering that the energy efficiency of final consumption has improved until now by approximately 1% per year, the European Commission advocates a reduction of a further percentage point in the energy efficiency of the final point of demand."
"Even the rapporteur wanted to set a more ambitious objective of more than 1.5%."
"I support this amendment even if I allow that it is necessary in some way or other to measure its potentially negative impact on the ability of firms to compete, especially small and medium-sized firms."
"In order to reach this objective, it goes without saying that legislative measures must be adopted even if they represent just one instrument among many. I am thinking particularly of economic sanctions."
"With regard to Altener II, everyone acknowledges the importance of renewable energy sources in reducing pollution and conserving natural resources."
"We also know of the problems such energies have in gaining ground on the market and the reasons for this state of affairs: traditional energy sources are available at a relatively low, stable price and there is a shortage of measures intended to promote renewable energy sources."
"This is why I approve the amendments laid down by Mr Langen demanding a more active role for the Commission in encouraging a coordinated promotion strategy within Member States and in developing the potential of Europe in the exporting of technologies related to renewable energy."
"In the same vein, I feel it is essential to adopt the charter on renewable energy as soon as possible."
"The vote on these two reports constitutes a pledge to the citizens of Europe of the will of the European Union to protect the environment while reducing our dependence on energy."
"Recommendation for second reading of the Report by Mrs Ahern (A5-15/99)"
"- The political benefit to mankind of genetic research is seriously eroded by vested interests, using the technology in a manner which is not compatible with sustainable development, and every often in conflict with acceptable ethical standards."
"While the EU is committed to closely monitoring and regulating the industry, there is, in my view, a moral responsibility on those involved to agree on standards which it is not acceptable to exceed."
"Experimentation with human genes and more recently attempts to introduce 'terminator technology' which ensures that crops will not produce reproductive seeds represents a frightening affront to the welfare of mankind."
"If it were not for the vigilance of politicians, NGOs, environmentalists and consumer interests, this technology would by now have been foisted on society."
"While I welcome the recent undertaking by Monsanto not to commercialise the 'seed termination technology' , this matter is far too serious to leave to those who are directly involved and who would have acted otherwise in the absence of consumer vigilance."
"I believe both the EU and Member State Governments must further tighten and control the overall operation of the genetic research area and, in particular, the implementation of programmes that do not fully conform to established ethical, environmental and consumer guidelines."
"Recommendation by Mrs Kinnock (A5-20/99)"
". (PT) This agreement with South Africa is part of Community policy on cooperation and development, which aims to guarantee vital solidarity with developing countries."
"But we must analyse the economic and social consequences resulting from the liberalisation of trade for both contracting parties."
"Apart from the fact that this would eliminate customs duties on products of concern to Portugal, such as textiles and clothes, we are also concerned about the specific case of the Davos Agreement on wines and spirits."
"The matter of the ""Port"" official designation of origin is vital to the Portuguese wine-producing sector."
"It would be a very positive thing if South Africa took steps to resolve the problem of its use of this designation, which is both unfair and illegal. In spite of the very long deadlines provided for in the Davos Agreement and of the concessions made in the area of agriculture, the latest available information shows that South Africa is delaying its fulfilment of this commitment."
"On the other hand, it would be an extremely serious matter if this agreement were to be separated from the overall negotiations on the general agreement, as this would cause it to be postponed, with all the damaging consequences that that would entail. This would set a dangerous precedent from the point of view of defending Community designations of origin at the WTO, particularly as far as the ""Port"" designation is concerned."
"This is why I am abstaining from voting."
". (FR) The signature of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa has just been approved by our House by a large majority."
"I can only rejoice at this Agreement, which I, naturally, voted in favour of."
"As a local representative, one of my first acts after being elected as Mayor of Saint-Benoît, in Réunion, was to name one of the city squares after Nelson Mandela."
"It was then 1983, and this purely symbolic act was intended as a fraternal gesture, a hand stretched across the Indian Ocean to the man then languishing in the jails of the apartheid regime."
"Today everyone can appreciate the distance we have come along the road."
"And this agreement, whose signature we are approving, comes at the opportune moment to definitively consolidate the process of democratic transition and economic and social stability undertaken some years ago now by the Republic of South Africa."
"It is in keeping with the tradition of solidarity of the European Union."
"By establishing a free trade area between two bodies at different stages of development, it even takes on a historic aspect."
"It also puts the finishing touches to the implementation of the strategy of the Union with regard to this country, a strategy defined, let us remember, under the French presidency."
"Finally, it is doubtless not without interest to note that the partnership thus cemented with this great nation of the south may contribute to the creation of synergy useful to the European Union within the framework of the delicate negotiations which are about to be opened within the WTO at the Seattle Conference in November."
"For all these reasons, we can only rejoice at the approval of this agreement."
"There is, however, one point to which I wish to draw the attention both of this Parliament and of the Council and the Commission: it is the influence which this liberalisation of trade, even over a ten year period, may have on the economic development of the outermost regions, specifically Réunion, a fully functioning European territory located in proximity to South Africa."
"I did indeed, of course, note the conditions given in Article 23(2) of the agreement, providing for the possibility of making use of supervision or safety measures in the event that the economic development of the ""outermost regions of the European Union"" should suffer serious damage."
"It seems important to me, nonetheless, firstly to have an in-depth study made as soon as possible in order to determine as precisely as possible the possible impact of this agreement on the economy of Réunion, and secondly to establish a permanent mechanism for supervision, establishing the conditions for quick intervention."
"Indeed, failure on our part to remain vigilant could have dramatic consequences for the society of Réunion, which is already seriously affected by unemployment (40% of the active population) and would be in total contradiction to the efforts of the European Union for many years, through the Structural Fund, to promote the economic and social development of the island."
"It is for these reasons that it seems important to me to draw the attention of this House to this essential aspect."
". (FR) The French, Italian, Portuguese and Danish delegations of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group have voted against this free trade agreement between the European Union and South Africa."
"As opposed to what the rapporteur indicated in his presentation of reasons, this agreement is not based on general acceptance of all parties."
"I would like to remind you, furthermore, of its nature which is particularly favourable to South Africa and as a result of the main terms stipulated by this agreement, which applies, let us remember, to a country whose GDP is closer to that of Poland than to that of its African neighbours:"
"Within 10 years, Europe must open its markets to 95% of South African exports, while South Africa needs to open its markets to just 86% of European exports."
"75% of South African agricultural products will benefit from facilitated access to the European market."
"The European Union will eliminate customs duties on 86% of the total volume of exports of industrial products from South Africa to the European Union."
"Products which South Africa considers sensitive will be placed on a reserve list."
"A separate agreement on fishing will be signed, as well as an agreement on wines and spirits."
"In my own contribution during the debates, I personally addressed four questions to the Commission on this separate agreement on wines and spirits and, more specifically, on its Annex 10."
"The answer which Commissioner Nielson gave me was couched in the vaguest possible terms and I am personally very surprised to observe that Parliament has been able today to give the go-ahead to the signature of this free trade agreement, even though the principle of protection of trade names and designations of origin has not been clearly acknowledged in the Annex to the Agreement and that no guarantee has been offered regarding the evolution of zero-rated imports and the consequences of this for the whole of the wine-growing sector in Europe."
"I would remind you that we currently import 320,000 hl in wine from South Africa which will be imported, if this agreement is applied, without any import tax."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I and the fellow members of my group are very worried about the evolution of these free trade agreements."
"For the first time, we are reimbursing a third country which illegally abuses the terms defining our European registered designations of origin, in total contradiction of the TRIPS Agreements."
"This infringement of international regulations, enshrined in an irresponsible fashion in an agreement which is binding upon the European Union, constitutes a dangerous precedent likely to be extended to other States, especially wine-producing countries (Latin America, Australasia, etc.) if they make such a request of the European Union."
"Finally, Mr President, I am worried that we are proliferating preferential agreements, even before the opening of WTO negotiations, which will lead us to reconsider the concept of the most favoured nation clause."
"Report by H.-P. Martin (A5-18/99)"
"Mr President, I am very pleased that the European Parliament is working intensively on the situation of Macedonia, for we must clarify that Macedonia is the European country which is at present most endangered by the instability of its neighbours. On the other hand, it has made exceptional progress in the peaceful resolution of problems with minorities and tensions with the neighbouring countries."
"Hence this country needs massive support, as the new government has shown how it is possible, in a European spirit, to ensure stability in one of the most dangerous regions of the world."
"So, let us give massive support for Macedonia and its reform government supported by both peoples of that country."
"Reports by H.-P. Martin (A5-17, 18, 19/99)"
". (FR) I am opposed to aid whose only objective is to re-establish a market economy, an economy of exploitation, which means that not one cent will go to the population who will continue to live in the same poverty."
"And just because Parliament hypocritically adds the word ""social"" to the expression ""market economy"" , this does not mean anything will be fundamentally changed."
"Besides, the precedent of Russia in the matter of aid under the aegis of the IMF can only make us more distrustful as to what becomes of the money in this sort of aid."
"Conference on AIDS"
". (FR) I am abstaining on the compromise resolution on AIDS."
"The fact that the joint motion for resolution bears my name is an error."
"I was not made aware of the text in the form in which it has been presented, and I do not approve it."
"Precisely because I think that AIDS is an absolute catastrophe, particularly for Africa, I find it inadmissible to conceal the overwhelming responsibility of the governments of rich countries and pharmaceutical trusts in the spread of this disease."
". (FR) We can only sympathise with the fate of a continent where 25 million people will die within the next ten years and which is experiencing, due to AIDS, unprecedented economic and social decline."
"The resolutions proposed by the various political groups are full of good intentions but also great naïveté."
"In them you condemn the ""egotism"" of an industry which respects only the rules of the economic and commercial game which you at best accepted and at worst contributed to establishing."
"You also condemn Western indifference and the paucity of the aid given to Africa for the fight against AIDS."
"But you did not even have the courage of Emma Tuahepa who herself dared to ask the African Governments what they had done and what they were still doing with the money of the Africans."
"No more did you report that none of the eleven African Heads of State invited to the Conference either deigned to turn up or pointed out the importance of cultural and religious factors in the spread of this scourge."
"In the world of the GATT and the European Union, you seem to be only just discovering that the values of sales and finance have taken over from politics."
"Well, Africa will not escape this human catastrophe by means of solutions offered by external sources alone."
"It needs not only the political will of its own leaders, but also the participation of the entire population."
"There is no question of denying the financial needs of Africa."
"It is a question of remaining lucid: manna in the form of Western financial aid, part of which, as per usual, will end up in private bank accounts, will not be enough to curb the epidemic."
"It is necessary, but it is not sufficient."
"And it is all the more necessary as the populations of our own countries are also endangered."
"Our own political leaders are acting irresponsibly."
"In refusing to put an end to immigration into Europe, in refusing to control it systematically, in refusing to impose systematic AIDS screening for candidates for immigration coming from African countries, you are exposing Europeans not only to HIV, but also to a number of opportunistic illnesses, such as tuberculosis, which had nonetheless been eradicated from this continent."
"- AIDS has become a massive development crisis in Africa."
"It is threatening to obliterate decades of health and social development progress."
"It threatens future economic development in Africa as it kills adults in the prime of their working lives, thus decimating workforces."
"AIDS fractures and impoverishes families and orphans millions."
"In other words, AIDS brings untold misery to countless Africans."
"In order to tackle this scourge, health education and welfare resources must be mobilised on a massive scale."
"This assistance should be channelled though local agencies spreading knowledge of the disease, its causes and its effects, and providing preventive and palliative healthcare."
"Turkey"
"Certainly I would wish to explain why despite our reservations about the resolution and its ambiguous character the Liberal Group in the end decided to support it."
"The resolution is at least a statement of our position on our relations with our great neighbour, and for Parliament not to have expressed itself upon this important subject would have been to have failed to shoulder its responsibility as an international parliament, and a sad sign that the policy of Fortress Europe is alive and carries more support than it deserves to inside this Assembly."
"Mr President, on the Turkish question we have this morning heard what I consider to be quite staggering statements from Mr Verheugen, the Commissioner responsible for enlargement."
"Already, during his hearing last month, he had stated that Turkey' s candidacy must be re-examined next December, at the Helsinki Council, and that he, personally, would support it."
"This morning, Mr Verheugen committed a second offence."
"He declared that the Helsinki Council must grant Turkey candidate status and this country must subsequently be treated like any other candidate for accession."
"It is true that Turkey, as such, would have to satisfy the criteria laid down by the European Council of Copenhagen, including the existence of stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, human rights and respect for minorities."
"Obviously, in the short term, Turkey is a long way from fulfilling this criterion. Nonetheless, according to the rather muddled speech by Mr Verheugen, Turkey should be accorded the candidate status to be allowed, in time, to join the European Union."
"For, although it seems necessary to us to associate Turkey to the Union in order to prevent an Islamist breakaway in this country, still its integration, pure and simple, into the structures of the Union in their present form, as the European Parliament has just requested, seems to us impossible."
"It seems to us impossible to integrate into the superstate which is being formed a country which is so profoundly different, and which, in the very short term, will have the largest population and therefore, no doubt, also the greatest number of votes in the Council and the largest number of Members of Parliament in our House."
"One wonders what Turkey would make of this power when we see the downright blackmail we were subjected to on the occasion of our invitation to them to participate in the European Conference."
"In addition, it seems impossible to us to extend the area of free movement of citizens, which the countries of the Union today enjoy, to Turkey."
"In fact, the Turkish question today highlights the inadequacy of the structures of the Union when faced with enlargement."
"It is impossible to integrate Turkey into a European superstate."
"On the other hand, it ought to be possible to associate it to a Europe with a flexible shape, respecting national sovereignty and national boundaries."
"Mr President, we cannot accept Turkey as a candidate for the European Union, because of its attitude of constantly denying the slightest recognition to the Kurdish people."
"This morning, as usual, we have heard speakers from different groups of this House mentioning the Kurdish minority in Turkey."
"It is crystal clear that there is a Kurdish people, as our colleague, Mr Sakellariou, pointed out during the debate."
"The European Parliament ought to realise that there is no Kurdish minority in Kurdistan, just as there is no Basque minority in the Basque country."
"We want to see Kurdistan closer to the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of enlargement of the European Union is the important theme of this legislature."
"Now today, in an isolated fashion, we have discussed and voted on a resolution on Turkey."
"Against the background of this enlargement process, I voted against this resolution."
"Today Turkey, and tomorrow perhaps another country too?"
"The question must be asked."
"I consider it important for this Parliament to stop and think fundamentally about how we actually see Europe."
"How large should the European Union become?"
"Today Turkey, tomorrow Armenia, and the next day Morocco, or is there an alternative concept?"
"I am therefore opposed to extending the established enlargement process now to just any other country."
"My second comment is that in Helsinki the Council will very probably include Turkey in the group of candidates for accession."
"We have told the eleven countries - the applicant States - that when we accord a country candidate status, we are, at the same time, undertaking to allow their accession to the EU. That being the case, this status would be devalued by our according it Turkey now, but declaring at the same time that no negotiations are to take place."
"This is harmful to the process which has been initiated and I do not consider it acceptable."
"I believe that the Parliament has the task here of clarifying what the concept of Europe, which we can finally also call political Union, should be."
"Mr President, I should like to warn our Turkish partner against thinking that all those who voted in favour of the resolution were friends of Turkey and all those who voted against were enemies of Turkey."
"I see things the other way around."
"I would like to see more intensive cooperation with Turkey than previously, the financial protocols being released, and a close partnership, just short of full membership, being put into effect immediately. Those who voted in favour of the resolution, are only contributing to propagating the idea of this unattainable goal of full membership, so that they can take advantage of it to discourage and oppress Turkey."
"I am therefore of the opinion that we need honesty, we must tell the Turks that their dream of full membership is deluded, but everything up to that point must be tackled rapidly in the interests of stabilisation and bringing Turkey closer to European structures."
"Mr President, I would like to make this statement on behalf of the EFA members of our group."
"Although we are aware that the Turkish authorities are making positive noises, still we are not convinced that they signal real change at this stage."
"Their position as regards human rights, the Kurdish question and Cyprus means that we do not yet consider Turkey to be a democratic constitutional state."
"What we want is for Turkey to become such a state The pro-democracy Turks, the Kurds and the Cypriots want this too."
"We must support these forces in Turkey and that is why we want real cooperation."
"Consequently, we have voted neither for nor against this resolution precisely because we are both for and against it."
"So do we consider the prospect of full membership to be a necessary precondition of cooperation?"
"Not so."
"We believe that cooperation is certainly feasible, indeed we believe that such cooperation is actually necessary for bringing about policy that will truly promote peace and development."
"That is something we all have a need for."
"So can we not have cooperation which is made to measure?"
"In any case, geopolitical factors are not sufficient reason for something as radical as full membership of the European Union."
"We believe that a democratic Turkey must be able to speak out about this itself."
"But we also feel that the European countries themselves, that the people must know how far they want integration to go."
"I am very concerned, particularly when I actually hear someone in the Commission, Commissioner Bolkestein to be precise, say that the enlargement of Europe is getting in the way of the deepening process."
"We want a Europe that truly unites peoples and regions and has extensive supranational power, with more authority being devolved to subordinate levels."
"But we believe that these questions need answering first."
"However we feel that Turkey deserves an honest answer too."
"Mr President, I would also like to say that I voted against the resolution on Turkey because it essentially adopts the proposal for granting Turkey candidate status in Helsinki."
"Worse still, the resolution stipulates that the government and parliament of Turkey are making efforts towards democratisation, that they respect human rights and that progress is being made in these areas."
"However, we all know that, at present, the tortures are continuing, the prisons are full and the resolution will be the last straw for those who are fighting within Turkey itself for real democratic change."
"My vote is just as much a sign of solidarity towards the Turkish people as it is to the Kurdish people."
"This resolution will encourage the Turkish regime to pursue and reinforce its policy of oppression not only against the Kurds but also against the Turkish people and to continue its occupation of Cyprus and its intolerance and disdain for UN decisions."
"Finally, it will have a very negative effect."
"The resolution will intensify and deepen the intransigence of the Turkish regime, which is why I believe we should have voted on another resolution - the one recommended by the GUE Group."
"- I welcome the compromise motion on Turkey as striking the correct balance between the need to affirm Turkey as eligible for EU membership and the need for Turkey to undertake a number of economic and political reforms before their application becomes 'live' ."
"There is no question that Turkey has the right to join the EU, nor in my mind that one day it will."
"However, it must build on its recent reforms and ensure that full democracy, respect for human rights and the rights of minorities become the norm in Turkey."
"Turkey must continue to improve its relations with Greece and work actively to find a solution to the Cyprus issue."
"The Turkish Government' s efforts to find a political solution to the Kurdish question are encouraging."
"The commuting of the death sentence on Mr Öçalan and the formal abolition of the death penalty in Turkey would be welcome further steps."
"- (EL) I shall not be voting in favour of the joint resolution on EU-Turkish relations as it contains contradictory policies and arguments as well as a dose of hypocrisy which does not become such a serious political body as our Parliament."
"Even in its first article, the resolution calls for Turkey to be considered eligible for candidate status with a view to eventual Union membership."
"Yet, immediately on from that, there is a series of articles which explain why Turkey does not fulfil the Copenhagen criteria for recognition as a candidate country!"
"If that is not a contradiction, then the draftsmen of this resolution obviously mean that recognising Turkey unconditionally as a candidate country will help it to make better headway towards the political reform necessary to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria."
"In which case, why can we not say this in our resolution?"
"Why can we not make it clear to Turkey that its recognition as a candidate country is an exception to what we demanded from other countries (such as Slovakia), and that this exception is being made for special reasons (which must be clearly stipulated) so as to facilitate its progression towards the necessary reforms?"
"It should stipulate that Turkey' s progress will be monitored by the EC and only then will it consider its actual application for accession into the EU. The fact that we did not do this in this resolution can only mean that either we do not take the Copenhagen decisions seriously, or that we cannot explain publicly, i.e. politically, why we are making an exception for Turkey."
"Alternatively, it may mean that we do not take Turkey seriously in the sense that we recognise it as a candidate country for reasons we cannot make public, but in any case, we have absolutely no serious intention of even helping it to ever become a Member!"
"From what I have heard of other speakers who pointed to certain differences which generally rule out rapprochement with Turkey, this last interpretation seems the most likely."
"I am also totally against such standpoints, which even border on being racist in some cases."
"Europe has everything to play for with Turkey' s accession, and should not mock or underestimate it but should set clear preconditions for a stable and long-term relationship with it with a view to eventual accession into the Union."
"But this will not happen with micropolitical and opportunist sophistry or with endless pirouetting, which favour neither the Union nor Turkey."
". (SV) I would have preferred a different wording for paragraph 9."
"Paragraph 9 - which deals with Turkey and the Kurdish question - is, in my view, far too weakly formulated."
"For decades, the Turkish State has persecuted the Kurdish people and denied them their self-evident entitlement, as a minority, to political, social and cultural rights, as well as the right to their own language, their own schools and their own culture."
"The death sentence upon Öçalan is one more proof that Turkey still does not comply with the EU' s requirements of a candidate country."
"It is also important to emphasise that the KLA must cease engaging in violence and terrorism in order to support a peaceful and political solution to the Kurdish question."
"Turkey may not be regarded as a sound candidate for accession to the EU for as long as basic human and humanitarian rights are not respected."
"I therefore refrained from voting in the final vote."
"Middle East Peace Process"
". (FR) On the occasion of the debate and the vote on the resumption of the peace process in the Middle East, I wish to congratulate the Israeli and Palestinian partners on their courage and their tenacity."
"I also wish to express my satisfaction at seeing Mr Ehud Barak keep his campaign promises and resume the path marked out by Mr Yitzak Rabin."
"I wish to assure my Israeli friends of our support on this course."
"I hope that Europe will be capable of demonstrating intelligence and tolerance, in letting the negotiators get on with negotiations, and refraining from ""preaching"" every time there are one or several more or less serious problems. The way forward has been marked out."
"Nonetheless, there are no other roads possible and, at the end of the road, there will be two States which are each guaranteeing to respect the other."
"I have always had confidence in this."
"Now, of course, I have even more confidence and I support Israel in its attempts more than ever."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Opening of the Millennium Round"
"The next items on the agenda are the statements by the Council and the Commission on the opening of the Millennium Round under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, due to take place in Seattle from 30 November up to and including 3 December."
"Mr President, Members of Parliament, it is a generally recognised fact that the multilateral trading system has, over the last fifty years, guaranteed steady economic growth."
"The EU' s main priority in foreign relations is to establish and strengthen a multilateral trading system."
"The new round on the liberalisation of trade is a necessary and natural extension of earlier achievements."
"The EU has been pushing for a broad-based round of trade negotiations since 1996."
"In spite of the fact that there have been doubts in many countries about the advantages and benefits of a new round, all WTO Members are now very keen to have a new round."
"However, we do not agree on how broad-based the round should be"
"The EU' s great challenge is to now convince the less developed countries and civil society of the benefits of a broad-based round."
"Finland, as the country holding the Presidency, will endeavour to ensure that the final decision on the commencement of the forthcoming round, the form it will take, and its agenda, will be taken at the meeting of WTO Ministers to be held in Seattle in November to December."
"The Union supports the commencement of broad-based WTO talks to take place in 2000."
"A round that is as broad-based as possible will guarantee a balanced end result, which will take account of the interests of all."
"As everyone knows, we will embark on negotiations to follow on from the decisions taken during the Uruguay round, at least on the issues of agriculture and services."
"This will be known as the 'built-in agenda' ."
"Unless we can convince other WTO Members of the advantages and benefits of a broad-based round, there is a danger that the talks will focus on agriculture alone, a matter in which the EU has important interests to defend."
"The EU is also agreed that the outcome of the round must be approved as one package and by all WTO Members."
"In other words, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."
"However, this will not prevent results being achieved more quickly in some areas than others."
"We also have to insist that the results achieved impartially reflect all the views of the Members of the WTO."
"The EU is also united in its call for a round to last approximately three years."
"We have to bear in mind that the EU objective of a broad-based round must fit in with both the United States' sector-based and internally structured agenda and its policy to reduce tariffs as well as more qualified positions on the less developed countries."
"The less developed countries have called for inter alia the Uruguay Agreement to be reviewed and amended to make its terms more favourable to them."
"It is enormously important for the success of the Union' s objectives that the less developed countries are convinced of the advantages of a broad-based round and of the EU' s good intentions behind this objective."
"This means, firstly, that the EU should be able to discuss issues that are difficult for it also, such as dumping and the textiles industry."
"In other words, the EU must be open to the recommendations of other WTO Members."
"The industrialised countries must be able to offer the less developed countries concrete benefits rather than promises."
"The Union has been in the forefront of those pushing for exemption of duty on almost all products from the least developed countries by the time the new round ends."
"We hope that the other industrialised and better-developed countries, in addition to the EU, will give their approval to this objective."
"I will briefly go over the most important topics the EU is proposing for the agenda for the next round."
"It is of fundamental importance that agriculture can be practised everywhere in the European area, including regions where there are special problems."
"It must be made possible to preserve the countryside, protect nature and promote a thriving countryside."
"These form a part of a concept for which we have used the term 'multifunctionality' ."
"As an important exporter of food, the Union believes it is also important to improve access to markets and remove trade barriers in this new round."
"We are also ready to negotiate cuts in aid, provided that the so-called 'peace clause' , and the 'special safeguard clause' remain."
"In addition, we must be able to respond to consumers' worries about the quality and safety of wood, the protection of the environment and the welfare of animals."
"The Union is also in favour of a broad-based WTO round with regard to services."
"We consider that no sector should be excluded from the talks."
"The EU' s position in the talks will be improved commitment to services and a broadening of the existing commitments by sector and by country."
"The EU believes it is important to support the participation of the less developed countries in the talks, with reference to the provisions of the agreement on services."
"The Union believes that a regulated system is of benefit to all, as the effects of unilateral action are avoided."
"We support the fact that the new round of talks will enable new rules to be made and principles agreed in those sectors that are closely associated with international trade."
"These would be questions of the environment, investment and competition, for example."
"Our objective is to review and adapt the rules of trade to meet the demands of a globalised and integrated world economy."
"The WTO rules of the future must be fashioned in such a way that they enable us to take care of the environment and take responsibility for the non-discriminatory treatment of foreign investment."
"At the same time, we must ensure that the special needs of the less developed countries are taken account of and that they are accorded a certain degree of flexibility in the manner in which they adopt the new rules."
"Sustainable development is the common objective of the Member countries mentioned in the WTO Agreement."
"Trade policy and environmental policy must support each other more effectively."
"For that reason, the Union considers it important that sustainable development is the basic principle behind the talks and that the environment is taken into account in all aspects of the round."
"Direct foreign investment has grown faster this decade than trade."
"We wish to create a framework for the non-discriminatory use of investment around the world."
"At the same time that the WTO starts to draft an agreement on investment, which would safeguard the rights of international investors, we think we should also create a mechanism to ensure that investors act responsibly."
"It is important for the Union to guarantee the future work of the WTO in the areas of trade and competition."
"We regard the development of multilateral principles of competition as an important part of the liberalisation of international trade, which we believe will remain limited, unless the WTO can prevent barriers from being erected by private companies and the distortions in trade that they create."
"In these areas also we must take account of the special needs of the less developed countries and ensure that they are accorded a certain degree of flexibility in the way they make progress."
"The Union is strongly committed to the enhancement of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, which include fundamental employment rights."
"The EU therefore believes it is important that the next round pays attention to issues relating to the social dimension of trade."
"We must remember, however, that the less developed countries are strongly opposed to the discussion of so-called standards of employment in the WTO."
"They fear that debating basic rights of employment in the WTO is an attempt to undo the advantages they enjoy as a result of low labour costs."
"It is naturally fundamental to the WTO talks that they should be transparent."
"If we are open internally we are strong and credible externally."
"We think it is important that Members of Parliament participate in the meeting of Ministers at Seattle."
"As the country holding the Presidency, we shall see to it that Parliament is kept informed and we shall take its views into account to the best of our ability."
"It is also worth noting that communications with NGOs have strengthened both at Community level and within the Member States."
"We are living in a historic age."
"We will be in a new Millennium when the round of trade talks commences."
"While the new Millennium will bring with it challenges for the WTO, it must also reflect development."
"Including new subjects for discussion by the WTO is the answer to today' s challenges."
"They can have an impact on the progress that we hope for."
"It is the objective of the country holding the Presidency that the draft conclusion of the Council should be approved in the General Affairs Council Monday."
"Immediately after the General Affairs Council, I will be reporting in detail to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 12 October on the common position of the Council in the light of the approved conclusions."
"Finally, to describe the conclusions briefly, they will by nature be primarily an expression of EU political will, containing a vision for the new Millennium."
"The conclusions will be directed at the public at large, and they will reconfirm at the same time the common objectives of the EU to commence a round of negotiations that features different topic areas."
"Thank you very much, Mr Sasi."
"Welcome"
"I would like to inform the House that an official delegation from the National Institute for Public and Social Administration in the People' s Republic of China, under the direction of Mr Wang Zhongyn, Member of the Council of State and Secretary General of the Council of State Affairs, is now seated in the official stand."
"This delegation is visiting France as part of an exchange programme between the National Institute for Public Administration and the Ecole Nationale d' Administration in Paris."
"I would like to offer you all a warm welcome and hope your visit to our Parliament proves fruitful."
"Opening of the Millennium Round (continued)"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Mr Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the development of world trade in the last 50 years is a success story."
"In the last 50 years, trade throughout the world has increased by a factor of 17, and has expanded by more than twice the level of macroeconomic production."
"Increased prosperity and the creation of jobs in Europe are an important consequence of this."
"Freer and fairer world trade within the framework of a strengthened multilateral world trade system formed a successful foundation for this."
"Progress to an exceptional extent and at an exceptional rate in the globalisation of real activity now makes further development of this multilateral body of regulations, which was based on GATT and is now the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, imperative."
"The focus of the Millennium Round is this objective."
"A comprehensive European Union Strategy, which embraces all the areas concerned in a dynamic way is being proposed by the Commission and, I feel I can already say this as a rapporteur, is widely supported within the European Parliament."
"We are defending the European Agricultural Model, food production, the maintenance of farms as family businesses, preservation of the countryside and environmental protection in equal measure."
"This Millennium Round should not be characterised by a defensive attitude towards the American position on imports of agricultural and genetically modified products into the European Union. Instead, the European Union should be finding confederates for its dynamic global strategy."
"The usefulness of globalisation should be measured against its usefulness to the regions and nations of the world equally, so that a better balance is achieved between the interests of the European Union, of the other European States, of the USA, of other industrial countries, and newly industrialised and developing countries."
"The framework now available to us, established with the World Trade Organisation in 1995, must be developed further in this direction and its instruments must be perfected."
"The essential bases for negotiations and solutions mentioned in the Commission document of July 1999 have so far met with a predominantly positive response in our discussions within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Today, I would like to touch briefly on our guidelines for content. In November, we have the opportunity to discuss this again in detail."
"Our draft resolution will predominantly include the dynamic elements which the President of the Council and also Commissioner Lamy have already mentioned and which will include our ideas on the improved incorporation of financial services, on investment and competition policy within the framework of the WTO, on the further reduction of duties on industrial products and on the improved integration, indeed the ""mainstreaming"" , of environmental and consumer protection in the body of regulations of the World Trade Organisation and vice versa."
"The protection of copyright must be improved in many developing countries."
"Labour standards should be taken into account more in the world trade system, and our markets must be opened more to developing countries."
"There are still, however, some outstanding questions regarding the cooperation between the Council and the Commission, on the one hand, and with the European Parliament, on the other hand, within the scope of the Millennium Round."
"Let me stress one thing at the outset. The European Parliament gratefully accepts this dialogue with the Commission and hopes that this dialogue will also include the Council."
"It will represent its position within the framework of its resolution, which will certainly be adopted in November, in an energetically coherent but also responsible manner."
"You can assume, Mr Sasi, as President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Lamy, as Commissioner, that in the position determined in our November resolution we will present ourselves as energetic and coherent both to you and to our partners in the Millennium Round."
"We shall strive thereby to be true to our responsibility as the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe."
"Secondly, we are assuming, a previously justified assumption, that the Commission and the Council are representing the interests of the European Union with equal coherence."
"The strength of the European Union as the largest trading power in the world resides in its joint position, which is represented by all elements."
"We are therefore somewhat concerned to hear rumours that in the Council, even before the start of negotiations, some delegations are now ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about some fundamental aspects of the Millennium Round which my party considers to be important."
"My colleagues will deal with this in greater detail from their own respective points of view."
"The new round of World Trade negotiations which will open in Seattle on 30 November, offers the opportunity to partially extend the blueprint for world trade, in some fundamental aspects."
"The round will automatically take on a symbolic character and should contain a clear message from the European Union."
"Our aim must be to achieve growth, employment and prosperity for everyone, and at the same time to reduce the poverty which exists throughout the world."
"The concept of opening up the market further only makes sense if everyone is able to profit from it."
"What we need is a new sense of direction, which leads to a reconciliation of trade and social components, without thereby setting up new barriers of discrimination by means of a concealed form of protectionism."
"We therefore have to ensure that social and employment standards, standards for health and food as well as env0ironmental considerations form an essential part of the negotiating package."
"The new WTO Round may lead to a further push towards globalisation which will make many people anxious."
"We must make it clear that everyone has something to gain from an open system of world trade."
"As far as this is concerned, it is particularly important to establish improved integration of the developing countries into the world economy and into the multilateral world trade system."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists particularly supports the Commission' s attempt to combine the concepts of globalisation and sustainable development."
"This is the only way to ensure that the basis for world trade is formed in a balanced and socially just way."
"We also agree with the Commission and the Council, in that this round of negotiations must be comprehensive, that is, one that includes all subjects."
"This is the only way to guarantee a sensible consideration of the specific advantages and disadvantages. This is also the only way that the interests of the European Union and of its citizens can both be assured."
"This time, the European Union must show that it is in a position to play some role in these marathon negotiations, if not a leading one."
"It would be disastrous for the European side to respond passively to the current weakness of the American political leadership."
"This is an appeal particularly to the Council to come up with a united European position and to the Commission to express complete confidence that a comprehensive mandate for negotiation will be granted in time, which will allow it to be submitted officially to Parliament for approval at the same time."
"Only if the European Union is strong at the negotiating table, will it be able to ensure that, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, there will be a better balance in the globalisation process, between the European and the American models for liberalisation."
"Comprehensive information and transparency are necessary to win the public' s confidence in and agreement with the new negotiating rounds."
"We particularly welcome the consultation with unions and non-governmental organisations."
"Confidence is also essential because the continuing development of the European Model amongst other things depends on what scope for arrangements national and regional administrations will have in the future."
"Just consider that the World Trade Organisation is a leading player, if the leading player, in shaping global economic processes."
"Only by combining transparency, the involvement of the public and official, extensive means..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to signal our strong support for the efforts of both the European Commission and the Council to persuade our international partners of the virtues of a broad-based new round of WTO talks, covering a wide range of issues."
"In order that the right compromises can be made between the different and complex issues facing the international trade system today it does indeed seem essential that the talks should cover a comprehensive agenda from traditional tariff reductions to crucial issues such as the environment and labour standards, and new topics such as competition and investment."
"You can count on large parts of this Parliament to give you robust support when arguing against those who may wish to confine the round to no more than a narrow series of sector-specific commercial trade-offs."
"I also welcome the openness with which Mr Lamy has commenced his working relationship with this new Parliament, and I also welcome his support for changes to the Treaty in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the common commercial policy."
"It would be a benefit to the Union as a whole if the Commission and Parliament could increasingly stand together in international trade negotiations."
"However, if the European Parliament is to play a new and more responsible role it must be given greater access to the information governing trade issues than is presently the case."
"New responsibilities should be accompanied by new rights."
"For that reason I would like to ask the Council two specific questions."
"First, the Commission has already stated that it has no objections to the inclusion in the conclusions which will be adopted at Seattle of wording on the role of the European Parliament in the conduct and completion of the new WTO round."
"Could Mr Sasi confirm the presidency will draft such new language?"
"Second, could Mr Sasi confirm that the presidency will come forward with new proposals to facilitate the fullest possible provision to the European Parliament of documents discussed in the 133 Committee in the Council, accompanied, if necessary, by special procedures to protect confidentiality?"
"Since Mr Sasi has kindly agreed to come to the meeting of the European Parliament' s Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 12 October, I suggest he presents his formal response to both these points at that meeting."
"If we could move forward on those two points, I feel both the accountability and legitimacy of the European Union' s negotiating position in the Millennium Round will have been significantly strengthened."
"Mr President, I believe that the question that concerns all of us here is not whether or not multilateral rules are necessary to provide a framework for world trade."
"We unanimously recognise the need for such rules."
"The problem, in my view, is to know whether the World Trade Organisation is functioning on the basis of rules which are equitable and able to help the world, and not just Europe, to progress towards sustainable development."
"The replies that I have heard from the Council especially, and to a lesser extent from Commissioner Lamy, make me think that it is begging the question."
"We have started from the hypothesis that there is clearly no contradiction between these two objectives and therefore the desire is to extend the field of competence of this organisation without having answered, through reasoned argument, what seems to me to be a fundamental question."
"We have five years of experience from which we can say that, in a certain number of significant cases such as hormones in animal rearing, bananas and GMOs, the record is far from brilliant."
"We note that the consequences are negative upon the functioning of the European Union' s policies and also, I feel able to say, those of certain developing countries."
"Also, we note a lack of action on the part of the European Commission when it senses the possibility of conflict with the WTO."
"We therefore in advance give in to certain demands which may be made by trading partners in order to avoid conflicts."
"So much for internal policies."
"As for foreign policy, I think we should insist on the fact that we do not only have commercial commitments, but we are also bound by multilateral agreements on the environment and international conventions on respect for human rights and that these commitments, in my opinion, an opinion which I believe is shared by many colleagues, have a value on both an ethical and a political level which is more important than free trade."
"We believe that these values cannot be called into question by the functioning of the WTO."
"We have no choice but to state that there is contradiction at the very heart of the texts of the WTO, the agreements and the statutes. Two principles form the basis of the functioning of the WTO."
"On the one hand, the prevention of discrimination between products for which the production processes are different, that is to say in particular the environmental or social conditions under which the product is produced. On the other hand, the fact that it is necessary to reduce to a minimum the negative effects on free trade of any political measure aimed at public health, the protection of the environment or social protection."
"These are two examples of the basic principles of this organisation which go against the objectives which we are trying to defend."
"In conclusion, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we believe that an evaluation prior to any expansion of the competences of the WTO is essential and that, otherwise, we are doing nothing more than applying a liberalist ideology."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Lannoye that it is a question of rules, but the question is - which rules?"
"Unfortunately, all the indications available to us show a desire to turn the future negotiations of the WTO into a further stage in the imposition of rules of liberalisation on a global scale."
"The European Commission has in fact announced, in its communication in July, that it wishes to liberalise new services, such as health, education, but also investments and public contracts."
"This wave of liberalisation is clearly justified in the name of the general interest and employment, as you stated, Mr Lamy, in your hearing, indicating that the progressive opening up of markets, both for goods and for services, is in the interest of the Community."
"However, it is not the results of the liberalisation initiated at Marrakech which are going to calm the fears which you spoke of just now."
"Did the Union make a serious appraisal in Marrakech?"
"What I observe is that the poor countries are trapped in wretched circumstances and that here we are seeing an increase in unemployment and instability that goes hand in hand with huge profits."
"We are seeing great mergers and take-overs on a European and global scale."
"Yesterday and today, the employees of Michelin have been here, in this Parliament building, to dramatically illustrate this idea which governs relationships on a European and world scale."
"Financial viability comes first."
"But what about the human beings?"
"What about thought?"
"What about nature?"
"What about solidarity?"
"I do not believe that the choice is between liberalisation and protectionism."
"I am reassured by the fact that the MAI has been rejected, which shows that intervention is possible."
"A front could be developed to demand a change of direction."
"To this end, this Parliament has adopted an amendment from my group which requested a review of the mechanisms of the WTO and the rules procedure, in order to take more account of social, health, environmental and cultural questions."
"Today, 1,800 organisations are addressing us and calling for changes to the system."
"Developing countries are demanding a review of the previous agreement."
"I am also pleased to see that an Intergroup on WTO issues is about to meet."
"With my group I have taken the initiative to organise an open meeting on these matters during next November' s part-session."
"Many people expect the European Union to stand up in these negotiations for the values of cooperation, solidarity and the pre-eminence of human beings, as against financial values and the dictates of the market."
"Mr President of the Council, Mr President, Commissioner, the communication of the Commission to the national parliaments is extremely revealing with regard to the profoundly antidemocratic workings of the main European institution and of the conditions under which the new round of multilateral trade negotiations will be approached."
"The Commission claims peremptorily that for 50 years, this GATT and WTO system has contributed to stability and the pursuit of economic growth, with all the advantages which result from them."
"A malicious mind may point out to the Commission that this phrase destroys our illusions since we thought - and God knows we have heard it enough times - that it was to the construction of Europe that we owe these fifty years of stability, economic growth and the peaceful settlement of disputes etc.. However, a purely curious mind may ask the Commission what it thinks of the continuous decline, decade after decade, of the average annual rate of growth in developed countries."
"According to the OECD report, the average annual growth rate of OECD countries was +5.2% between 1961 and 1969, +3.9% between 1970 and 1979, +2.6% between 1980 and 1989 and +2.1% between 1990 and 1996."
"These statistics hardly support, and this is putting it mildly, the idea that the progressive dismantling of barriers to trade, after the eight rounds of negotiations from the early fifties until 1994, have favoured economic growth."
"Would it be too much to ask the Commission to communicate to us the relevant economic studies on which it bases its current recommendation to proceed to a new round - as Mr Lamy has said - of dismantling?"
"Would it be impertinent also to ask the Commission whether it has taken the care to ascertain whether the possible projections which it established on the launch of the Uruguay Round have been achieved?"
"Could you give us written documents containing figures, sources and dates?"
"It is, to say the least, strange that the Brussels Commission, at the point when it is inviting the Member States to give the green light to the immediate launch of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations, does not feel the need to make an appraisal of the WTO which is the least bit objective, particularly of its provisions for the settlement of disputes."
"Is the Commission really more modest than our friends across the Atlantic who regularly weigh up the pros and cons of a procedure?"
"Is this a procedure you hoped and prayed for?"
"It is noticeable, furthermore, that in reality it is above all the Americans who achieve a certain degree of success within the system which has been put in place."
"I will not go on, given the short time allotted to me."
"I would however like to say this: unless we are blind and have no idea what is being said and what is happening on the other side of the Atlantic, we cannot help but be struck dumb by the similarity between the terms used by the Commission and the words of President Clinton."
"The opening of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations is first and foremost a decision of the President of the United States of America, who himself has set the tempo - I translate: accelerated negotiation, a tight agenda - and the objectives ...."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I would like yesterday' s speeches in this House to be checked in order to see how many speakers exceeded their speaking time, by how much they exceeded it and who was allowed to do this and who was not."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens understand only too well that the agreements resulting from the Millennium Round will seriously affect their personal and professional lives."
"The Uruguay Round offered producers and consumers a fait accompli."
"Let us not allow this to happen again."
"Look around."
"The farmers are justifiably concerned for their future and it is our duty to listen to them."
"Repeated food scandals, the dictates of large-scale distributors, the European desire to give handouts to the agricultural world, we have been spared none of it."
"This is the logic of globalisation ordered by certain people who should now be called into question."
"Otherwise the Millennium Round will become the death warrant of our farmers, our countryside, our land, and this is something that we must not accept."
"These negotiations should be aimed at the promotion and prosperity of our peoples and not simply at the defence of the great financial powers."
"We must leave behind this ultra-free trade logic which standardises the market."
"It does not guarantee the fair defence and promotion of our interests, which are European interests because they are primarily local, regional and national."
"It falls to us to ensure the continuity of our employment, our production and our quality of life."
"Europe will thereby find its justification."
"The current situation shows that we are liable to incur retaliatory measures, while we simply intend to protect ..."
"(T he President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, international trade and a new international division of labour are a major resource in terms of economic growth and freedom for the 6 billion plus human beings who are now crowding the planet."
"No freedom exists that is not also the freedom to trade and the freedom of movement."
"In my opinion though, in this context of international trade and also in the Millennium Round, there are well founded risks that Europe will hang back and will not instead take on a role as a leader of civilisation, a leader which wants to guide, within the scope of clear rules for everyone, the changes in international trade in 2000."
"In the first place, these risks must be averted for the good of the European citizens."
"I am thinking, for example, of the excessive emphasis on the social protection clauses and social dumping when we know full well that these will be mere words which nothing can come of. They will not lead to effective checks and for developing countries and recently industrialised countries, this can only represent the protectionist sword of Damocles which can be used when the old Europe, the old Europe of bureaucracies, of union bureaucracies and industrial decline is in a fix."
"Another point concerns audio-visual production and cultural production."
"I think that this protectionism which is felt in Europe - in France and Italy - is completely out of place and obsolete."
"We need only think of how the Internet represents the chance to disseminate audio-visual and cultural products."
"To insist on protectionist values means imposing low quality audio-visual and cultural products on the European citizens, which are almost always state-controlled, and financed and aided by the public purse."
"I think that European citizens have the maturity and the right to make choices in this area too, from within the supply available on an international level."
"I would like to contribute to this debate by making three remarks of the following nature - general, specific and political."
"Firstly, a general remark."
"From the outset we should be in support of this round, we should have a positive outlook to ensure that we can avoid protectionism, promote free trade and extend prosperity in the world system to other parts of the world."
"It is a pity that Mr Pasqua has gone."
"He said that there was no debate in this Chamber, but I would refer him to results of the economies run by Britain and the United States where they are achieving in a world trade system high rates of growth, low rates of unemployment, low rates of interest."
"The French economy and one or two other continental countries could learn from that particular experience."
"Might I say too, in terms of the general debate, that the communication of the Commission has indeed laid down four major principles for the Agenda of the round which we fully support in my Group."
"Not least we support the need to have a comprehensive round because if the round is as broad as possible, we will be able to make progress in the end."
"On specifics, there is one comment I would like to make about agriculture."
"Quite clearly, this is going to be one of the most sensitive areas to be investigated, in terms of export subsidies, in terms of the vital need to maintain the rural areas, but also in terms of food safety."
"These are three of the main issues which the round will have to deal with."
"It may be, Mr Commissioner, that the Commission together with the US administration could come up with some kind of Green Paper sketching out where the differences are and where the common interests are between America and Europe because as you know, in your previous role, unless America and Europe agree on the major outlines in an international round such as this, we will never conclude."
"And therefore, maybe an informal document such as this would be useful for Seattle."
"Lastly, of a political nature, there are a number of networks and non-governmental organisations now which are indeed in favour of world trade and would like to take a responsible part in these negotiations."
"There are others, which are much less responsible, more militant in nature and likely to be present in Seattle."
"It is for those reasons that, if we want to ensure that consumer and social and labour issues are part of the agenda, we must ensure that these networks do not actually take over our agenda."
"We therefore need, I believe, to have a large parliamentary delegation in Seattle from this Parliament at least equal in size to that of the US Congress to make sure that we can represent what the views of this House are there as well as being able to ensure that as this negotiation takes place on non-tariff as well as tariff issues."
"These are legislative problems and therefore legislators need to be present."
"I therefore endorse those colleagues who have said that we should have a strong parliamentary presence."
"The three institutions of the European Union must cooperate and it would be very interesting to have the both the Council' s and the Commission' s view on the need to have a strong European parliamentary presence in these negotiations."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Erika Mann has given a good - if rather brief - summary of the Group of the Party of European Socialists' current position on the Millennium Round, so I shall not dwell on it any further."
"I just have two observations which I would like to share with the Council and with the Commission - and they are two sides of the same coin."
"These are, to be precise, the need to include our citizens in this important exercise, and to deal with their legitimate concerns."
"My first observation concerns the need to include the European Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations."
"This is not simply a matter of making a claim for this institution, and nor is it a childish desire to be in the limelight."
"It is a question above all, of ensuring that the problems that this round poses for our citizens can reach the European Union' s negotiator at all times, as we have seen from what previous speakers have said, as well as the solutions that these citizens expect of the negotiators."
"This is the only way to ensure that these demands reach the Union' s representatives."
"And these demands will have all the more force if Parliament presents a united front with the Commission and with the Council."
"This therefore, is my first observation."
"My second observation justifies my first request and that is that our citizens' main concerns are heading in an apparently opposing direction."
"On the one hand, we are perfectly aware that this round should not result in empty words, but should instead provide a net benefit for everyone, especially for the developing countries."
"On the other hand, our society has legitimate concerns about the challenges that the phenomenon of globalisation poses for us: respect for human rights and of fundamental social liberties, the protection of the environment and the preservation of nature, as well as the protection of our consumers' health."
"My question to the Council and to the Commission is this: how can we reconcile these two apparently contradictory issues?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the WTO must guarantee the purity and quality of food."
"For that reason, with the meeting at Seattle drawing near, the EU must not be too modest in its demands."
"Europe wants to practise a social and sustainable agricultural policy and, above all, produce food which is pure and of good quality."
"That is why the environment, people' s health and that of animals, and the question of fairness must be a proper basis for the talks."
"The agenda for the negotiations must be broad in scope from the outset."
"The European agricultural model has to be forcefully promoted in the talks."
"The quality and purity of food cannot be put into jeopardy as the result of a liberalised market."
"In future, food production must be able to comply with the principle of caution."
"In addition, I think it would be best for all if food could, in the future, be produced near to where it is to be consumed."
"Regional food chains would help us to monitor the quality of food in the best way."
"The EU must take an aggressive stance to defend its own sustainable course of action."
"Furthermore, others must take account of the protection of the environment and health in their own production processes, if trade is to be liberalised."
"Mr President, wealth is just as unevenly distributed throughout the world as it ever has been."
"In the last five years, since the WTO was set up, the differences have become even more marked, and those countries which cannot count themselves amongst the leading industrial nations have become even more dependent."
"That is why we do not need new rounds on liberalisation, instead we need a fundamental analysis and evaluation of the effects of the Uruguay Round on countries, people and the environment."
"The WTO Round of Ministers is the right place for this."
"A fundamental reform of the institution itself is also called for."
"Transparency, democratic control and the equal participation of all countries, amongst other things, must be guaranteed."
"Now on the subject of agriculture: if we stay on our current course, as the Commission and the USA would like, farmers with small- and medium-sized holdings will be the ones to suffer, both here and also in developing countries."
"They cannot be made to compete with one another."
"That is why better conditions for entering the market must be obtained for developing countries and at the same time, all export subsidies for farm products from the EU should be withdrawn."
"The recognition of safeguarding food as a 'non trade concern' according to Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture must also be accepted."
"A whole raft of Southern countries is quite rightly demanding a renegotiation of the TRIPs Agreement because they are losing the right to use their own resources."
"We are also completely against the patenting of living things."
"We must also refuse to accept any agreement similar to the MAI agreement on investments alone at a WTO level."
"Other international institutions such as the UN and the ILU must unite on this issue."
"By combining their forces they would be able to say that the welfare of all people will come to the fore in Seattle, and not the interests of big companies, of the rich and powerful such as well as the interests of the European Union and various elites and oligarchies."
"The Commission should not accept a mandate for negotiation which goes against human rights, social rights and the environment."
"What developing countries need, as they are not equally strong economic partners, is a special position laid down by agreement, and this should be the rule, not the exception."
"It is not only to them that we owe this, but also to all of us here."
"Mr President, we really would like to believe the assurances given by Mr Sasi and Mr Lamy on Europe' s aim in Seattle to limit the harmful effects of further liberalisation without rules on multilateral trade under the usual stars and stripes flag of globalisation."
"We would like to believe them, but bitter experience prevents us."
"Take, for example, Mr Lamy' s predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, whose commitments in this Parliament to oppose the American steamroller were often disregarded - just think of the case of Helms­Burton and the WTO."
"We realise that times have changed radically, and that awareness accompanied by protests is spreading across the world and that the slogan 'what is good for big business is good for the world at large' is no longer shouted from the rooftops."
"Let us hope that what we have heard today is not just a public relations reaction, a placebo, or a tranquilliser."
"Mr President, globalisation needs a leader."
"It is clear that the World Trade Organisation has removed barriers from commercial activities, meaning ideological barriers have been broken down which has helped peoples to communicate with each other."
"But liberalisation cannot be an uncontrolled process, but must be steered by rules which will safeguard the specific values of each people and the characteristics of each country."
"We must therefore also defend European agriculture and the traditions of those typical products which also encompass the textile sector, shoe sector and industry. We must remember that the demise of certain products also means a change in traditions or even landscapes - just think of olive oil, hops and malt."
"Another requirement is to guarantee food safety."
"We cannot, in the name of freedom of trade, allow non-approved products to circulate."
"Hormones in veal are not a very good recipe. So removing barriers must not include removing the safety and quality of products."
"The last imperative is to prevent small businesses being eliminated."
"Let us ensure that the Millennium Round is not a round in which Europe gets knocked out."
"Mr President, in the Millennium Round, concern with further free trade ought to be combined with concern for poor countries, employees' rights and the environment."
"Unfortunately, the Commission' s proposals in important areas such as agriculture and TRIPS reflect an old-fashioned trading policy designed to promote one' s own export opportunities at the same time as retaining protectionist arrangements within the EU."
"It is not therefore difficult to understand why developing countries form the impression that the EU' s policies in other areas are just as heavily characterised by our own interests."
"If the negotiations are to cover employees' rights, the environment, consumer protection, investments and competition, the EU must send out a clear signal that common interests are being given priority over and against our own narrow interests."
"For developing countries, this must mean free access for all goods, compensation for rising prices for basic foods, exemptions from the TRIPS agreements and a situation in which the EU removes the subsidies which result in unfair competition, especially in connection with agricultural products."
"Mr President, this new round of negotiations poses a question of principle, a question of method and a question of content."
"First of all with regard to principle, why have a new round?"
"There has already been Tokyo, Kennedy, Nixon, Uruguay!"
"Has humanity gained anything from them?"
"If the rounds had not taken place, would we have been worse off?"
"The MAI has not been signed, the transatlantic contract has not been signed!"
"Yet, there has been no catastrophe."
"On the other hand, the GATT has been signed and there are still 18 million unemployed people in Europe."
"The NAFTA has been signed and Mexico has been bled dry."
"Scientifically, free trade is like the independence of central banks."
"There is no conclusive scientific evidence as to whether it is good or bad."
"We are not in a domain of science but in a domain of belief."
"It is basically as if in Seattle on 30 November the Church of Globology was going to meet."
"That means that the method is important."
"It is important that the Council monitors the mandate of the Commission, so that Blair House may not happen again, and that both the States and public opinion monitor it."
"This is because in France the sickle has revolted against MacDonalds and the Millennium has come out of hiding."
"As regards the content, there will clearly be a lot of questions."
"The question of services, audiovisual, social and environmental questions, developing countries and, of course the agricultural question, with the risk that Europe will behave like Bambi and Walt Disney."
"Europe will no doubt obtain labellings and traceability, it will be able to play with blue boxes and green boxes, but it will give in on the important points, that is, the internal support for the farmers and the Community preference."
"Mr Lamy, you have not even mentioned the term ""Community preference"" , hence our reservations regarding this round."
"To participate in these cycles, you have to be some sort of a cyclist."
"The only problem is that it is the people who do the pedalling and the very poorest who most suffer from the punctures."
"But it is true that we still have the strength to bear the evils of others!"
"Mr President, as my colleague Konrad Schwaiger, the general rapporteur, said, the framework for the agricultural negotiation must be the CAP, reformed in the context of Agenda 2000, as laid down at the Berlin European Council."
"However, I would like to emphasise four particular points."
"Firstly, the only way that the European Union can maintain a fighting stance in these negotiations is to lay the truth about the state of its agriculture on the table."
"The reality of this is one of multifunctional agriculture, which combines its economic function with preserving the environment and the countryside and which guarantees that the whole of our territory remains populated."
"This reality has a name: it is called the European agricultural model."
"Bearing this in mind, the European Union will not be able to accept any measure that might put it in jeopardy."
"Secondly, the European Union can only consent to enter into negotiations on the issue of agriculture if it is made clear that free trade is inseparable from fair trade."
"And for this reason, the WTO cannot confine itself to commercial matters, but must also address fundamental issues such as the quality and safety of food, animal welfare, the protection of the environment, and respect for consumers and their views."
"Thirdly, the European Union must put on the table the precautionary principle, which means being able to take exceptional steps to protect our consumers."
"There should be no more trade reprisals merely because we have sought to protect our consumers, as we did in the case of the battle over hormones."
"Fourthly, we must be aware that although European agriculture as a whole comprises many specific elements, it is also deeply heterogeneous. That is to say, the European agricultural model is a plural model."
"To this extent, special measures should be advocated for those areas whose survival is at greatest risk, particularly those with small farms, and the poorer regions."
"Mr President, agriculture will therefore still be one of the main subjects of the next round of WTO negotiations, and our European institutions all seem to agree that we should seek the recognition of our European Farm Model, protect the consumer, and treat the Berlin agreement as the framework of the Commission' s negotiating mandate."
"We now have to benefit from this coherence in the face of our competitors, our partners in the WTO."
"In this respect, we should make it clear that anything that can be done to inform, sensitise and mobilise public opinion, will strengthen the determination of our negotiators in the eyes of the Cairns Group, the United States and developing countries."
"We can already see that the pressure of our civil society can have contagious effects in our competitors' camp."
"The proof can be found in what is currently happening in the United States, for example, with regard to GMOs."
"It is therefore necessary, as an extension of this matter, and with the aim of creating a favourable balance of power within the WTO, to debate, to communicate throughout Europe regarding the direction to be given to globalisation and the liberalisation of trade."
"For us Europeans, the aim of this globalisation should consist of reconciling economic competitiveness with a global development which is more balanced, more durable and better distributed especially between North and South."
"With regard to agriculture, we should establish a system for trade in agricultural products which is fair, based on the market certainly, but also on more general considerations such as public health, the environment, employment and balance between territories."
"It is in light of these objectives that there is good reason to carry out, without delay, an intermediary appraisal of the application of the Marrakech Agreements."
"Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, these aims should naturally form the basis of the principle of the global application of the agreement, which should take precedence in the negotiations."
"Commissioner, the half-heartedness of the Commission alarms me and I would say that, perhaps, one suggestion should be taken on board: avoid the capitalist trap, be offensive and, if you will allow the expression, ""be liberal"" ."
"I would like to ask the Commission if it can commit itself to a firm basis comprising three main points."
"Why not commit yourselves to humanist values and dare to say that we must recognise the fundamental social standards defined by the ILO?"
"Why not require quality standards on a global level, and therefore demand the same rights and the same responsibilities of all economies and businesses?"
"Why not argue for diversity on an international level and demand, for everyone, a cultural exception and an agricultural exception?"
"Finally, a wish and, in any case, a will."
"I do not think it is good for the European Parliament to accept the possible position of the Commission and then leave it to the end of the round to pass judgement."
"We must always work alongside the Commission, but also see to it that the Parliament is not just a ratification Chamber, but may make its point of view count."
"Mr President, as stated in the introduction to the Commission' s report on the draft communication to the Council and the European Parliament, in public opinion today, there is, fortunately, growing concern, engendering much debate, about the impact of the liberalisation of trade on employment, on the distribution of wealth, on the environment, on health, consumer protection and cultural diversity, as well as the increased marginalisation of poor countries."
"These concerns are shared and (...) by our group."
"We are not in favour of increasing the competences of an organisation lacking democratic structures, as is the case with the WTO. Nor are we in favour of interaction (...)."
"What we want instead, is the World Trade Organisation to be officially reformed so that it complies with the Convention on Human Rights and with the conventions of the ILO."
"We particularly want economic and commercial measures for the development of poor and marginalised countries."
"In any case, I want to say that the Millennium Round negotiations must not harm the basic elements of the European Agricultural Model. Neither must they harm the reforms which in addition to Agenda 2000, are necessary for protecting the development within each State of the number one objective which is local, family-based farming in the face of the interests of big industrial companies which have huge powers of distribution."
"Finally, we are asking this Parliament to participate, as well as the Commission..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I believe that what is being considered here will probably be the most serious international agreement ever."
"It is therefore all the more depressing for me that, so far, no comprehensive evaluation of the consequences of the Uruguay Round has been made."
"During our discussion on food safety yesterday, I wondered how we are really doing on the safety issue, as few of today' s consequences have stemmed from the deregulation which has already begun."
"The fact that the mandate for negotiation has barely been discussed in national parliaments I find all the more unacceptable."
"I think that it is shameful that we must accept that many developing countries who are contractually bound within the framework of this discussion to take part and above all who are directly concerned, for financial reasons cannot sit down at the negotiating table at all. It is also shameful that so little of the proceedings will be open to the public."
"If there is one thing then that I would call for, in the short time I have left, I would wish that this Parliament, across all Parties, guarantees this openness to the public, and that there is transparency and intensive discussion."
"Mr President, I had almost decided against speaking in this debate."
"Why?"
"Because when I hear the Council, Commission and Members of Parliament talk in this way it really does put me in mind of courting hedgehogs: afraid of needling each other and knowing that when it comes down to it we appear to agree on all the important issues, that is to say the social issues that Mr Hansenne talked about before and which I shall enumerate again: sustainable development, culture, the precautionary principle in food safety, agricultural affairs, development-related matters and animal welfare."
"Mr President, that would only require a day' s work, which is why I believe it is appropriate to call upon you to consider this one point: all these courting hedgehogs will soon be gathering in Seattle; how does the European Commission intend to keep them communicating?"
"I think there are two things which will achieve this."
"Firstly we need to see to it that Parliament sends a strong delegation which will ensure that national interests do not play a part."
"Secondly, Mr President, I hope that Mr Lamy will see to it that everyone continues to be aware that if the WTO is of importance to us, if it is of importance to Europe then it is also of importance to our other trading partners."
"What is more, they must remain aware of the fact that the WTO can only serve an important purpose if every Member State ensures, and also continues to understand, that the interests of one State alone cannot be allowed to prevail, rather the interests of Europe as a whole must always be served by these negotiations too."
"Mr President, the advantage or disadvantage of speaking late is that much of what I was going to say has already been said, so I will just reinforce three general points."
"Firstly, we must resist the pressure for a narrow round of debate, wherever that comes from."
"We need a broad round, we need comprehensive negotiations to get a package that has something in it for everybody."
"Secondly, throughout these talks we will be very much in the public eye."
"The days of negotiations on technical matters behind closed doors are gone forever."
"People are watching, NGOs are watching, businesses are watching environmental concerns, health, animal welfare."
"So I am very pleased that the European Commission is tomorrow having a consultation with NGOs in Brussels."
"That is very good news."
"Thirdly, many have spoken about the need for a balanced approach."
"We must have a balanced package."
"It is not just about trade, it is about international and social justice, it is about environmental concerns."
"But neither can we, as some in this House would wish, forget job creation and wealth."
"That matters to the public too."
"It is going to be hard to get that balanced package, but the public expect it of us and that is what democratic, responsible government is about."
"We have to do it."
"Finally, I am pleased to hear the Commission and the Council mention the needs of the developing world."
"It is very important that we give them more than warm words as we enter the new millennium."
"Let us hope that in the next century we shall see something other than stories of Africa going backwards in terms of economic development."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is reassuring to know that in negotiations as important as those with the World Trade Organisation, the Fifteen Member States have adopted a common position in order to establish, in the area of agriculture, stable ground rules which will allow fair trading on the world scene and to face the challenges of the new Millennium with a clear purpose. We can do this because we have based our position on those adopted at the time from the agenda of the agriculture agreement of the Uruguay Round and at Agenda 2000 in Berlin, as well as on maintaining the multifunctional nature of agriculture"
"To these basic principles, I think that we should add the strategic value of agriculture in some regions of the European Union with strong exports, which furthermore were given particular recognition in the Amsterdam Treaty, such as the so-called outlying regions. These should be given special consideration in the Millennium Round negotiations so that the decisions taken in Seattle safeguard their agricultural interests and guarantee their cultural, economic and environmental survival, particularly after the Cologne Summit."
"This is why it would be useful to remind the Council and the Commission of the problems these regions face, and to make another of the negotiations' aims safeguarding the..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am concerned by the statements on the so-called Millennium Round."
"They say that we should extend our policies of liberalisation to an ever-greater number of sectors and countries, including agriculture and services essential to development and essential to improving the quality of life of our citizens, such as education and health."
"The President of the Commission made his intention clear when, in his speech during the investiture process, he said that it was necessary to continue restructuring the single market and to promote liberalisation. He specifically emphasised the continuation of the process of liberalising the goods and services sectors."
"This means that we are no longer only in the process of liberalising the exchange of goods, as happened with GATT."
"The multinationals now want to go much further. They want to take over public sectors which are essential to our citizens' lives and which have until now been the responsibility of the State."
"This is a very dangerous road to go down, as the consequences of applying the WTO rules have shown, causing as they did, an increase in social inequality, unemployment, and world poverty."
"It is vital that the forthcoming negotiations do not go any further down this road, but take the road of solidarity and cooperation instead."
"Mr President, yesterday we held a debate here on the strengthening of food safety in Europe, while conflicts on the precautionary principle are taking place within the Union and in parallel, the Americans are pursuing unjustified retaliations."
"The situation in the agricultural and food-processing sectors has become more serious over the last few years, although we were theoretically covered by the Uruguay Round and the Marrakech Agreements, which were supposed to guarantee and organise access to the market, support for exports and internal support."
"So you will appreciate, Commissioner, our concern at the apparent absence of shared views within the Union before the beginning of the negotiation, while the United States seems very determined to oppose the European system of subsidies, while skilfully absolving themselves from flexibility payments."
"In fact negotiations cannot get under way seriously until we persuade our partners and competitors to recognise the European Agricultural Model."
"It is this model which, based on the Community preference, guarantees product quality, food safety and the survival and development of our agricultural and food-processing sectors."
"Commissioner, we have been happy to note your answers to the committee as well as your words at the beginning of this sitting."
"But we would like to know whether you can tell us how the Americans have reacted to the European position in favour of extending the peace clause beyond 2003."
"Could you also tell us whether the United States are demanding compensation or the disappearance of the green and blue boxes which amused Mr Martinez so much but which are absolutely essential for our farmers?"
"Finally could you tell us whether you consider that the conclusions of the Berlin Council on the reform of the CAP are an inviolable basic element in your eyes or whether they are under threat in the new negotiations?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the short time I have left, I would just like to make a few key points."
"What do we need to do in terms of form?"
"We must change the process for the settlement of disputes within the World Trade Organisation."
"We must make it more transparent, clearer and more accessible to the public."
"This is one of the most important conditions necessary for ensuring that areas such as the protection of the environment and of the consumer are given their rightful place, and are not ridden roughshod over in some panel."
"Concerning the areas that are included, Mr Lamy, the most important of all is the precautionary principle."
"I have already said this on many occasions."
"We must take the precautionary principle from the trade agreement on plant health and apply it to the Agreement."
"So what then do we really need?"
"We need policies on the environment and health to be important and proper components of the Agreement."
"The achievements of the World Trade Organisation' s committee on trade and the environment are not enough."
"It has not so far fulfilled its duties and must be penalised."
"It must be given a clear timetable so that it can give support to the various projects."
"What are the most important areas that we really have to deal with?"
"We must do what the Commission itself asks."
"We must make the whole World Trade Organisation more open, more democratic and more transparent and we must ensure that the whole contract underlying it can be subjected, as you yourself say, to a study on its environmental acceptability."
"We must examine production methods that are not tied to products and we must have an overview of the situation."
"I am convinced that this Parliament will not ratify another agreement in which the precautionary principle, consumer protection and health policies do not play an important part."
"Mr President, a great many people are concerned about the social consequences of a new wave of trade liberalisation."
"These fears must be taken into account and must appear in the agenda of the Millennium Round negotiations."
"However, neither on the creation of the WTO nor at the Singapore Conference were we able to persuade our partners to discuss them."
"We must draw lessons from this failure and, with determination, present a credible and coherent position."
"Above all determination: there will be no balanced negotiations if we are not able to debate these issues, and our citizens will not understand if we dare to start these negotiations by immediately giving up this essential issue."
"In order to succeed, we should take a credible stance."
"In 1994, in Marrakech, and in Singapore, in 1996, we were unable to convince many developing countries of the validity of our concerns because we presented them in the form of a social clause."
"We failed because we presented ourselves with a negative and punitive image."
"Since then things have changed."
"Last year, the Member States of the ILO - and amongst them our own countries - adopted a declaration on the principles and fundamental rights relating to work."
"We all undertook to respect the principles which create a genuine social dynamic in each country."
"We promised to support the efforts of developing countries to fulfil their commitments. We do not wish to sanction but rather to assist."
"Not to assist for the sake of assisting, but to assist so that the commitments may be met."
"To this end we must ensure that there is suitable and effective cooperation between the ILO and the WTO."
"We must finally give substance to the agreement reached in Singapore on the cooperation between the secretariats of the two organisations, in order to guarantee the positive implementation of the declaration."
"We must also adopt a coherent position."
"If we are willing to help our partners to build with us genuine world-wide social foundations, we must tell them what efforts we are willing make to this end. A more attractive incentive system involving preferences and a programme of specific and generous cooperation may contribute to this."
"A clear and strong sign in this direction on the part of the Commission and our governments must be prepared and announced in Seattle."
"Mr President, I think the Commission did well to stress in its communication, the important point that what we are going to open in Seattle is a round of world talks."
"It will mean difficult and complex talks, during which we must always keep at the forefront of our minds the strategic interest that is fundamental for the European Community."
"We are the largest exporter in the world and so we are involved more than any other area on the planet with the push towards the abolition of barriers which hinder development of international trade."
"Developing international trade means making a substantial contribution to European economic growth, which the countries of the Community really need."
"I think that this is an irrefutable situation which Mr Pasqua' s anti-American arguments, which are at least 30 years old, cannot bring into question."
"Naturally, we have to defend the values and principles which are fundamental for the countries of the Community, but we have to do it in a shrewd and flexible way. We must also keep in mind that first of all, we need to develop that strategic interest that is fundamental to the liberalisation of international trade which I spoke of a short while ago."
"I therefore think that this is neither the place nor the time to be erecting barriers."
"I think that Parliament' s involvement in the course of the talks and its cooperation with Commissioner Lamy will bring about results that are appropriate for this objective."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about an area in which there is a large deficit, and to state that I recognise the advantages of further liberalisation."
"But I would like to see balance in world-wide trade."
"The tried and tested European Model must be maintained, with, for example, our high environmental standards and consumer protection, including our socio-economic measures."
"Against this background several maritime aspects must be considered in the WTO negotiations, even if the fishing industry does not have as much weight as agriculture."
"I shall now mention three of these aspects."
"Firstly, Europe has been allocated fish imports."
"Each measure that weakens our European fish-processing industry means large-scale job losses, mostly in regions which already lack infrastructure."
"The valuable assistance that the Commission and the European Parliament have so far guaranteed, through various market and regulatory instruments, should not be sacrificed at the altar of absolute liberalisation."
"Secondly, international fisheries agreements benefit the exploitation of waters outside Europe and give support both to European fishermen and to the development of third countries."
"I do not call this protectionism."
"But without public support, these agreements would not be feasible."
"What we must do here is to look beyond the confines of absolute liberalisation, in order to guarantee the many jobs which are dependent on a balanced and regulated world market."
"In the future, the principle of partnership must be strengthened on a global scale."
"But this does not mean that free trade must be proclaimed to be the golden calf."
"It must be brought into line with other important aims such as environmental protection and sustainability in the fishing industry."
"The WTO negotiations must also deal particularly with ensuring that the products we want to market world-wide will still be available when we finally get around to discussing them."
"Mr President, even if the European Community is a passionate advocate of the new round of negotiations within the framework of the WTO, in the course of what will probably be the last big push for liberalisation, we should not ignore social issues."
"Participation in prosperity, a healthy environment and healthy working conditions are by far the best investments for a good future."
"Following the 1994 Uruguay Round, we expected to see greater prosperity through higher growth for the ACP countries."
"Growth was to a large extent achieved, but according to studies by the OECD and the UNCTAD, standards of living at the lowest levels have not changed at all."
"In fact, what has happened is quite the opposite!"
"It cannot make sense to have a policy of increasing our prosperity while making poor people poorer."
"This is why we should not miss the last chance to demand that the seven most important core employment standards, which were ratified in the IAO agreement, be made checkable social clauses."
"This does not imply a new form of protectionism, but is to do with standards of fundamental rights with which employees suffering discrimination can protect themselves. This is a human rights issue and we must strive for this minimum standard."
"Once we have these things, we can offer the ACP countries positive incentives to do the same."
"There is a whole raft of ideas on this in the Commission' s report."
"If we do not succeed in having the social components included, the last great step in achieving liberalisation will not work."
"I expect greater commitment on the part of the Council on this matter."
"Mr President, Mr Sasi, the liberalisation of world trade is preparing to take a big step forward at Seattle."
"With European integration, the EU has grown into a major global influence on the economy, for which only a broad-based round of negotiations will make it possible to ensure steady economic growth."
"Of all the important issues on the agenda for the talks, the liberalisation of trade in services is the most challenging."
"The European Union is the world' s largest player in the field of trade in services."
"Services account for the largest share of GNP in the European Union, and, what is more, that share is growing all the time; and that is good."
"One of the greatest barriers to free trade in services is the lack of any global set of norms relating to tendering for contracts in the public sector."
"International companies must have converging opportunities to make tenders for contracts, and the public sector must be opened up to international competition."
"Furthermore, the rules of global commerce must be defined to safeguard the rights of the market operators."
"Similarly, we must substantially develop a scheme to gauge the international comparability of rules of copyright."
"The main aim of the talks is to ensure the quality of services on offer."
"If the European markets are opened up, any external agent offering services must meet the same high standards that exist in Europe."
"Any monitoring mechanisms used to check levels of quality must be clear as to their principles and as open as possible with regard to the communication of information."
"It is especially important that the fast growing services of the information society become subject to an agreement."
"The advantage of the development of the modern trade in services in Europe is that it maximises the benefits of increased commercial exploitation of information technology."
"Electronic shopping must clearly be made easier, and regulation and taxation in this area must be kept to a minimum."
"At the talks we must be able to ensure that electronic shopping remains free and dynamic, and guarantee the possibilities for developments in electronic shopping in Europe in the next Millennium also."
"Mr President, I would like first of all, to ask a question of the Council and the Presidency which concerns transparency: when will the European Parliament receive the draft final declaration which the Finnish Presidency has tabled in the Council?"
"It would appear that this long and detailed document is currently under discussion in the Council and between the Council and the Commission."
"It is the real mandate for negotiations which the Council is preparing to give to the Commission."
"We would like the European Parliament to be genuinely involved in the preparation of the negotiation mandate and, to this end, this text should be made available to us."
"Secondly, I would like to mention one of the most important points in future negotiations: the question of services."
"Not all services can be put on the same level."
"For us, for example, human health is not a piece of merchandise."
"Certain services should continue to stand out amongst public services and general interest services."
"I am also thinking of education."
"Elsewhere in the world, others have made a different choice and have reached a situation where you are asked for your bank card on entering a hospital before they will treat you."
"This is one choice, but it is not ours and we do not want a situation where tomorrow, in Europe, the inclusion of services in the scope of the WTO leads to the rules of competition and market openness being applied to sectors such as health and education."
"This would mean the dismantling of our social model."
"This would mean changing from a market economy to a market society."
"The best guarantee for our public services is to place them clearly, and from the outset, outside the scope of the negotiations, as has happened in the case of the cultural exception."
"I would like to finish - and this is not unrelated - with the question of investment."
"May I remind you, the European Parliament has rejected the MAI, and we should not let the very thing that we turned away from our door yesterday, when it came from the OECD, today get in through our window coming from the WTO."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, Mr Sasi, the Millennium Round will, out of necessity, have to promote forms of cooperation and integration between the World Trade Organisation, the International Labour Office, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. This is so that the liberalisation of trade will be accompanied by renewed stability in the money market, by wide-ranging policies on human resources, by social protection networks and by widespread compliance with the fundamental regulations on work."
"Only in this way will it be possible to remove the mutual accusations of social dumping and protectionism."
"With the solemn declaration of June 1998, the 178 Member States of the ILO undertook to promote the four fundamental rights of work: the right of association, respect for the minimum working age, the prohibition of forced labour and the suppression of discrimination."
"Out of this came an indirect definition of fair competition so that social development will not be compulsorily suppressed for competitive purposes."
"More recently, the express hope came out of the G8 meetings in Washington and Cologne that the ILO' s solemn declaration will be implemented."
"Support policies must therefore always prevail over sanctions."
"In this regard, Europe can constitute a reliable point of reference, and this is also thanks to its model of the social market economy."
"The Commission, backed by Parliament, must therefore commit resources to assisting developing countries and transitional economies, construct modern social protection systems and efficient job markets."
"This is the ideal, political message which the united Europe will be able to take to Seattle, confirming the traditional function of dialogue and integration between developed economies and developing economies or those undergoing changes."
"Mr President, in today' s Financial Times the Secretary-General of UNCTAD reiterated that there remains persistent bias against developing countries in the multilateral trading system."
"In these deliberations we need to be absolutely clear that developing countries are not asking for an ambitious programme in this round."
"They are asking for compliance with the commitments which were made under the Uruguay Round."
"They have not, for instance, seen the benefits for their textile and clothing industries, neither have they seen benefits from the liberalisation of trade in farm products."
"What they want to see first are the good effects that could come from the Uruguay Round."
"Developing countries are preparing for Seattle, and preparing to be very busy."
"They are saying that market access alone is not going to be a panacea enabling them to achieve competitiveness and integration into the global economy."
"We need to acknowledge that all these fine objectives will demand that we support the supply side in developing countries, because they simply will not have the capacity to deal with these fine objectives."
"It is also necessary to see the elimination of agricultural export subsidies and a new WTO clause to cover the need for food security in developing countries."
"Also, a social clause - which many people have mentioned - should be jointly managed by the ILO to ensure that some of the susceptibilities we all know about are dealt with."
"Finally, Commissioner, when you deal with WTO rules in your deliberations, I would ask you also to remember that we have enormous duties and responsibilities under the Lomé Convention."
"Mr President, production in the European Union has grown by just over 3% per year in the last few years."
"Trade in recent decades has decreased by an average of 6% per year, service exports stand at 9% and foreign direct investments are at about 12%."
"This shows very clearly what our priorities must be."
"Our number one aim, which is full employment in Europe, requires an improvement in our competitiveness and is being decisively formed by these developments."
"My priorities for the WTO negotiations are firstly, electronic commerce, the area with the greatest potential growth rate, and in which Europe is actually very competitive."
"In this area, we want to see electronic transactions and supplies made officially exempt from duty in the long term."
"We want to avoid ways of looking at the situation that differentiate between traditional and new services as the way in which a transfer of goods or services is effected does not change the nature of providing a service. We also want improved access to markets in non-EU countries for goods and services, and in the telecommunications services which give the necessary support to electronic commerce."
"Secondly, telecommunications."
"Well-developed networks and fairer competition have a generally positive effect on a country' s economic performance and employment situation."
"The forging of international alliances opens up new markets, and as a consequence brings about a covert and strengthened sense of competition which is to the consumer' s advantage."
"But there is also a need for transparency in this area."
"Liberalisation is a prime example of a job creator."
"Through liberalisation, hundreds of thousands of new and supplementary jobs have been created."
"My third point is TRIPs."
"The effective implementation of this agreement should safeguard the equality of status between material and intellectual property."
"Mr President, many NGOs have signed the declaration opposing the Millennium Round, the WTO and Seattle."
"We are no longer in a position to leave the concerns of citizens and various organisations off the Seattle agenda, which means that the European Parliament and the Socialist Group also have an important role to play here."
"This role must be focused on making a positive contribution during the negotiations."
"A contribution that has due respect both for trade interests and the interests of citizens."
"We must succeed in having the best of both worlds, even when it comes to the sensitive area of consumer and environmental protection."
"The political question is always about the division of responsibilities between the WTO, the European Union, national governments and the consumer."
"There are various answers to this question."
"In the United States, more responsibility rests with the consumer."
"Here in Europe, the government tends to bear the responsibility and we rely on legislation."
"Many conflicts over environmental and consumer protection could be avoided by the effective application of the precautionary principle."
"According to the Rio Declaration of 1992, it must be scientifically proven that a new product will have no damaging effects."
"This evidence must then be provided before the product can come onto the market."
"Mr President, the significance of the Millennium Round and world trade on economic and employment policies and for the European economy in general, which is now the largest trading partner in the world, cannot be emphasised enough."
"This means that it is particularly important that the European Union clearly states its opposition to any attempt to promote a new or even an old kind of protectionism."
"It must contribute towards developing a type of administrative interdependence for interdependent national economies, and it must also contribute to a global concept of economic management."
"The most important thing we need to do is to establish international rules for competition."
"These rules for competition are all the more important because it is actually not very useful for the development of the European economy to have rules for competition here which do not apply throughout the world."
"I am thinking here of huge mergers, amalgamations, price cartels and cartels within a particular field."
"It is not acceptable that the 100 biggest companies in the world share things out between themselves, and all we can do about it is react but not actually play a role in it."
"That is why we need a catalogue of minimum standards for international rules for competition which must be laid down in national rules for competition."
"What we need above all are independent competition authorities in all the countries that are members of the WTO to implement these minimum standards for competition regulations."
"Whether a procedure for the arbitration of disputes will one day turn into an international competition authority is a question that should be left open for today."
"Mr President, I am just going to talk about one subject."
"This is a subject Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already spoken of: the procedure for conflict resolution."
"When the Uruguay Round ended in Marrakech, the World Trade Organisation brought in a compulsory system of settlement of disputes, but the procedure they used was one inherited from the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade."
"This was a procedure led by groups of experts and informal bodies."
"The result of this is that now, the European Community is handing over to an international organisation its obligation to find a solution to its international disputes with no guarantee that it will be treated with sufficient impartiality."
"For example, the first dispute about bananas was resolved by a panel, that is a group of experts, presided over by a former American senator, when the plaintiff was the United States of America."
"And secondly, closer to home, the Commission needs to set its own affairs in order because now, the Commission services responsible for putting its claims to the dispute settlement body of the World Trade Organisation are completely toothless."
"I would therefore expect from the Commission and from the Member States that in the new draft of the World Trade Organisation text, an independent and impartial system for settling disputes will be established, which will not push us into the path of an oncoming bus as has happened in the past."
"I think our deliberations today have been very much about the key issues of environment and agriculture and also the social clause issue, but I want to bring to your attention the specific needs of the cultural industries and the audiovisual sector."
"It is particularly important, in considering these areas, that we look at the problems that challenge us in these sectors: for instance, the growth rate, presently 13% in the EU, which probes the capacity and the reach of negotiated rules; as well as their complexity."
"To take, for instance, the convergence of the telecommunication industries, audio and computer technology, which I feel pose fundamental questions regarding the way in which we produce and consume these industries."
"But much of this will depend on the detail as concluded in the negotiations themselves."
"I want to use the opportunity of the Commissioner' s presence here today to propose - in the light of the exemptions we already have in the European Union for the audiovisual industries, which give us room for manoeuvre, which give us also the ability to evolve with the industry and to make a gesture in the direction of an even playing field vis-à-vis the US - that, in constructing the infrastructure for the negotiations, we should be flexible enough to accommodate our needs here in Europe."
"At the same time, I also recognise that we need a negotiating arena that is both robust and realistic."
"So I would advocate that, in terms of our position here in Europe, we need to ensure that our industries move forward in a way auspicious to achieving the potential that they undoubtedly possess."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank everyone for this lively exchange of views."
"I would also like to thank Parliament' s large groups for the positive attitude they have of both Council and Commission policy."
"In my opinion, Commissioner Lamy asked the essential question in his excellent speech: is the liberalisation of world trade of any benefit to us?"
"In the opinion of the Council, it most definitely is."
"It offers us economies of scale, which means obviously cheaper products for consumers."
"In addition, it offers the opportunity for economic transparency, and it can be clearly shown that in open economies, democracy and human rights fare better."
"It also furnishes trade with clearer rules and transparency to prevent bureaucracy, malpractice and bribery."
"We could say on the whole that we are not at the moment working for prosperity, democracy, human rights or integrity."
"Here in Parliament, there is also cause to remind everyone that the basic idea behind the Union was to create a common market."
"We have a single market, whose objective is peace and the creation of prosperity."
"For that reason, it is quite natural that the Union should want a more open market for the world economy also."
"Central to the round of talks will obviously be the question of democracy, human rights and the environment."
"It is important that we try to find positive incentives for less developed countries to develop their own systems."
"I have to say that the Union' s own generalised Preference system is an excellent tool."
"But these incentives can be created outside the information system, for example, for the World Bank system and elsewhere, where they can function effectively."
"When transparency and democracy is spoken of in the WTO, I would like to remind you that decisions are taken unanimously in the WTO."
"Consequently, it is certain and clear that democracy is also established there."
"I would also like to stress that cultural diversity will be a very important issue for Europe in the talks."
"In questions of agriculture, the fundamental principle will obviously be the Agenda 2000 solution that we achieved, and that solution has to be defended."
"We have been asked here to predict its outcome, but it would be quite wrong to assess the outcome in any way at this stage, or at least to say anything about Agenda 2000 that might be off the track."
"But it is important for us to remember that a broad-based round is also, for this reason, of benefit to the Union."
"I would also like to remind everyone that the Union enjoys important benefits in the area of agricultural exports."
"I believe that if we develop our own production, the agricultural produce of the EU Member States will become competitive, not necessarily with regard to just price: we also have to bear in mind quality, and especially the fact that we are taking responsibility in our own area for food safety, whose importance to consumers will essentially increase in the future."
"The role of Parliament has also been discussed here."
"The Council also wishes in future to have an exchange of opinion with Parliament - here in the part-session, and, likewise, on the Committee."
"We will try our best to take account of the opinions that have been expressed in Parliament while formulating our own positions."
"As for the documents discussed in the 133 Committee in the Council, we will furnish Parliament with all the information it requires as well as the documents insofar as the Union' s own acts allow."
"I wish to refer to the fact that during the previous parliamentary term a written question was presented on these procedures and a written reply was issued on the subject also."
"As for the number of Members of Parliament to be present at the talks in Seattle, it has to be said that what is most important is that we have a body of people that can work in close cooperation with one another and between whose Members information can freely circulate."
"My experiences of other rounds and the number of MEPs present were positive, so this could serve as a basis for estimates of the number of Members required."
"I do not intend to touch on all the subjects which we have debated, but I would simply like to thank the speakers - or at least most of them - for their support and to reply to some specific points or some of the questions posed by the speakers."
"First question: can we, or should we analyse the impact of something like a round on the economy or the environment?"
"I believe that in the case of the economy, it is not necessary, even if it is not an exact science, because the majority of economists consider, for reasons which have just been indicated, that the liberalisation of trade is the right direction to take."
"It is less obvious in the case of the environment, so much so that the Commission has taken the initiative to carry out a study of the environmental impact of the round which we are about to launch. One could therefore ask why we have not done the same in relation to the Uruguay Round."
"We did not do it because at the time we had not thought about it, we did not have the means and to do it now on the basis of the Uruguay Round does not make any logical sense."
"On the other hand, we have begun to do so for the next round."
"It is not an easy task and furthermore I think that the Union is a pioneer in this field."
"It is clearly possible to improve the mechanism for the settlement of disputes!"
"Let us remember however, between ourselves, that, on the whole, the results of the application of the mechanisms put in place after Marrakech are absolutely correct from the Union' s point of view, with regard to the relationship between the number of cases we brought against other parties and the number of cases brought against us, between the cases won and the cases lost."
"If we look at the statistics and try to consider the exchanges in question, the results are satisfactory."
"It is true that I have not mentioned the term ""Community preference"" ."
"I am not superstitious and, from the moment that it appeared in the treaties and I was made responsible for developing it, I have not felt the need to repeat it constantly."
"To my knowledge, the United States have not yet given their opinion on the problem of the peace clause which takes us to 2003; we will clearly have to address the question of knowing what we will do after that."
"With regard to the interpretation of the European Council of Berlin, which has, on this point, expressed its agreement on what has been called Agenda 2000, I have said, and I repeat, that it seems to me to be a good basis for discussion."
"With regard to the possibility of developing countries gaining access to the techniques of commercial liberalisation, to the WTO and its panels etc, it is true, as has been said, that this poses a problem, that this objective is not yet within the range of many of them and that the use of these complex mechanisms is reserved for those who have the means, hence our proposal of technical assistance (which is furthermore mentioned in the Commission' s document), so that these countries may themselves possess and use the necessary legal technology."
"As for the problems of health and education, we do not think, we do not foresee and we do not wish to call into question the public policy objectives in these areas within the proposals on the liberalisation of services in the next round."
"Finally, with regard to the representation of the European Parliament, I have already said, and I repeat, that the Commission is absolutely clear on this issue."
"We believe that to have the Members of the European Parliament, who are so well informed, by our side, in a negotiation of this type, is a trump card for us and hence for the Union."
"I have not therefore changed my opinion on this."
"We are aware that generally we work under your supervision and, sometimes, with your support."
"On the question of the number, I consider this to be a matter which is in your hands and I would not presume to interfere."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy."
"The debate is closed."
"Climate change"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the forthcoming global conference on climate change, from 25 October to 5 November 1999 in Bonn: implementation of the Kyoto Convention."
"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to inform Parliament of the work of the Council and its views on climate policy."
"Climate policy is one of the greatest of all the environmental challenges that exist on a global basis, and I believe that it will continue to be so throughout the next century."
"Climate change will have immense social and economic effects."
"Obviously, the more we allow the climate to change, the greater these effects will be."
"One issue that people are just becoming aware of is the likely effects of climate change on health."
"Many researchers believe that the increase in the number of storms and flooding are a sign that the climate is changing."
"Obviously, these have a direct effect on people' s health."
"But still more significant are the indirect effects of climate change that stem from changes in the ecosystem."
"It is predicted that, for example, warmer and drier summers in many areas will mean smaller harvests."
"It is also predicted that, as a result of warmer climates, many diseases spread by what are known as vectors, such as those spread by insects, will increase."
"It is predicted, for example, that malaria may spread to southern parts of Europe and the United States."
"Ultimately we could also have a situation where a new type of gap emerges between rich and poor: the health gap."
"This is just one example of the dramatic effects that climate change could bring with it."
"For that reason, it is vital that we prevent, or at least slow down, climate change."
"The agreement that was made in Kyoto is an important step forward, but one that does not go nearly far enough."
"It is important to realise that beyond the commitments of Kyoto, new commitments have to be made in order to sufficiently slow down climate change."
"But in spite of that, achieving the commitments made at Kyoto will take a lot of effort and a significant change to the way the problem has been dealt with up until now."
"The European Union' s action consists of two main areas. One is the Union' s own action to reduce emissions, and the other is the work of the Union in international negotiations."
"The Union' s own action and the action taken in the Member States at national level to reduce emissions are essential in order to maintain the international dimension."
"It is worrying that, according to a report by the European Environmental Agency, the 'business as usual' attitude will lead to an increase in emissions in the Union and not the reduction of 8% by the year 2010, to which we are committed."
"This means that new policy action is needed."
"One of the most important objectives of the Finnish presidential term is to achieve first sector strategies for energy, transport and agriculture."
"Without such strategies it will not be possible to achieve the reductions in emissions we are committed to."
"I believe it is important that a continuous process should emerge from these sector strategies, i.e. that we should not be content with the first versions but that at regular intervals sector strategies in the areas of transport and energy, for example, should be reviewed and targets should be set that are ever more ambitious."
"In my opinion, what is most important in international talks is to resolve issues that are still open, enabling us to start to ratify the Kyoto Protocol so that it may come into effect and become binding."
"It is Finland' s objective at the Fifth Party Summit at Bonn to make decisive progress in the creation of rules relating to the Kyoto mechanisms and rules for monitoring the agreement."
"Our aim is that, ideally, the Fifth Party Summit should produce a draft agreement, which will obviously have sluice-gates in it, but which will enable us to adhere to a timetable, thus making it possible to conclude the agreement at the Sixth Party Summit, meaning that progress in the Party Summit this autumn is essential."
"One of the most difficult issues is the main role played by the less developed and the industrialised countries."
"As the country holding the Presidency, Finland will also work to ensure that climate policy and development policy support one another."
"We also have in the Development Council conclusions being drafted on the connection between climate policy and development policy."
"It is important to bring technology, for example, to the less developed nations."
"The most important mechanism here will be the Clean Development Mechanism."
"So that the transfer of technology and resources to the less developed countries can start to work we need rules for the CDM. But it is also important for the Union that the agreement on all three of the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms - the CDM, International Emissions Trading and Joint Implementation - make equal progress under the agreement."
"The 50% ceiling proposed by the Union for the use of the mechanisms has attracted harsh criticism from other negotiating parties to the agreement, which means that this will be a very difficult issue in international talks."
"Finally, I would like to say that the Commission' s communication on preparations for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol is a lucid document and a good start, but it mainly contains measures for the initial stage."
"It will also be essential to draw up a longer-term programme."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the UN' s climate convention was adopted in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the European Union showed itself to be a strong world leader."
"It did the same when the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997."
"It is my ambition to ensure that the EU retains this leading role in combating climate change."
"The European Parliament has already had an important role to play in taking this work forward."
"I also welcome the resolution which has been presented here today."
"The political challenge is enormous."
"Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is still not within reach."
"A lot of rich countries with unacceptably high emissions of greenhouse gases are hesitating."
"What is more, the highest increases in emissions during the next two decades will take place in the developing countries."
"Within the EU, too, the trend is in the wrong direction."
"Emissions have increased dramatically in recent years, especially within the transport sector."
"It is important that the EU is expected to be able to stabilise its emissions of greenhouse gases at the 1990 level by the year 2000, but that is not enough."
"If we continue as we are today, we shall not be able to honour our Kyoto commitment to reduce emissions by 8% over the period 2008 to 2012."
"The trend is not good, whether in terms of sustainable development or the EU' s international credibility."
"How are we going to meet this challenge?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I have already stated during the European Parliament' s hearings, combating climate change is one of my most important priorities."
"I shall be proposing the measures required to achieve results in this area."
"Allow me to outline now what, in my view, are three essential components of an effective and comprehensive climate change strategy."
"Firstly: if we are to be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we need to adopt a strategy which includes concrete measures in different areas."
"A number of sectors and interests must be involved in this work."
"In order to achieve this, I shall be launching an action programme to combat climate change at the beginning of next year."
"My idea is to bring together all those concerned: technical experts, representatives of business, non-governmental organisations and other important players."
"The object, of course, is to reap the benefits of cooperation and to try to reach a consensus on practical measures which the Commission can propose to the Council and Parliament."
"A programme of this kind may form the basis for further measures."
"An important part of these measures will be to spread knowledge and make better use of the enormous advantages which new technology offers."
"Great capacity exists in the form of renewable energy sources, new vehicle technology, energy-efficient equipment and machinery which is waiting to get onto the market."
"Up until now, we have not been using this potential sufficiently."
"We must alert private individuals and business to the fact that this new technology, in many cases, also holds out the prospect of financial gain."
"The market for these technological solutions must be extended through the introduction on our part of a mixture of clear rules and financial incentives."
"Secondly: I intend, during the spring of 2000, to present a Green Paper on the trade in emission rights within the EU."
"I am aware of the fact that there are still hesitations when it comes to using so-called flexible mechanisms."
"I am nonetheless convinced that, if they are regulated as part of a system with clear and effective conditions, such mechanisms will contribute to our being able, in a cost-effective way, to achieve the reductions in emissions which we need."
"Thirdly: in addition to these measures, we must also implement changes in areas which influence emissions of greenhouse gases but which lie outside the range of environmental policy."
"I am thinking mainly of sectors such as the energy, transportation and industrial sectors."
"We must therefore make sure that the integration strategy which was adopted in Cardiff in June 1998 produces results."
"The discussions which are to take place in connection with the Summit in Helsinki in December will in many ways decide how these sectors might contribute to combating climate change."
"Many people say that this will take time."
"That is quite true, but it is also a good reason for taking measures right now."
"We can see positive developments in certain areas."
"I am thinking, for example, of the efforts which Mr Bolkestein, has made to remove obstacles to the negotiations concerning the proposed energy tax."
"It is clear, however, that if certain Member States, in the future too, oppose this proposal, we shall have to find alternatives."
"I note that the European Parliament is in fact in favour of using the flexibility clause in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"This clause in fact enables a number of Member States to move forward in this area."
"Questions relating to transportation and energy are also of decisive importance for the combating of climate change."
"I shall therefore be discussing with Mrs Loyola de Palacio how to reach the goal of doubling the use of renewable energy sources and also improving energy efficiency."
"We shall also be discussing how we are going to be able to reduce emissions from the transport sector."
"The Commission will shortly be adopting new guidelines in connection with State support aimed at protecting the environment."
"Mario Monti is investigating the ways in which subsidies and tax incentives can contribute to an improved environment and to protecting our climate."
"I shall also be investigating whether the support for fossil fuels might be redirected to the use of renewable energy sources and implementation of energy-saving measures."
"I should also like to urge the European Parliament to determine what Parliament can do through its own work to ensure that these questions about climate change are taken into account in different sectors of the economy."
"We need your full support in order to achieve rapid results in this area."
"I want to say that I fully share Parliament' s view that we must all provide intelligible and easily accessible information to make it easier for citizens of the European Union to play an active role in this work."
"It is only when each and every one of us takes his or her own share of responsibility for climate change that we are going to see results."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures I have just reported on will help give Europe the credibility required for us to be able to continue to fight for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol."
"This ought to be ratified as soon as possible after the Sixth Party Summit to the UN' s framework convention on climate change."
"If we are to succeed in our efforts, it will of course also be necessary for the Member States to participate fully and to live up to their commitments."
"Mr Hassi has already spoken about the forthcoming international negotiations at the Fifth Party Summit."
"Finally, may I also emphasise the decisive role which the EU plays as a bridge between the USA and developing countries, making sure that all are fully involved in the process and live up to their commitments."
"I am counting on your wholehearted support and look forward to close collaboration with Parliament with a view to achieving results."
"It is our joint responsibility to succeed, and on behalf of future generations too."
"Mr President, I cannot think of a worse building in which to hold a debate on climate change."
"The building is a monument to how humankind has ignored the imperatives of climate change."
"There is no natural light at all and we demand huge amounts of electricity."
"Even when we get into the lifts they are black so we have to have the electric light on."
"However, that being said, I welcome the remarks by the President-in-Office and by the Commissioner and, if I may do so in my humble position, I would like to congratulate her on her maiden speech."
"The Kyoto Protocol created certain expectations and the impression of the European Parliament is that things have been allowed to go to sleep for far too long after the negotiations on that protocol were concluded."
"Politicians have partly conspired to hide from the peoples of our Member States that implementing the Kyoto Protocols is going to be painful."
"It is going to cost them money."
"It is going to be money well spent, because we need to spend it to protect the environment, but it is going to cost them money."
"I should like to thank Mrs Wallström for outlining to us what the Commission' s action is going to be."
"She said at one point, rather blandly I thought, that she was going to propose tangible measures in various sectors."
"Well, we wait to see what these are going to be."
"We are glad there is going to be an action programme coming forward in the spring and a Green Paper on emissions trading."
"When we had our debate in the hearing with the Commissioner about a month or so ago, my committee, the Committee on the Environment, was really rather in two minds as to whether it wanted to see emissions trading measures put forward, but it is worth our while to explore that line."
"We need to produce an action programme to enable the European Union to live up to what it signed up to in Kyoto."
"We would like to highlight - and we have highlighted in our resolution - the need for action, particularly in the air transport sector."
"That is not something which can be left to the transport Commissioner, it is an initiative that should come from Mrs Wallström."
"Finally I would like to pledge the Commissioner our full support in the Committee on the Environment for whatever it is that she brings forward. Whatever it is, we hope she brings it forward in concrete form and soon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to make two observations as well as two requests."
"The first is about emissions trading."
"Emissions trading has two sides, one is political and the other economic."
"In political terms, there are different ways of evaluating emissions trading."
"Many in our group take the view that emissions trading, i.e. the freedom to buy the obligation to reduce CO2, is not politically tenable."
"I do not want to evaluate that further now, but I think that the reduction of CO2 should not be seen merely as a burden but that it actually has an economic effect, and offers the opportunity, and the possibility, to bring the improvement of the quality of life into line with employment. That is why I feel that we should not participate in unlimited emissions trading."
"I am absolutely convinced that Parliament' s position, which we drafted - to permit at the most 50% emissions trading, that is, 50% reduction of CO2 must be done in one' s own country - is in political and also economic terms, exactly the right way to generate employment here at home."
"There is a sufficient number of studies which show that, for example, a reduction by 34,000 carbon equivalent units creates around 100 jobs in Europe, and this is the route we should take in order to bring ecology and economics designed to increase employment more in line with one another."
"Hence my request: could you please confirm that you do not support any agreement which allows more than 50% emissions trading to take place outside one' s own country."
"Secondly: the European Parliament' s participation."
"I was very pleased Mrs Wallström, that you emphasised once again your desire to work closely with the European Parliament and I fully accept what you say. Past experience has shown, though, that this was sometimes not the case and that participation indeed worked on a very ad hoc basis."
"This occurred firstly in the delegations for example, where one sometimes had the impression that the European Commission did the actual negotiating there, and that the Members of Parliament who were also present, were just there to make up the numbers. It also occurred in the drafting of the mandate or, to give a particularly negative example, in the issue of individual obligations to reduce CO2 and their negotiation by the Commission with the relevant partners, especially recently with the Japanese and Korean car manufacturers."
"In this case, there was absolutely no contact with the European Parliament and the Parliament was not even officially informed."
"The Council on the other hand, was informed and will make its decision on this on 12 October, but we have been cut out of the loop."
"If we want to establish an instrument for individual obligation, then please ensure that all partners participate."
"This brings me on to my second request: could you please confirm that a modus vivendi for the participation of Parliament will be found."
"Mr President, changing and influencing nature in such a way that future generations do not have the same chance to live as we have is indefensible, be it from human or ecological points of view."
"That is why it is really good to hear that Mrs Wallström has ambitions for the years to come."
"I believe that we are today in a position where ever more people recognise that it is the interplay between environment and economies and between environment and markets in which a large part of the solution to our problems lies."
"We must therefore make more and more use of economic instruments of control."
"We take this up in our resolution."
"Commissioner Wallström has also touched upon the question."
"The fact is that each country is free to introduce this type of measure, as in fact a number of countries have done already."
"The best thing, however, would be for all countries to do this at the same time."
"The next best thing would be for all EU Member States to do it at the same time."
"A less good, but nonetheless necessary, alternative would perhaps be for some country to take the lead, that is to say for the flexibility clause to be used."
"In that case, the majority of countries could move to introduce the measures required, while the others remained shamefully behind."
"I had intended to ask Commissioner Wallström a question about this."
"I do not, however, need to do this now because she has backed this point of view right from the beginning."
"The question is merely one of how many countries we can get to join us in a first phase of this kind."
"The second point I want to raise is precisely the point that Mr Lange raised in the matter of trade in emission rights."
"I believe it is necessary to make for the greatest possible effectiveness at the lowest possible cost."
"It is good that we should now be getting a Green Paper on this subject."
"I am also pleased that Commissioner Wallström, with the background she has, has adopted the standpoint she has done."
"I think it would be unfortunate to land ourselves today with percentage figures concerning the extent to which a particular environmental measure is to be employed."
"I believe that we should be prepared to work as quickly and effectively as possible to influence the environment for the better."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to welcome Madam President-in-Office of the Council and Mrs Wallström, of the Commission."
"Parliament must give you both its fullest support in your aim to include the issue of climate change in all European Union policy."
"We know that very far-reaching decisions will be made at the Helsinki Summit on how to take account of environmental considerations generally, and climatic issues in particular."
"Mrs Wallström spoke of a very positive matter with regard to Mr Monti."
"The Member of the Commission responsible for issues of competition is thus ready to look into how subsidies and taxes will impact on climatic issues."
"Parliament' s draft statement forcefully emphasises the importance of reducing those very large subsidies that are granted at present for fossil fuels."
"I believe that Mr Monti will tackle this problem in earnest."
"Perhaps we could then redirect the subsidies to areas that further the Union' s intentions, especially that of sustainable development."
"I also support the idea that we must try hard to ensure that market forces work to halt the development of climate change."
"In this, the importance of an energy tax cannot be underestimated."
"The Commissioner responsible for the Internal Market, Mr Bolkestein, told Parliament yesterday that he also intends to become involved in this issue, although, unfortunately, he said he still needed a year to convince Spain that an energy tax is really needed."
"I would have been interested to hear the opinions of the Member of the Commission and the President-in-Office on how a common energy tax would evolve, as, without one, the European Union will be unable to fulfil its objectives."
"Mr President, climate change is set to be one of our most difficult environmental challenges."
"What makes it so difficult is that, if we are to take the matter seriously, huge changes must be made in both the energy and transport sectors."
"What is probably also required, in spite of new technology and alternative energy sources, is less use of transport and lower energy consumption overall."
"A large part of the responsibility for this lies, of course, with the individual Member States, but the EU too can do a great deal."
"My Group naturally supports this resolution which we have also been involved in drafting."
"I shall emphasise three points which are especially important for the EU in this situation."
"The first point is that we must come up with a carbon dioxide levy, that is to say, a tax on greenhouse gases."
"I should like to emphasise what is stated in paragraph 15 of the resolution to the effect that it is probably better to have a decision of substance, even if we do not have everyone on board, than to have a decision lacking in substance which entails an unacceptable delay."
"The second point concerns the subsidy for fossil fuels which is, of course, directly counter-productive."
"I also think that the EU' s energy research grants must focus solely on renewable sources of energy, which is not the case at present."
"The third point concerns aviation fuel."
"It is a matter of urgency that agreement be reached on the international taxation of aviation fuel."
"Aviation is the area with the fastest increase in emissions of greenhouse gases."
"On this subject, I should like to hear a little more from Commissioner Wallström."
"What do you intend to do with regard to this particular area?"
"What initiatives do you have under way?"
"To conclude, I should like to point out that there is a lot of scepticism in my group about trade in emission rights."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Minister Hassi and Commissioner Wallström for their inspiring statements."
"A conference on climate change is just around the corner now."
"It is to take place in Bonn."
"In view of the fact that there are so many different opinions about climate change, there are bound to be a great many more conferences in the future."
"The fact is that there has been no noticeable improvement whatsoever."
"According to a report by IPCC, there will need to be a 35% reduction in CO2 emissions between now and 2010 if temperatures and the rise in sea level are to be kept within the necessary limits."
"This does not sit well with the fact that in most EU countries CO2 concentrations have done nothing but rise since 1990."
"So we will need drastic supplementary measures if we are to comply with the Kyoto Agreement."
"However, it has become apparent since this agreement was reached that countries are taking their time when it comes to compliance."
"It is downright scandalous that the Member States have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol."
"This severely restricts the foundation on which practical efforts to cut down greenhouse gases are to be based."
"It would in any case be best if Member State Governments were to press on with ratification."
"In view of the seriousness of the situation I support the proposal made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Lange to do this by means of an assent procedure."
"Ratifying the Kyoto Protocol is not, in fact, something Parliament has to do, but neither can we allow a situation to develop in which laxness on the part of the Member States means there is no ratification whatsoever."
"Another point is that there must soon be clarity and agreement in relation to the criteria for flexible mechanisms."
"However, we must also guard against wanting other countries to effect reductions when we do not take measures to limit CO2 emissions ourselves."
"Mr President, we must be perfectly clear about the scale of all this."
"We are currently releasing as much CO2 per day as has been bound in the last 3000 years."
"If we add that up over the course of a year, we are actually moving backwards in one go, at a rate of one million years per year."
"In this sense, the plans of the Council and the Commission do not of course go far enough by any means and are actually merely cosmetic actions."
"What we need in the long term are not voluntary agreements, but thorough analyses of the real costs and to make the whole tax system environmentally friendly."
"If these things are not done, it simply will not work!"
"Within the framework of the current agreement on the common position, the requirement in Amendment No 5, that is, an EU Directive with legally binding targets for renewable energies to be achieved, is the minimum condition necessary if the Paper in any form can be taken seriously to any great extent."
"Mr President, this is an important motion for a resolution which may form the basis of continued work in the field of climate change."
"There are ever more signs to indicate that imminent climate changes on our planet will become the really big environmental question and challenge for politicians the world over."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I should like to report on the positions we have adopted."
"We oppose paragraph 15 because we are doubtful as to the suitability and effectiveness of general energy taxes."
"We oppose paragraph 16."
"The question of energy efficiency is in fact also dealt with in paragraph 11 in the motion for a resolution."
"It is proposed in paragraph 11 that a directive be prepared for this area and, in so doing, consideration can be given to what might be a more realistic goal for increased energy efficiency than what is stated in paragraph 16."
"Where the draft amendments are concerned, we support proposal 1 from Mr Bowis, who is a member of the Group of the European People' s Party, together with draft Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"With regard to proposal 4 from the Socialists, we request split voting because we think that it would be unrealistic to try to achieve ratification of the protocol as early as the first few months of next year, even if it were a matter of urgency."
"With regard to paragraph 5 from the Greens, we request split voting there as well."
"We share the view that an EU Directive on renewable energy sources ought to be prepared, but we think that decisions about targets which are to be legally binding upon the Member States ought not to be formulated by the EU organisation."
"Finally: I listened this morning to Environmental Commissioner Wallström who is in fact also with us here now."
"She emphasised that market forces, free trade and well-informed consumers can be our best friends in obtaining a sound environment."
"I agree with her statement, including the parts of it concerning measures to arrest climate change."
"Mr President, we have to move on from the Kyoto agreement to be successful in preventing climate change. For that reason, we need a longer-term action programme, as proposed by the country holding the Presidency."
"International emissions trading must be assessed according to how effective it will be in reducing emissions."
"Environmental taxation is important, and that is why it has been discussed here."
"It is an important means of achieving cleaner production processes and cleaner transport."
"Ambitious attempts on the part of individual countries are doomed to failure unless there is progress in the EU area as a whole."
"The cultivation of forests, as a means of dispensing with carbon dioxide, is still being discussed; this discussion must continue openly and we should also make more of the versatility of forests with regard to the environment and the prevention of climate change."
"Mr President, today the European Parliament is discussing two global questions: the liberalisation of world trade, and the realisation of an agreement on climate change, both of which issues are connected."
"They must both be seen as part of the greater whole."
"The current trend in all the Western societies of the European Union and throughout humanity is in irreconcilable conflict with the economics of nature."
"We speak of sustainable development with reference to the economics of nature, but the main drift of the action goes in the opposite direction."
"Despite the population policy, population growth continues at a considerable rate."
"Everywhere, including the most prosperous countries in the world, people are trying to raise their material standard of living, which is to say, they consume more."
"There are many who believe that the invisible hands at work in the markets and technological development will solve the problems of mankind."
"Market forces are a good servant, but a bad master."
"The new technology will help us to adapt our own economy to that of nature, but it also creates new problems and risks all the time."
"Both market forces and technological developments must be steered in a direction that will take sustainable development from the sphere of mere words to one of deeds."
"In the end, however, it will be a question of the values of life and policy."
"To check the advance of climate change and other changes to the environment that are harmful to human beings effectively, we need to be able to break the chain of materialism, with its supremacy of temporary values, which is harmful both to nature and humanity."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think that what the public expects from us is not a contribution to even more hot air, but concrete measures."
"The most important of these will be specific steps towards the incorporation of them by the European Union, and industry-specific targets and timetables."
"Unfortunately, I have heard you say very little about these things here today."
"Please be more specific. I believe that we must start implementation here in the EU and not wait until the start of the period of enforcement."
"There are two other points I would like to mention."
"Commissioner, you mentioned renewable energy sources."
"This is less a matter of financial assistance and more of when we will have a European ""feed-in directive"" with compensation that actually covers the costs."
"Secondly, as the Swedish speaker already said, there is the matter of taxing aviation fuel."
"According to our international obligations, we are not able to tax aviation fuel."
"What is possible, though, is a tax on CO2."
"The European Union could introduce such a tax immediately."
"I would have liked to hear in concrete terms, what the timetables look like and how they stand in relation to these two specific recommendations, which represent a real contribution to achieving a noticeable fall in CO2 emissions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I must thank you for agreeing, on most points, with the European Parliament' s resolution, which lays down our whole philosophy on climate change."
"Really, I would like to concentrate on the points which are of most concern to this Parliament."
"Firstly, the European Union must continue to lead the way at the meeting which will take place in Bonn from the 25th of the month and, if necessary, it would be very useful to suggest a unilateral reduction, which was initially envisaged as 15%."
"Secondly, we also feel that it is essential that the Kyoto Protocol be ratified."
"I think that it is scandalous that 84 countries signed it and yet only 12, mostly small islands, have ratified it."
"Perhaps these small islands have done so because the danger is much closer to home for them."
"The European Union therefore, must make efforts to ensure that its Member Countries also sign this protocol."
"I am also very keen on emphasising the issue raised by Commissioner Wallström, regarding a concrete plan of action."
"I think that the time has arrived, Commissioner and Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to abandon rhetoric and to take action."
"If you abandon rhetoric and take action, this Parliament will certainly support you."
"Mr President, I welcome many of the things our Commissioner has been saying and is proposing to do."
"I ask her with my amendment to do one thing more."
"We all want to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced and my amendment is not a judgment on energy taxes, but it is seeking to help us make informed decisions on any proposals for such taxes."
"What we need to know is the assessed impact on jobs in Europe and the extent to which pollution might simply be exported to low-income countries which can ill afford to cope with it."
"An example of this: for a leading tomato grower in Britain currently paying GBP 363 000 for its gas and GBP 60 000 for its electricity, the proposed climate change levy in Britain would increase its energy bill by GBP 149 000."
"That is a staggering 35% increase, an increase which would simply drive that company out of Britain and into some non-EU country, possibly in Eastern Europe, possibly in the developing world."
"What would then happen is that the European Union would claim to have reduced its pollution, reduced its emissions, but at a cost: firstly European jobs would be lost and secondly the world would not have reduced its pollution levels by one iota: the pollution would simply have been exported."
"That in my view would be immoral to low-income countries and it would be insane economics for the working people of Europe."
"The European Trade Union Confederation has called on us to make sure that every step - and they do say every step - taken to implement the Kyoto targets is carefully evaluated."
"They are right."
"That is what I want."
"That is what I am asking the Commissioner to do."
"Please publish your impact assessments on jobs and on the extent to which emissions would be exported."
"Then we can all take an informed decision."
"The climate changes we have been experiencing for the last few decades present us with the biggest environmental challenges of all."
"There are also humanly created problems."
"The EU and the Member States should therefore stick to their goal of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 15% by the year 2010 and might well go further than that in the slightly longer term."
"On the other hand, the tools we use to reduce emissions will have to be effective and binding, as Mrs Hassi and Mrs Wallström emphasised."
"We know however that there are strong forces which are prepared to cheat the system by means of any old agreements."
"You can certainly do that as a way of wangling lower environmental requirements for yourself, but you cannot cheat with regard to the actual effects of climate changes."
"I would therefore urge the Council and the Commission to stand by the demand that at least half of the CO2 reductions are to be made on a national basis."
"If we lower that 50% level, then I think we should be considerably impairing the EU' s policy on climate change and also greatly reducing the EU' s credibility in continued negotiations on the subject."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I support the joint resolution submitted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and unlike others in my Party, I also support the section which deals with an CO2 energy tax."
"The CDU Party in Germany believes, and we have recently discussed this again with our Chairman, Mr Schäuble, that we should stop continuing to work towards a European solution, just because at the national level, left-wing and Green governments are abusing the issue of environmental taxes."
"But we should not concentrate solely on the tax issue, as seems to have happened in the Committee to some extent, as well as in our Party."
"There are many aspects of reducing CO2 which we will not be able to resolve through a tax alone, perhaps not through taxation at all."
"I will give the example of the stand-by switch which is taken up in paragraph 9 of the motion for resolution which I proposed."
"Between five and ten per cent of the European Union' s energy consumption is wasted because we do not switch off our televisions and other electrical appliances, but leave them on stand-by."
"Five to ten per cent represents a huge contribution to energy savings, which can be achieved here if we either turn the appliances off or come up with new technical means in order to achieve a reduction in energy consumption."
"This will not be achieved though, by means of a tax."
"When someone buys a television, the question of how much energy it uses on stand-by is not generally of prime importance. They have other criteria in mind, and this is why we also need technical solutions to this problem."
"However, I would like to ask those of you who want to see solutions other than a tax not to raise objections again when we are holding a discussion on technical alternatives to stand-by on the grounds that this is a European regulation and you did not want that either."
"We must do something if we are to appear credible in the negotiations."
"Nor should we discuss only CO2, because if my information is correct, 50% of the greenhouse effect is caused by other greenhouse gases."
"I think that we have not made this sufficiently clear in the discussion. We should give this point much greater consideration."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Laura González Álvarez and also the Spanish speaker who is coming after me."
"Without them, one might have assumed that this is a Northern European debate."
"This is not the case, as this is an issue which concerns us all."
"On climate change itself, I would like to express my fear that this issue is being continually pushed into the background, as something which is of less and less interest to the public and to politicians."
"Finally we have professed our beliefs and that appears to be enough for most people."
"That would be extraordinarily dangerous!"
"Therefore, I would like to suggest two things: firstly, we should endorse Mr Lange' s call to reach agreement on the emissions trade with the close involvement of Parliament, because such a powerful intervention in trade policy would be very difficult to carry out against Parliament' s wishes."
"Secondly, I suggest that we establish a binding timetable, one with real sanctions against any EU State that deviates from the targets for reduction."
"The model I recommend is the concerted reduction of debt, which has now made the Euro possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think that now, all of us in Parliament agree on the need to tackle the problem of climate change rigorously, not just in order to fulfil a commitment made by the European Parliament but also because of the undeniable world-wide importance of this issue."
"Nevertheless, we feel that in order to succeed in this task, we must avoid various topics which crop up on a regular basis in discussions on the subject and we should avoid including them in the text of the resolution."
"The first approach that we have to avoid is to think that economic development inevitably brings with it an increase in the deterioration of the environment."
"It is possible to neutralise to a large extent this undesirable effect of growth by making our resources more efficient."
"Introducing low cost efficiency measures would significantly reduce emissions."
"Nevertheless, attaining this objective may prove difficult for certain Member Countries, which is not what we want at all."
"The second topic concerns the way global problems are dealt with as local issues."
"The European Union must show itself to be strong on this matter and encourage as many countries as possible to sign up to this commitment and fulfil it."
"This is the only way we will be able to accept adopting measures which will certainly be difficult and economically damaging for various European Union countries, as well as for some of those mentioned in the motion for resolution."
"The last thing that we should avoid doing is to make the protocol' s so-called flexible mechanisms the fundamental basis for our actions."
"Although it is true that there are means which would potentially allow us to fulfil the commitment made in Kyoto through national strategies and measures, the economic cost of the different options varies enormously."
"Strategic action in the areas where the net economic costs are lower should be stepped up immediately."
"For this reason, and before the measures are adopted as standard for energy, we would have to ensure the adoption of this strategic action, as well as the reliability of the means of production of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, so that we can efficiently monitor the development of the problem in all countries."
"Mr President, now that we have discussed the question of world-wide negotiations in great detail, of course we have to optimise our own strategy."
"I am pleased then, that the Commissioner finally wants to propose appropriate strategies."
"At the moment, I rather have the feeling that our actions are relatively selective and ad hoc and not really purposeful."
"What we really need is an integrated strategy on which we will base our decision as to which industry-specific measures we should take."
"I would like to come back to the idea of voluntary agreements."
"The gist of the Commission' s statement is that we should call on everyone to sign up to voluntary agreements."
"This will not allow us to state precisely where our priorities lie and what conditions are necessary to achieve them."
"I reiterate Parliament' s continual demand to specify what measures are required for each industry and how they should be applied."
"Mr President, most of what needs saying has been said at this point."
"The EU is falling sharply behind in meeting its legally binding undertakings on reducing greenhouse gases."
"I would just like to mention my concerns about my own country."
"I am very concerned that the Irish Government is complacent in its attitude towards its Kyoto Protocol commitments, which they entered into in December 1997."
"We are committed to limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases to 13% above our 1990 levels by the year 2010 or so."
"On current predictions Ireland' s emissions will be up to 40% above this target."
"In relation to the energy tax issue, it is time we decided exactly what we mean by this."
"I am a great believer in more carrot and less stick, particularly when it comes to environmental protection."
"Just to wave taxes as a threat, without matching them with grants for retrofitting older plants so that they can comply with acceptable emission standards, and without generally increasing investment in monitoring emissions, will not work."
"Are we talking about climate change levies, emission taxes, energy taxes generally, carbon tax, carbon dioxide tax?"
"I do not think we have ever put our heads together to decide exactly what we mean by it."
"I fully support the point made by my EPP colleague, Mr Bowis, that under no circumstances can we export our problem from the developed world by slapping taxes on our older plants with problematic emission standards and just driving those jobs and those particular production units to the less developed regions where they are less able to cope with environmental degradation."
"It is a net reduction in emissions we want globally, not just exporting the problem from the West to the less developed regions."
"I am also very concerned about the projected increase in fluorocarbons, which are presently a minor contributor to the total greenhouse gases."
"We are told they will increase by 40% on current rates."
"That is a major cause for concern."
"We should turn our attention to it."
"Mr President, Mrs Jackson said that the policies hid the fact that their implementation costs money and that it was hard-hitting."
"I do not know how the debate is conducted in other Member States, but in my own country, it is certainly no secret that big changes are needed to reduce emissions."
"The question was asked here concerning the effects of reductions in emissions on jobs."
"Personally, I am certain that the reduction of emissions will create jobs in some areas, but it is equally true that it will mean reduced employment in others."
"Those who will obtain jobs are not certain of it yet, but those who are losing them know a lot more about it, and, for that reason, unfortunately, there is much stronger lobbying from their side."
"Many Members spoke of the need for financial controls and an energy tax."
"As you know, the Council cannot take a decision on this, so I cannot say anything at all on behalf of the Council."
"I can only state Finland' s position, which is that we believe it is very important for the Union to make headway in the creation of a common energy tax and we have also discussed the possibility of Member States, which are so inclined, moving forward faster in this area."
"One problem connected with this is whether such action would be of benefit in conflicts that could possibly arise with regard to EU competition legislation."
"For example, in my own country we experienced the situation where an energy tax that was brought in at national level in its first version was found to be in violation of the Union' s acts on competition."
"However, I think that energy taxes are one means of inducing market forces to reduce emissions and develop new, modern and clean technology, and I consider that to be very important."
"Regarding the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, I would say that, as the rules for the Kyoto mechanisms and those to do with compliance with the commitments made have not yet been agreed, ratification at this stage would mean that we would not really know what we were ratifying."
"As these matters are being discussed internationally, I believe it is important that the EU holds the trump card, enabling it also to negotiate the terms on which it should be ratified."
"If the EU were to ratify it immediately, it would mean that, thereafter, it would no longer have any great significance when more precise rules were being discussed."
"I agree with Mr Linkohr that, as the Union is committed to targets for reduced emissions, we also have to decide on action in respect of those Member States that are unable to meet their commitments."
"The Kyoto Protocol and the climate agreement also states that if a combined body of economic cooperation such as the EU cannot achieve the targets as a whole, responsibility for the targets set for it falls to all its Member States, in other words, if some Member States cannot meet their commitments, the Union will suffer as a whole."
"Finally, I would like to stress that the idea, which has been expressed in these deliberations, that, if nothing is done, the temperature of the Earth will have increased by two degrees in a 100 years' time, is wrong."
"Restricting the rise in temperature to just two degrees over the next 100 years will take much effort."
"If the current trend is allowed to continue uncontrolled, with no determined climatic policy, the rise in temperature of the earth will be a lot greater than two degrees in one hundred years, and all the corresponding effects it will have will be all the more dramatic."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is an almost incomprehensibly large and difficult task we have before us."
"We are to assess the credibility of future scenarios which involve actually diverting the Gulf Stream and perhaps encountering a new ice age."
"On the other hand, we are today to try to make decisions about concrete measures which in certain cases may only take effect perhaps 50 or a 100 years in the future."
"We are being asked preferably to come up with specific proposals today and to speak about exactly what will happen."
"I believe that this is necessary because it is exactly what citizens in our respective countries are asking of us."
"We know that the problem exists. They too know that it exists, and they wonder: are you prepared to take decisions so that we can see a change?"
"What I have done today is to report on how the Commission and I want to tackle this problem, how we must analyse it, how we must work with a strategy and a programme in which we consider each greenhouse gas in turn and how exactly we are to manage the problems. There are already proposals on the table."
"The Kyoto Protocol contains a number of proposals concerning how we can proceed further and what measures need to be taken."
"I am completely convinced that we need financial incentives. Money talks, as they say."
"That is when things become serious, and this is something which companies and industries understand too."
"On many occasions, expectations that jobs were to leave the country have proved unfounded because, instead, an environmentally friendly technique or a more efficient and environmentally-friendly use of energy has been promoted. Which is what we want to bring about."
"I want to comment briefly on a number of questions which have been raised here."
"Where air traffic is concerned, the Commission is very conscious of the fact that this is a growing problem."
"We shall present a report before the end of the year."
"Those of us from the Environmental Directorate have of course been involved in this."
"In this connection, too, I am in favour of the use of financial instruments of control because we know that they are effective."
"When it comes to trade in emission rights, I believe that we must first see a concrete proposal."
"I have said that I shall be presenting a Green Paper with just such a concrete proposal for a system. This will, of course, describe the national responsibilities which each country will have."
"It will not be possible for a country to buy itself free of obligations. There must be a system of rules through which, instead, countries honour their commitments in the most effective way."
"That is what is intended."
"I believe we should be on our guard against language."
"You see, words channel the way people think."
"If you use a concept such as ""an exchange for trade in emission rights"" , then I think that we are feeding the thought that this is to be a cynical system in which it will be possible for countries to buy themselves free of obligations. Now, this is definitely not my approach."
"Any system must be sensibly regulated, and we must make sure that a lot more interests are involved."
"If we do not have industry with us, if we do not have the citizens of the European Union with us and, above all, if we cannot take political decisions, then it is not going to work."
"In that case, we shall not succeed in this undertaking."
"We must mobilise on a much broader basis."
"In fact, I believe that, in general, our citizens are the ones who are more acutely conscious of these issues and that their willingness to act is greater than that of the politicians in our Member States just now."
"That is the big worry."
"When it comes to an energy tax, I cannot judge exactly how long it is going to take to introduce this."
"It is something which we have to discuss in the Commission."
"If the fact of the matter is that it is going to take too long a time, then I am prepared to support a proposal to the effect that a number of countries go on ahead in order to show the way and demonstrate that it can be an effective way of achieving results where the issue of climate change is concerned."
"I want also to take the opportunity to thank you for your interventions."
"Mr President, some of the speakers have already asked quite specific questions."
"I would like to ask Mrs Wallström again, to go into some specific details."
"Firstly, there was the question on when we can expect industry-specific plans for reduction, and timetables for this from the Commission. Secondly, there was the question raised by two of us on the subject of CO2 emissions from aviation fuel."
"The question obviously still remains as to how you produce a Directive on phasing in renewable energies, and providing compensation which actually covers the costs."
"I would be most grateful to you if you could answer these three specific points."
"I do not know if you are in a position to as you have so recently taken up your post."
"I think that we are agreed that we should all do something to protect the environment."
"I do not have time to answer every specific question, but what I have been talking about here is my way of setting to work on the concrete measures."
"Before the end of the year, we are to present a Green Paper describing a system for trade in emission rights (one of the flexible mechanisms)."
"We are to get an action programme under way, requiring us specifically to examine each area in turn and involve all interested parties."
"This is necessary because there is no such plan at the present time."
"I shall also, of course, try to push forward the integration process as far as possible."
"Exact dates cannot be given. The question of energy taxes has been on the agenda for six years."
"I wish I could say that results will be seen no later than tomorrow, but it is going to take a little longer than that."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Mrs Breyer, in this kind of debate, even the omissions are respected."
"I have received, pursuant to Rule 37(2), a motion for a resolution to close the present debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0030/1999). We shall look at the questions put to the Council."
"Question No 1 by (H-0464/99) :"
"Subject: Adoption of a decision regarding the reconstruction of areas hit by earthquakes in Greece."
"Mr President, the Council is very sorry to hear about the earthquake in Greece, and would like to convey its deepest sympathy to the Greek nation with regard to the widespread damage this natural disaster has caused."
"So far, the Commission has not sent the Council a proposal for a decision on the reconstruction of the areas affected by the Greek earthquake."
"However, the Council would like to state that it is satisfied that the Commission has already begun talks on how the consequences of the earthquake can be alleviated."
"As was the case with decisions previously made on natural disasters, and if the Commission makes a proposal to the Council regarding the earthquake, the Council will treat the matter as urgent."
"Question No 2 by (H-0466/99):"
"Subject: Structural Funds The Structural Fund resources allocated to the Objective 1 Autonomous Communities are not distributed by the Spanish Government on the basis of objective criteria relating to population size and per capita income."
"During the 1994-1999 period, which Autonomous Communities received the Structural Fund resources allocated to Spain for distribution to Objective 1 areas and in what proportions? In the 2000-2006 period, what will be the criteria for the geographical distribution of the Structural Fund resources set aside for Spain and legally allocated to the Objective 1 Autonomous Communities?"
"Mr President, the Council considers that the distribution of financial aid from the Structural Funds in different areas should be carried out in compliance with the rules in existence, so that all regions are treated impartially."
"However, the Council cannot give a precise answer to the honourable Member' s question regarding Spain."
"The coordination of Structural Funds aid for the Objective 1 areas is laid down in the Community' s aid framework, which the Commission drafts with the Member State concerned, The implementation of Structural Funds aid does not, therefore, fall within the competence of the Council, but the Member States."
"It is the responsibility of the authorities and bodies appointed by the Member States and the Commission."
"I could really not have hoped for a more insubstantial answer."
"What I mean Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that as far as the Autonomous Regions in Objective 1 are concerned, the Spanish state, in spite of the competences held by these Regions, is reserving 55% of revenues which go to the Spanish State for centralised policies which do not apply in general to the Autonomous Regions in Objective 1."
"Therefore, they are being distributed arbitrarily and - I repeat - are being spent on centralised policies."
"For example, in my country, Galicia, which is part of Objective 1 and which should therefore receive proportionally around 12% of the revenues going to the Spanish state, received only 5% in the period 1994-1999."
"In this way, Galicia differs from Portugal and Ireland, both countries in Objective 1 who have achieved extraordinary development, which has unfortunately not taken place in my country, Galicia."
"What is the Council going to do to stop this happening?"
"Mr President, the question of competence is really very clear here."
"By virtue of the rules governing the granting of Structural Funds aid, it is the Commission' s task to see that no distortions occur."
"As this is the business of the Commission, which is an expert in the field, being in possession of all the necessary information, it may be able to give an answer to the honourable Member' s question."
"As long as the rules stay as they are, these matters are the concern of the Commission, and they must be dealt with by the Commission. The Council may not interfere."
"I would like to restate my colleague' s question and although I realise of course it might have been more aptly directed to the Commission, I would like to inform the Council of the reality of the situation he mentioned."
"We have seen a large overall growth in the Structural Funds, but what is happening is that in some countries, the money coming from the Structural Funds is being used by the Member State under the pretext of putting it towards multiannual programmes, which means that the money received by the Communities and other regions is greatly reduced."
"This does not happen in other countries."
"In other countries, the State does not appropriate 50 or 55% of the Structural Fund money."
"Does the President-in-Office of the Council think that it is logical to take away so much of the European regions' budgetary contribution?"
"Mr President, I believe it is logical that aid always goes to the right areas for the right work, as only in that way can we achieve the best possible results."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it was my understanding that Spain, just like other countries which receive Structural Funds for Objective 1 regions was applying these funds according to criteria which accord perfectly with the regulations of these Funds."
"And I have to say that it is quite a bad mistake to confuse countries with regions."
"Furthermore in Spain' s case, all institutions, starting with the Court of Auditors and the Commission itself say that Spain is applying the Structural Funds to Objective 1 correctly and they also confirm that these funds have been managed extremely well."
"Some Spanish regions such as Galicia, to give an example, have a percentage of the gross domestic product dedicated to infrastructures which is well above the national average."
"But my question to the Council is this: does the Council intend to put pressure on Member States whose standards of performance relating to the Structural Funds are lower than the European average, to force them to manage their funds more effectively and to prevent the ""snowball"" effect taking place?"
"Mr President, as the Commission monitors this matter, the most appropriate option is to leave the Commission to apply pressure. The Council does not consider it appropriate to interfere in this matter."
"Besides, I believe that this might well also be a subject for debate in the Spanish Parliament."
"Mr Nogueira is asking for the floor on a procedural motion."
"But there is not actually any procedural discrepancy here."
"Everything is going very well and you can write to Mr Sasi, who I am sure, will be very helpful."
"Despite all that, Mr Nogueira, now has the floor in order to make a procedural motion, but it must be a genuine procedural motion."
"Do not set a bad example, Mr Nogueira."
"Mr President, I am making this intervention because of an anticonstitutional remark that the Member of the People' s Party has just made. I must remind you that in the Spanish Constitution, my country is defined as an ""autonomous region"" ."
"I therefore ask you to respect the Spanish Constitution."
"Mr Nogueira, I told you yesterday that as this is the Finnish Presidency' s term in office, I intend to act objectively in these controversial debates, as if I too were a Finnish President."
"This is not a debate on nationalities and regions in the Spanish Parliament."
"When we talk of regions, I understand that to mean that it is European Regions that are being discussed."
"I do not want to hear anything that goes beyond that."
"Question No 3 by (H-0471/99):"
"Subject: Women's rights and equality Article 3(2) of the Amsterdam Treaty stipulates that equality must be a feature of all areas of policy."
"To achieve that goal, budget resources must be earmarked for a fifth action programme and specific, measurable targets set for equality."
"Targets may be set, for example, by measuring the percentage of women making up the labour force and the unemployed, by assessing the extent to which the equal pay directive is being implemented and measuring the percentage of women on decision-making bodies."
"The best three countries should then be selected as targets to be achieved by the Member States through their own action programmes."
"What does the Council intend to do to promote the adoption of a fifth action programme with sufficient budget resources and a fixed timetable and what measures will the Council take to set specific, measurable targets for equality?"
"The Council recognises, as does the European Parliament, first of all that the policy of equality is still extremely important; secondly, that the action programme comprises the EU' s most important instrument for implementing the obligations accepted as a result of the action programme arising out of the Peking Conference; and, finally, that successful implementation can best be achieved by integrating a perspective of equality into all policies."
"That is the reason why, during the Finnish Presidency, the Council is expected to take decisions with a view to achieving this and why the Council welcomes the Commission' s intention to submit a proposal as soon as possible for a new action programme designed to promote equality between women and men and to ensure that this can be implemented when the present action programme comes to an end."
"What is more, the Council is planning to have indicators and benchmarking for the purpose of following up the action programme arising out of the Peking Conference."
"The Finnish Presidency has prepared an initial report on women' s participation in the decision-making process."
"Finland has proposed that the Council should clarify its intention to continue, during the forthcoming presidencies, to develop indicators and benchmarking for other critical areas specified in the Peking Conference' s action programme and to undertake regularly to examine progress in the areas under discussion."
"Thank you for your answer."
"I want to say that I welcome your answer clarifying that there is to be a fifth action programme."
"There is one small quibble, namely the question of adequate funding through the budget."
"I would therefore hope that the Council will ensure that there are in fact adequate funds (because, without money, nothing can be achieved) as well as make sure that there is a fixed timetable."
"Integration within all policy areas is very important indeed for equality, but it is necessary to have a two-pronged approach and therefore also to come up with special measures designed for specific purposes."
"It is important, then, that specific goals should be set for what one wants to achieve."
"That is why I want to ask again: in what way are you, on the part of the Council, prepared to establish specific and measurable goals for equality for the coming five-year period?"
"When it comes to funding through the budget, the question may be said to have been asked too soon because the Commission has still not issued its proposal."
"The Council cannot yet therefore take up a position on this question."
"The Council could of course indicate what its response would be if the Commission were to bring forward such a proposal for financing."
"However, my question to the Council is: does the Council not believe that the European Institutions themselves have a duty to lead by example on the issue of equality, and is it happy about the existing staff quality of the Institutions?"
"Even though Mr Prodi has initiated some reforms, it seems to me that women are still very much under-represented in the hierarchy of both the Council, the Commission and, to be honest, this institution as well."
"I want to say that we welcome President of the Commission Prodi' s proposal to strive for a higher level of competency where the Commission is concerned."
"It is our goal on the Council too to try as far as possible, whenever people are elected, to take account of qualifications."
"We would wish and hope that this would lead to the proportion of women in various posts increasing in the very near future."
"Question No 4 by (H-0473/99):"
"Subject: Common method of compiling drug statistics One of the tasks of the Lisbon Institute is to compile drug statistics for the Member States, which provide an overview of the trend in drug abuse in the EU and an opportunity to compare Member States' statistics."
"Unfortunately, there are a great many failings in this system as no common method of compiling the statistics is used."
"Will the Council press for the introduction of a common method of compiling these statistics and/or does it consider that other improvements can be made to make the system more practicable?"
"The Council understands very well how important it is to have access to precise statistical data which can be compared. In that way, it is possible to assess the nature and extent of drug use, together with the trend in drug-related crime and to analyse the success and effectiveness of the methods which have been introduced to combat drug misuse."
"In this connection, it ought to be emphasised that all Member States of the European Union now have access to statistics of this kind."
"It is also clear, however, that it is not enough to exchange national statistics if we want to develop a specifically European method. We must also ensure that the definitions any such system is based upon can be compared between one country and another."
"The work which has already been embarked upon within this field has, however, has revealed significant differences between the national systems for collecting statistics."
"The Member States use a range of different indicators to describe the incidence of drug abuse and its effects upon health, together with the trend in drug-related crime at national level."
"Definitions forming the basis of the indicators are also sometimes very different from each other."
"When it comes to the quantity of confiscated drugs, a number of Member States combine different kinds of drugs in their statistics while other countries divide the information according to criteria which are not necessarily the same from one State to another."
"The statistical information is assembled by a variety of bodies, for example by the Customs, the office of the public prosecutor or departments reporting to the police."
"At the same time, the systems for collecting, recording, evaluating and transferring the information operate at considerably different levels of centralisation."
"It is also important progressively to harmonise the principal epidemiological indicators."
"The Council understands all this very well and is supported in its disquiet by the European Parliament' s resolution of 13 April 1999, as well as by the Commission' s report on the European Union' s action plan to combat drug abuse during the period 2000-2004 and by the report of 17 March 1999 from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EDMC)."
"Ever since its second work programme for the period 1998-2000, EDMC has formally described its most important goals as being those of introducing common indicators and devising instruments and methods for comparing initiatives, schemes and legislative strategies within the European Union, as well as that of establishing a data base for existing tools, which is to make it easier to access and compare information."
"In March 1999, the EDMC reiterated its message from the previous year. There was also an initiative from the German Presidency to give a working group within the Council the task of investigating what measures are required for improving the ways in which police drug statistics are compared."
"A detailed statistical questionnaire has been prepared."
"The Member States' answers will then form the basis for preparing indispensable common standards for collecting information."
"The fact that suitable structures have been introduced within the Council has already made possible the conclusions to which I referred at the beginning of my intervention about the difficulty of comparing different national systems."
"It is the very clear intention of our Presidency to support these endeavours and ensure that the records of past and future success in reducing drug trafficking are afforded added value in both qualitative and quantitative terms."
"May I thank the Minister for that answer in which he shows that he has come to the same conclusions, namely that this is a problem."
"On the other hand, he does not perhaps indicate equally clearly how this problem is to be solved."
"It is not just a question of our being able to report to each other upon how many drugs the police are confiscating or upon what the Customs are doing. Instead, it is above all a question of the statistics we have for drug abuse among young people in Europe today."
"These are what are most interesting because they show us what the trend is, what increase is to be found and which drugs are being used."
"With this information, we can attempt in a more effective way to administer the European Community' s resources for combating any increased use of drugs."
"Statistics are important because they reveal the trends."
"The fact is that, at present, we are to a certain extent taking each other in by having different concepts when it comes to producing statistics."
"Then we put everything together at the Lisbon Institute and send it around the European Union."
"In that way, there are no reliable statistics. Nor, perhaps, are the programmes we present reliable."
"This is a task for the Council too, I believe."
"With all due respect, Mrs Hulthén, I must tell you, so that your intervention does not set a precedent, that although you have given us a great deal of information, you have not asked anything, and you have taken the floor in order to ask an additional question."
"Mr Sasi will have to answer a non-existent question, but he can try if he wants."
". (SV) As I said in my answer, it is a fact that there is a problem which we must try to solve."
"The EDMC has now undertaken to devise a common method for compiling statistics."
"However, it will then also have to be seen what resources are available."
"In then attempting to develop the required statistical method, the purpose for which the statistics are required will need very much to be borne in mind."
"Mr President, I am rather astonished by the reply of the Presidency of the Council, insofar as we are all in agreement with regard to the need for statistics."
"The European Parliament has restated this in a resolution, and as the President of the Council has reminded us."
"This has been requested several times by the Monitoring Centre."
"There is a working party with the Retox network, and according to the response of the Presidency of the Council, we still do not know when we will have the joint statistics."
"I believe that this is really important because we have fifteen national policies which are all absolutely disastrous in the field of drugs."
"It is therefore urgent that the European citizens understand that the increase in resources allocated to the fight against drugs corresponds directly to the increase in the consumption of drugs and that therefore the policies that have been pursued are a complete failure."
"I would like to ask the Minister when we will finally get these joint statistics which will demonstrate the disastrous strategy of the prohibitionist policy."
". (SV) Let me just say briefly that we are on the way forwards."
"We have, then, taken steps to make progress and to obtain uniform statistics."
"It is still not possible, however, to give any date for when everything will be ready."
"Question No 5 by (H-0475/99):"
"Subject: Common policy Speaking in Strasbourg in July as a representative of the country currently holding the Presidency of the Council, Finland' s Foreign Minister stated one of Finland' s objectives as being to ensure that the Union had a common will, a common policy and a common voice."
"Does this mean that Finland, which is militarily neutral, is prepared, like other countries, to establish a common defence policy within the Union in order that the Union may have a common will, a common policy and a common voice?"
"Mr President, the honourable Member, Mr Seppänen, knows it was firmly concluded at the European Council at Cologne, that the Union would participate to the full in international action."
"Union Heads of State and Government also said they intended to grant the European Union the means and facilities to deal with the job of creating a common European security and defence policy."
"At the European Council in Cologne the Union' s readiness to prevent a conflict and manage a crisis was discussed."
"Reference was made to a credible military capability specifically in connection with controlling international crises."
"It was also emphasised at the European Council that the Union' s development of a crisis control capability would improve its position when involved in the furtherance of world peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter."
"Work in the area of crisis management is in total harmony with the neutrality or non-alignment policy of Member States."
"The conclusions of the European Council in Cologne specifically state that there would be no interference when it came to the special status of the different Member States with regard to guarantees made concerning a collective defence."
"Mr President, the representatives of the country holding the Presidency have stated, in various connections, that we shall be adopting the practice of qualified majority decision-making on the subject of a common foreign and security policy also, and, evidently, since Cologne, on a common defence policy as well."
"I would ask the Minister how the country holding the Presidency is preparing for the adoption of the practice of qualified majority voting in the areas of foreign and security policy and defence policy."
"Mr President, as the country holding the Presidency, Finland has prepared for qualified majority voting by asking Member States in what areas they are prepared to increase majority voting."
"Preparations are still in hand, and it is impossible to say yet whether it will extend to foreign and security policy, but if we consider the history of preparatory work for a moment, it has to be said that taking binding decisions based on a qualified majority, for example in matters of defence, is not very likely to come about, at least very quickly."
"Question No 6 by (H-0477/99):"
"Subject: Attacks on homosexuals There has recently been an escalation in the number of attacks on gay and lesbian communities throughout Europe."
"These crimes are particularly serious in a region such as the European Union, where the protection of human rights is a basic issue, especially at the present time when we are drafting a European Charter of Fundamental Rights"
"Under new Article 13 introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam the Council is entitled to take appropriate action to combat discrimination based, amongst other things, on sexual orientation."
"For this reason, homophobic attacks of this kind on freedom of sexual orientation call for a clear and tough response from the Council."
"What action does the Council intend to take to prevent and avoid attacks of this kind within the territory of the European Union?"
"Mr President, the Council considers the protection of fundamental rights to be very important."
"As Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union states, the Union is based on the principles of freedom and democracy, the respect for fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law."
"The same Article states that the Union respects fundamental rights as a general principle of Community law."
"With the Treaty of Amsterdam becoming effective on May 1 this year, the new Article 13 of the EU Treaty gives the Council the power, within the limits of power the Community is entrusted with under the Treaty, to take action to combat any form of discrimination inter alia discrimination based on sexual orientation without, however, limiting the application of other provisions in the Treaty."
"The provisions require a proposal from the Commission and a hearing in the European Parliament, for the Council to take a legal decision."
"The Council has to say that, thus far, there has been no such proposal from the Commission that is based on the new Article 13 referred to."
"The Council would remind everyone, for the sake of clarity, that it is the exclusive authority of the Member States to prevent the attacks and attempts on people' s lives the honourable Member refers to."
"They alone are responsible for maintaining order and protecting people and property."
"I would like to use this intervention to the House to draw the Council' s attention to an extremely serious matter."
"In the European Union' s territory, in our territory, a whole range of completely intolerant attitudes and behaviour bordering on the fascistic is currently prevailing towards homosexuals."
"Europe has always been at the forefront in the protection of human rights, coexistence and tolerance, which have made this territory the most advanced in social terms, and we cannot allow ourselves to go back on these achievements of liberty, tolerance and coexistence."
"We must denounce the slightest hint of a divergence away from these strikingly European values."
"In the face of these facts, we should be concerned, and we should react in order to eradicate attacks on people, whatever their moral, religious, ideological or sexual orientation may be."
"Having said this, and considering that we are now at a historic moment in European construction, with the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, with a debate on a Charter of Fundamental Rights about to take place, and considering also the powers conferred on the Council by the Treaties in order that it carries out action which guarantees these rights of European citizens, I would like to know what the Council' s attitude is on the contents of this Charter of Fundamental Rights concerning the protection of sexual freedom and sexual choice rather than sexual guidelines."
"Mr President, a respect for, and tolerance of, human rights are basic values of the Union. They are Western European basic values."
"In this regard, we all have to work hard to create a climate in all Member States in which, for example, sexual minorities are viewed with respect and appreciation."
"As for rules, they can have an impact on developments to some extent, but in this case it is more a question of attitudes."
"Attitudes can also be influenced through action in the areas of cultural policy and social policy."
"It has to be said that all sectors of society must try to cooperate so that the climate in all European States is as tolerant as possible."
"Thank you very much."
"I do not think you read the question - it said what action will be taken?"
"We know what has to be done, but it is no use standing there saying that until the Commission acts or until Parliament acts, you will do nothing."
"Such inaction actually endorses these attacks upon minorities."
"Therefore, I offer you another chance to answer: will the Council undertake an audit of Member States to establish those states which have discriminatory legislation against lesbians and gay men, which fail to offer equal rights, equal civil rights to lesbians and gay men and which fail to offer equal protection under the law to lesbians and gay men?"
"Only when we have determined this can we begin the process of implementing Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The talking has to stop."
"The excuses have to end."
"We must act and act swiftly or else this House and all its institutions will always be held in low regard."
"Mr President, I would like to say that we really have a proper legislative basis insofar as all Member States of the European Union are parties to the Council of Europe' s Convention on Human Rights."
"This agreement is of immense value with respect to civil rights, human rights and tolerance."
"We also have Article 13 of the EU Treaty to refer to in such matters, but in concrete cases it has to be realised that the Union does not have its own police forces, but national governments with their own police forces in each country, which are specifically responsible for the safety of their citizens."
"Audits of the situation in the various Member States can of course be made, but I believe the primary responsibility in this matter lies totally with each Member State and its political decision makers themselves."
"Mr President, we must, of course, adopt a tough and determined line on violence and crime."
"We are all aware that that there are constantly muggings in Brussels, within sight of this Parliament, and that out there, crime is the order of the day."
"There are really no comparative statistics for Europe."
"If you ask EUROSTAT, they give extremely varied results."
"I think that we need standards for evaluating crime and that we need comparable statistics."
"During the last legislature I asked the Council to make an effort to look after the safety of Parliament' s employees and of the people of Brussels. I would also like to take this opportunity to request the Council to create a safety initiative which is for Brussels and against crime in the city."
"I must say, Mr Rübig, that I gave you the floor so that you could ask a supplementary question."
"I specifically asked the President of the Council if he is prepared to provide comparable statistics in this area."
"That was my question: will the Council try to obtain comparable statistics?"
"Mr President, I wish to say in answer to the honourable Member' s question that there is certainly much benefit to be derived from statistics in themselves, but the question is of a general nature, so that if the honourable Member specifies what sort of statistics he would like to see, I can take a position on this issue later on."
"However, I want to say that this is very much a question of attitudes, and, obviously, in a society in which there are strong clashes of opinion, attitudes often easily harden."
"It is quite a lot to do with what sort of spirit prevails in a society."
"As for deeds of violence in general, in just over a week from now there is a Union Summit organised in Tampere, whose purpose is also to debate how crime, and violent crime also, can be prevented generally in the Union area."
"Mr Dupuis is asking for the floor so that he can table a procedural motion."
"Mr President, Mr Rübig' s question had nothing to do with the question which appeared in the agenda."
"Maybe it was a very interesting question for him, but in this case he must ask a question like the other Members of this House."
"This is not the time to call Mr Rübig back."
"I have already said that any supplementary questions made must be relevant."
"Furthermore, only one person should be presiding at a time in this House."
"If there are several Presidents, the whole thing will take much longer."
"Question No 7 by (H-0480/99):"
"Subject: Denmark's share in the capital of the ECB Will the Council state what Denmark's share in the ECB's capital has to be, as a percentage and as an actual sum, if Denmark wishes to play a full part in EMU?"
"Mr President, under Article 28 of the European Central Bank Statute, the ECB' s paid-up capital amounts to EUR 5 billion."
"According to the formula for ECB Member States' subscriptions set out in Article 29(1) of the Statute, the Bank of Denmark' s share of the paid-up capital of the ECB is 1.6709%."
"Member States outside of the euro area pay, according to Article 48 of the Statute, only a minimum percentage of the share of entered capital to share in the operational costs of the ECB, if the General Council of the ECB so decides."
"On the basis of the Article in question, central banks outside the euro area had to pay a share of the ECB' s operational costs, which was 5% of the share of the entered capital."
"In Denmark' s case, it was EUR 4,177,250, which takes account of the revenue that resulted from the discontinued work of the EMI."
"Thank you for your answer. I should like to ask an additional question."
"The fact is, the huge power which the European Central Bank has to intervene in national financial institutions and the national banks is part and parcel of a highly cryptic system reminiscent of a nest of Chinese boxes."
"I am very familiar with Article 28 of the Statute."
"In addition to this, there is Article 30 which stipulates that the contribution may be increased by the currency reserves to ten times as much, that is to say EUR 50 billion. What is more, Article 30(4) has a condition to the effect that the European Central Bank can call in currency reserves over and above the maximum, which is set at EUR 50 billion."
"This is a very large sum, whether it be for Denmark or for other countries, and this maximum may, of course be established by means of a majority decision in the Council on the basis of a recommendation of the Board of Management, which also makes majority decisions, while each individual country has the voting weight to which its contribution entitles it."
"My question is: are there any limits?"
"Mr President, it is my understanding - although I have to say there was very little time for a legal amendment - that it is the European Central Bank that will make the decision on this."
"I also want to thank the Council for their answers."
"I have two additional questions."
"First of all, I am curious to know how large Sweden' s share will be as a percentage if we join the single currency."
"We have received some information here about Denmark' s share."
"Secondly, I just want you to confirm that the Council can, against a Member State' s will, increase this share so that the country concerned has to pay more. That is to say, it can be forced to deposit a larger proportion of its currency reserve with the Central Bank, and there is no real upper limit."
"I have to admit that, in this particular case, I do not have sufficient material to be able to answer the Member' s question concerning Sweden' s share and the procedure in question."
"I would ask to come back to the Member with a written answer."
"Question No 8 by (H-0481/99):"
"Subject: Non­compliance with Regulation 1239/98 on a reduction in and ban on the use of drift­nets The Luxembourg Council of Ministers of June 1998 agreed to ban the use of drift-nets for tuna fishing from 1 January 2002."
"Given the blatant non-compliance with this regulation, the delays in communicating lists, the increase in the number of vessels using these nets, the harm to the tuna fishing industry and the marine ecosystem, the serious economic repercussions for fishermen in the north-west Bay of Biscay and the total lack of response from the EU to the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in relation to the overfishing of this species, what measures will the Council take to ensure strict compliance with Community legislation in this area?"
"Does the Council intend to urge the Commission to incorporate the ICCAT=s recommendations into Community legislation?"
"Mr President, first, the Council would like to remind everyone that it is within the competence of the Commission to monitor compliance with Community legislation in the Member States."
"This also holds true for monitoring action that Member States have to implement within the framework of the common fisheries policy."
"It has not come to the attention of the Council that the application of Regulation 1239/98 has been found wanting."
"So far the Council has received no proposal to implement the recommendations of the ICCAT regarding restrictions on white tuna catches."
"The only thing I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council is that this does in fact fall within the competence of the Commission, but I put this question to the Commission, who could not give me an answer yesterday, and I still have not received an answer."
"There have obviously been cases of non-compliance, there are delays of four months in communicating lists, the number of boats is increasing - between 57% and 63% more in Ireland and England - at a time when there should be fewer. Harm is being done to the ecosystem, people are suffering financially and the ICCAT recommendations are not being implemented."
"I shall therefore ask again, how many more facts and figures do the Commission and the Council want us to give them before they actually take steps to ensure that this does not continue?"
"Mr President, we most certainly like to receive information."
"If we do, we convey it to the Commission so that they can embark on the necessary measures."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we all agree that the element of control is essential to guaranteeing a sustainable level of fishing."
"To this end, the Council, and the Commission, Mr President, adopted in 1998, with this aim of conserving our resources, a decision on the progressive disappearance of drift-nets also known as volantas."
"I would like to ask the Council, and the Commission, how it feels, in general terms, that this campaign is developing; if it is true that this has been a good year for tuna and that this is why disputes between the different fleets that work the Bay of Biscay have been avoided. I would like to know by how many boats each country has reduced its fleets as a result of the moratorium and if this method is proving useful in reducing the pressure on tuna populations."
"Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask you if the fact that several European boats - and I hope you will tell me just how many - have replaced their drift-nets with other high yield methods has brought about greater protection for tuna fisheries or if, quite the opposite, we are now seeing increased pressure on tuna populations, which is the opposite effect to the one we wanted."
"Mr President, unfortunately, I have to say that I cannot really answer these questions."
"The Council does not have these statistics at its disposal."
"These statistics are in the possession of the Commission, and I would ask the honourable Member to refer the question to the Commission, which can give him the information he requires."
"Mr President, drift nets are also used in the Baltic, where they lead to overfishing of salmon."
"I would ask the representative of the Council this: if he has no information on reductions in tuna catches, has he any information on the natural salmon spawn last year in the Tornio river that separates Finland from Sweden, and will the representative bring it to the attention of the representative of the Commission that drift net fishing should also be restricted in the Baltic, and not just in the tuna fishing waters now being talked about?"
"Mr President, I have an idea that drift net fishing is restricted in the Baltic, but I would have to consult Kalevi Hemilä, who is President of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture, and convey these questions and this information to him."
"I think that in some cases, we should direct these questions to national Parliaments."
"Question No 9 by (H-0484/99):"
"Subject: Referendum for civil concord in Algeria What are the Council' s views on the referendum on the Law on Civil Concord held in Algeria on 16 September?"
"What measures and actions will the EU undertake with this Mediterranean partner over the coming months?"
"Mr President, after the referendum on the Law on Civil Concord held on 16 September 1999, the country holding the Presidency of the Council issued a declaration, on behalf of the European Union, which also answers the honourable Member' s question in full."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thought that here we had a question on which the Council could finally shine, because this is a matter of enormous importance for current European foreign policy - as the recent referendum showed - for a partner of ours such as Algeria, a country with an extremely important role in the Mediterranean, and for the relationship we have with that country."
"Instead, the Council has given an answer which is a kind of lengthy side-step which makes my role useless."
"This is a Parliamentary Question Time."
"I ask the President in Office of the Council to be explicit, to use words I can understand, not bureaucratic ones, and I ask him to assess what view the Council should take on the referendum on the Law of Civil Concord held recently in Algeria."
"Please speak to us in words that the citizens and I can understand."
"Mr President, perhaps it would be best if I read the essential points of the declaration: ""The European Union is satisfied with the results of the referendum held on 16 September in Algeria."
"The Algerian people expressed their support for President Bouteflika' s plan for national harmony and peace."
"The European Union hopes that Algeria will finally rid itself of the violence its people have had to suffer for years and start national reconstruction to bring about the political stability that is an essential requirement of economic and social progress."
"The European Union reconfirms it is prepared to support and encourage the renewal process in Algeria, especially through Euro-Mediterranean partnership, including the prompt recommencement of talks on establishing the Euro-Mediterranean Association Pact."
"The Union believes it is very important the political dialogue that has commenced with Algeria should continue, and it is satisfied that a meeting at ministerial level is to be held with the EU troika on 3 November in Algeria."""
"I would like to say that, as the honourable Member stated, Algeria is a very important country for the Union, and we consider it to be a positive sign that the referendum was able to take place."
"We are satisfied with the results, and we hope that peaceful development can gain strength in Algeria in the future."
"Question No 10 by (H-0488/99):"
"Subject: Agreement with Croatia What progress has been reached with preparations for the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement with Croatia and the release of PHARE funds?"
"Mr President, as the honourable Member knows, in granting a preferential agreement on trade and PHARE aid, as with contractual relations, a regional approach to the action is adopted by the European Union that it has applied to the countries of South-East Europe."
"The countries in question are aware of the criteria they have to meet, and the sectors in which the Union hopes progress will be made."
"The Council regularly reviews the situation with regard to the progress that has been made in meeting the criteria set for this approach."
"In connection with the last review, carried out on 21 June 1999, the Council found that political dialogue between the Croatian Government and the opposition had improved over the previous six-month period."
"It was the Council' s opinion that progress, however, had been insufficient in the areas of democratic development, human rights and the judicial system, especially regarding the separation of powers and the return of minority groups."
"The Council also considered that the government had not begun proper information campaigns on the rights of the people who wish to return."
"On the basis of its assessment, the Council decided that a unilateral preferential agreement on trade should continue to be applied to Croatia."
"The Council found that democratic development should be furthered through inter alia an overhaul of the media, electoral reform, and the return of refugees."
"It noted, however, certain positive moves with regard to elections and the media."
"The Council presumed that if current developments continued in these areas, an opportunity would soon present itself for Croatia to benefit from the PHARE programme."
"Regarding contractual relations, the Council stated that the commencement of talks on a Stability and Association Pact, which is a new type of bilateral agreement that the Union is offering the countries of South-East Europe, would be discussed on the basis of a report by the Commission when Croatia has met the relevant conditions."
"The Council next intends to discuss conditionality in November this year."
"Mr President, I am referring directly to a discussion with Mr Verheugen in Questions to Council before the European elections, and I would like to say that, of course, Croatia has many things to improve on."
"But many people who were driven out have now returned, and democracy there is very highly developed."
"Therefore, I would like to ask you why Russia is receiving a TACIS programme as is the Ukraine, and why States like Albania which have many problems also have a Agreement on Trade and Cooperation."
"Why are tougher criteria imposed on Croatia - and I am afraid that this does appear to be the case - than on any other country?"
"The PHARE programme and the Agreement on Trade and Cooperation are the first steps in taking a country forwards in order to reform and open it up."
"My question is: do you not want to take this step at last?"
"Mr President, I wish to say that the same criteria apply to all countries."
"And, indeed, as regards Croatia, positive developments are taking place, and we believe, hopefully, that we can also make headway fairly soon with the PHARE appropriations."
"Question No 11 by Mr Deva lapses as it appeared on the Agenda of the present part-session."
"Mr Deva has been informed of this in writing."
"Question No 12 by (H-0497/99):"
"Subject: 'Cultural cleansing' by the Front National In the town of Orange in the south of France the Front National has conducted a 'cultural cleansing' (èpuration culturelle) operation in the municipal library by banning what it regards as impure literature."
"For fear of knowledge of both the past and the future, books on subjects such as Ancient Egypt, and the EU on the brink of the Millennium have been removed."
"This is an attack on the freedom of expression and the public' s unrestricted right to culture unparalleled in the EU or anywhere else in the democratic world."
"What action does the Presidency intend to take against this form of cultural cleansing and to strengthen the democratic and informational role of libraries?"
"The Council attaches a very great deal of weight to protecting fundamental rights."
"According to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the European Union is founded upon a number of principles common to the Member States, namely the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, together with the fundamental freedoms and the principle of the constitutional state."
"It is specified in the same Article that the fundamental rights are to be respected by the European Union as general principles for Community law."
"It ought however to be noted that circumstances of the kind described in the Member' s question are a matter for the Member States."
"On the question of libraries and the promotion of democracy and culture, the Council would remind you that, in Article 151 of the EC Treaty, it is specified that the Community' s efforts to contribute to the development of culture in the Member States, at the same time as respecting the latter' s national and regional diversity, should be aimed at promoting cooperation between the Member States. If need be, the Community' s efforts should also support and augment the Member States' activities in a number of areas: firstly, improving people' s knowledge of, and disseminating information about, the European peoples' culture and history; secondly, preserving and protecting such cultural heritage as is of significance to Europe as a whole; thirdly, promoting cultural exchange of a non-commercial nature; and fourthly, supporting artistic and literary creation, including within the audiovisual sector."
"In accordance with the codecision procedure, the Council, together with the European Parliament, therefore assumed on 28 June 1999 a common position on the adoption of a decision to establish a uniform instrument for financing cultural cooperation and for planning programmes for such cooperation."
"It is called the Culture 2000 programme."
"Thank you for your answer."
"I consider it a disgrace to this Parliament that we have representatives here who stand for this type of ideological and intellectual ""cleansing"" ."
"I should like to ask if the Council considers that this perversion of local democracy is compatible with the European Union' s fundamental values."
"Where our fundamental values are concerned, it may indeed in this case be said that the rights which ought to apply throughout the European Union have not been properly respected."
"In the end, however, it is always a matter for the individual nation state to guarantee that human rights and other fundamental rights are guaranteed in that country."
"Question No 13 by (H-0499/99):"
"Subject: Peripheral island regions Will the Council, under the Finnish Presidency, outline its policies towards peripheral Objective I and II island regions in relation to infrastructure, agricultural and employment policies?"
"Mr President, many thanks for your sympathy."
"When it approved the new Code on Structural Funds last June, the Council defined in the basic regulation the primary objectives, general principles and programming procedures for the period 2000 - 2006."
"In the various regulations on Structural Funds, the Council has defined the rules for each fund and, in particular, their areas of operation."
"As the Council charged the Commission with the task of applying the codes, the Council is not competent to specify sector strategies for Objectives 1 and II, based on the code in question."
"Mr President, firstly, the new rules on Structural Funds were approved last June, and, obviously, the relevant decisions were made."
"As for the island regions generally, it could be said that when people in the Union have spoken of areas that have fallen behind, for example, in many conclusions made at Summit meetings and in other declarations, particular attention has been drawn to these very island regions."
"Question No 14 by (H-0501/99):"
"Subject: Duty free Will the Council outline its strategy aimed at assisting Irish airports, ports, airlines and passenger shipping companies in their efforts to overcome the loss of income resulting from the ending of duty-free and how does it intend to safeguard consumers against higher fares, protect and enhance employment and support vital infrastructure developments which, in the past, were made possible by sales of duty-free goods?"
"Mr President, according to the decision taken by the Council in 1992, duty-free sales to travellers within the Community do not apply to the single market, which does not have any tax restrictions."
"However, the Council decided in 1992 to keep the situation with regard to duty-free shops unchanged for a temporary period ending in June 1999."
"The Council considers that it is primarily the task of the Member States to alleviate both the social affects on the sector and regional problems in border districts that have been caused by the duty-free sales being discontinued."
"A communication was issued to the Council on 17 February 1999 by the Commission containing Community instruments at the disposal of Member States to deal with the possible consequences of the ending of duty-free."
"Does the President-in-Office of the Council understand that the ending of duty-free contrary to the majority view of the Member States has undermined the strategy of airports, airlines and passenger shipping companies aimed at keeping fares at a low level?"
"Will the Council undertake to keep the decision on the review and request the Commission to ensure that airports in Objective I areas and Objective I areas in transition are not penalised by the loss of revenue resulting from the ending of duty-free, which inevitably leads to higher prices for consumers, loss of earnings for airlines, shipping companies, ports and airports, and threatens employment for the industries and small firms which have supplied a range of goods to duty-free shops?"
"Mr President, firstly, personally, I have noticed that most large airports are doing very well, despite the ending of duty-free, and, as I said in my reply, we consider that it is primarily a matter for each Member State to try to alleviate both economic and other problems - mainly problems of employment - that will result from the fact that duty-free sales have stopped."
"As the author is not present, Question No 15 lapses."
"Question No 16 by (H-0505/99):"
"Subject: New EU Combat Poverty Programme As the Council is aware, under the Treaty of Maastricht no progress was made towards the adoption of a new Combat Poverty Programme."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, does the Council now intend to press for a comprehensive EU Combat Poverty Programme and to what extent will it support EU action for housing and the homeless?"
"Mr President, the Council takes a positive view of those new opportunities to prevent social exclusion that it gained with Article 137(2) on social provisions when the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force. Within these frameworks the Council can now implement measures to promote cooperation between Member States."
"This being the case, it supports such initiatives to prevent social exclusion that attempt to improve access to information, improve information and the exchange of best practices, promote innovative approaches and evaluate experience."
"As the measures to be decided on and implemented in this area are very delicate in nature, the legislator has included this area in the codecision procedure, meaning that the European Parliament will also function as legislator."
"Up until now the Council has had no proposals from the Commission that would have any bearing on the special problems mentioned in the question."
"I should like to thank the Minister for his answer."
"I know how difficult this area has been in the past for the Council."
"However, there is a very firm majority in Parliament who are in favour of a European involvement, not just in the exchange of best practices or the cooperation procedures, which we agree with, but also in utilising some of the previous programmes which existed in the past; in particular the Poverty I and Poverty II programmes and the way that they dealt with the problems using a bottom-up approach."
"By analogy we already have at the moment within the European Community initiatives like the Leader programme and the Urban programme where this bottom-up approach has been proven to be successful, and has resolved some of the problems that have been faced."
"Could I ask the President-in-Office whether he would be willing to bring forward an initiative at Council level calling on the Commission to put in place a new poverty programme that will utilise the best of the past but to make it a real programme, not just experts exchanging ideas, or meetings taking place in exotic parts of the Union."
"Mr President, I would like to say in reply to the question that such programmes that have up until now been implemented have had barely any significant effect in the Union area."
"For this reason, it is the opinion of the Council that a new approach should be found to deal with this issue."
"Question No 17 by (H-0511/99):"
"Subject: 'Open' Council meetings The Finnish Presidency began with the laudable aim of holding many of the Council' s meetings in open session, accessible to the public and the media."
"What success has the Presidency had with this objective during this period, and what proportion of the meetings have been fully or in part open to the public?"
"Where the Presidency did not succeed in its plan to hold open meetings, which Member States opposed it and prevented it from being carried out?"
"An interesting question with which to end the sitting. Mr Sasi has the floor."
"On the Presidency' s initiative, the Council has in fact approved a fairly complete list of questions which ought to be taken up for public debate in the course of these six months."
"These questions are all based around a common theme: ""a strong and open Europe in the new Millennium"" ."
"The Presidency has also undertaken to improve the quality of public debates and increase the interest these generate, partly through preparing the debates better."
"In advance of any public debate, the Presidency therefore distributes a discussion document with a list of questions for the Member States and the Commission. This constitutes a springboard for the discussions."
"It is too early to provide a definitive evaluation of this procedure."
"When it comes to the public debates which have already taken place in accordance with this principle, it must however be noted that a satisfactory start has been made."
"With regard to the Member' s question about certain Member States' attitude to these initiatives from the Presidency, it should be pointed out that the initiatives were approved unanimously by the Council."
"I want to thank the Council of Ministers for this answer."
"It is, in fact, a most excellent initiative by the Finnish Presidency to arrange for greater openness in the work of the Council."
"This is something which is really positive and timely."
"It is indeed a fundamental democratic right to be able to have insight into the actual processes of legislation and, in that way, to be able to insist upon political accountability."
"My question following on from this is about whether it has ever happened that whole Council meetings, from start to finish, have been open to the public."
"Or has it only been specified points on the agenda that have been debated in public?"
"Have you ever, during your Presidency, been presented with objections which, in one meeting or another of the Council of Ministers, have prevented you from having as much openness as you would have wished for?"
"With regard to the first question about the extent to which whole meetings have been open to the public, the answer is that they have not been."
"We have always had some point on the agenda which has been discussed openly but the remainder of each meeting has, so far a in any case, been closed to the public, as it will continue to be during the Finnish Presidency."
"What was the second question?"
"My second question was about whether there had ever been a case in which you wanted to have a greater degree of openness but in which some individual Member State, in one context or another during the period of your Presidency, prevented this and used its veto to oppose such openness."
"What can be said is that the practice has been for the country holding the Presidency to decide which points on the agenda are to be discussed openly."
"As far as I know, all the other countries have approved this."
"It may be that, in certain situations, we have consulted other Member States, but in principle, it has been the decision of the country holding the Presidency which has been acted upon."
"As far as I know, no problems have, at least so far, arisen involving other Member States."
"As you know, Mr Sjöstedt, Mr Sasi is renowned for his discretion."
"I think that he has answered you as best he can, and we are very grateful to him for the great mental and physical efforts he has had to employ this afternoon."
"I am also pleased because we have ended the sitting on time, in harmony with the Council."
"As the time allotted to Questions to the Council has run out, Question Nos. 18 to 27 will be answered in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.30 p.m.)"
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Chechnya"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B5-0142/1999, by Mr Maaten and Mr Väyrynen, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Chechnya;"
"B5-0149/1999, by Mr Schori and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the alarming situation in Chechnya;"
"B5-0158/1999, by Mr Markov and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Chechnya;"
"B5-0168/1999, by Mr Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group, on the war in Chechnya;"
"B5-0177/1999, by Mr Oostlander and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE Group, on violence in the Northern Caucasus."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is certainly not the first time that this House has talked about a war in Chechnya, nor is it the first time that we have talked about a problem in the Caucasus."
"Mind you, compared with the war that took place in 1995, the motives behind this war are much more understandable."
"The events which have taken place in Dagestan and Chechnya in recent weeks render it almost imperative that this pressing problem be resolved through military action."
"The problem in the Caucasus, in Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia is actually nothing new."
"It has been around for decades, for centuries, and it is therefore also quite important that in our resolution, we express the view that in general in this area, the problem has to be tackled and a solution has to be sought, something which is important for the region as a whole and which will bring stability to the entire region as well as contribute to its development."
"The proposal in the resolution to convene a New Millennium Conference in which European partners and organisations would also participate and provide structures for such negotiations is, therefore, very important."
"I hope that our Russian negotiating partners will take this up accordingly."
"The European Union also has to look into the problem of refugees, and very closely at that."
"Hundreds of thousands are again fleeing."
"We still have things to do as regards the refugee problem from previous conflicts."
"I would like to call upon the Commission to make proposals as quickly as possible in this regard as to how the problem can be solved; how a way can be found for the refugees to survive the winter, which is imminent."
"I think that being able to help in this area is a matter of the deepest concern for Europe."
"Mr President, it is clear that the problems facing Chechnya are complex."
"I am pleased that the resolution as well as a number of the amendments that have been submitted point to the complexity of the problems."
"Russia has been in Chechnya for years now."
"This has nothing to do with the government that is currently in power. The situation already existed under the Tsarist regime."
"It is easy to understand why, in many countries of the Caucasus, some of whose problems differ widely, there is great opposition to Russia' s presence."
"I therefore think it is important that we first ask Russia to really get down to talking to everyone in Chechnya."
"That is the only solution."
"It is important as well that we ask them also to take care of all the refugees that come from there."
"That is why we intend to support some of the amendments submitted by the PPE."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once more we have a war."
"In this motion, this term, unfortunately, does not appear and therefore, I am pleased that Mrs Krehl used this expression."
"Do you also not consider it appalling and alarming that both in thought and deed, responsible politicians regard the use of military violence as an indispensable element in the resolution of conflicts?"
"And do you also not consider it appalling and alarming that increasingly, the inhumane tactic of bombardment, which was employed to excess in Yugoslavia and where nobody suffered more than the civilian population, is again regarded, in the meantime, as being an adequate policy?"
"Mrs Krehl, I simply cannot understand you when you talk about fighting terror with terror, and when you express understanding for the current situation in Russia."
"Military violence has no place in the political spectrum in the resolution of conflicts."
"Mr President, a brutal colonial war is currently taking place in the Caucasus which is being disguised as an anti-terrorist and anti-fundamentalist campaign, I could almost say a holy crusade."
"A few years ago, the talk was of the Gulf War, no blood for oil."
"I now miss these demonstrations because there, blood is indeed flowing for oil."
"Mr Putin has talked quite openly of the fact that the war in the Caucasus is exclusively, or primarily, about energy and raw material interests which are being defended there."
"Human rights have been trampled upon in an extraordinarily brutal fashion, as was already corroborated by the OSCE during the last Chechen war."
"Even at that time, we needed a long time to become aware of the reality and we later said, ""Yes, if only we had known that"" ."
"This is what we should avoid this time."
"It was announced yesterday that Russia' s military budget for next year is to be increased by EUR 1 billion on account of the Chechen war."
"You know that Russia would today be unable to repay its debts without IMF credits and without money from the EU; in other words, we are paying for this brutal war."
"Therefore, we have a large responsibility to bring our political weight and the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation to bear in order to stop this war and to ensure that dialogue is again entered into with the Chechen President, elected under the supervision of the OSCE, and with the Chechen parliament, also elected under the supervision of the OSCE."
"You are aware that Moscow has reactivated the pseudo-parliamentary Council in Moscow that was established before the armistice, to which it has signed up."
"It recognises this Council and in so doing, has ruthlessly broken this agreement, which came about under the auspices of the OSCE."
"We must put a stop to this."
"I must say in fairly unequivocal terms, Mrs Krehl, that I do not understand how, exactly ten years to the day that it was plotted to use the military against refugees, exiles, prospective emigrants and demonstrators in Saxony, the SPD Chairman of Saxony can express sympathy for military action."
"At that time, I would, however, have wished for a similarly clear position from Mr Markov and others, although that is another story."
"Irrespective of this, however, we must put a stop to this terrible campaign."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing another tragic chapter in Russia' s development after the end of the Soviet Union."
"We can certainly understand why the Russian Government, against the backdrop of terrorist attacks against its civilian population, would like to take vigorous action."
"However, one must distinguish between vigorous action in the sense of a legal development and what is currently taking place in Chechnya."
"There were many dead and injured as a result of the first Chechen conflict, numbers being totally comparable with the dead and injured witnessed in other conflicts world-wide, as well as in Europe."
"It is not right that we, as the European Parliament, on the one hand criticise human rights' violations in other regions and make strenuous efforts to put a stop to them while, on the other hand, stay silent on the issue in Russia because we are talking about an important economic partner."
"Even in Russia' s case, the European Parliament is called upon and (we, as the European Union are called upon) to defend all people clearly and unequivocally, and to speak out in favour of human rights and against human rights' violations."
"For this reason, it is good that we are today dealing with this matter in an urgent procedure."
"Mr President, the Russian Parliament is trying to impeach this same President for the former war in Chechnya."
"The war is political, it is taking place at the same time as election campaigns in Russia, so that any way out must also be political."
"It will not be possible to get these fighters out of the mountains using force."
"Russia has got its own Kurdish problem, which is evidently just as difficult to solve as it has been in Turkey."
"In both cases international aid is required simply on account of the refugees, some of whose camps are out in the open. Soon they will be covered in snow."
"In addition, there is the threat of the conflict spreading."
"Military operations are now taking place in the territories of at least five States and for this reason the matter is already an international one."
"The OSCE and the Union must offer to negotiate between the two sides so that in this way, the stalemate, which seems time and again to lead to war in the area, can be broken."
"We must act swiftly to aid the refugees because they are the innocent ones in what has happened."
"It is therefore a question of a political solution - I do not believe a military one to be possible - and we now have the opportunity to help Russia, which is in a difficult political situation in any case, by offering help to find a solution and bring about negotiations on the Chechen problem."
"Mr President, we are again dealing with what we might call the conflict of interests between the principle of the territorial integrity of a State and the principle of self-determination of a people."
"As regards what is today Russia and what was once the Soviet Union, this second principle has been implemented smoothly in Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus and the Caucasus."
"But it seems that within the Caucasus, this does not apply in the case of Chechnya."
"The international community has made every effort to help the Kosovars, but not the Chechens."
"The international community has supported independence for East Timor, but not for Chechnya."
"I wonder: why is there this discrimination against a people which has every right to self-determination?"
"Mr President, there is nothing new about the conflict between Russia and Chechnya, that small country in the Caucasus with little more than a million inhabitants which, nevertheless, has the same right as any large country to freely determine its own future."
"The last precursor to the current conflict took place between 1994 and 1996, a war which cost 100,000 lives."
"Now, since 22 September, Russian warplanes have begun to bomb Grozny and other cities."
"The Russian army has entered the Republic' s territory and has invaded, according to its own sources, a third of its territory causing death, destruction and a massive exodus of more than 100,000 refugees - women, children and the elderly - who have entered neighbouring Ingushetia, whose President is now talking of humanitarian disaster and is requesting international aid which is not arriving."
"It is also true that Russia has, in previous weeks, suffered horrendous terrorist attacks which have caused considerable loss of life, supposedly carried out by guerrillas who are based in the mountains of the Caucasus."
"The European Union must not remain passive in the face of this conflict, once again displaying the same spectacular inactivity that we showed during the early years of the war in Yugoslavia."
"It is essential and urgent that all the institutions of the European Union make a serious plea to the Governments of Russia and Chechnya to end the escalation of war, silence their weapons and take up political dialogue, using all our resources - of whatever type - so that our voice may be heard."
"It is essential and urgent that we use all the measures available to us so that we may re-assert human rights in the region, so that the refugees may count on all the humanitarian aid that they require and so that, finally, they may return to their homes as a result of peace being established once more."
"I simply wanted to ask whether the Commission will press Georgia, in view of the supply problems, to build the 700m of road which is lacking up to the Chechen border, and which was not constructed following pressure from Russia, so that humanitarian supplies may, in future, reach the Chechen border?"
"You will recall that the first thing I mentioned in my contribution here was to express deep concern about the threat to stability in the Caucuses that this conflict represents."
"I fear that if we do what is being suggested here, if we commit ourselves very directly on that specific matter, we might not be helpful in terms of strengthening stability in the region."
"We have to do what is possible, so I will not commit myself to any specific action that is suggested here."
"We will have to find many different ways - perhaps unexpected ways - of solving the logistical problems of getting assistance to the people who need it, but it is difficult to promise specific action on this one."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"European Code on arms exports"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B5-0143/1999 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the EU Code of Conduct on the export or transfer of arms;"
"B5-0152/1999 by Mr Van den Berg and Mr Howitt, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the First Annual Review of the EU Code of Conduct on the export or transfer of arms;"
"B5-0157/1999 by Mr Morgantini and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the EU Code of Conduct on the export or transfer of arms;"
"B5-0163/1999 by Mr McKenna and others, on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group, on the EU Code of Conduct on the export or transfer of arms;"
"B5-0175/1999 by Mr Morillon and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the export or transfer of arms."
"Mr President, we have to change this resolution in one important respect and it is for a gratifying reason."
"In paragraph 1 we urge the Council to publish its report on arms exports - and the Council has now decided to do so."
"When we have the vote this afternoon I would like to make an oral amendment to that effect, noting with satisfaction that the Council has published its report."
"This is a very good example of transparency."
"It is a good example for the Member States, it is a good example for the EU as a whole, and we can all be happy that at least we have achieved some progress in this field."
"Finally I would like to note that what we do jointly as a Union in this area has a lot of influence."
"This really is progress, when we can act together on this issue, and when what individual countries are doing is less important."
"Mr President, I too consider it an important step but, unlike Mr Haarder, I am extremely dissatisfied."
"Three obvious things come to mind."
"Firstly, I find it depressing that a Code allowing arms to be exported to Indonesia up to the summer of 1999 is obviously totally insufficient."
"Secondly, if the rules are so totally different whereby arms exports to Yugoslavia are prohibited by law, but are permitted to Indonesia, for example, then clearly standards other than those contained in the Code, namely economic interests and trade, hold sway."
"Thirdly, it naturally occurs to me that the dependency of governments on these economic interests is so great that no uniform standards are enforceable in this regard."
"It is for this reason that I considered it extremely necessary that this Parliament is included in supervising arms exports, over and above the transparency which is desirable."
"Mr President, arms trading is a persistent plague, which also distorts the development of the poorest countries."
"Therefore, the fact that the Union has produced its first report on the export of arms, and that it has made it public, is very welcome."
"The report must, however, be actively extended to also include instruments of torture and other inhumane and debasing treatment so that information is available to national parliaments and this House as soon as possible, and before it is more widely disseminated. In this way, the monitoring of arms exports can be made more effective and we have sufficient political and legal means to intervene when the regulations of the monitoring system are contravened."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that I need three minutes to tell you that the resolution concerning the export of arms, which is subject to our approval, deals with a matter which is fundamental to the establishment of an area of peace and stability throughout the world, which is without doubt one of the most important mandates which our electors have given us."
"I simply regret the fact that it has been examined following an urgent procedure, thereby denying us the time for a thorough reflection on it, and God knows it would have deserved it!"
"I fear that it contains nothing more than proposals which, while certainly noble and generous, in some cases perhaps do not have much practical application."
"I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to the risk to the credibility of this Parliament resulting from the excessive use of this urgent procedure, especially when, as in this case, we are examining a text drawn up by an external body."
"Mr President, this motion is both topical and urgent."
"It is urgent because we have not yet defined how to control the spread of small arms and light weapons, nor have we strengthened the code to cover conventional arms."
"Death and destruction can be caused by almost any means."
"I saw recently the mass grave in Rwanda of up to half a million people bludgeoned to death by physical weapons, called machetes: just a single weapon in the hand of one man killing person after person."
"Half a million people were genocidally slaughtered by this method."
"Some time ago, 25 000 people died as a result of ground-to-ground missiles in the marshlands of southern Iraq."
"I saw where they had been killed by just one ground-to-ground missile."
"So death and destruction can come by simple or complex means."
"We have to address that."
"That is the urgency."
"The topicality of the motion comes because the year 2000 has now been declared by the United Nations to be the year for peace and to usher in a decade of UN aims for peace."
"Let us, in this motion, also put our hands behind that effort."
"Mr President, the reason for this urgent resolution is, of course, that we as a Parliament have produced a joint statement about the problem of bringing the export of small arms and arms in general under control."
"At the same time, we know that our governments really drag their feet and are uncooperative and often obstructive when it comes to taking any action."
"We are soon to receive a report from various governments and this motion for a resolution is extremely topical because it addresses the national governments yet again, via Parliament and the Council, on the fact that we as a Parliament - and I am very pleased that all groups have been able to reach agreement on the motion for a resolution - really do stress the importance of their taking active steps to produce a carefully considered report."
"Russia is supplying Eritrea with arms through Antwerp whilst we, the European Community, are in the midst of this conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia."
"We know that the authorities are not supervising these affairs properly."
"So we also know that there is a desperate need for discussion about effective supervisory mechanisms."
"The motion for a resolution, expressing as it does the view of our Parliament, has the following to say on that point: if we are aware that at the beginning of this century, just as many soldiers perished in wars as civilians perish in modern-day conflicts on account of these very same small arms, and if we are aware that so many arms are exported from or conveyed through our own Member States, or are actually produced there, then do we not bear an enormous common responsibility for this?"
"I welcome the fact that this Parliament as a whole supports putting the right amount of pressure on our Member States and governments to take serious action on this point."
"Doubtless we will be able to discuss this further in November."
"Mr President, this resolution states that we are appalled by the atrocities in East Timor and that these awful events strengthen the need for effective controls on arms exports."
"If we truly believe that - and I hope we do - how can we then not take the next logical step and condemn those governments which ignore arms controls?"
"What is the use of a code of conduct on arms exports, or an arms embargo, if we do not condemn those who violate them?"
"In the very week after Britain agreed to an EU embargo on arms sales to the Indonesian government last month, three British Hawk warplanes were delivered secretly to Indonesia."
"It stretches credibility beyond belief to imagine that the British government could not have halted the delivery of these war planes which arrived only hours before Indonesian forces shot dead at least five demonstrators in Jakarta."
"Please make this resolution on arms exports a resolution that is worthy of this Parliament."
"Make it one that truly respects the awful suffering of the people of Indonesia."
"Make it one which firmly condemns those governments which defy an EU arms embargo."
"Please support the Green/EFA amendment to this resolution which seeks to do exactly that."
"The Code has now existed for one year."
"As acknowledged in the first annual report, initial experiences of the Member States from its operation during that period were positive."
"The Code has increased mutual understanding on Member State policies, established an efficient consultation mechanism and encouraged dialogue on the implementation of its provisions."
"The statistical tables attached to the report testify to the strong interest shown by Member States in making the Code' s consultation mechanism a success."
"It is undeniable, however, that there are grounds for continued strengthening of the Code and its implementation."
"The aim of the annual review process is to identify such potential improvements."
"Naturally, any amendments to the Code must enjoy the support of all Member States."
"As far as the role of the Commission is concerned, I would like to point out that Member States have up to now, on the basis of Article 296, exempted trade in arms from the scope of application of Treaty rules, thereby preventing Community action."
"Ultimate responsibility for arms exports therefore belongs to national governments."
"Arms trade is currently dealt with in the context of the common foreign and security policy with which the Commission naturally is fully associated."
"Finally, the Commission is interested in broadening acceptance of the main principles contained in the Code so as to cover the world' s main arms exporters."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Human rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"Moratorium on the death penalty - B5-0144/1999 by Mr Thors and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the vote on the UN General Assembly resolution on the creation of a universal moratorium on capital punishment;"

"Moratorium on the death penalty"
"Mr President, we believe that it is particularly important that in the debate on the budget, amendments have now been approved in committee which support the Commission and ask it to back the campaigns and actions in favour of the moratorium on executions and, in the long term, the abolition of the death penalty."
"Why am I saying this, Mr President?"
"Because this House has often made commitments on specific issues and has had successes, alongside defeats, as regards the commutation or stays of executions."
"The important thing is to mark the end of the twentieth century by means of action by Europe - Europe as the home of human rights - involving the abolition of the death penalty."
"All over the world, there is a vitally important campaign which Europe should be leading."
"I would ask the Commission to undertake to implement these objectives to make Europe the global home of political action against the death penalty."
"Mr President, since I and my colleague Olivier Dupuis moved this draft resolution on a moratorium on the death penalty, a most grievous and sinister event has taken place."
"Last Monday, the United States Supreme Court rejected the petition for a writ of certiorari by Moumia Abou Jamal, the Afro-American freedom fighter sentenced to death in 1992."
"At the very moment we are debating in this Chamber, Thomas Ridge, the Governor of Pennsylvania, is probably issuing and signing the order for his execution."
"There are very few legal avenues left open to Moumia to escape the gallows."
"As has happened in the past, when this House, the Council, various heads of state and world public opinion mobilised to obtain a stay of execution, we once again have to do everything in our power to save the life of this victim of racist hatred and of an egregious perversion of justice."
"Mr President, the fight against the death penalty in the world is, first and foremost, civilisation' s fight for the right of humanitarian intervention which is making headway in terms of global awareness."
"This Parliament has a long tradition on this issue, and I would like to pay tribute here to the work of Adelaide Aglietta, who was the first rapporteur in this Parliament to deal with the issue of the death penalty in the world."
"The Council is doing a good job and we hope that the Commission will do likewise."
"However, we must now make sure that the resolution which will be put to the House will not end up as just a piece of paper, but will constitute another stage in the continuation of this fight."
"The Council must not stop. It needs to establish further deadlines and mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the resolution."
"Mr President, we know that Olivier Dupuis has been leading this particular struggle, a fact which has also been mentioned here before."
"I think he deserves a big thank-you for enabling this discussion to take place."
"I also think that, at the moment, things look very promising indeed in the UN General Assembly."
"There has been a lot of support from every country, and it has been easy to reach agreement within the Council on this point."
"Now that the fight is being carried on within the UN, we must beware of cunning counter-proposals which perhaps look innocent enough but which will come from various directions for the purpose of watering down any strong position adopted by the UN General Assembly."
"We therefore need to keep track of what is happening in the UN."
"At the same time, we need to ensure that there is strong support from Parliament for this action and that in the future, and in Geneva too, whenever questions affecting human rights come up, we get binding decisions adopted. We also need to ensure that we can follow up the present resolution, which I hope will be approved in New York this autumn."
"Mr President, it is high time that we adopted a universal moratorium on the death penalty, that true administrative murder, as Albert Camus called it."
"This is the purpose of our resolution directed at the General Assembly of the United Nations."
"Like my colleague, I would like to devote a few words to the urgency with which we must intervene to save Moumia Abou Jamal."
"Moumia is the black American journalist who was sentenced to death in 1982 after a police set-up and a rigged trial."
"The Supreme Court has just rejected his appeal."
"Having spent 17 years on death row, Moumia is now at the mercy of an execution order which the Governor of Pennsylvania can legally sign at any time."
"At a time when an American study has revealed racial disparity in the application of the death penalty in Philadelphia, the American Government should be noble enough to make a stand against this flagrant violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"The shock that this produced in public opinion and the resulting powerful international mobilisation, in which this Parliament took full part, already prevented the implementation of the first execution order, signed on 2 June 1995."
"Today the threat is serious."
"It is urgent."
"The person who is known as the voice of the voiceless and the peacemaker is in danger."
"Any stand, demonstration or resolution will help to prevent the irreversible, and may prevent that voice from being silenced."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Mr Frassoni, Mr Thors and Mr Manisco for their support for the text of this resolution."
"I think that we are very close to achieving the first great result from the UN General Assembly and that it is important that we make an effort to ensure that the final text is a genuine text, a text which allows us to continue this battle which, as other speakers have said, is particularly close to this Parliament' s heart."
"We risk - as is the case after debates within the Council - having a weak text, which will simply reproduce those which have been adopted over the last three years in Geneva and which will not allow us to continue this battle, set new deadlines, or create mechanisms which allow us to verify the steps taken or the progress made to date."
"I therefore ask the Council not to get bogged down in philosophical debates, but to see to it that the mechanisms allowing us to continue this battle are included in the text and that the drafting may soon be completed, so that the Council and the Commission - and we have Mr Patten' s assurance on this - may begin the work of convincing the 180 Member States of the United Nations."
"It is urgent. The House has already begun its task."
"The days and weeks to come must be used to give solid form to this great text in favour of the abolition of the death penalty by the General Assembly."
"We must also ensure that this text is not anti-American."
"The initiatives of recent years have shown the Americans that this is not the case, but I believe that this point should continue to be stressed."
"The American administration is aware that there is now progress in this direction on the part of the whole of humanity and it is really a matter of widening the sphere of human rights."
"Finally, it is all the more significant that in the last few hours, Mr Öçalan has been sentenced to death."
"This is therefore another manifestation of the need to definitively legislate, at United Nations level, for the abolition of the death penalty."
"Regardless of its formulation, I shall be voting for this resolution which demands the abolition of that barbarous punishment, the death penalty."
"I would ask the House to take an urgent stand against the execution of the black American journalist, Moumia Abou Jamal."
"Moumia Abou Jamal fought against racism and for the dignity of Blacks by denouncing in his articles the violence and corruption of the Philadelphia police and institutional racism in general."
"After being arrested by that same police force, which accused him, without proof, of the murder of one of his own people, he was sentenced to death following a rigged trial, as a result of falsified evidence and bribed witnesses."
"He has now spent seventeen years languishing on death row, seventeen years claiming innocence and fighting for a review of his case."
"Moumia Abou Jamal may be executed at any moment, since his appeal in the United States Supreme Court has just been rejected."
"The United States is a signatory to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Racial Discrimination, as well as the Convention against Torture, which is applicable in Moumia' s case since the racial factor weighed heavily in his trial and he has spent seventeen years on death row which constitutes, according to those Treaties, an unjust form of punishment which is equivalent to torture."
"This is why I call on the House to vote not only for the resolution against the death penalty, but also for the amendment which adds that the European Parliament is appealing to the Governor of Pennsylvania to refrain from signing any new execution order against Moumia Abou Jamal and is renewing its demand for a review of his case."
"Moluccan Islands"
"Mr President, viewed apart, the problems facing Ambon have their own particular characteristics, yet at the same time there are certain similarities with the situation in East Timor and also in Aceh and other parts of Indonesia."
"It is the case with all these areas that we must not labour under the misapprehension that the international community is in a position to solve the problems."
"The international and European Community can only play a modest role."
"We must also avoid giving the local population the impression that when international institutions start getting involved everything will come right again."
"We must spare the local population the disappointment that this expectation could lead to."
"Of course this does not alter the fact that the situation in Ambon is serious."
"Our first priority is to remain vigilant and endeavour to find a solution, but we must not add fuel to the fire."
"In my view, the resolution produced contains all the necessary ingredients."
"We might consider modifying the religious aspect slightly but, even without such a shift of emphasis, this resolution makes it adequately clear that the European Parliament attaches great importance to preventing a similar situation from arising in Ambon as arose in East Timor."
"Mr President, with all due respect to my colleagues in this Parliament, I think that it is a little odd - I thought I would just say this, looking at the list of speakers - that we are having what is almost an all-Dutch round on the Moluccas."
"Of course, there is every reason to say something about the Moluccas."
"The pictures and, still more, the reports that we are receiving are, after all, very reminiscent of what happened in East Timor."
"But I must say that I have my doubts about this round."
"Last time, we talked about East Timor and today, we are talking about the Moluccas. We might talk about yet another part of Indonesia tomorrow, for the problem is not confined to the Moluccas."
"I have a problem with the way in which we are handling this subject; that is to say, I do not think Parliament should discuss individual incidents, for I fear that this great island kingdom will be the scene of many more such incidents where national and religious factors are intertwined."
"What actually needs to happen is for Parliament to ask itself how, in any event, it should deal with the big problem of Indonesia."
"The Moluccan situation is not an isolated case."
"The Moluccas form part of a great State comprising many nationalities and religious groupings."
"It is a State that is at risk of falling apart and where tensions are running high."
"I would be very much in favour of having a big debate of the kind I have just described at some stage in the future, rather than going from incident to incident all the time."
"Mr President, the list of speakers from this morning also clearly shows how firm the bond between the Moluccas and the Netherlands is."
"You see, we are closely involved in the ups and downs of the Moluccas, one reason for this being that many Moluccans have lived in the Netherlands for a long time now."
"Following the disturbances that took place at the beginning of this year, there was a short period of calm in and around the Moluccan islands, but at the end of July, the violence flared up again in all its ferocity."
"It is striking how little interest the media show in these disturbances."
"The Moluccas have been completely overshadowed by East Timor."
"The current irregularities are much more organised in character than the disturbances that took place in January."
"This gives me great cause for concern."
"Various army units in the Indonesian army have been transferred to Ambon, not to maintain public order but to participate in the conflicts themselves."
"Civil-military relations are not very democratic, which is why pressure must also be brought to bear on the Indonesian Government to take independent action."
"To close, I would just like to make reference, in this connection, to the disadvantages of delivering aid via international channels."
"In the case of the Moluccas, there is a historic bond with the Netherlands."
"The Netherlands has recently started delivering ever more multilateral rather than bilateral aid, which has led to the aid no longer being recognisable."
"Consequently, the Moluccans feel they have been left in the lurch."
"We must not allow the joining of forces to be to the detriment of historic bonds."
"Belarus"
"Mr President, we have just come from the first meeting of the delegation from this Parliament that concerns itself with relations with countries such as Belarus."
"We have already briefly discussed the alarming situation in this country."
"We would like to ask Parliament to give some of its attention today to recent developments there, whereby Belarus, that is the Government of Belarus and President Lukashenko in particular, are at risk of isolating themselves still further from the international community, and in so doing from the European Union too, of course."
"The internal situation in Belarus gives great cause for concern."
"Democratic structures are not functioning and we are on the sidelines to some extent because the international community is disregarded by the authorities in Minsk."
"Our willingness to help to find a solution to the internal political problems and the deadlock that exists there is not being satisfactorily addressed by President Lukashenko."
"We also want to help to promote dialogue between the opposition and the government."
"We support the OSCE, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in its efforts to achieve this."
"Our Parliament is also involved in activities undertaken by the Assembly of the OSCE which are designed to bring about an improvement in the situation in Belarus."
"But where is the gesture from the President? What positive reaction has there been on the part of the government in Minsk to the efforts being made to bring about a dialogue?"
"What we see is quite the reverse."
"Instead of positive gestures we see arrests, intimidation and disappearances."
"A climate of fear is being created."
"It gets very difficult to find a compromise in a situation of this kind."
"We are in fact prepared to stretch our standards a little in the interests of the people of Belarus."
"We are prepared to talk to a President who is actually there illegally."
"If he fails to offer us a gesture, then things will certainly become very difficult."
"If, as I said, the opposition wants to talk then we will support this, but there will have to be a prospect of fair elections which will put an end to what is currently an extremely odd constitutional situation in Belarus in which there are two parliaments and a President reappointed by ""referendum"" ."
"There are, of course, limits to our realism and that is why we want to take the opportunity today to register our protest about the situation in Belarus. We also want to make an urgent appeal to its government to do something about those who have disappeared and to ensure that they reappear so that that in itself may lead to really getting a dialogue going which will move towards free and fair elections, hopefully next year."
"Mr President, as Deputy Chairman of the delegation which has just sat on this subject, and as a rapporteur to this country for many years, I can seamlessly follow on from the previous speaker."
"We know that we are faced with a very, very difficult situation on account of the fact that in this country, such dubious Stalinist values are enjoying a renaissance and it appears that nothing has really changed."
"On the other hand, Belarus is important for the entire European security structure and it is - and we should not forget this - one of the countries bordering the European Union."
"Therefore, we are naturally clutching at any semblance of hope that we can again support a democratic movement in this country."
"But the situation is unimaginably poor."
"The work of the OSCE is marking time, in spite of the enormous motivation of the working group and despite the fact that it is really looking into every opportunity in detail."
"All attempts at dialogue with the opposition are counteracted in practice by human rights' violations on the streets and in the prisons and by violations against the free press."
"Lukashenko has to be told in no uncertain terms that he cannot speak with a forked tongue."
"The drama attached to important people, rivals of Lukashenko, suddenly disappearing, shows that the opposition is to be rooted out."
"As soon as a critical article is written, the newspapers are threatened with closure."
"We really have to strive to speak a clear language in this regard, even if we naturally want to promote the process of dialogue and not obstruct it."
"In this connection, Lukashenko, however, must be the first one to set an example."
"Such an example would amount to him approving the 5 Million programme for civilian society in the event that the Commission were to travel to Minsk tomorrow."
"A second example would be releasing his opponents from prison."
"That would be a sign to begin a dialogue."
"I would question the sense behind this resolution when Lukashenko will not listen to us in any case."
"But it does have a point, because we would like to show the people that we will never lose hope for a change in Belarus, and that we will do all we can to ensure that democracy is restored to this country."
"Thank you, Mrs Schroedter."
"We could really sense your own personal commitment."
"I would like to call Mr Sacrédeus as the next speaker."
"Perhaps you can help us a little with the correct pronunciation of your name."
"It is certainly a name with holy connotations and you are from Sweden."
"Perhaps you could tell us how it should be pronounced."
"Mr President, my name is pronounced Sacrédeus and it is a family name we have in Sweden."
"Democracy is a gift to us all."
"It is a gift from previous generations, from our forefathers."
"It gives expression to a view of human beings, a view bearing the stamp of Christianity, which says that all human beings are of equal worth and have the same value, a unique and inviolable human dignity."
"It is an important task of the European Union to defend democracy and this view of human beings."
"Developments in close proximity to the European Union, namely in Belarus, are therefore deeply worrying."
"An old communist system lives on there."
"People disappear and, not least, parliamentarians close to the Christian Democrat Party such as Andrey Klimov and Vladimir Kudinov have disappeared without trace."
"Other people too have disappeared, as has been pointed out here in previous interventions."
"Democracy is founded upon people being free to express their opinions, even if this is uncomfortable and is not appreciated by everyone."
"Let us, together as a Parliament, view supporting the developments towards democracy in Belarus as one of our most crucially urgent tasks."
"I would also say to you that today is Birgitta' s name day. In fact, my wife is called Birgitta."
"Birgitta has also been chosen by the Pope as one of the three patron saints of Europe."
"Birgitta is also a Swedish patron saint."
"It is a special honour to be able to give one' s maiden speech in the European Parliament on Birgitta' s name day."
"I should like to see it as one of my most important tasks to work for democracy and human dignity in Belarus."
"Mr President, speaking of courage, this commendable human quality is certainly one that adorns the Belorussian lawyer Vera Stremkovskaya."
"Though one of the few advocates in her fatherland, she dares to defend the political opponents of the Lukashenko regime."
"In so doing, she does in fact already have one foot in prison, figuratively speaking."
"The judicial authorities in Minsk judge that her personal commitment to human rights is irreconcilable with her legal work."
"The confederation of German lawyers has an entirely different view of the matter."
"It recently awarded Stremkovskaya its prize for human rights."
"Her speech of thanks tells us a lot."
"Those who champion a democratic constitutional state in Belarus long for western support and for interest to be shown in their extremely difficult position."
"This is the ultimate significance of the prize awarded to her for her selflessness."
"Belarus must not remain a ""black hole"" on the European map."
"The present joint resolution fulfils this fondest wish of ours."
"Hence, we are able to give it our full support."
"The resolution serves to underline Stremkovskaya' s criticism of Lukashenko' s repressive presidential rule: ""people are disappearing in Belarus and that is causing great public unrest."""
"We want this topical debate to give a boost to the opposition in Belarus."
"There is certainly a need for this, now that such bitter, almost desperate words are reaching us of the kind uttered by the exile Siaretski, the former President of the Belorussian Parliament that was dissolved by Lukashenko: ""Belarus is currently under the leadership of a man who says of himself that he admires Hitler."""
"A man who can only survive politically on account of support from Moscow which, in turn, is itself being financed by the West."
"The situation of the Roma in Kosovo"
"Mr President, it is an incredibly serious crisis we have in Kosovo regarding the Roma."
"A week ago, I was involved in a live television debate with the OSCE's representative for the Roma population, who is monitoring the situation."
"I regret to have to say that his appeal to the effect that the EU should do something about the Roma' s situation, such as arrange a special meeting, has fallen on deaf ears."
"We know that people are being thrown out of hospitals and exposed to various forms of violence if they belong to the Roma population."
"The profound appeal I am making to the Commission and the Council is therefore as follows: help arrange a special meeting where the Roma' s situation can be discussed."
"Try to obtain a proper monitoring of the situation and demonstrate that all the international organisations which are on the scene in Pristina want to do something about the issue, for example by calling a meeting of the kind that the OSCE' s special rapporteur has been seeking (but without receiving any support)."
"This could be extremely significant in showing the path we are to go down."
"I hope that the present Commissioner, Mr Nielson, will present this message to Mr Hombach and his colleagues in Pristina and Thessaloniki."
"Mr President, we are now talking about the situation facing the Roma in Kosovo."
"We all agree, and this is also apparent from the joint motion for a resolution, that the Roma in Kosovo are not receiving adequate protection at the present time."
"There may be all kinds of reasons for the fact that they are being treated in a very unfriendly manner, particularly by the Albanians, but that does not alter the fact that they have a right to protection and that this is inadequate."
"KFOR is doing its best but there is too much happening all at once."
"Nevertheless, we urge that a more active approach be taken to protecting the rights of the Roma, for they have just as much right to this as the other inhabitants of Kosovo."
"After all, that is what the Kosovo conflict was all about."
"Were those not the values we were fighting for? It is on account of these selfsame values that we must now also fight for the interests of the Gypsies in Kosovo."
"If the Albanian leaders expect us to support them in rebuilding Kosovo, then it is right that we should not hesitate to remind them of their responsibilities with regard to the Roma."
"Their situation demonstrates yet again that it is taking far too long to build up the police force."
"One of the big complaints we have at the moment about the situation in Kosovo itself is that the military police have to carry out extra duties when they have so much other work to do and they are not actually trained for the duties."
"We would also make an urgent appeal to the UN to ensure that the police force is built up more rapidly than is the case at present."
"For the situation in Kosovo - I was there myself only last week - is one of chaos, and this must not be allowed to continue for too long."
"The resolution rightly points to the problems endured by the Roma in other European countries, some of which are applicant countries."
"Only this week, I was confronted with one example of this in the form of a Czech local authority that wants to build a wall somewhere in the city in order to separate the Gypsies from the rest of the population."
"It seems to me that actions of this kind are not in keeping with the Copenhagen criteria."
"I just wanted to point out that the Roma problem is not one that crops up in Kosovo alone."
"The Council of Europe is very active in this area, for every day there are in fact reports of problems somewhere in the world."
"I would also urge this Parliament to endeavour to develop a coherent approach and to help to find solutions to the problem on account of the sense of responsibility we all share."
"Just shaking a fist does not always solve problems."
"Mr Wiersma, I do not hold it against you that you have spoken three times today on the subject of human rights; quite the opposite, we need colleagues in Parliament who will take up this subject."
"However, next time, I would request that you do not exceed your speaking time by 100%!"
"Honoured President, ladies and gentlemen, and Members of the European Commission, this is not the first time since the elections that we have spoken about the situation in Kosovo."
"As recently as the last part-session, we talked about reconstruction and we also discussed the situation facing Albanian Kosovars in Serbian jails in the debate on urgent subjects."
"I would like to point again to the fact that this situation gives a great deal of cause for concern."
"We did adopt this resolution last time but reports have reached me in the meantime to the effect that there has been no improvement whatsoever in the situation."
"We really are going to have to keep an eye on this."
"It is right and proper that we should be discussing the situation facing the Gypsies in Kosovo today."
"I think it is completely unacceptable for any section of the population whatsoever to be disadvantaged and persecuted."
"We must take very decisive action against this and I believe that the compromise resolution articulates this in a very balanced and effective manner and also places responsibility where it needs to be placed."
"There is no need for me to read it out. Everyone can read it for themselves and we will see that it is indeed worded very effectively."
"Indeed, I have visited Kosovo myself and have spoken to most of the Albanian political leaders there from across the political spectrum including Rugova, Bukoshi and Thaçi."
"These people are well aware that they do not always have control of the situation."
"I believe this resolution shows our support for them; it is a recommendation and we must help them to put it into practice."
"Mr President, Milosevic has long been poisoning the entire region with his racist ideas as regards ethnic minorities."
"He has certainly been successful in certain parts of former Yugoslavia."
"Radicalisation is underway in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, everywhere, in reaction to his ethno-racist policy."
"The Albanians in Kosovo have already been subject to this pressure for a very long time but they have continued to resist it. They have succeeded in this for some time now due in particular to Mr Rugova' s leadership."
"But if the oppression continues to increase in its severity and shows no signs of abating and ethnic cleansing takes place, then it is to be expected that radicalisation will be the response met with there too."
"In reality this would mean success for Milosevic in terms of his policy, for he would actually like to spread this ethno-racist ideology throughout the region."
"We must bring pressure to bear on the Albanians as a matter of urgency and appeal to them not to grant him this success."
"This Parliament has always rejected ethnically-based lines of reasoning."
"We are on the side of the oppressed in principle and even if the victims of yesterday are the ones holding power today, we will still be on the side of the victims of today."
"Everyone knows that this tends to be the Serbs."
"Indeed, there are many instances of the Serbs being violently oppressed at the present time, but there is very little attention being given to the Roma."
"They easily fall prey to ethnic hatred for no one likes them anywhere."
"That is all the more reason to keep this very vulnerable population group within our sights, specifically with the use of this resolution."
"KFOR must be afforded the scope and resources it needs to protect the Roma."
"There is an urgent need for a fully fledged Kosovan political power that will truly be in a position to guarantee public order, and not by choosing the easy route, that is to say, the division or cantonisation of Kosovo, but by choosing a route that leads to reconciliation."
"Kosovo must take the route leading to a constitutional state if it is to achieve this."
"Effective public administration must be established."
"I know that in that respect Western Europe is doing everything that can be done and this deserves our full support."
"This will have to include support and a role for the Yugoslav Tribunal, since justice for all concerned is an essential prerequisite to reconciliation between the various population groups."
"The war against Serb ethnic cleansing in Kosovo was a just war."
"It was fought in the cause of upholding European values."
"The fact that it was to protect a largely Muslim people - the Kosovo Albanians against oppression and genocide by the Christian Serbs showed that such values are independent of, if certainly influenced by, religious belief."
"The core of the values we fought for was the right to be different - the right to live in peaceful enjoyment of one' s own culture and identity and to enjoy full civil and political rights and not to be segregated or ghettoised."
"It would be a betrayal of those who believed in the morality of the war in Kosovo for us now to tolerate discrimination against any minorities there - whether Serb, the subject of my Group' s amendment, or Roma."
"Of course, we can understand bitter grievances and resentments, but we cannot condone summary justice."
"We stress here again the need for proper investigation into war crimes."
"The success of the Austrian Freedom Party last week threatens to contribute to making dangerously populist and xenophobic views respectable in Europe."
"This resolution signals, not least to the Kosovo Albanians, that Europe does not accept xenophobia in any guise."
"Europe does not choose to defend certain communities or minorities."
"It insists on defending everyone' s human rights."
"Thank you very much."
"Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen, has asked me to point out that she would still have liked to mention in her speech the fact that a delegation of Moluccan Dutch nationals is present who have just been following our debate with great interest."
"Mr President, the situation in Kosovo is both tragic and dangerous for all ethnic groups, not only for Albanians."
"Serbs, Gypsies, Egyptians and Muslims are also victims of the ethnic cleansing operation which the KLA forces have been systematically carrying out for some months now, turning the presence of NATO and KFOR forces to their advantage."
"The responsibilities of the European Union and of the so-called international community are great."
"Despite our being well aware of the atrocities committed by the KLA, we still nominated its forces to act as a protective body for Kosovo and, at the same time, we purported to be interested in the plight of the Gypsies."
"In view of this, we consider the resolution under debate today to be hypocritical. Not only does it omit to outline the responsibilities, but it essentially makes the European Parliament jointly responsible for the terror facing the Serbs and Gypsies in Kosovo."
"If Parliament wishes to play its role, it needs to put an end to KLA action, under all its guises, both policing and military."
"On capital punishment: during the last three years, a resolution on the death penalty has been passed in the UN Commission on Human Rights with a growing number of co-sponsors."
"To take the policy against capital punishment one step further, to consolidate the achievements of the Human Rights Committee and to establish the question of the death penalty on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, the EU Member States have decided to introduce a resolution in the Third Committee during the 54th session of the General Assembly."
"It is the objective of the EU to keep the text focused and concise to win as broad a support as possible."
"The EU will seek collaboration with other regions and states that share the same vision to arrive at the best possible result."
"I noted, and I agreed with, what Mr Dupuis said, that this initiative is not anti-American."
"It is pro-human."
"On the Moluccas: the Commission follows closely domestic events in Indonesia and shares with honourable Members, the serious concerns about the dramatic inter-religious conflict in the Moluccas and the ensuing injury and loss of life."
"The European Union has made it clear to the Indonesian government, on numerous occasions, with particular reference to the Moluccas, that it holds it responsible for law and order throughout Indonesia."
"The government is well aware of the Union' s view and acknowledges its responsibilities."
"ECHO has been running a project worth EUR 1 m for humanitarian aid to the population in need."
"The project covered the supply of drinking water, food and medication."
"A renewal is under consideration."
"At this moment, Indonesia is undergoing significant political, economic and social changes."
"It is hoped that this process will contribute to improving the social climate in particular as regards inter-ethnic and inter-religious tensions."
"I heard the debate today and I interpret it as a very mature and very sober contribution to furthering these hopes that what I would call a soft landing for Indonesia and for all the peoples of Indonesia can be obtained."
"On Belarus: the Commission is closely following developments in Belarus."
"We appreciate the efforts of the Belarus government and opposition to initiate a constructive dialogue in order to agree on acceptable conditions for fair and free elections, and thereby restore the rule of law in the country."
"However, the Commission remains concerned about Belarus' s human rights record and in particular about the disappearances of political personalities, most recently Mr Gonchar."
"The EU presidency has officially asked the Belorussian authorities to make all efforts to find Mr Gonchar and secure his safety."
"This took place on 24 September."
"Such developments may well put at risk an agreement between the government and the opposition in the framework of their recently established dialogue."
"In a few days the Commission will adopt the TACIS civil society development programme in the slightly amended form agreed informally last June with the Belorussian authorities."
"The document will then be formally submitted to the Belorussian authorities for approval."
"We trust that the Belorussian authorities will remain committed to the endorsement of the programme."
"This will represent the fulfilment of an important political benchmark set by the EU last April."
"Only the fulfilment of the EU' s political benchmarks will allow the EU to gradually normalise relations with Belarus."
"Among these, human rights have a significant weight alongside free access to the media, an end to harassment of the opposition, constructive dialogue between opposition and government and endorsement of the TACIS civil society development programme."
"On the resolutions on abuses of Roma and Serbs in Kosovo I have the following remarks. The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these resolutions."
"The Commission and the EU have been clear from the outset in our condemnation of all ethnic violence whoever the perpetrator and whoever the victim."
"It is as unacceptable now against the Serb and Roma minorities as it was when carried out against the Kosovars until some months ago."
"The Commission continues through its assistance programmes in the field of democratisation and human rights to support confidence-building measures and dialogue between the different communities."
"We already did so, though unfortunately without enough success, before the conflict and now in the changed circumstances this continues to be one of the priorities in selecting projects."
"Furthermore the Commission, through ECHO, provides humanitarian assistance in favour of the victims of the Kosovo crisis, including the Serb and Roma minorities."
"We fully support the efforts of KFOR to maintain law and order in Kosovo and to protect all citizens."
"We fully support the efforts of UNMIK to establish a functioning civil administration which would take over policing functions from KFOR, and to create a peaceful multi-ethnic society which would set about the task of rebuilding Kosovo and its society."
"UNMIK has approached the Commission for support for the Kosovo protection corps."
"Member States will decide in the coming weeks on the Commission' s proposed programme in this regard."
"We call on all others within and outside Kosovo to also support these aims and to support UNMIK and KFOR in their work to achieve them."
"We too oppose any cantonisation of Kosovo."
"Kosovo must become a multi-ethnic society without distinction or discrimination on ethnic or any other grounds."
"Mr President, I wonder if the Commission can support the proposal I submitted, to the effect that the EU should call a meeting with OSCE representatives in order to have a special discussion specifically about the Roma' s position and involving everyone who is active locally there."
"I would appeal to the Commissioner at least to pass on my message to his colleagues and to Mr Hombach."
"I will convey the wish you have expressed concerning such a meeting, but I would also add that the existing organisational set-up is very comprehensive in its complexity."
"Most of the problems we are facing will fit in somewhere in the framework established concerning the organisation of support and the re-establishment of society in Kosovo."
"So I think the issue will come up in one place or another, but I will convey your wish to them."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Aviation accident at Ustica"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B5-0138/99 by Ms Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the aviation accident at Ustica;"
"B5-0148/99 by Mssrs Procacci and Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the aviation accident at Ustica (Italy) on 27 June 1980;"
"B5-0156/99 by Mr Barón Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the aviation accident at Ustica;"
"B5-0160/99, by Mssrs Di Lello Finuoli and Manisco, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Ustica attack of 27 June 1980;"
"B5-0162/99, by Mr Celli and others, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group, on the aviation accident at Ustica on 27 June 1980;"
"B5-0176/99, by Mr Bodrato and Ms Grossetête, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the aviation accident at Ustica."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it really is very important that a debate is taking place on the Ustica massacre here today."
"It will take on particular importance if Parliament manages to exercise an appropriate political and practical role which will help shed light on this sombre event and bring justice for the 81 victims and their families who, for more than 19 years, have been waiting to find out what happened, why it happened, and who was responsible."
"I said that more than 19 years have passed and there have been several inquiries by the Italian magistracy, but not even the last inquiry overseen by Judge Priore, while very noteworthy, has provided truly satisfactory answers."
"Was it a missile launched during air combat which destroyed the aircraft or was it a bomb planted inside?"
"Unfortunately, a great deal, indeed too much evidence has been concealed or destroyed and it would be an oversimplification to place the blame for this tragedy only on the top ranks of the army, who generally speaking, only follow orders."
"Obviously, the real blame lies elsewhere, in particular at the door of the high level Italian representatives of government and politicians of the time."
"What inconvenient facts, what political manoeuvrings were covered up in the interests of National Security?"
"In fact there have been numerous unanswered questions regarding the complex international events of those years."
"On the one hand, the great world powers - USA and USSR - were at diplomatic breaking point, and on the other hand, there was a progressive deterioration in relations between the Atlantic Alliance and some Islamic countries, Libya in particular, while in Italy, the far left in particular, was continually calling into question Italy' s participation in NATO."
"Finally, what is the link between the Ustica massacre and the one that happened around a month later at Bologna train station?"
"We have tabled a motion for a resolution to underline the importance of these factors, factors which, however, were not mentioned once in the joint motion for a resolution."
"Nevertheless, while we consider that the joint motion for a resolution leans too far towards the air missile hypothesis rather than towards an internal bomb, and above all, while we believe this motion to be far too kind and diplomatic towards the Italian political authorities, we agree on the need to request the cooperation of all the Member States of the European Union in finally providing everything necessary for an appropriate and adequate detailed examination of the inquiries, so that those who did this, the instigators and the motives behind this absurd massacre can be identified."
"Mr President, the Ustica question is one of the darkest legal episodes in not only Italian, but I would say especially, European history."
"Over the past 19 years, we have seen numerous dramatic turns of events regarding the investigations to establish the truth that has still not emerged which, it appears, is also down to those involved preventing this happening and riding roughshod over the legal rights of the victims' families and over our basic democratic principles."
"We do not want to apply a political interpretation or allow anyone to exploit a tragedy which has caused so much suffering."
"Let us leave it to the magistracy to ascertain the truth which is the right of everyone, not only of the victims' relatives."
"In addition to the results obtained recently by the Italian magistracy, I do not know whether, in the future, there will or will not be other scenarios which, in recent years, we have unfortunately become used to owing to the legal events of Ustica. But today, we are faced with a judgement which outlines the hypothesis of the participation of aircraft from different countries during the disaster of 27 June 1980."
"And so Parliament must make a firm request to the Member States and the United States to cooperate in finding the truth."
"It is certainly significant for our institution to promote an action which aims to protect..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, as you can see, it is almost exclusively Members elected in Italy who are speaking, and this is significant."
"Various colleagues from other countries have asked me - what is Ustica? Why the urgency?"
"This is a question, or rather, these are two very reasonable questions."
"Ustica, as perhaps a lot of people know, is a small island in the South Tyrrhenian Sea."
"Why this urgency though?"
"It does not spring from something that has happened now but from something serious which happened almost twenty years ago."
"The urgency is because an Italian deputy Public Prosecutor has issued a judgement which identifies the high-level air force authorities as being to blame for covering things up, keeping quiet and not saying what they knew, which prevented the truth coming to light about what happened almost twenty years ago."
"So what happened?"
"An aeroplane left my city, Bologna, two hours late but never reached its destination, Palermo."
"It was hit, so several parties say, by a missile during an aggressive act which took place nearby."
"Well, immediately afterwards, in the following days, weeks and years, there ensued an extraordinary criminal course of events which aimed to conceal the evidence, to silence people and to ensure that the truth did not come out."
"Why was all this done?"
"This is why we need to take up this subject again today, as the course of Italian justice has entered the final and perhaps overdue stage of its inquiries."
"We are asking the Member States - because they say aircraft from one of the Member States or NATO might have been involved in that act of war - to help with information, which there is no longer any reason to keep confidential, concealed or secret, so that we really can bring the facts to light and the whole truth can be told."
"After all, the relatives of the 81 victims are asking for nothing more than to know the truth and to see that justice be done."
"I think this is not just an Italian internal affair, but is a service to the whole of European democracy."
"Mr President, on the night of 27 June 1980, off the coast of Ustica, 81 innocent European citizens who were flying from Bologna to Palermo, lost their lives in the course of a military operation which involved the civilian airliner in which they were travelling."
"A few minutes after the disaster, the military and secret service machinery of the countries concerned - with the Italians leading the way - were already putting in place a huge and disgraceful operation to conceal, if not destroy, the evidence to prevent the legal authorities ascertaining what really happened in the skies over Ustica."
"The European Union and its Parliament have the institutional duty to protect the interests of the European citizens and not those of individual governments, NATO or the United States."
"The European citizens, including the 81 European families of the victims of Ustica, have the right to demand all our help in bringing justice to bear."
"And so it is our duty to ask for the States involved in the disaster to be put under pressure to say all they know."
"This is also of the greatest interest to us because this is the only way to prevent something similar happening again in European skies, and not only in European skies."
"Over the next five years, we are committed to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice."
"Ascertaining the truth on the Ustica disaster would be a major first step along this path."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Ustica tragedy - with more than 80 dead, almost 20 years of inquiries and more than 15 victims linked to this tragedy either during or after the inquiries - brings to mind three crucial points: the transparency, accountability and arrogance of a certain type of military power, but not only military power."
"In order to perhaps understand this tragedy better, I will also refer to the tragedy which occurred at Cermis in the Dolomites, where an American military plane cut through a cablecar cable."
"Twenty people plunged to the ground in the cablecar and died."
"In this case, we know what happened because the plane was seen, but up till now, even in the Cermis tragedy, it is still not at all clear where the blame lies."
"Firstly, I wonder whether Italy, despite it being strategically important in Europe, is the best place to carry out military experiments, tests or even training."
"In my opinion, the Nevada desert is much more suitable because Italy has too many inhabitants."
"And it has to be said that the victims' loved ones have the right to know why, how and when their children, parents or relatives died, and to this end, we join them in asking for help and complete transparency."
"The Governments of Italy, France, Great Britain and the United States as well as the Secretary-General of the UN must help us to shed light on these tragedies, especially the Ustica tragedy."
"Mr President, after almost twenty years and despite the commitment of the Italian magistracy and the association of the victims' families, we still do not know the truth about the Ustica tragedy, a tragedy which affected Italian public opinion and also the wider European public opinion."
"The inquiries were made more difficult by the reticence and lack of cooperation shown by some countries, including countries which are Members of the European Union as well as the very Alliance which guaranteed security in Europe during those years."
"The mystery which continues to surround the catastrophe has ended up casting serious doubts on Italy' s democratic life and its very independence."
"Now, a judgement made by the Italian magistracy has outlined various scenarios which provide for military operations along the very route taken by the DC9 that disappeared into the Mediterranean that evening."
"Transparency is therefore an issue."
"Transparency is a value which this Parliament referred to decisively during the first weeks of its activities and the public has the right to trust both political and military institutions."
"However, we believe that it is right for the European Parliament to ask the Member States - which can participate in ascertaining the truth - to provide the magistracy with all the documentation necessary to definitively identify who was to blame."
"This is the moral and political significance of this joint resolution and is the reason for the urgency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1980 something happened in Italy, the scale of which, in terms of numbers of victims, made it a disaster."
"As is typical of Italian justice, 19 years later, nothing has yet been said with any certainty."
"In relation to this grave episode - and the previous speakers highlighted this - secrecy and doubts have surrounded military bodies, institutions, governments and nations for two decades."
"The lack of certainty encourages prejudices and vague judgements."
"The victims, their families and the entire international community have the right to uncover the truth, not in twenty years or more but as quickly as possible."
"This Parliament must oblige all the States concerned and individual institutions to close this chapter, which is one of the many Italian mysteries where the truth is never found, and which has seen high level involvement and assistance."
"The Italian and international communities will be grateful to this Parliament and they will regain confidence in the institutions. This will honour the memory of the many innocent victims."
"Mr President, today' s debate in this House is also an opportunity to highlight the extremely serious and unjustified delay of a magistracy measure arriving after twenty years of inquiries."
"This delay has displayed a serious disrespect for the great desire for truth, not only of the victims' relatives but also of those entire communities which have been involved in this tragic event."
"So naturally, while I join the invitation extended to those countries which were involved to cooperate in establishing the truth, I would also ask the European Parliament not to forget this event at this most delicate time of public debate in order to ascertain the truth. Therefore, I ask Parliament to use its representatives and bodies to continue to monitor events so that this tragedy will finally reach a just and honest conclusion, as requested by the Italian and European communities in their entirety."
"Mr President, we are in favour of this debate being dealt with on a European as well as an international level, because we think that the Ustica question, with its fatalities and the controversy left in its wake, which are still an issue in our country, deserves to be clarified, and must be clarified."
"If we all want to be European citizens, if we want a shared destiny, we must not regard this as just an Italian matter but as a matter for the international community, and it must be investigated and resolved at this level."
"We are asking for military activities to be definitively and transparently coordinated with civilian activities."
"This is the transparency that citizens are asking for, this is the justice we want, this is the sense of justice that is being requested by the citizens, by the people who have suffered this grave loss as well as by the entire international community."
"We are asking, therefore, for serious cooperation between political and military activities."
"We are asking for justice to be done."
"Just as Cermis was not only an Italian matter and was dealt with at an international level, so Ustica deserves to be discussed here."
"It deserves to be clarified and it deserves our respect, as does the work of the magistracy, which must get to the heart of the matter, clarify blame and charge those responsible."
"The Commission deplores this tragedy and hopes that investigations carried out by the Italian authorities can be conducted with full transparency and equity."
"The Commission shares the concern of the honourable Members, and calls on the Member States to collaborate with the Italian authorities to bring together all available evidence to help clarify the causes of the disaster."
"Concerning the rules on safety of military air traffic, the Commission recalls at present the Community has no powers in this field."
"It is for the Member States to take the necessary measures."
"However, the Commission is well aware that the joint use of airspace by various users, civil and military, may be at the root of safety problems, as it is already partly responsible for air traffic delays and congestion."
"This is why the Commission has advocated in the past, in its White Paper on freeing European airspace, that European airspace should be managed centrally by a strong international organisation for all aspects of its use."
"Moreover, the Commission felt it was better to entrust this task to Eurocontrol rather than to a Community body, because national governments might find it easier to allow that organisation to play such a role in the military use of airspace."
"At the request of the Council, the Commission is preparing a communication on air traffic delays and congestion and will certainly address this question again and propose initiatives in the field of airspace management."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Nuclear accident in Japan"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B5-0141/99 by Mr Maaten and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on recent accidents at nuclear power plant and shipments of dangerous substances;"
"B5-0150/99 by Ms McNally, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the accident at the Tokaimura nuclear power processing plant in Japan;"
"B5-0161/99 by Mr Papayannakis and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the nuclear accident in Japan;"
"B5-0165/99 by Ms Ahern and others, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group, on the major nuclear accident in Japan and MOX shipments;"
"B5-0171/99 by Ms Grossetête and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the nuclear accident in Tokaimura, Japan."
"All accidents are tragic for individual people and, of course, we extend sympathy to the workers involved in the incident at Tokaimura, their families and the 300,000 local people who were subjected to intense fear and worry for several days."
"Accidents occur in all industries, and we have just seen an appalling train crash in the UK this week."
"But accidents in nuclear installations, especially criticality accidents, are the most feared of all accidents."
"Rare though they are for obvious reasons, the potential consequences to very large numbers of people are extremely serious."
"That is why the nuclear industry has to be more careful than other industries."
"It will not survive as an industry unless the public believe in a strongly instilled and strictly enforced safety culture."
"Now that culture was breached quite clearly at Tokaimura this week."
"There will be an investigation."
"We hope and expect that the findings will be shared with us so that any lessons can be enforced everywhere where nuclear activities take place."
"Workers in the industry expect this, and the public most certainly does."
"Nuclear activity requires emergency plans, spot checks by independent inspectors and factoring-in of the possibility of error or negligence."
"That costs money but it has to be done."
"All installations in the supply chain are part of safety requirements."
"Any weak link is dangerous."
"A wide-ranging investigation and a public explanation are required by those whose concerns have been justifiably raised by this very serious incident indeed in Japan."
"Mr President, the accident in Japan has again reminded us of the very great risks associated with nuclear power."
"Again, it was human error which caused the accident but, as human beings, we are made in such a way that we easily make mistakes."
"It is this which is the big risk in connection with nuclear power."
"The export of MOX from Sellafield in Great Britain means that both Great Britain and the EU are involved in this problem."
"That is why I personally share the points of view expressed in the draft amendments submitted by the Greens."
"We in the Liberal Group do not, however, consider that they are sufficiently at home with this issue."
"We shall therefore abstain in the vote."
"Mr President, the accident which has just happened in Japan shows that nuclear power can never be completely safe."
"Even in a technologically very advanced system, the so-called human factor plays a decisive role."
"The resolution which has been produced is a good one, even if I should like to have seen it go further still in the positions it adopts."
"An example of this is point 9, because it ought to be obvious that one should not have reprocessing contracts with countries which do not comply with international standards."
"As we all know, Japan is one of the world' s technologically most developed countries."
"Nuclear power and the way in which nuclear fuel is handled are probably, all in all, no less safe in Japan than they are in our own countries."
"It may be worth remembering this when we happily criticise unsafe nuclear energy in other countries but do so less readily in the case of our own countries."
"All that is, in fact, completely certain is the fact that one can never be certain that nuclear power is completely safe."
"President, our hearts go out to the two radiation workers who were subjected to intense radiation poisoning and to the 300,000 people who were in terror as radiation levels skyrocketed."
"All over the world nuclear authorities insist that an accident like that in Japan could not happen anywhere else."
"Different processes will ensure that the chain reactions do not start."
"But in Britain, BNFL has recently admitted the falsifications of safety checks on MOX fuel while in Japan the authorities have found that the plant at Tokaimura was operating illegally for four years."
"The nuclear industry is clearly out of control."
"The PPE and PSE refuse to acknowledge a link with the BNFL MOX shipments to Japan."
"Perhaps here we see the long arm of Mr Blair, but the falsification of such data is of concern to Europe."
"There is a link - MOX shipments to Japan are under EU safeguards controls."
"If both ends of the chain are operating illegally, we must not only halt all MOX shipments but we must also halt the production of MOX fuel."
"I have to say here today that we must also stop blaming workers, workers who are now under sentence of death for the illegal and criminal activities of the nuclear industry."
"We have been told time and time again that stringent controls are in place, that accidents cannot happen and that fail-safe systems are in place and then when anything happens, we are told it is the fault of the workers."
"This is not only injuring people but also adding insult to injury."
"It is time that the nuclear industry was shut down completely."
"That, of course, is our position."
"But is this latest accident the death rattle of the nuclear industry or must further nuclear terror happen before we close this monstrous industry down?"
"Mr President, a nuclear accident always provokes highly emotional reactions, fear and even irrational terror."
"The events in Chernobyl affected our mood for a long time."
"But in Tokaimura, the Japanese authorities have themselves recognised that the safety procedures, both in the conversion plant and in the fuel production plant, had not been followed."
"It was therefore not an unforeseeable accident."
"Apart from our sympathy and friendship towards the families affected by this drama, what are the lessons and consequences to be drawn from this accident?"
"The first lesson is clearly that it is imperative that the European and national authorities in each of our States deal with the question of safety procedures."
"Secondly, it seems very clear to me that the IAEA should intervene more regularly, not only to verify the text of the regulations, which it does too often, but also to do what it has not done often enough, that is, to go to the site to verify that the regulations are really being applied."
"In the case of Tokaimura, the IAEA should, in any case, ask the Japanese authorities not to authorise the resumption of reprocessing activities before a thorough investigation is carried out and before public and transparent conclusions are published."
"For us, the European Parliament, it seems to us more necessary than ever that the European Commission, within the framework of its Euratom competences, not only lends its assistance to Japan in the current circumstances, but also asks the Euratom services to carry out a complete analysis of the official safety regulations for our power stations, and around our power stations, in Europe. In this way, it would be in a position to ascertain whether all the safety conditions are being respected and to know whether further urgency procedures can be added in the case of regrettable human negligence, which are ultimately much worse or at least they have been in the last few years, than the unforeseeable accident which, by definition, can spread terror."
"We are in favour, Mr President, of the use of nuclear energy and we know that, in the European Union, the safety rules and conditions are stricter and more respected."
"Or at least we are told, for example, that the initiation of a nuclear chain reaction as a result of faulty handling by an operator is practically impossible in Europe."
"This is what happened in Tokaimura."
"We wish to avoid two pitfalls, Mr President."
"On the one hand, the blind, unconditional and uncontrolled support for nuclear energy."
"But also on the other hand, the manipulation by too many people of public opinion in order to spread irrational fears and terrors which were well known a thousand years ago."
"These were the famous millennium fears of the year 1000."
"Today, they are the fears on the eve of the year 2000."
"No, nuclear power does not kill any more than a traditional source such as coal has killed and still kills."
"That is the purpose of our resolution today."
"Two accidents have focused our attention over the last ten days."
"The first was in Tokaimura in which some 45 people were injured and 3 are in a critical condition in hospital."
"The second, was the rail crash in London which involved a train taking hundreds of people from the capital to the region of England I represent, in which 70 died and 200 were injured."
"While I wish to think of the individuals and families of those who died or were injured in the railway accident, I am afraid that the two accidents are very different."
"Accidents in transport systems can endanger the lives of hundreds of people."
"Unfortunately, a nuclear accident can affect potentially hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people."
"Mrs McNally made the point that near Tokyo, in Tokaimura, 300,000 people were confined to their homes."
"It appears that the accident was not as severe as we first thought."
"As a former Japanese civil servant, and as a member of the Japanese delegation for the last 15 years, I wish to put on our record, however, our concern for the victims of this accident in Japan."
"I want to make three political points: firstly, it is very clear that human error or human stupidity is continually with us in all areas of endeavour."
"We cannot trust individuals."
"In Tokaimura, it would appear either that the workers - with the active collusion of management or owing to the failure of management to enforce regulations - were breaching regulations that were there in the interest of nuclear safety."
"There are stories that there was actually an illegal handbook produced by the management telling workers to operate in this way."
"The swift action of the Japanese police going into the company may enable us to establish whether that is the case."
"If it was the case, it demonstrates the truth of Nietzche' s dictum that madness is rare in individuals but common in parties, groups and organisations, which is why we need individual, independent monitoring of what goes on in nuclear plants."
"We need someone to guard those people from their own stupidity and errors."
"Secondly, it is clear that there is a lack of emergency planning."
"Thirdly, we have to say that we should be offering assistance to the Japanese if they request it."
"Finally, two factual corrections; firstly, our Amendment No 6 makes it clear, when we are calling for the plant not to be reopened until an investigation has taken place, that we are talking about the conversion plant and not the reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, which is a separate plant on a separate site operated by a separate company..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the accident in Japan is, of course, something we must also concern ourselves with here in Europe for at least two reasons."
"Firstly, it has created uncertainty about the safety of nuclear power."
"Now Japan is planning to build 20 additional reactors between now and the year 2010 and to make itself enormously dependent on nuclear energy."
"It is therefore unacceptable that neither Japan' s own people nor the rest of the world have been provided with adequate information, and their failure to involve the IAEA in the investigation is equally unacceptable."
"Of course, it should actually be standard international practice to involve the IAEA when accidents of this kind occur."
"Secondly, nuclear MOX fuel is shipped from Europe, for example from Cherbourg and Sellafield, to Japan."
"Apart from the problem of what may happen to it out at sea, British Nuclear Fuel has admitted that safety data relating to MOX shipments has been falsified."
"Of course that just cannot be allowed to happen and is every bit as unacceptable."
"I would like, in due course, to hear from the Commission about what kind of European Union regulations are applicable to such shipments."
"Mr President, I would like to put some questions to the Commission."
"In my view, the accident in Japan demonstrated, first of all, that nuclear energy is not safe."
"When are the safety levels actually determined?"
"How many victims were there at the time of the Chernobyl accident and how many are there today, about ten years on?"
"Safety levels cannot be measured at the time of the accident."
"A nuclear accident is not the same as a train accident."
"In time, the effects magnify and they cannot be reversed quite so easily."
"Secondly, just how cheap is nuclear energy, Commissioner?"
"Will the nuclear industry pay the initial cost of research and development which the military, i.e. the taxpayers, had to pay?"
"Does the nuclear industry pay for the cost of the accidents when they affect areas and sections of the population on a much wider scale?"
"Of course, it would work out cheap if it did not have to bear all those costs."
"This is why I believe that it is time to turn a new leaf, to change existing policy."
"It would take decades to close down all the nuclear plants."
"Let us capitalise on this time and concentrate our efforts on the other sources of energy we have been discussing here. Let us discourage the establishment of new nuclear plants, particularly in areas which are not as safe as Japan such as the ones now under preparation in Turkey, in Akkyu, or in Thrace."
"How can we dare to encourage such dangerous investments?"
"Mr President, when we have spoken in recent years on the use of nuclear power to produce electricity, we have always made reference to the hazardous eastern reactors which are of Russian design."
"Self-declared opponents of nuclear power have drawn the distinction between the relatively safe reactors of the West and these reactors."
"The Japanese have said, just as the Europeans are doing today, that their reactors are safe and that a chain reaction could not occur."
"The facts tell us otherwise."
"Today, after these two bad accidents, the one in Japan and the other South Korea, we have to recognise that drawing this distinction between high-risk nuclear reactors and supposedly non-risk nuclear reactors was a serious strategic error."
"All nuclear reactors have a risk attached to them, to say nothing of the fact that the permanent disposal of nuclear waste is not safe in any area."
"In view of the fact that such nuclear accidents do not stop at national borders, now would be an opportune time to explain to the accession candidates to the European Union that if they choose to continue with their risky nuclear policy - I am thinking here of Temelin, Krsko, Bohunice and Mohovce - which are a threat to the entire European Union, then accession should not, and cannot, be granted under these circumstances."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are faced with a nonsensical disaster, and we are powerless to intervene."
"The nuclear accident of 30 September in the private nuclear power plant in Japan proved once more that the use of nuclear energy is dangerous and that it is imperative that we establish tough safety specifications."
"Of course, what is particularly noticeable is the fact that for a country with 51 reactors and an undertaking to establish a further 20, it does not have the appropriate knowledge and experience to deal with such events."
"Thirteen years after the great Chernobyl disaster, this nightmarish history seems to be repeating itself."
"In the immediate future, we shall find ourselves grieving for yet more innocent victims."
"Despite all that, instead of being ousted from the world energy market on environmental and financial grounds, the nuclear power industry is still continuing to expand"
"The issue is a critical one and public opinion is sufficiently sensitive to it."
"The European Parliament, as a representative of European public opinion, has a duty to take heed of the messages and react accordingly."
"The objective of sustainable development stipulated in the Treaty of Amsterdam has once again provoked deep concern and forced us to rethink what we are doing."
"Current trends show that milder and renewable energy sources are increasingly becoming the only solution to the energy problem of post-industrial society."
"The Commission shares the concern of the European Parliament and others about the accident at the uranium processing plant in Japan."
"That an accident such as this could happen in a technologically developed country such as Japan once again makes it very clear that nuclear safety requires great and constant vigilance everywhere."
"Another major concern is that in a facility handling such hazardous materials the operators were able to interfere with or bypass the procedures designed to avoid such accidents."
"This, in particular, highlights the question of the overall safety culture of the plant and the level of training of the personnel as well as the importance of rapid dissemination of information."
"The Commission has already asked the Japanese authorities for detailed information on the accident and its causes."
"The authorities have launched an enquiry."
"This will undoubtedly address the issues of regulation, safety procedures, supervision and worker training."
"The Commission will most carefully examine the report of this enquiry for lessons to be learnt in Europe."
"In the light of these, it will in due course review its emergency procedures."
"Poor safety management in combination with inadequate training or poorly qualified personnel appears to have been a very important factor in this as in many accidents."
"In the European Union, Member States' national authorities must require undertakings to inform exposed workers and apprentices of the health risks involved in their work and train them in radiation protection."
"The Commission will enquire of Member States what their latest provisions are for radiation protection and training of workers."
"The Commission will also undertake a review of the present levels of training in nuclear safety for operators and other workers in the different types of nuclear facilities in the European Union."
"Research on safety culture in the nuclear sector is already included in the research and training part of the Community' s Fifth Framework Programme."
"Research on nuclear reactor safety is also included in the programme, though at a lower level of funding than previously."
"The Commission will respond positively to any request for assistance from the Japanese authorities in managing or exploring the consequences of the accident."
"The Commission services will remain in close contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency to exchange information and analysis and, if necessary, provide support for follow-up activities."
"The issues raised in the motions concerning the manufacture, transport and use of mixed oxide - the MOX fuel - are unrelated to the accident at the Tokaimura plant."
"The questions relating to inspection of the fuel at the Sellafield MOX plant are within the competence of the national authorities and have been reported to the UK nuclear installations inspectorate."
"There was no question of any of the material being removed from safeguards control."
"Transport of MOX fuel is performed under the control of national authorities in the countries of origin and destination, taking into account the appropriate Community legislation and IAEA standards."
"As the MOX fuel shipped to Japan is ready for use in the nuclear power reactors without any further processing, it will not pass through the Tokaimura facility."
"Concerning the use of MOX fuel in nuclear power plants, this is a decision made by the individual electrical utility after licensing by their national safety authorities."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a moment."
"President."
"The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.25 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)"
"VOTES"
"The first item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance"
"Mr President, I have a point of order to make."
"A characteristic of urgent procedures is that they are urgent and, as a rule, we receive the approved amended texts with the Minutes on Friday morning."
"I wanted to ask you whether these texts will be available here in Strasbourg by tomorrow morning, in which case I would pick them up or will they otherwise be vailable this afternoon?"
"At the moment I can only assure you that the texts will be available electronically this afternoon."
"Motion for Resolution (B5-0188/99) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on climate change: preparing for implementation of the Kyoto protocol"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Explanations of vote"
"According to the definition in the Kyoto protocol, only forests established in non-forested areas after 1990 can be considered as carbon sinks."
"Under this method of calculation, only 1 to 3% of the network of European forest can be taken into account."
"The present definition of 'carbon sink' in forest is inappropriate for the European practice of forest regeneration."
"This is a matter of the utmost importance."
"If we really want to combat climate change and not just develop measures which have nothing to do with the environment, we should accept the overall carbon stock of forests as a carbon sink."
"- There must be full cooperation of all the Member States within the European Union if we are to play our full part in reducing the level of greenhouse emissions which are presently playing such a destructive role within our global environment."
"We owe it to future generations to take seriously the long-term implications of the uncontrolled emissions of CO2 and their impact on the environment."
"I welcome the fact that EU Environment Ministers have agreed to reduce the EU' s emission of six greenhouse gases by 8% between the years 2008 and 2012."
"The figures agreed will permit Ireland only to increase emissions by 13% relative to 1990 figures."
"The European Parliament too, has worked hard in implementing legislation which reduces the use of CO2 gases."
"For example, the EU' s new directive on regulating pollutants obliges oil companies to sign up to ensuring that the sulphur content in cars is cut three-fold and that the sulphur content in diesel is cut seven-fold by the year 2005."
"If the overall social, human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be secured, then the standards laid down by the EU' s recent directive on vehicle emissions and fuel quality must be strictly adhered to."
"There must be maximum cooperation between the EU Member State governments and all interested bodies so that a reduction in the use of CO2 becomes a reality."
"I welcome the debates which took place this week in the European Parliament on the uses of alternative energy resources."
"The Irish government has brought out a Green Paper on Sustainable Energy which is to be given special status within our National Development Plan for the period 2000-2006."
"This Green Paper discusses the framework for reducing CO2 emissions within all sectors of our society."
"More funding must be put aside for alternative energy resources and there is also an anticipation that there will be a switch from the use of solid fuel and oil to natural gas and renewable energy sources and power generation in the future."
"This plan also proposes measures targeted at various consumer sectors which are designed to enhance energy awareness expertise and practice in areas such as appliance purchasing, use of energy in the home, building installations, heating systems, energy management in industry, the services sector and the public sector."
"I want to stress that the publication of the Green Paper on sustainable energy in Ireland should be viewed as a positive contribution to the debate on how we deal with climate change threat within the energy sector."
"- This motion for a resolution calls, inter alia, for a kerosene tax and for kilometre charges for motor cars."
"I believe that these measures are damaging and unnecessary in themselves, and in any case I am opposed in principle to taxes being set at the European level."
"I affirm that fiscal policy is exclusively a matter for individual Member States."
"In view of the position of my political group in this matter, I feel unable to oppose the resolution outright, and I shall therefore abstain."
"- (FR) I am voting in favour of this report because it is urgent that the European Union takes specific decisions to combat the greenhouse effect."
"However, the reference, in point G, to ""flexibility mechanisms"" is unacceptable to me because the principle of organising a market for the right to pollute would be scandalous."
"The ""right to pollute"" should not be for sale and the richer countries should not be able to side-step the common law by means of a payment or transaction."
"It is they above all, who should have the means to conform to the necessary constraints in order to improve the environment."
"Everything possible must be done to ensure that each operator will make the greatest possible reduction in its pollution, guaranteeing that the minimum effort laid down is carried out by all parties."
"Market regulations should not replace the requirements of the law - and therefore the duties - which apply to everyone."
"This is a crucial choice of society which is fundamental to European identity."
"In this respect too, we are making serious concessions to American and liberal ideas which, however, have proved to be ineffective in terms of protecting the planet and to be unfair."
"Europe has not been able to prevent the establishment of this principle in Kyoto, however it is in no way obliged to implement it in its own territory."
"Finally, I hope that we will be able to resist it."
"- (SV) I should like to give the following explanation of my vote."
"I could not, for the following reasons, vote for the resolution concerning climate changes and the way in which the Kyoto conference as a whole is to be followed up."
"The resolution contains nothing about which particular consequences for the climate the unreasonable development of nuclear power has."
"In my home country, Sweden, the parliament has decided to phase out nuclear power by closing an extremely dependable nuclear power station, Barsebäck on the Sound."
"According to calculations made, closing this power station will increase carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 3.5 million metric tons per year."
"This more than doubles Sweden' s contribution to overall CO2 emissions from electricity production."
"This unwise strategy in my own country has also meant that Sweden has negotiated for itself a quota within the EU, on account of the EU' s commitments following the Kyoto Conference, as a result of which carbon dioxide emissions in Sweden have been permitted to increase by 4%."
"This is extremely regrettable and remarkable, considering that the EU' s responsibility after Kyoto is to reduce CO2 emissions by a total of 8%."
"Because these important facts were not dealt with in the resolution, I could not support it."
"That concludes the vote."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 12.05 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 7 October 1999."
"I cannot quite place your intervention, Mr Bethell, in the framework of the Rules of Procedure."
"I think it was supposed to be a procedural motion, but was not in fact."
"Nonetheless, I take note of your wise advice."
"Agenda"
"The next item is the inspection of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Regarding Thursday' s sitting:"
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has requested that the Commission statement on British beef be brought forward to Thursday."
"I must clarify that the reason why we decided at the Conference of Presidents to schedule this debate for Friday was, of course, to take into account the meeting of the Committee of Experts scheduled for the previous day, i.e. Thursday."
"I felt it necessary to clarify this point, without wanting to prejudice the decision of the House in any way."
"Madam President, I should like to speak on behalf of my colleague, Miss Lynne, who sadly has injured her shoulder, having fallen down the stairs here while showing people how dangerous a particular set of stairs was!"
"Miss Lynne would have asked that we be allowed to close the debate on the question of British beef with motions for a resolution from the various political groups."
"I would like to make that proposal that the political groups be invited to submit motions for a resolution to close the debate on British beef."
"Thank you, Mr Watson."
"Firstly, please convey my sympathy and best wishes for a speedy recovery to Miss Lynne."
"There are two aspects involved here: we already had the problem of the lifts."
"I would like us to proceed in order, as I do not quite follow."
"I had two requests. The first was for the debate scheduled for Friday to be brought forward to Thursday."
"This is the request which you should be speaking in favour of, first of all, on behalf of your Group, and I shall therefore give you the floor."
"Madam President, my apologies for not being clearer the first time I spoke."
"Our initial demand was to bring the debate forward to Thursday."
"However, we understand now that the reason the Commission wished to make the statement on Friday was because on Thursday there is a meeting of the Veterinary Committee which will look at this matter, and so the Commission will therefore be in a position to give further information on Friday."
"We welcome this but we would also like to ask that Members have the possibility of putting down motions for a resolution to close the debate."
"In other words, if I understand you correctly, in the light of the argument I suggested, you are withdrawing your request to bring the debate forward."
"On the other hand, you are maintaining your request for the submission of motions for resolutions at the end of the debate."
"Is there a speaker against this request?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have been approached with a request from the Liberal Group for the submission of motions for resolutions and a vote on these at the close of the debate on British beef."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Madam President, it should be said at this particular stage that it was the British Conservatives, the EPP, who asked for this item to be put on the agenda on Friday simply because, as Mr Watson has said, the Commission will only be ready on Friday morning. I therefore reject the allegations of Mr Donnelly."
"British Conservatives were in favour of making sure that we have free commerce in the European Union."
"We want to make the internal market work and have British beef bought on the continent."
"It is my very great pleasure to cordially welcome Mr Dehaene who does us the honour of attending in the visitors' gallery to hear our debates prior to his own statement on Wednesday."
"(Loud applause)"
"Still on the subject of Thursday' s sitting, I have a request from the Group of the European People' s Party to bring the question for oral answer on the European Union-Morocco fisheries agreement forward to Thursday."
"At the moment, this point is included on the order of business for Friday."
"Who wishes to speak in favour of this request?"
"Madam President, it was always the wish of our colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries that we should no longer only ever discuss fisheries issues on Fridays, and we have heard that there is still sufficient time on Thursday afternoon to discuss one issue."
"Given that relations with Morocco are of such great importance, not just in general terms, but also with regard to the area of fisheries policy, we are pleased that there is time on a Thursday to give an issue like this its due importance."
"I would be grateful if we could show a relatively united front in deciding on this."
"Madam President, I am sorry, but I was getting Tuesday and Wednesday confused."
"I would be most grateful if you could advise me whether it would be possible for the Council, before the vote on the report on Kosovo - which we have urged should take place - to at last provide its comments on Parliament' s amendments, following which we will then be able to hold the final vote."
"We had made a written request for the Council to be present, for it to comment and for us to hold the vote only after this has been done."
"Has it now been resolved that this is how matters are to be handled?"
"Absolutely, Mrs Pack. I can assure you that the Council will be represented, and that we have forwarded Parliament' s request."
"Madam President, I propose to talk about a human rights violation."
"Many Europeans have been shocked and disgusted over the last few days to discover that in a country with which we are on very friendly terms, and to which we Europeans, especially those in my own country, owe a great debt of gratitude, that is, the United States of America, it is still legally possible to put children on trial and to take them away from their homes in handcuffs and shackles. And I am not talking about seventeen or eighteen-year-old youths, but about ten and eleven-year-old children."
"This is what has happened to a small slip of a boy with a very high-pitched, young child' s voice, who has been accused of sexually abusing his five-year-old sister."
"Madam President, I would therefore request that you write a letter to the governor of Colorado and ask him to give this small, mistreated child his fatherly help."
"Remind him too that the United States of America is the only country apart from Somalia that has not yet ratified the UN Convention on Children' s Rights."
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you, Mrs Flemming."
"We are going to look very closely into this case, and I shall be happy to consider some action along the lines you request."
"Madam President, I would like to raise a matter which, although not as sensitive, is still important."
"During the first part-session of this Parliament I asked you if you could do something about the television channels."
"We had a Dutch TV channel for five years at a stretch in the other building and suddenly we find that we no longer have one."
"I asked you about this during the first part-session and you assured me at the time that you would spare no effort in putting matters right again."
"We are now three part-sessions and three months on."
"I do not doubt your good intentions but the point is that nothing has been done yet."
"I would ask you again to see to it that we get a Dutch channel on the television again, just as we used to in the old building next door."
"Thank you, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel."
"Thank you for reminding me of this point once again."
"We shall see when this can be done."
"I thought it had been."
"I did ask for it to be done, quite emphatically."
"I think that it has not been possible to do anything so far for technical reasons, but I promise that I shall ensure that the situation is remedied as quickly as possible."
"I promise you that I shall read this booklet very carefully, and if there is indeed the need to carry out this amendment, then we shall readily attend to it."
"Madam President, my report, which was to have been debated and voted on this week, has been deferred."
"My understanding was that it had been deferred to the sitting on 3 November but I cannot see it on the draft agenda."
"Could you advise me whether that is an oversight or whether it is going to be deferred again."
"I shall begin to feel that this report should be renamed: ""The deferral"" !"
"Mr Chichester, I can tell you that the report has been included on the order of business for the November part-session in Strasbourg."
"I thought that would suit you. I see that is the case."
"Madam President, over the last few days, the Italian press has disclosed the scandal of the Mitrokhin files which concern spying."
"As I belong to the group of Members which was disbanded in a democratic vote in this Parliament, I have tried to properly understand the meaning of the term 'affinities' ."
"Reading about the scandal in the press, I have learned that two influential Members of the European Parliament are involved in this scandal."
"Given the involvement of these two Members, I would like to know whether the term 'affinities' also covers possible relations between their groups and the KGB."
"As you can imagine, it is not my place to answer that question."
"Madam President, on the same subject of TV reception, as raised by my colleague Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I wish to express the hope that the technical problems currently preventing the reception of BBC1 and BBC2 can be resolved."
"I realise that we English-speakers are spoilt with Sky, CNN and BBC World, but it is not the same as having the domestic channels."
"I think that your request involves another technical problem, one that we are going to look into, but which seems to me less easy to solve than Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel' s."
"Changes to the Rules of Procedure following the interinstitutional agreement (OLAF)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, regarding the possible changes to the Rules of Procedure following the interinstitutional agreement of 25 May 1999, relating to internal inquiries carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)."
"Madam President, when a speech is made before a parliament, silence might be too much to expect;"
"I think we can allow a gentle hum of voices."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the report and proposal for a decision that I am presenting and briefly explaining on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs concerns the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement on the methods used to investigate fraud."
"We are tabling this report at the specific request of the President of the European Parliament, taking fully into account the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would like to remind you of the facts that are, actually, very simple."
"On 6 May 1999, the European Parliament approved this interinstitutional agreement with its own vote in plenary session."
"On 25 May 1999, the agreement was signed by the President of the European Parliament - Mr Gil-Robles, the President of the Council and the President of the Commission."
"The Council and the Commission adopted, on 25 May and 2 June respectively, the necessary decisions under their competence concerning the implementation of the agreement within those institutions."
"We are somewhat late in implementing this agreement, which can, of course, be explained by the hiatus caused by the elections and the start of the new Parliament' s work."
"We must proceed, however, without further delay in order to avoid any ambiguity regarding our desire to cooperate fully in the more correct and rigorous way fraud will be investigated."
"In fact it means inserting, in accordance with Rule 186(C) of the Rules of Procedure, a very short new rule - 9(C) - which will allow an annex containing the text of the interinstitutional agreement to be included, in which the necessary technical alterations with regard to our institution' s competences have been introduced."
"To avoid any ambiguity regarding the respective functions and competences of an institution such as the European Parliament and a unit such as OLAF, I would like to stress, Madam President, that both Recital 5 and Article 1(2) state unequivocally that the provisions on privileges and immunity of the Treaties in general, and of the Protocol in particular, will take precedence and will be fully complied with."
"I would like to add that because concern had been expressed about Article 2 in particular, during the debate of 14 October in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, all of us in the committee agreed on an amendment which now appears as the last paragraph of Article 2 and says: 'This article applies without prejudice to confidentiality requirements laid down in law or in the European Parliament' s Rule of Procedure."""
"I therefore believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this text can be adopted without any reservations, especially because the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has unanimously adopted this report and proposal for a decision."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, for clarifying such an important issue in his report."
"We all know that this clarification has come at an opportune and important time - at a time when there are widespread calls to tackle, and ultimately root out altogether, fraud and those conditions which nurture it."
"As you are all aware, the European Parliament showed some awareness of this issue when, some months ago, it adopted a decision containing very specific articles - a decision which Mr Napolitano has incorporated in his report which also contains very specific articles on how we should function and what factors we must consider in order to achieve our goal of combating fraud."
"Now is not the time to re-examine the articles one by one."
"We all know them very well."
"However, at this time, it is essential to draw your attention once more to the awareness this House has shown and the awareness the European Parliament has shown on the issue of fraud - an awareness which was turned into action by the internal decision of the European Parliament, and an awareness which is re-formulated in the report and the proposal of Mr Napolitano."
"It is, I believe, quite significant for this House and it is significant for the institution of the European Parliament that, once again, it is responding to the demands of the European citizens - demands which have been made quite clear of late, particularly during the recent European elections."
"Madam President, you all know that the word ""fraud"" forms part of our major focuses."
"On many occasions, we have mentioned the need to combat and eradicate fraud altogether."
"However, you all know very well that our experience, both in the European Parliament and in Europe, proves that it is not enough just to say this, to go on reiterating that something should be done."
"We need to take steps - specific steps - and it is up to us to take the first steps since we are the ones who anxiously call for fraud to be tackled and eradicated."
"Mr Napolitano' s proposal which, as he himself said, was adopted in the Committee of Constitutional Affairs without any objections, is a very clear and very specific step in this direction."
"For precisely this reason, this House must also vote in favour."
"At the same time, it would be an oversight on my part if I failed to mention the contribution made by the European Parliament' s Committee on Budgetary Control which has laid down the right foundations for us in one of its opinions, which can also be found in Mr Napolitano' s report."
"In closing, I would once again like to thank the Chairman of the Committee of Constitutional Affairs, as well as the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I would like to ask the House to vote in favour of the Napolitano report."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee asked for an opinion, the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am able to follow on from where the preceding speaker left off."
"We give our unqualified support to the report by our colleague Mr Napolitano. We, on the Committee on Budgetary Control, have recommended that the changes that have become necessary as a result of OLAF should be incorporated directly into the Rules of Procedure."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has suggested that a single basic rule be incorporated into the actual Rules of Procedure and that the full wording - consistent with the interinstitutional agreement - be added as an appendix."
"That is perfectly acceptable."
"It is crucial that the substance remains unchanged."
"The key point, as has already been mentioned, is that we, as a Parliament, should give a clear signal that we are not just demanding or stipulating that others should be subject to investigations by an external, independent authority, but that we want to subject ourselves to this process too."
"I would have liked us to be able to discuss this decision of Parliament' s together with the question of appointing the new director of OLAF."
"We had planned to hold the hearing for shortlisted candidates last week, in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The Commission, however, did not draw up the definitive list of candidates in time."
"Some people, moreover, have the impression that we have sought to interfere improperly with an appointment procedure that is, and must remain, the responsibility of the Commission."
"Yet those who have this impression overlook or gloss over the fact that this is by no means a normal appointment procedure, rather it is a matter of filling a key post that has far-reaching powers and the right to conduct administrative investigations into every organisation and institution of the Union."
"The Regulation on OLAF of 25 May 1999 lays down specifically that the Commission can only appoint its director once Parliament and the Council have voted."
"Therefore, there must be harmony between the three bodies."
"This procedure was chosen to guarantee the director' s independence."
"I hope that this week, here in Strasbourg, we will succeed in resolving the confusion over the procedure which has emerged."
"Ultimately, we must not be the ones to delay any decision of this kind when, almost exactly a year ago, the overwhelming majority of Members of this House gave their support to the idea of launching an independent anti-fraud office."
"Madam President, my group welcomes the decision."
"We regret, in fact, the delay of four months now in Parliament bringing the report to a conclusion."
"A failure or further delay would be catastrophic for Parliament' s reputation with its public."
"The centrepiece of the decision is Article 2."
"This will avoid a potential van Buitenen affair emerging from inside Parliament' s own ranks."
"The final clause of Article 2 is slightly cryptic, and questions will arise about its meaning."
"It is important for us to recognise that under the Rules of Procedure of Parliament the information acquired inside a temporary Committee of Inquiry is to remain secret only if it contributes to the writing of the inquiry report."
"We must acknowledge that any knowledge acquired that is superfluous to the inquiry or gratuitous should be disclosed immediately."
"Madam President, I am very keen to add my congratulations to those extended to the rapporteur and fully concur with the previous speakers who actually said that they will support this report."
"I could stop there, but since I have four minutes of speaking time, for once, as opposed to two I will say something more on the subject after all."
"The call for more openness and transparency is closely bound up with the call for more democracy that is ringing out loud and clear across Europe, not least in relation to the institutions of the European Community."
"Parliament - and we have been reminded of this - was most insistent in its calls for clarity during the last part-session and made a stand against dirty tricks and fraud."
"When I arrived here a year ago I saw the reports produced by the Committee on Budgetary Control, the report by Mr Bösch, how many meetings there were under Mrs Theato' s leadership, and the protest being made by Mr van Buitenen."
"It all revolved around the question of clarity and transparency."
"This therefore led to an interinstitutional agreement being produced, which we welcomed."
"It may not have contained everything we could have wished for but it was still a very honourable compromise and went further than Parliament had been able to manage. But all this happened back on 25 May 1999."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament have now reached agreement in principle but OLAF, the new anti-fraud office, was unable to set to work because, on the one hand, a formal ruling still had to be issued by the Bureau for the purpose of making the procedures applicable to Parliament' s services and, on the other, we have yet to take up responsibility ourselves, as a Parliament, so that we as individuals, our services, and our working practices also become subject to the same supervision that we impose on the Commission and on Parliament' s services."
"I therefore think it is absolutely essential that we take this step here today."
"There are, of course, individuals who have raised formal objections, and rightly so, but the rapporteur' s expertise and that of the people who have assisted him in compiling the texts, completely reassures us that there is no further cause for any objections and that we have crystal clear texts which will make the procedures applicable to Parliament itself, providing we add this amendment."
"Consequently, we are in favour of this happening without delay, for imagine if the reverse were to be the case."
"It does not bear thinking about, Madam President."
"One of the worst moments I have ever experienced in this Parliament occurred when we voted on the Statute, for there is still no sign whatsoever of a European Statute despite all the hoo-ha that was made about it at the time and despite all the praiseworthy efforts on the part of our Parliament."
"The fact that the ""best"" result had not been achieved was used as an argument for not pursuing something that would merely be ""good"" ."
"I believe that in this case there is not even an argument for taking such a line, and that we can give our full support - in the firm belief that all formal objections have been resolved - to the proposed texts, so that the fight against fraud will be something to be undertaken not just by others but also by ourselves."
"The obligation to provide information that we impose on others will also apply to us, and we will be subject to the same supervision that we require others to submit to."
"I was often asked at the time if, in view of the fact that Parliament wanted to subject the Commission to more stringent supervision and to impose on it a stricter regime for combating fraud, Parliament would also live by the same code?"
"I will be ashamed if we are unable to adopt this unanimously."
"Madam President, the best way of combating fraud is not to appoint more inspectors but to implement, in our own Parliament too, a policy of complete openness about subsidies and administration."
"It is the present culture of secrecy which is the fraudsters' best defence."
"All administration and all subsidies are nowadays dealt with by computer."
"It is a very simple matter to give our citizens access to the information on the Internet."
"Everyone can see, at the library or on their own computer, who has received what amount and for what purpose."
"If a company or an association wants there to be confidentiality about any subsidies it receives, then it is free to use its own resources to ensure this."
"If a company, a municipality or a Member of this Parliament wants a subsidy from myself and other European taxpayers, I want to know what I am supporting."
"I ask that funds should be seen as being entrusted to our care and that they should not, en route to their recipients, be wasted or siphoned off by fraudsters."
"But no matter how many people we appoint to OLAF, fraud is, at best, only going to be slightly reduced."
"We need to go to the root of the problem if we want to stamp out fraud."
"The first prerequisite for doing this is a radical reduction in the number of projects and subsidy schemes the EU operates. Brussels ought only to be granting subsidies to cross-frontier projects or in cases where each country is too small to be able to carry out the projects concerned on its own."
"It should not be the EU' s job to decide if taxpayers' funds are to go to a church in Christiansfeld or a golf course in North Jutland."
"Prioritising of this kind can be done much better by Danish voters and politicians."
"Nor should it be the EU' s job to decide whether motorways or schools are to be built in Alentejo with the help of EU subsidies."
"We can safely leave those decisions to Portuguese voters and their representatives."
"Funds are more efficiently transferred to poor Member States from the rich countries in the north by reducing or completely doing away with the contributions paid by poor countries to the EU."
"At present, EU subsidies mean more often than not that poor people in rich countries are taxed for the benefit of rich people in poor countries. None of us ourselves want to pursue a policy of wealth distribution of this kind, but this is happening nonetheless because of the EU' s numerous systems for granting subsidies."
"For example, 20% of farmers receive 80% of subsidies."
"We ought instead to make all subsidy schemes transparent."
"Our citizens will then ensure that they are done away with."
"The newspapers will write about the absurdities entailed."
"And then the voters and the various organisations will get involved."
"In this way, living democracy will ensure that incentives to fraud are abolished and that the fraud which does go on is revealed."
"To combat any remaining fraud, it is a splendid idea for the police authorities in the Member States to cooperate with each other."
"On the other hand, we have no need for a Corpus Juris, a common prosecution service, penal legislation and a European answer to the FBI."
"These things are aimed not at reducing crime but only at creating a new state and developing a more intrusive European Union."
"I totally agree with Mrs Maes that complete openness about subsidies and subsidy schemes will make the job easier for OLAF' s new director. So who is this to be?"
"My group proposes that we do not turn the decision into an election battle between left and right."
"We ought instead to unite around the best qualified candidate and be content with nominating him or her for the job."
"For years, the Council has approved faulty accounts and so disqualified itself from finding the right candidate."
"The Commission has positively concealed fraud and so shown the need for an independent director of OLAF."
"As the situation stands, a unanimous nomination from the European Parliament is therefore the best solution, and my group sincerely hopes that we can find a director for OLAF who will take decisions to prevent any fraud in future."
"And because, Madam President, Parliament must clearly abide by the same rules, I too am voting for the agreement."
"Mr President, I have always been rather sceptical about moralistic or police-like attitudes that actually encourage whistle-blowing, which means that fraud is only avoided through the creation of increasingly invasive instruments used to monitor individuals."
"I believe that along with my group, I can give my full backing to President Napolitano' s report, because the amendment to the Rules of Procedure and the proposed decision are a serious response to the concern that Members might be subjected to excessive and arbitrary checks - a concern which has been voiced of late, most recently by Mr Dell' Alba."
"I think that there is no reason to delay the decision any longer."
"The European Parliament and its Members have a wide range of means available to defend themselves in the event of these investigations."
"This will clearly become easier if the internal procedures are made clearer and more transparent."
"We must have confidence in OLAF' s future work and make its work easier."
"Only in this way can we react in a credible way in the event of abuse, and react effectively to episodes like those mentioned today by Mr Theato and Mr Bösch."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision on the establishment of an anti-fraud office can largely be attributed to the European Parliament' s involvement."
"The establishment of this office was a very significant decision because combating fraud plays a central role in the way the citizens of our Member States perceive European politics."
"This is why the general public expects this office to be able to perform its task thoroughly, and this ability to perform its task thoroughly will relate primarily to the institutions in which OLAF is able to carry out investigations, and I therefore welcome Mr Napolitano' s report and the contributions that have been made here."
"The appointment of the director will obviously play a major role in the office' s ability to do its job."
"A special appointment procedure was agreed on and has been emphasised here several times."
"That is why it is also necessary to prevent irregularities in this procedure."
"I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, and you, Mr Bösch, that I, for my part, will prevent any improper influence being exerted on the selection of a director."
"The only decisive factor in appointing someone to this extremely important post should be that person' s qualifications for the job. I hope that very soon the selection of the candidates and the appointment of a director will take place, through consensus, and also that the posts you have already approved for this year will soon be filled."
"I can assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the role that combating fraud plays in the way European politics are perceived by our citizens and therefore, on behalf of the Commission, I once again welcome the report and the work that went into it."
"Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday after the votes on the Budget."
"Electronic signatures"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the Internet may have been seen until now as a source of information, it is now being used by the business world for buying and selling, and not just by businesses but by quite ordinary private individuals."
"Of course, this development within a rapidly expanding market with terrific growth rates ignores national borders and requires the provision of a Community framework."
"In recognition of this fact, the Commission has proposed a recommendation for a Directive on a Community framework for electronic signatures, in other words for signatures that are produced electronically rather than by hand."
"Parliament approved 32 amendments at the first reading in January 1999."
"The Council then presented its common position on 28 June 1999 having taken into consideration many of Parliament' s amendments."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market discussed the position and voted unanimously in favour of it, with 7 amendments, one of which we ought not to accept though."
"I would like to discuss the following points. The directive is intended, first and foremost, for subscribers to open networks such as the Internet and does not affect the right to voluntary agreements in the context of closed systems."
"The Internet does not stop at European borders."
"For this reason, the directive aims to open up the market to third countries and provides for cross-border agreements."
"Secondly, the future of electronic legal and business transactions essentially depends on whether we succeed in improving confidence in security, especially where the consumer is concerned, both in technical security as regards forgeries, for example, as well as in the legal validity of such processes."
"A crucial starting point for this is the electronic signature."
"By means of this kind of signature in electronic form, one can guarantee that the identity of the person who has made a declaration and signed it, the signatory in other words, can be immediately ascertained."
"In addition to this, the integrity of the data that have been supplied can also be ascertained."
"As regards the technical standards which the directive deals with, it is attempting to ensure technological openness."
"We should be able to achieve higher standards of security through such advanced signatures and qualified certificates."
"The directive guarantees that the appropriate cryptographic products will be available throughout the Community without this being made dependent on approval."
"It will permit voluntary accreditation systems though, in order to promote the level of quality standards."
"It is envisaged that there will be a minimum liability for certification-service providers."
"It will have to be possible to use pseudonyms and data protection will also be taken into account."
"A crucial issue in subscribers' confidence in the trustworthiness of legal transactions concluded electronically on the Internet is the legal validity of such actions."
"In future, advanced signatures will, as a matter of principle, be accorded the same status in the eyes of the law as hand-written signatures because they are particularly secure."
"However, the legal validity of ordinary signatures and their use as evidence ought not then to be denied as a matter of principle."
"With this directive, which involves the first worldwide framework regulation of this kind, the European Union is making a first and crucial step towards both the regulation and the promotion of electronic commerce within the Community."
"This is designed to increase people' s confidence in the trustworthiness of open networks, in the services and products on offer and in the legal validity of business concluded on the Internet."
"It also makes a valuable contribution to the free trade in goods and services in the internal market, and indeed both for the consumer - if I may make a rather sensational comment: in terms of Internet shopping - and also for the suppliers of the necessary cryptographic services and products."
"I would like to offer a word of thanks in particular to the Commission and to the Council for the extremely cooperative way in which they both worked together with Parliament."
"But my thanks also go to all my fellow Members of Parliament, from every group, not least those from the previous legislature period during which important preparatory work was done."
"Our task consists mainly of painstakingly dismantling the divergent national regulations which have evolved, and of bringing them into line with one another."
"In this case, we are dealing with a newly developing technological and social reality, to which we can, from the outset, give legal form, through original European legislation, by means of which we will be able, at the same time, to prove our worth as a European Community of law in a particular way."
"Divergent national regulations should not be allowed to develop at all, or become established over and above the current scope."
"For this reason, I also think that it is important that this directive should come into force as quickly as possible and so I ask you to give it your approval."
"Mr President, European regulations are often accused of lacking balance; either they are too bureaucratic, or they only serve certain interests, or they are even ignorant of worldwide developments."
"I think that we can say now that here we have an excellent example of the opposite."
"In the area of the approximation of laws, we must always try to find the difficult balance between necessary harmonisation, on the one hand, and consideration for the legal traditions that have evolved in Member States over the years on the other."
"This is an outstanding example of balance."
"On the one hand, a small number of clearly defined regulations relating to the requirements pertaining to electronic signatures will be laid down. On the other, Member States will be able to decide in which cases to accord these signatures equal status with conventional declarations of intent such as hand-written signatures, written proof, or other documentary evidence."
"At this point, I would like to comment particularly on proposed Amendment No 2 which clarifies the rather misleading wording in Article 5(1)."
"I would now like to emphasise once again that it was also confirmed to us by all sides in the discussions that were held in Committee that it is not automatically permitted to substitute an electronic signature with a personal one for certain form requirements as laid down by individual Member States."
"National legislature will have a completely free hand in deciding in which cases electronic signatures will be afforded the same status as hand-written ones."
"This directive is a good example of balance between the interests of commerce, on the one hand, and the consumer on the other."
"What we have here is a precise, straightforward rule that lays down only a few requirements."
"Look at the appendices for example."
"But we also have the necessary protection to make such agreements binding and to make the supplier liable."
"Finally, it is also a good example of, on the one hand, systematic action by the European Union within its borders, in the internal market, but is, at the same time, a way of opening up towards international cooperation."
"We have here a clear framework which applies first and foremost within the EU, but we have also laid down in the text of the directive itself, and this is particularly noteworthy, an openness towards international regulations."
"One can see very clearly in exactly this area that in terms of harmonisation within the EU, we are currently at an intermediate stage of regulation."
"We have the national level, we have the European level, and recently the international regulations level has increasingly been making its presence felt in more and more areas."
"It is good that we are clarifying here that precisely in the area of new technologies, in the area of electronic commerce, we are prepared to address these issues on a worldwide scale."
"Of course, this will also have a central role to play when it comes to the WTO negotiations."
"I am pleased that, as a new Member of this esteemed House, I have been able, in my maiden speech, to participate in a good piece of European lawmaking, and I hope that there will be broad agreement here with what I have said and that the Council of Ministers will not have any problems in adopting the directive."
"Thank you very much Mr Wuermeling, particularly as this was your maiden speech here in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I would first like to give my heartfelt congratulations to the rapporteur for his report on behalf of my group and to give him my especial thanks for having been able - in spite of being new to this House - to steer this report on the Directive on electronic signatures so quickly to its second reading."
"Because in a matter such as the regulation of requirements for the recognition of electronic signatures, a rapid solution is at least as important as finding the proper solution."
"I am convinced that we have found both a rapid and proper solution for helping the electronic signature along and making it possible for there to be a breakthrough in the suitability for everyday use of the new information and communication media."
"What strikes me as being particularly appropriate is the demarcation of the scope of closed and open systems, the neutrality of technology, enabling people in the legal field to apply these rules unambiguously, and the admissibility of pseudonyms."
"First and foremost, this will allow the consumer to remain anonymous on the net, as anonymous as in everyday business in the 'offline' world. It will also allow the prevention of a precise profiling of the consumer."
"In accepting one of the amendments we want to establish this week that it is the responsibility of the Member States to stipulate those legal areas where the use of electronic signatures may apply."
"This clarification has certainly been necessary."
"However, I would like to see this clarification combined with a request, a request to Member States, to be as generous as possible here and to limit the applicability of electronic signatures and the equal status accorded them only in exceptional cases."
"If we now more or less conclude the Directive on electronic signatures at second reading, it will be an important stage victory."
"The aim, which is to achieve a consistent and halfway-complete European legal framework for the information society, has not yet been achieved."
"For that, we still need the second reading on the Directive relating to e-commerce, the Directive relating to copyright and that relating to the distance selling of financial services."
"To conclude, I would therefore like to appeal to the Council to establish its common position on these draft directives as quickly as possible, of course as far as possible on the basis of the amendments from first reading in this Parliament, in order to submit it to Parliament for second reading."
"Mr President, at this time I shall be thinking of our former colleague, Ullman, who was the rapporteur when we discussed electronic signatures last time."
"There were not many of us present here then, but there are a few more of us today."
"I think it is because there are more of us here in the Chamber who understand the importance of this directive."
"Its importance is also illustrated by the share issue last week in connection with the Finnish company, Data Fellows."
"This was a real example of people' s capitalism."
"Data Fellows is a company which, partly through the Internet, markets just the kind of security and verification services we have been discussing."
"It is therefore an economically important proposal we are debating."
"When we discuss this, it is also important that we obtain a quick decision, as the rapporteur pointed out and as many others have emphasised."
"I support the rapporteur and am pleased about the Council' s view that a quick decision is wanted and that constructive dialogue has taken place."
"I think that, otherwise, the European market may well become fragmented because quite a lot of countries have now already adopted directives."
"It would therefore be unfortunate if we were not to obtain this directive."
"I also think that this directive is clear, even though there have been certain discussions about its not specifying what formal requirements the Member States want to make in connection with different procedures."
"One unoriginal example which might be used to illustrate this is the fact that, if legislation in the Member States makes it a prerequisite that both parties be present simultaneously, then, in order to get married over the Internet, it is not enough for both parties to produce this type of signature."
"There is therefore a formal requirement there in the legislation, and this cannot be overturned."
"When we talk about identification and security services of this type, I hope that we do not limit ourselves and think that it is just a question of numbers."
"Instead, we shall, in the future, have other forms of perhaps physical identification and verification, and I hope that this will be borne in mind when drafting the revision clause of the directive."
"Now, do not imagine that I have been watching too many James Bond films."
"No, this is in fact how it is going to be in the future, and that is why the revision clause is important."
"The talk is of voluntary agreements and of a variety of options, but in actual fact it is important that the security requirements in this directive should be complied with so that signatures valid on a national basis also have international currency."
"It is also worth pointing out that the Commission has an important task in establishing both what are to be regarded as reliable signatures and what are to be regarded as secure arrangements."
"Where these matters are concerned, I hope that the Commission will establish standards which are economically correct, that this will be done in an open way and that no de facto monopoly will be created."
"We know in fact that standards in the information society have precisely this degree of significance."
"The directive gives the Commission a very great deal of power in this area."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to welcome Commissioner Liikanen as for the first time he is concentrating on information society matters and no longer on budgetary matters."
"I wish him every success in his work."
"I am very pleased by this development."
"I hope that with our vote we will accelerate the procedure as much as possible in order to finally allow electronic signatures to be recognised, something which already exists in practice."
"We are aware of the speed with which this system is growing and the fact that the world of the Internet, that is to say, the world of the users of the information society, is already well advanced as regards the validity of contracts and transactions via the electronic system."
"I would stress that we in the European Parliament should have been the pioneers of this, but we were not because our administration refused to comply with one of Parliament' s decisions."
"Some years ago, we voted on an amendment to the Rules of Procedure which aimed to make electronic signatures valid, especially as far as petitions and appeals to the Ombudsman were concerned."
"This would have allowed petitions to be presented via the Internet, increasing transparency and the chance to contact Parliament and the other institutions, for example the Ombudsman' s department."
"Well, despite this amendment, this provision has, to a large extent, remained a dead letter."
"Indeed, it is true that a petition can be presented via the Internet, but then written confirmation by the writers is always needed, which in fact makes this method redundant."
"I hope that during the vote which we are about to take, the strength of Parliament' s wish will be affirmed in a way that will immediately establish the provision that will straight away allow more visibility, more transparency and give the citizens of Europe more access to our democratic life."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report."
"Electronic commerce is growing rapidly, which we find very positive."
"However, we still often fail to understand the cultural and political significance of the Internet."
"In the future, we shall obviously need a movement to uphold civil rights in electronic commerce."
"Electronic signatures ensure the security of electronic commerce, and that is important."
"We need growing trade, for example, so that we can improve our competitiveness with the United States."
"Our use of the Internet is only one third of that in the U.S. Even though three passwords would be needed for one transaction, and two of them would be changed each time, the system is not completely secure."
"If hackers can access Pentagon files, then obviously they can also access electronic commerce networks."
"In retail trade, where losses due to theft might be about 1% of sales, it is the retail trade that suffers."
"In electronic commerce the customer suffers too, and very often just the customer."
"For this reason, the importance of security cannot be sufficiently emphasised."
"We need international cooperation, as has been proposed here already earlier this evening."
"To secure extensive cooperation we should set up an Internet police force comparable to the traffic police."
"But imagine how much higher the speed is and how much longer the roads are than in ordinary road traffic."
"It is also important that surveillance take place where the action is."
"This will require international cooperation and much effort from our negotiators at the WTO round of talks."
"We also want to protect minorities, and the largest minority in all countries is the poor."
"I await the time when they too can access the Internet, and I hope that the Commission will take action to that effect."
"Mr President, I too would first like to warmly thank my colleague, Mr Kurt Lechner, for his excellent report which I can also fully endorse in terms of its content."
"With the Directive on a Community framework for electronic signatures, the European Union is taking an important step towards breaking down the barriers to electronic commerce."
"Until now, the legal position of electronic signatures has been unclear, and it has been particularly open to question whether electronic statements with a digital signature can be accepted as evidence in legal proceedings."
"These problems will now diminish since, according to the directive, in future, legally binding declarations may also be submitted electronically, thereby facilitating electronic commerce."
"The directive is the first step on the way to achieving a comprehensive legal framework for electronic commerce."
"Amongst other things, it points the way for the Directive relating to electronic business transactions, for the Directive relating to distance selling and in part for the Directive relating to copyright which will both soon be dealt with at second reading in the European Parliament."
"My colleague, Mr Wuermeling, has already quite rightly clarified the fact that the directive leaves it to the Member States to determine when an electronic declaration of intent which is signed with a digital signature should be taken to be equal to a signed statement or to a statement for which the law stipulates, for example, that a hand-written signature is necessary."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the directive exempts national contract law, in particular provisions on the drawing up and fulfilment of contracts, from its scope, and concentrates on essential matters."
"I have two more very brief observations on the directive."
"Firstly, it is extremely important that a Europe-wide system for electronic signatures is established, one which will be open to global developments and ready to integrate them."
"Here, too, it is incumbent on the Commission to take up contact with third countries and international organisations in order to find appropriate solutions."
"It will be of particular interest to observe in this context which recommendations the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), the OECD and the WTO are developing in this area."
"It must be our aim to ensure that electronic signatures are recognised across borders, in other words, to establish an internationally compatible framework."
"Secondly, I would like to stress, and with this I shall also conclude my speech, how important and urgent it is for there at last to be regulations governing market access for the certification service providers, for internal market principles to be applied and for there to be liability regulations."
"It is high time that through the adoption of uniform provisions, both for certification services providers and for consumers, consistency of law is achieved, so that - as is the case when credit cards are used - they will then know exactly to what extent there is a risk of them being threatened with liability."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 p.m."
"Motor vehicles and trailers"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0033/1999) by Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 70/221/EEC on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to liquid fuel tanks and rear underrun protection of motor vehicles and their trailers [8697/1/1999 - C5-0031/1999 - 1998/0071 (COD)]."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, for the deep analysis of the common position, and also his very concise presentation of the issue here today."
"This draft proposal for a directive is aimed at establishing construction standards to be respected by manufacturers of fuels tanks for the purpose of EC type- approval."
"In particular, the idea is to introduce into Council Directive 70/221/EEC new provisions for plastic fuel tanks for motor vehicles."
"The provisions will cover such matters as impact resistance, mechanical strength, fuel permeability and fire resistance."
"In fuel tanks, safety is of paramount importance, especially when new technologies and materials are introduced."
"The draft proposal links up directly with the technical requirements of Regulation No 34 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, relating to the prevention of fire risk and in particular to the provisions for plastic fuel tanks."
"The report proposes two amendments, both related to diesel spillage, which may be a serious hazard to motor cyclists, especially in combination with a wet road surface, as has been mentioned here."
"We fully agree that this is a serious problem from both safety and environmental points of view and the Commission can accept the two amendments."
"To summarise, the Commission can accept all the proposed amendments."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.00 p.m."
"Speedometers for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0029/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on speedometers for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 92/61/EEC on the type-approval of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles (COM(98) 285 - C5-0029/1999 - 1998/0163(COD)) (rapporteur: Mr Ferri)."
"Mr President, at its first reading, Parliament did nothing about this directive because it appeared to be a technical directive which presented no difficulties."
"But the Council later opened up a Pandora' s box by introducing two supposedly technical amendments: one, to Article 3, which provides for a sort of legislative delegation with continuous reference to the Regulation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe; and another, to Article 6, extending the time limit for the entry into force of the directive owing to the need for an adaptation period for the industry."
"Parliament, as a result of these amendments introduced by the Council on the recommendation of the Commission, felt obliged to review the text."
"The time limit seems reasonable, bearing in mind the delay which this directive is experiencing. The deadline for mopeds has been extended from 1 January to 1 July 2002, so that the industry may have a slightly longer adaptation period."
"But above all, the Council has re-addressed the question of commitology."
"The original decision laid down a certain type of committee, specifically the committee mentioned in Article 3(A) which, in the meantime, was disbanded last July."
"That committee no longer exists and therefore the rapporteur, displaying a high degree of responsibility and intelligence, has proposed an advisory type committee."
"It seems inappropriate that in the case of provisions of this type, which the Council describes as technical, the Commission feels set on the idea of a management committee."
"I hope that the rapporteur maintains his proposal to adopt an advisory committee, which would be most appropriate for this type of regulation."
"Maintaining the mechanism of a management committee is complicated and, furthermore, it would have to be done by amending the original directive on the type-approval of motor vehicles."
"Therefore, I hope that, on the basis of the agreements which this Parliament adopts this week, the Council and the Commission will consider the possibility of definitively laying down the advisory committee procedure."
"Mr President, I will not take up the two full minutes because several thoughts that I wanted to express, particularly about road safety, have already been expressed by the preceding speakers."
"I think that the problem of road safety, particularly for two-wheel motor vehicles, is actually a problem that concerns the younger generation above all."
"I personally only ride motorcycles and never drive a car. I am also a member of various motorcycle clubs and deal with young people there too."
"This is why I think it is particularly necessary to do something about this specific area."
"Of course, speedometers are installed in order to automatically create an inhibiting threshold to the vehicle' s speed because otherwise - unfortunately this is the case - very high speeds are attained which these vehicles cannot cope with on account of their centre of gravity being too high, for example. This has dire consequences."
"For this reason, we fully endorse this directive, and we would also be pleased, of course, if, all in all, more could be done in the European Parliament with regard to road safety so that it is more consistent between Member States, because the accident figures clearly show that young people are the ones most affected in this area."
"We agree that the deadline should be postponed."
"We must also give industry the chance to actually transpose it if, at the end of the day, that then helps us to achieve a uniform directive."
"We also believe that an advisory committee would be the appropriate instrument for this."
"Mr President, the draft directive under discussion concerns the compulsory fitting of a type-approved speedometer in all new mopeds, motorcycles and three-wheel motor vehicles."
"The Commission believes that, for reasons of safety and to protect the environment, mopeds and motorcycles that are not fitted with a type-approved speedometer should no longer be allowed to be placed on the market."
"It should be possible at all times for drivers of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles to comply with the speed limits in force in the Member States."
"They should not have the opportunity to refer to the lack of legal provisions in order to escape the consequences of breaking the speed limit."
"Besides, the speedometer is already a standard fitting in most of the vehicles placed on the market in the European Union, without this significantly affecting the overall price of the vehicle."
"In addition, the compulsory fitting of a speedometer in all these vehicles will yield economies of scale which will benefit consumers as well."
"The Commission would be prepared to approve all the proposed amendments, but Amendment No 5 on the committee procedure may prove very problematic."
"As the Commission will soon be making a proposal to amend the framework directive, i.e. the Directive establishing a committee on motor vehicles, the Commission suggests that the committee procedure be discussed in that connection."
"The issue could also be dealt with when the new commitology decision approved in June enters into force with regard to the existing committees."
"However, I would consider it unfortunate if discussion of the document became a matter for conciliation simply because of a problem concerning committee procedure."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.00 p.m."
"Passenger cableway installations"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0028/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive relating to cableway installations designed to carry passengers (COM(93) 646 - C5-0030/1999 - 1994/0011(COD)) (rapporteur: Mr Miller)."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party/European Democrats, I would like to thank the rapporteur and to welcome this directive."
"We all ask that the formal procedure following Parliament' s decision be carried out as quickly as possible, and that the directive be quickly transposed so that we can successfully conclude this discussion process which was initiated by the Commission in 1994."
"This directive is significant in four ways."
"It is significant in terms of industrial policy, competition policy, security policy and consumer policy."
"This directive relates to all four policy areas."
"We can all still remember the dramatic accidents that have taken place on and as a result of cableway installations."
"They are largely responsible for the fact that calls for uniform safety standards have become more vociferous."
"These calls have also become increasingly topical."
"I am therefore very pleased, and the preceding speaker also touched on this matter briefly, that it will not only apply to those people who are actually in the cable car, but also to those who disembark at the station or who are waiting to depart."
"Uniform Europe-wide safety standards are necessary in order to protect both the safety of passengers and also the competitiveness of the European cableways industry in the international market."
"Cableway installations have undergone highly specialised, state-of-the-art improvements."
"Cableways are an important economic factor in many Member States, particularly in the Alpine region."
"I am pleased to be able to refer to the fact, in my maiden speech to this House in plenary session, that in my own country, Austria, cableways are a cornerstone of tourism and consequently, of the Austrian national economy."
"I would just like to emphasise the importance of this directive."
"In my country alone, we have nine million passengers who take around 526 million trips with 255 cableway companies and, in economic terms, this represents a total turnover of 10.8 billion Austrian schillings."
"The directive represents a competitive advantage and raises the competitiveness of European and particularly Austrian cableway companies."
"The directive is aiming to harmonise safety standards for passengers."
"It aims to boost the free movement of goods, that is to say the internal market, as far as the cableway industry is concerned."
"It will consolidate this sector as an integral part of the national economy."
"Uniform and simplified procedures, a relieving of the burden on the authorities as well as the removal of procedural steps are all part of this directive."
"I welcome the fact that, by means of this directive, it is going to be possible to bring an initiative that was introduced during the Austrian Presidency to a successful conclusion in terms of consumer safety and competitiveness."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the substantial and significant content of this directive."
"I have only been a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for a few days, and therefore I have not had the opportunity to follow its entire course."
"Over the past few days, I have only been able to familiarise myself with it."
"The speaker before me was saying that this type of installation is very widespread in Europe - it certainly is in my country, which includes almost all of the Alps as well as the Apennines."
"So we are dealing with structures, and a sphere of activity which are of great concern to us."
"As I was saying, the content of this directive is all very noteworthy, and we certainly agree with it."
"In this way, we are giving the go-ahead to the free movement of technologies in this regard, and to the free movement of supplies."
"As was said a short while ago, the route has been opened to competition in this sector which, in the field of technology and in the field of safety, is essential because competition is exactly what it is - it makes technology advance."
"I have read carefully the content of the directive and from a technical point of view, I still find some points unclear."
"Of course, the directive lays down principles, gives specific instructions, brings into line and also harmonises legislation within the Member States on what has to be an essential goal - safety."
"However, in the area of safety and in the area of technology, specifications, parameters, characteristics and materials used become fundamentally important. Levels of maintenance and planning times also become vital."
"Now, from my point of view, certainly the technical provisions which will follow this directive - and which will be laid down in other places and after other meetings - will form the basic element in defining the authorisation of this directive in all the Member States."
"In this sense, and knowing which parameters will be examined from a purely technical point of view, I would ask whether it is possible for Parliament, and particularly the Commission, to be kept informed. Above all, I ask whether it is possible for the Commission to inform us what the result of the implementation of this directive will be, from a purely technical point of view."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.00 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m.)"
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, on behalf of myself and several other MEPs, while I fully respect the solemn nature of today' s formal sitting, I wish to make a point of order under Rule 19 out of concern for human rights given that the Colombian President' s visit today is restricted to his parliamentary address until a formal dinner with heads of political groups."
"Bearing in mind that the Colombian Government' s own public defender reports one massacre for every day this year and that the Commission of Colombian Jurists attribute 78% to paramilitaries with the knowledge of the official Colombian forces, will you, as President of this Parliament, in your private talks ensure that you discuss issues of human rights."
"Will you in particular ask when the law passed in June this year requiring crimes against humanity committed by the Colombian military to be transferred to the jurisdiction of civil courts will actually be implemented."
"Will you ask why instances of forced disappearance, extrajudicial execution and sexual abuse have been excluded from that law."
"Will you find an appropriate way to report back to Parliament on the responses given."
"I ask this in the spirit of successive resolutions on human rights in Colombia passed by this European Parliament and in support of brave human rights defenders working under the threat of violence and of death."
"Thank you very much, Mr Howitt."
"Of course, both the Bureau and the Presidents will present Parliament' s position in accordance with their traditional decisions in that regard."
"The results of these contacts will be communicated to you."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"EC and ECSC budgets for 2000"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0030/1999 by Mr Bourlanges, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2000: Section III Commission (C5-0300/1999);"
"A5-0031/1999 by Mr Virrankoski, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2000 (C5-0300/1999)"
"Section I, European Parliament - Annex: Ombudsman"
"Section II, Council"
"Section IV, Court of Justice"
"Section V, Court of Auditors"
"Section VI, Economic and Social Committee and Committee of the Regions;"
"A5-0032/1999 by Mr Pittella, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the ECSC draft operating budget for the financial year 2000 (SEC(1999) 803 - C5-0017/1999 - 1999/2072(BUD))."
"Mr President, you will understand, ladies and gentlemen, that it is a great honour for me to be able to take the floor today."
"I have had a seat in this Parliament for ten years now, and I have never had the opportunity to speak for fifteen minutes before, which, considering my temperament, has been a long-lasting source of frustration, and is finally coming to an end today!"
"I would like to tell you, Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that preparing the budget of the European Union is a strange process indeed."
"What sort of budget is it, then, which is based on the principle that the budgetary authority and Parliament vote on the expenditure but not on the revenue?"
"What sort of budget is it which necessitates making a distinction between two well-defined categories of expenditure, one being the compulsory expenditure determined by an authority - the Council - the other being the non-compulsory expenditure determined by Parliament?"
"This distinction is patently absurd."
"What sort of budget is it which subordinates the budgetary authority to legislative texts to the extent that some figures and some amounts expressly stipulated in the legislation and in the programmes are so restrictive that they tend to reduce the budgetary procedure to a set of legislative adjustments which have already been carried out?"
"The situation is thus strange, to say the least."
"But it is even stranger still to draw up a budget within the framework of the interinstitutional agreement and the budget perspectives which we have."
"Effectively, we are working within the framework of the Financial Perspective decided in Berlin."
"Well, the least that one can say is that the programming exercise which took place there was quite strange, firstly in terms of its duration (setting a seven year programme in two days of Council meetings was perhaps risky) and vague in terms of the amounts."
"Today, we can see that however one approaches these needs there is only a very approximate matching of budget estimates and actual requirements."
"In Category 1 on agriculture and market expenditure, we are already up to the limit of the margin."
"In Category 4 on external action - I shall return to this point - the Category is literally at bursting point."
"In Category 5, we do not know what the administrative reform of the Commission will cost, but it is with great concern that we see the problem of pensions taking shape before suitable expenditure has been envisaged; and in Category 7, intended for pre-accession preparations, the movement developing in favour of faster and wider enlargement, if I may say, is not supported by suitable appropriations."
"Countries such as Cyprus and Malta are in an uncertain situation already."
"The budget programming exercise was, therefore, vague, but also very restrictive for the European Parliament because, for the first time, we are working within a framework where we have obtained less flexibility in exchange for - not more money, as previously, but less money."
"The situation is inherently paradoxical."
"The matter becomes thoroughly surreal when we tackle the subject of the financial year 2000, as the European Union is experiencing an absolute contradiction here."
"On the one hand, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the implementation of the single currency are creating new burdens, whilst on the other hand, the planned enlargement effectively entails an additional financial load."
"Finally, the increased weight of the Union' s responsibilities, especially as regards Kosovo, are also creating far greater tensions, far greater pressure on the budget."
"Well, confronted with this situation, some institutions, particularly the Council - I am wondering what the Commission will decide in the end - tell us that we are going to finance more policies, with more partners, take on more responsibility, with less money."
"I must say, Mr President, there is a paradox here, a contradiction which Parliament does not wish to accept."
"This is the situation we find ourselves in."
"Budget 2000 is characterised by the paradox that I have just mentioned, of how to finance more with less money, but will also, I hope, be characterised by Parliament' s rejection of this paradox."
"How do the institutions seek to address this paradox?"
"Well, by two methods, both very simple and equally reprehensible."
"The first involves cutting expenditure, and the second sacrificing traditional priorities in favour of new priorities."
"I find the draft budget, which the Council has submitted for our approval and whose inspiration we are objecting to, quite worrying from that point of view."
"When I speak of cutting expenditure, I am thinking, for example, of expenditure under Category I for which a cut has been proposed."
"The Commission already started off on the wrong track. Perhaps today it is starting to experience some regrets?"
"In fact, across-the-board reductions have been proposed to us, which are not in line with the real situation."
"The same applies to payments."
"As regards structural funds, we have considerable payment requirements, due both to the implementation of the new instrument of Agenda 2000 but also to the vast weight of past commitments."
"This death rattle, which is the last gasp of the dying man - forgive me, interpreters, this is impossible to translate, it means the final hour has come - is the last gasp when the programmes of previous years finally expire."
"All that entails considerable burdens as regards payment and, in this respect, the Council follows neither the Commission, nor us, and proposes a perfectly unacceptable reduction in relation to the preliminary draft budget."
"Having demonstrated some vagueness on this question in recent months, the Commission seems recently to have returned to more laudable sentiments, which we are pleased to see."
"Thus, on the one hand, we have a cut in expenditure and the appropriations allocated to existing and future requirements."
"The same is true for expenditure under Category 5."
"At the same time, the priorities of yesterday and today are being sacrificed, and this is unacceptable, in favour of the priorities of tomorrow."
"I think this is a serious point."
"In Category 4, the Council makes the completely unacceptable proposal to implement across-the-board cuts without any justification whatsoever."
"We have clearly understood that there must be reductions on condition that they are at least justified, but in this case they are not, I must insist."
"We have been told that it is necessary to finance Kosovo, Morocco, Timor and Turkey."
"Admittedly, Timor and Turkey are not in the draft budget yet, but we shall surely find them there in time."
"We have been told that all this must be financed and, in return, there will be cuts in all the traditional expenditure for the development appropriations for Africa, Asia, Latin America."
"Parliament says no."
"We shall not accept making Africa, Latin America and Asia, everyone bar Europe, pay for Kosovo."
"It is not acceptable."
"More generally, we consider the fact that the Commission is undertaking this type of approach for the future to be very serious, since we shall have to bear the cost of these new responsibilities from structural funds."
"And we cannot expect to pay for the Balkans, for example, in a structural and lasting way by means of enlargement, etc."
"No, we cannot get out of it that way."
"You cannot get the foot of Charlemagne' s mother, Berthe au grand pied (Berthe Big-Foot), into Cinderella' s slipper."
"It is just not possible."
"You have to make the shoe bigger, to take into account the needs we must fund."
"This is the situation as we see it."
"We are waiting for the Commission to make a statement on this point."
"The PDB obviously did not take some items of expenditure into account, but it was very clear."
"All we want to know now is whether the Commission is going to defend it."
"I should warn you, Commissioner, of a proposal which may be made to substantially reduce your own PDB, for it would be a serious matter if the Commission were not even to defend its own policy."
"We would be in a situation even more paradoxical than I am willing to accept, setting up Parliament as defender of the Commission' s preliminary draft budget, replacing the Commission as guardian of the major policies decided by the European Union."
"I should warn you on this point."
"It would be a serious matter."
"What is Parliament' s response?"
"It is quite simple."
"It rejects this attitude."
"It considers, on the one hand, that it is necessary to face up to the new priorities."
"There are essentially two of these."
"Firstly, administratively, it is necessary to deal with the consequences of the institutional crisis which we experienced last winter."
"This entails active support, and even an active demand for administrative reform addressed to the Commission."
"All the measures relating to TAOs have that objective, in the same way as all the appropriations for OLAF."
"The call for the creation of a new administrative instrument, a sort of executive agency or decentralised executive unit, fulfils a real need."
"We have initiated contacts with the Commission which seem to be productive."
"We have heard the words, we are now waiting for the deeds."
"Internationally, our second priority is effectively to finance, by some means, the main priorities: Kosovo with up to EUR 500 million, the agreement on Morocco with up to EUR 125 million, the programmes for Turkey and Timor with up to EUR 50 and EUR 30 million."
"In this regard, we have voted on an amendment which corresponds to a serious political commitment from this Parliament, even if we vote it before Category 4, which means that it does not to date have the status of an amendment, but it does constitute a commitment on the part of this House to vote in these appropriations at second reading, especially regarding the Morocco agreement which is one of Parliament' s political priorities."
"The second approach adopted by the European Parliament is not to sacrifice our traditional priorities."
"This is why we have rejected en masse all the across-the-board cuts proposed by the Council and we consider that we must face up to requirements in the areas of redevelopment, development, international development, social actions and environmental policy."
"We must face up to all these expenses with great energy and we must not accept their being sacrificed."
"Just now, I left out one essential point, research, within the framework of administrative reform."
"We are waiting to formalise in writing and give concrete expression to the agreement which is in the pipeline between Commission and Parliament in order to guarantee better budgetary use of the appropriations under this sub-section."
"We are therefore facing up to the new priorities but we are not sacrificing our traditional priorities."
"Thirdly, this requires us, and this is the essence of the problem, to respect fully the terms of the interinstitutional agreement, but in a dynamic fashion."
"We are respecting this agreement."
"We are respecting all the ceilings in all the categories and we are even leaving substantial margins in some of them, such as Category 1B on rural development."
"But we want a dynamic interpretation, in accordance with what has been said and, in particular, we want an ongoing structural review of Category 4, rather than an annual review."
"There are new expenses which must be funded."
"These expenses are not just for one year, they are ongoing expenses."
"This must be translated into a net increase in the appropriations allocated to Category 4 for the entire period and not just for the budget for the year 2000."
"This is a demand which Parliament is making and I would like to see it taken fully into account by the Commission and by the Council."
"What is the way out of this situation?"
"The Council still has time to think and a choice of means."
"There is the time to think as we are to meet on 25 November, Saint Catherine' s Day. There is a French saying ""A la Sainte-Catherine, tout arbre prend racine"" (on Saint Catherine' s Day, every tree takes root), so I hope that the budget tree will take root."
"As for the choice of means, Madam President, you and your colleagues have to choose, for I know that you cannot do everything, and I am sorry for this, between two avenues. One alternative is to review the Financial Perspective of Category 4 which will make it possible for us to vote in this budget by facing up to the new priorities in accordance with the commitments undertaken at the time of negotiating this agreement."
"If you do not want to go down this road, Parliament shall then be forced to resort to the strict application of Article 272 of the Treaty, and to assume the powers, which it is entitled to do, regarding both commitments and payments, and to vote for appropriations which match up to the level of the commitments which are the political commitments of the European Union and in strict observance of the Treaty."
"Madam President, the ball is in your court."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the 'EU budget for the year 2000 - other sections' , which we are considering, follows the rigorous policy of recent years."
"The budget for institutions other than the Commission and the Council for the year 2000 will be EUR 1.286 billion."
"The increase is EUR 44 million, or 3.5%."
"The margin for manoeuvre calculated from Category 5, as referred to in the Financial Perspective, is EUR 135 million."
"This draft budget focuses mainly on rental arrangements and renovation solutions for the places of work of the institutions."
"The intention is for the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions to move into Belliard buildings I and II once they have been vacated by Parliament and renovated."
"The joint organisational structure for these committees will be accommodated in the Bertha von Suttner Building, the former Montoyer building."
"The rented premises that have been in use until now will be given up."
"For these solutions to be successful, seamless cooperation is required on all sides."
"The budget provides for new posts to be created at both Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee to render the administration of the buildings more efficient."
"One condition of adequate administration, however, is that the division of labour and of responsibility of both Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee be clarified both interinstitutionally and with regard to the individuals involved."
"This division of responsibility must be considered a pre-condition of the project' s success."
"There are two reserves attached to the buildings, which are still in the budget."
"A reserve of EUR 7.4 million has been entered in Parliament' s expenditure for the rental of the Belliard buildings, as the rental agreement between the owner and the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions is still under discussion."
"If the rental agreement is finalised before the end of the year, the amount mentioned will be deducted from Parliament' s budget, as the European Parliament budget is, at present, 20.11% of Category 5, whereas Parliament has itself declared a ceiling of 20%."
"There are two reasons why this ceiling has been exceeded."
"The first is the double budgeting relating to rents, as explained above."
"The other reason is the reserve related to the Statute for Members."
"In the spring a reserve of EUR 60 million was included in the parliamentary budget for remuneration related to the Statute for Members."
"Parliament has demanded that Members' remuneration be paid from parliamentary funds, and the Council has supported this initiative."
"Because at present it is the Member States that pay the salaries of MEPs, this will mean that the payments are transferred from the Member States to the European Union."
"It is quite natural to suppose that a new expenditure item of this kind, which at the same time would diminish Member States' costs, cannot be included under the ceiling for formerly approved expenditure."
"If we take these two expenditure items into account, Parliament' s share of Category 5 would be 18.97%, which is in line with the principles of budgetary discipline."
"Another priority of this draft budget is increasing the resources of the Court of Justice of the European Union, especially their translation resources."
"According to the Council' s proposal, the Committee on Budgets has recommended that altogether thirty new translator' s posts be established, and that a substantial appropriation be earmarked for paying freelance translators."
"As appropriations have been proposed for improvements to the electronic office, the Court of Justice can expect a clear increase in resources."
"After this, we expect that the Court of Justice will be able to cope better with its workload, reduce the number of documents left untranslated, and serve Member States, citizens and businesses better in the interpretation and application of European law."
"Parliament has both the right and the obligation to demand clear results."
"Discussion of this year' s budget made it clearer than ever that there is a need to move towards activity based budgeting."
"The institutions have an abundance of staff, and it is to the benefit of all that they be used efficiently."
"The present administrative model, however, gives cause for criticism."
"The institutions seem extremely interested in inventing new requirements and job descriptions, so as to be able to justify their ever-growing need for staff."
"It is very difficult for Parliament, as a decision-making authority, to scrutinise the chart of its own four thousand strong organisation and draw conclusions as to what new posts are needed for what jobs."
"Every Member State, however, has had to radically reorganise personnel structures."
"Jobs have been reallocated, as have posts and staff."
"That is why in many cases the establishment of new posts is no longer the responsibility of the budgetary authorities."
"The budgetary authorities only allocate appropriations to the institutions."
"There are two advantages to this."
"Firstly, the overall work of an institution is seen clearly, which means that there is less danger of getting swamped in details."
"The work of the institutions can be assessed more clearly, on the basis of results, and can be better managed."
"On the other hand, comprehensive budgeting also makes it possible to clarify and increase personal responsibility."
"This encourages better and more efficient work, as everyone can find a way to work more effectively and use resources sparingly where the need is greatest."
"It is high time the European Union switched to activity based budgeting, result-oriented management, delegated power and responsibility downwards, and clarified personal responsibilities."
"We must require managers and heads of department to bear the responsibility for their own areas of revenue, and for their development and improvement."
"Finally, I would like to thank all those who helped me to prepare this report."
"I would especially like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terence Wynn, who has given me his support in so many ways, both in practical negotiations and at meetings of the Committee on Budgets, and in personal discussions."
"At the same time I wish to thank the main rapporteur, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, with whom I have enjoyed seamless and smooth cooperation."
"I would also like to thank all the coordinators, especially Reimer Böge of the European People' s Party and Ralf Walter of the Party of European Socialists for their constructive and pertinent cooperation."
"Finally, I wish to thank my own group for their unreserved support in every respect, as well as the secretaries and employees who were involved in the project."
"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, the discussion of the budget for the year 2000 has progressed significantly since I presented the Council' s draft budget here in Parliament on 14 September."
"Today, I have heard detailed perspectives and justifications regarding the content of Budget 2000, with particular reference to the European Parliament."
"The Union appears to need diverse resources, and the most essential questions are gradually beginning to be resolved."
"With the new trialogue practice, we have been able to discuss many major problems in a positive spirit."
"The speeches that have been made here indicate clearly the main priority of Budget 2000."
"It stresses particularly the many current challenges presented by Category 4 on external action, which call for joint solutions by the budgetary authorities."
"First, I will speak generally about the budget, on the basis of contributions from various quarters, and I shall return, at the end of my speech, to the Kosovo or Category 4 issue."
"First, I would like to comment on the compulsory agricultural expenditure, that is to say, Subsection B-1."
"The view of the Council is that the Commission' s proposal overestimates requirements for the year 2000."
"Therefore the Council in its own deliberations reduced this item by EUR 375 million."
"Overestimation by the Commission has been the regular practice throughout the 1990s."
"That was also shown in this year' s figures."
"The same can be said with regard to subsection B-1 on rural development action."
"In matters of appropriations relating to structural operations, the difference between the Council and Parliament concentrate on two areas: firstly, the size of the advance payment in respect of new structural operation payments, and, secondly, the timetable for attending to old, unpaid, committed funds."
"I believe that both matters are purely technical."
"Setting the advance payment at 3.5%, instead of the 4% proposed by the Commission does not require amendments to the legal effect measures."
"Neither does it in any way affect the total amount of new Structural Funds that Member States will be receiving over the period 2000-2001."
"As regards old, unpaid commitments, it is necessary to take account of the new spending criteria the Commission has just announced."
"In addition, we should note that the level of expenditure proposed by the Commission - 48% -clearly exceeds the 45% held to be the basis of the European Council' s own decisions at Berlin."
"In internal policies, there are many problems that are presently being discussed in the codecision procedure."
"It is important that the budgetary authorities respect the ceilings for expenditure adopted in the interinstitutional agreement."
"This will require even more effective coordination."
"There is significant pressure to develop administration in the Union."
"The new Commission has promised to issue a report on administrative development in February 2000."
"We can all agree that only on the basis of the Commission' s views can we comprehensively evaluate the need for human resources."
"As the OLAF commences its work, we should set great store by the qualitative aspects of this work."
"Regarding the importance of pension funds stressed by Parliament, we must also expect a comprehensive report from the Commission on, inter alia, reform of the acts on human resources, and other concrete proposals."
"Regarding the so-called BAT issue, or the issue of technical assistance offices, perhaps the time is not yet ripe to conduct such a laborious reform as Parliament is proposing in the budget for the year 2000."
"Funding for action in Kosovo and in connection with other external relations will be a challenge for the Union in terms of budgetary procedure and financing."
"It is noteworthy that the direct financing needs of the Kosovo area are considered to be mainly covered."
"This was established at the first donor conference in July."
"The budgetary authorities should now wait for the final, reliable, assessment of needs, which, in my opinion, cannot be expected until next year."
"The Council, for its part, is committed to attending to the financing needs occasioned by the earthquake in Turkey with the help of a loan from the EIB, macro-financing aid, and the funds targeted at the MEDA programme."
"This being the case, perhaps there will be no need for a separate financing programme for Turkey."
"As for East Timor, aid has been channelled there via ECHO."
"The donor conference on East Timor is to be held in November, so more detailed assessments will be available only later."
"As I mentioned earlier, Kosovo has become the main priority of the budgetary procedure for 2000."
"For this reason, the Council has demonstrated flexibility in its own procedures, resulting in a reallocation of appropriations in the draft budget for the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"It would seem appropriate to reallocate appropriations of humanitarian aid for Kosovo, especially as a large number of refugees have now returned to Kosovo, and to a certain extent humanitarian aid in Kosovo would seem to be the first step on the road to reconstruction, offering people at least shelter for the winter."
"For other budget headings that concern external action under Category 4 of the Financial Perspective, fixed-rate reductions for appropriations granted are a means of preventing hurried decisions to amend the excessiveness threshold of this Category. The reason, as I said, is that there do not yet exist any assessments of the genuine reconstruction requirements."
"With regard to the concern expressed by Parliament regarding the possible consequences that might result from the reallocation of appropriations under Category 4 regarding Union aid for the least developed countries, we should not forget that, by virtue of the Lomé Convention, the European Development Fund channels EU aid to many of the countries in question."
"The European Development Fund is not included in the general budget for the European Union: the Member States contribute directly to it and it has its own internal financing rules."
"Thus, the reallocation of funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo did not affect the European Development Fund."
"Subsection B7 of the budget is only partly aimed at the poorest countries, and the fixed-rate reduction thus harms countries other than just the poorest."
"In the sitting of the Budget Committee on 16 July, the reallocation of appropriations for Kosovo was discussed, and it was stated that the Commission should not burden the least developed countries and poorest groups."
"Furthermore, we were reminded of the Commission' s commitment to an international development strategy, whose purpose it is to halve world poverty by the year 2015."
"I have noted that the European Parliament also intends to propose appropriations that exceed the excessiveness threshold under Category 4 of the Financial Perspective, so that funds would be allocated to finance operations in East Timor and Turkey and to adopt the new fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"On this matter, I would like to make the following observations."
"The Council is also very worried about the situation in East Timor, but until now no precise assessments of the amount of aid needed there have been presented."
"The consequences of the Turkish earthquake have required our assistance already this year."
"This assistance was provided for in the supplementary and amending budget no."
"4/1999. It is, however, too early to determine the total amount of aid appropriations required for the year 2000."
"Appropriations to fund action in Turkey and East Timor should also be found within the framework of the excessiveness threshold under Category 4 of the Financial Perspective determined at Berlin."
"The Council, furthermore, has accepted that the Commission be empowered to negotiate a fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"The outcome of these talks is not yet known."
"I might, however, remind everyone that, in adopting the draft budget, the Council has also reallocated some Category 4 appropriations in order to create a reserve for the funds required under the new agreement."
"Finally, I will briefly comment on the overall increase in the budget and the frameworks for drafting it."
"On the basis of votes taken by Parliament' s Committee on Budgets, the payment appropriations would increase by over 6%."
"The corresponding figure in the Council' s draft budget is 2.8%."
"We have a responsibility to European taxpayers."
"It should be clear that Union expenditure should comply with the call for budgetary discipline and cost-effectiveness."
"The Union budget should observe the same degree of rigour as those of the Member States."
"At the start, I emphasised the need for a swift response from the budgetary authorities in ever-changing circumstances."
"I believe that the new interinstitutional agreement also contains sufficient means to deal with unforeseen needs."
"The spirit of the new agreement is clear: we cannot right away rely on the new funds for aid that exceed the total sum in the financial framework."
"Let this also serve as a basis for adopting the budget for the year 2000."
"I believe that, through sound cooperation among the institutions, we will successfully steer home the decision-making process with regard to the draft budget for 2000."
"I would like to thank the President and the Members of Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget is the political programme cast in figures; this is the short-and-sweet summary normally used to explain the budget plan."
"Although many decisions are taken at European level which are not directly reflected in the European Union budget, nevertheless Budget 2000 is a crucial and defining basis for many areas of European policy in the coming year."
"Since the drawing up of the preliminary draft budget in the spring there have been important events which could not have been anticipated at the time but which will and must be reflected in Budget 2000."
"Most importantly, this year we have had to experience a war on European soil necessitated by the most atrocious violations of human rights and by a policy of expulsion and ethnic cleansing on the part of the Milosevic regime; a policy which could not be tolerated by a democratic Europe and by a democratic international community committed to human rights."
"Europe at the close of the 20th century must not accommodate any policy of expulsion, or indeed murder of minorities."
"The European Union has assumed the responsibility for financing reconstruction in Kosovo, where it is not just a matter of reconstructing bridges, schools and the technical infrastructure, but rather the total reconstruction of a democratic and peaceful civilian society in the region. I am glad, therefore, that there is absolute consensus, absolute agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on making available in the EU budget the necessary funds for Kosovo."
"I think it is worth stressing the point that everyone is aware of the responsibility and stands by the commitment to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"The preliminary draft budget of the Commission from April of this year provides for a total of EUR 92.8 billion for all expenditure commitments which may be entered into during the coming year and EUR 89.6 billion for payments."
"However, as I have already said, this preliminary draft budget of the Commission does not take into account Kosovo, East Timor, Turkey and the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"The Council draft reckons with EUR 92.4 billion for commitments and EUR 87.9 billion for payments and the amendments adopted by the European Parliament Committee on Budgets give overall commitments of EUR 93.4 billion and payments of EUR 90.8 billion."
"Then in addition there are the funds needed for Kosovo, East Timor, Turkey and the fisheries agreement."
"I would like to add that there are a further EUR 15 million to be financed in the budget 2000 (directly, i.e. not from the development fund) as a contribution by the European Union to debt redemption initiatives for the poorest countries."
"I have given these aggregate figures for four reasons."
"Firstly: for all three sets of figures in question, i.e. those of the Commission in its preliminary draft, of the Council and of Parliament, the expenditure to be appropriated for the year 2000 in fact exceeds the totals for this year."
"The reason for this, which must be stressed, is as follows: the necessary payments, e.g. for structural operations in particular, are increasing next year due to the commitments from previous years and the Commission fully agrees with Parliament that it is not right in these instances to appropriate lower amounts than the standing commitments require."
"That would be a dubious policy."
"Secondly: in all three sets of figures some of the appropriations for commitments which may be newly entered into are, conversely, far below the corresponding amounts for this year even though, for example, the appropriations for pre-accession aid, i.e. in the case of the funds which are being allocated to the applicant countries, show a large increase."
"In short (and I would like to say this in reply to the speech of the Council also) this means that budgetary discipline is not just required of the Member States, but is clearly also being exercised at European level."
"Thirdly: the aggregate figures also show, however, that ideas on budgetary appropriations, in particular those of the Council and Parliament, are still far removed from one another and, consequently, intensive debates lie before us in the coming weeks."
"Fourthly: the aggregate figures are, of course, also an indication of the work which has been carried out by the committees, in particular by the rapporteurs, and, on behalf of the Commission, I would therefore like to thank Mr Virrankoski for his report on the individual plans of Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Mr Pittella for his report on the operating budget of the European Coal and Steel Community and particularly Mr Bourlanges for his report, which again shows him to be an excellent rapporteur and a master of highly sophisticated proposals."
"Besides budgetary appropriation levels, the report deals with important issues of budgetary economy and administration."
"I would like to mention the issue of the TAO, i.e. the issue of when external offices should be brought in to help."
"Mr Bourlanges, you quite rightly point out that this is not just a matter of better supervision and better contracts, although these are important issues, but also of the basic questions: ""what should be handled by the public administration and what can be done and under what conditions by private enterprise?"
"Therefore, these questions obviously concern the entire Commission staff."
"The new Commission has been able to meet the initial staffing requirements for the newly established Directorates-General through restructuring."
"However, the total staffing requirement now obviously depends on the institutional reforms for which the Commission will submit a blueprint, a proposal, in February."
"I hope that in the coming weeks we will be able to bring the proposals in the report into line with the Commission' s schedule for reforms."
"Regarding the OLAF staff, the Commission will incorporate into its letter of amendment the proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets to provide 75 new jobs next year."
"A brief word on agriculture."
"The Commission fully agrees with Parliament that the second pillar, the measures for rural development, presents a great opportunity, in particular for agro-ecological development."
"It will therefore propose in its letter of amendment, an appropriation increase which, although lower than that of Parliament, is nevertheless considerable."
"The Commission will also take account of the request to provide funds in the budget for the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"We are agreed that Budget 2000 should ensure EUR 500 million in commitment appropriations to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"The Council decided at the first reading to finance an across-the-board cut in the appropriations for external action."
"You have made it known as a parliament that you consider this course to be untenable."
"The Commission has authorised me to inform you that the Commission will propose another course which will take account of both the ideas on policy prioritisation and the ideas on budgetary discipline."
"The Commission proposes financing the necessary funds firstly by making adjustments within the external action Category, secondly by using the smaller part of the flexibility reserve and thirdly by making adjustments between policy areas, which will entail a change in the Financial Perspective."
"This is a course which was established in the joint agreement, the interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, in May of this year."
"European taxpayers would, I believe, not understand it if we simply requested additional funds to finance work in Kosovo without taking the difficult course of prioritisation, which means in practice reallocating funds."
"On the other hand, the increasing tasks of the Union in external action will also need to be reflected in the structure of the budget."
"The budget should be an expression of political tasks and priorities, which ultimately means an increase in the external action Category."
"I hope that, on the basis of preliminary work carried out by all institutions and, in particular, the reports of Parliament before us, we will reach agreement on Budget 2000 through a positive, open debating process which befits the major political responsibility we have for European policy."
"Mr President, I should like to extend our congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, and to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, on the way these proceedings have been conducted."
"Regretfully I cannot offer congratulations to the Council for their part in this process."
"The message the Foreign Affairs Committee has taken from the Council is that they believe we can only pay for Kosovo by taking money out of the hands of those who are even worse off than those in Kosovo."
"We want to rob the very poor in order to pay the slightly less poor."
"We want Africa to pay for the Balkans."
"I do not believe that is the message the EU should be sending out to the rest of the world."
"To find the EUR 500 million for Kosovo the Council has proposed an across-the-board cut of 10% in Category 4."
"Some cuts are even worse."
"For humanitarian aid, line B7-21, they are proposing a 20% cut."
"They are cutting EUR 70 million from NOVA: in other words, a 40% cut in assistance to Bosnia, so Bosnia has to pay for Kosovo."
"We are cutting support for the Middle East peace process just at the time where there is hope for a long-term solution to that process."
"What sort of political message is the European Union sending out about its commitment to that process?"
"Of course there has to be financial responsibility and we have to set priorities, but a 10% cut across the board is not a proper setting of priorities."
"It is an exercise in indifference and irresponsibility."
"No wonder the EU' s reputation at the moment is not very high with the public."
"There are two other areas that the Foreign Affairs Committee would like to draw your attention to."
"First, we would like to see proper funding for the Royaumont Process, particularly ensuring that it is a Pillar I activity, not a Pillar II activity."
"Hence we propose that we should set up a line on the Stability Pact and take some money away from the Meda line in order to pay for it."
"Finally, we would also like your support for the conflict prevention network, set up as a result of Parliament' s work, particularly the work of Mr Rocard."
"Now that we have a similar organisation in the Council its work is even more important."
"I would urge your support for increased funding."
"I urge that financial prudence is not made an excuse to drive more people down into poverty."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Budget Committee and Mr Bourlanges for their work."
"I am grateful to the commitment that they have shown in the fight against fraud in the European Union and, in particular, with the extra commitment they have made - an extra EUR 9 million has been voted by the Budget Committee for OLAF."
"This will allow for the creation of an extra 50 to 75 new posts in the year 2000 on top of the 30 new posts voted for in the supplementary and amending budgets."
"I should remind you that OLAF needs 300 posts to carry out its duties."
"This was endorsed by the report of the Committee of Independent Experts."
"Let us not forget that there are raised expectations in terms of the public' s attitude towards reform of the European institutions."
"It is essential that OLAF is given the appropriate resources."
"I should like to remind the Commission that we will not allow OLAF' s independence to be compromised by budgetary gains - a little note there for the future."
"I am disappointed that the Council Presidency has not referred to this."
"Are you committed to the extra 75 posts or not?"
"I would be grateful for some kind of feedback on that."
"You need to show the same commitment to fighting fraud as we are within the European Parliament."
"Another issue for the Budgetary Control Committee is the use of technical assistance agencies."
"In its budget guidelines for the year 2000, Parliament called for the phasing out of the agencies. And for the Commission to provide it with an assessment of its staffing needs."
"That has not been done."
"The Budget Committee has entered expenditure on logistical support and technical assistance in a separate section, with 90% of those appropriations in reserve."
"The Budgetary Control Committee would support this approach."
"It is absolutely right that those appropriations should not be released until the Commission has defined those categories of tasks that need to be outsourced."
"We look forward to receiving that information from the Commission."
