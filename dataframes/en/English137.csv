"An attempt is now being made, through the European External Action Service (EEAS), to bring the Union's external policy instruments into a coherent framework - the existing resources are being brought together and complemented by new resources."
"In view of the novel nature of this structure, ambitious provisions with regard to transparency and budgetary and financial accountability need to be applied."
"Since Parliament's budgetary authority includes the EEAS, the service must be integrated into the Commission structure."
"Otherwise, it will be impossible to grant discharge within the meaning of the treaties."
"The annual activity reports are also provided to the budgetary authorities."
"I, too, believe, as my fellow Members do, that the EEAS needs to have autonomy within the staff regulations for European officials."
"I support the provision which stipulates that EU officials and temporary agents who come from Member States and diplomatic services must enjoy the same rights and be eligible to apply for new posts."
"I hope that recruitment on the widest possible geographical basis, and by that, I am alluding to the new Member States, will become a reality."
"The European External Action Service is an essential instrument for an EU that is more open to the world and able to establish fruitful contacts with many different regions and countries."
"In order for this service to function, it is essential to give its officials proper roles and to clarify their status and that of temporary staff from the national diplomatic services who have a role within it."
"This amendment of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of those Communities shows that it is, therefore, fully justified."
"I hope that the service will operate in tandem with the national diplomatic services and act as a positive factor to enhance their performance."
"I hope that the main priorities of European policy will not neglect their external component and that, in the course of their action, the service does not neglect the crucial role of European languages in universal communication, nor the global European languages which are most suitable for establishing direct communication with large parts of the world."
"The European External Action Service is now an integral part of the European administration: it is open, efficient and independent, under the terms of Article 298 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."
"In the modification of the Staff Regulations and Conditions of Employment of Other Servants, I would like to highlight the equal status given to EU officials and temporary staff from the diplomatic services of the Member States, in particular, with regard to eligibility to take on all tasks under equal conditions and in promoting equal opportunities for the underrepresented gender."
"in writing. - I abstained on the occasion of the final vote on the Rapkay report on 20 October 2010."
"I fully support the formation of the European External Action Service and value highly the efforts of Elmar Brok and other MEPs who have managed to successfully balance the original draft presented by the High Representative."
"My intention was to draw attention to the fact that the amendment on geographical representation, which was supported by the AFET and BUDG committees, has not been adopted in the JURI committee."
"As a result, there are doubts whether the final version of the report can provide the European Parliament with a legal basis with regard to geographical balance."
"I wish you, Lady Ashton, and the new EEAS, on which we are pinning great hopes that yet another European dream will come true, every success, and hope that Europe will address the world with a strong, authoritative single voice."
"This is what a huge section of our Parliament wants."
"You can be sure that we will help you."
"I wish to explain why I abstained from voting on the amendment to the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities."
"I think that indicative targets for geographical balance are beneficial to the new institution."
"We need a highly qualified diplomatic service which has people from every Member State so that they can enhance the representation of the EU in the world."
"I am sure that the service will be a success if it can benefit from the experience of all Member States."
"I realise that the number of Member States has increased more than fourfold since the start of the European integration process."
"It is understandable that the countries recently admitted lag behind at this stage in terms of level of representation."
"However, there must be determination and clearly defined legislative texts to overcome this."
"I believe in your desire and determination, which you have expressed to us on numerous occasions, to work towards genuine, suitable geographical representation for the new service so that you can be the High Representative of the whole EU."
"We will follow its activity closely."
"I appreciate the fact that we managed to put some safeguards, in the form of amendments, into the report, which will guarantee that when it comes to filling positions in the European External Action Service, officials from certain Member States will not have an advantage over officials from other states."
"European Union foreign policy is, after all, only one specific area, and therefore, in addition to qualifications and broad geographical representation, a principle must apply according to which state officials from all Member States will be appropriately represented among the staff of the European External Action Service."
"I therefore think that it is very important that Parliament has proposed to delete provisions that allowed the transfer of officials from the Council or the Commission to the European External Action Service without competition for the vacancy."
"The European External Action Service works in collaboration with the diplomatic services of the Member States and is made up of officials from the relevant services of the General Secretariat of the Council and the Commission, as well as staff seconded from the national diplomatic services of the Member States."
"Thus, for the purposes of the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants, the EEAS should be treated as an EU institution."
"In view of this, EU officials and temporary agents from the diplomatic services of the Member States should have the same rights and obligations and be treated equally, particularly as regards the eligibility to assume all positions under equivalent conditions."
"The amendment provided for in this resolution is therefore necessary."
"I supported this report which was preceded by very serious debates, primarily as regards filling the posts of the European External Action Service."
"The principle of geographical balance was the main cause of these debates, a principle that - along with the priorities of institutional and gender balance - was eventually included in the report in a much attenuated form."
"The new Member States are undoubtedly not entirely satisfied, but it is nevertheless a good thing that a compromise has been reached, and we trust that in future, this may be revised to be even fairer."
"To this end, we must do everything possible to ensure that the diplomats designated by the individual Member States have comparable and high qualifications."
"We should be pleased, however, that we have taken an important step towards a unified and effective foreign representation of the EU, since given the current and future challenges, this is one of the most important aspects of EU policy."
"in writing. - We have adopted with a big majority the compromise package reflecting the Green position, to which our group has substantially contributed."
"in writing. - To those of us from the new Member States, the omission of any legally binding commitment to geographic balance in the European External Action Service is a disappointment."
"It is true that there have been several political statements promising that the interests of the new Member States will be taken into account."
"However positive a political commitment might be, the absence of a legal provision is regrettable."
"Without legal provision, it is hard to see how voters in the new Member States will feel that they own the service."
"This is why a number of us have had misgivings about giving our full support to the Rapkay report."
"We are coming to the end of the rather tumultuous work on the form to be taken by the European External Action Service, on which we are about to vote today."
"We have talked a lot about sustainable development in terms of gender and geography and a lot about transparency of recruitment based on pre-defined rules and regulations, but the most important issue is how good and effective the EEAS will be, which is why meritocratic criteria are so important when it comes to staff recruitment."
"I would like to stress the requirement, indeed the necessity, of ensuring that employees from the Directorates of the European Commission that are relevant in terms of subject matter, as well as from the Council and Parliament, participate in these services."
"The point is not the representation of European institutions, but the fact that these persons should have the right qualifications in various spheres of EU activities, such as complex aspects of energy, trade, agricultural and other issues, not to mention human rights or terrorism."
"I have concerns that most of the people involved in the EEAS will have general diplomatic skills, but no familiarity with the complex factual issues they will have to deal with."
"Abstaining from voting is not a solution."
"Those who are absent are always in the wrong."
"I think that in the resolution as a whole, there are many more good measures than those which are of less value."
"We need the European External Action Service."
"It should begin its work as soon as possible, to increase Europe's importance in the world."
"The resolution which has been adopted says that all Member States will be represented in the service."
"Now we have to take care that this does really happen."
"This creates confidence in the process of establishing the External Action Service."
"It should be remembered that it was on mutual trust that the European Union was built, and that Poland has greatly benefited from this."
"I am going to be watching the process very carefully."
"Only a year ago, introduction of the concept of geographical balance to the debate on the European External Action Service met with huge opposition, even from within the European Parliament."
"Today, no one at all is in any doubt that this is a problem and that it has to be solved."
"The commitment found in all the most important documents related to the EEAS to take steps to ensure equal representation of all the Member States of the European Union in the new Union diplomatic service is a success."
"The review planned for 2013 will allow us to judge if these steps have been taken."
"in writing. - The results of the vote on the Rapkay report show that a considerable number of MEPs from new Member States either abstained or voted against it."
"I was one of the MEPs who abstained."
"My main concern was the lack of ambition of its wording on the principle of geographical balance within the employment policy and staff of the future European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"The report failed to introduce a legally binding commitment to geographical balance in EEAS, thus relying only on political promises made by key EU decision makers on foreign affairs."
"This is why most new Member States do not feel reassured by the proper application of the principle of geographical balance in the future EEAS."
"It is regrettable that the rapporteur chose such a minimalist line, while the reluctance of the Council to explicitly accept this binding commitment raises even more concern."
"I am calling on the Council and the Commission to examine the voting result on this report closely and deliver on their promises of respecting the geographical balance principle while recruiting the future staff of the EEAS."
"It will be one of the MEPs' priorities to monitor this process closely in future."
"I voted in favour of the Parliament resolution as I agree that it is vital that the EU is able to use all of its external instruments within a coherent structure, and that the provision of budgetary resources in 2010 in order to establish this structure, in its initial phase, is the political purpose of this report."
"I voted against the report, which refers to the European External Action Service set up on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Financial and any other form of aid for this service is unacceptable because it deploys political and military resources for misguided actions under the Union's foreign policy, ultimately resulting in further militarisation of the European Union."
"At the same time, it moves Europe away from the independent and pacific role which it should play in settling international problems."
"This makes it part of the tension and a participating force in divisive, military interventions in war zones."
"It is becoming necessary to adapt the budgetary instruments to the new reality of the European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"However, I believe that efforts to ensure adequate funds for its capabilities and efficient and effective operation in line with what was intended, along with the effective monitoring of its costs, are broadly justified."
"In the early days of its effective existence, the European institutions and Member States should pay special attention to the EEAS so that they can properly monitor its activities and identify its main problems."
"This proposal for an amending budget comes under the realisation of the Treaty of Lisbon in order to facilitate the implementation and operation of the European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"I therefore support this initiative, and it is important to ensure that it is implemented within the principles of efficient management of European resources, while highlighting a good relationship between cost and benefit, along with the requirements of budgetary restraint, due to the impact of the economic crisis on public finances."
"Our vote against this report, which represents another step towards establishing and employing the European External Action Service (EEAS), is a position consistent with our opposition to the creation of this service."
"A central point of the Treaty of Lisbon and a fundamental element of federalism in the European Union, it will involve more than 5 000 people in the future 130 EU embassies in various countries."
"A diplomatic mega-structure that will inevitably subordinate the representatives and interests of the Member States, imposing on them, and here too, the interests of the powers that have been determining the course of the EU."
"Moreover, there is no guarantee that the EEAS will not be linked to military and intelligence structures."
"There is, therefore, the prospect of a worrying militarisation of the EU and of international relations, which we will fight vigorously."
"It should also be asked, as the EU's budget is extremely reduced, where will the contributions come from to cover this expenditure?"
"All this at a time when the effects of the crisis are getting worse, with the so-called 'austerity' policies putting enormous pressure on national budgets; when salaries and social security benefits are being cut, and taxes on income from work are being increased."
"Following the amendment to the Staff Regulations and an amendment to the Financial Regulation so that the creation of the European External Action Service is encompassed in those documents, it is now necessary to approve a budget for its proper functioning."
"Hence, for this service to function properly and achieve the objectives for which it was created, it must be given a budget that is sufficient to provide the human and material resources necessary for it to perform its activities well."
"I voted against this European Parliament legislative resolution, because creating the service that they want to finance represents another step towards the militarisation of the European Union's foreign policy."
"As well as my opposition to this militaristic foreign affairs philosophy, my reason for voting against it is that the most basic principles of transparency and democracy have been absent throughout the process of creating the European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"The organisation and financing of this service do not include the necessary strict control over staffing and financing by the European Parliament, meaning that the EEAS is worryingly lacking in democracy and transparency."
"It is therefore no surprise that the proposed structure for the EEAS relegates the European Parliament to a secondary, irrelevant position in EU foreign policy, which my group and I firmly reject."
"I have therefore voted against it."
"I cannot be in favour of the proposed budgets for this type of service with its militaristic tendencies."
"Consideration surely does need to be given to the precise form of the European External Action Service (EEAS) that is to be established."
"A system in which each of the 50 directors-general would initially have 30 and later a good 80 staff members would mean bloated and expensive administration."
"Similarly, the establishment of the EEAS is expected to bring with it a wave of promotions."
"A few issues have not yet been cleared up sufficiently."
"Possible effects on the building costs must be subject to prior scrutiny."
"Other factors, such as actually giving proper weight to German as a working language, as laid down in the treaties, have been ignored."
"For these reasons, I feel that, in its present form, the funding for the EEAS must be rejected."
"I voted in favour of the Parliament resolution as I agree that it is vital that the EU is able to use all of its external instruments within a coherent structure, and that the provision of budgetary resources in 2010 in order to establish this structure, in its initial phase, is the political purpose of this report."
"in writing. - The setting up of the European External Action Service (EEAS) necessitates an amendment of the 2010 budget and of the proposed 2011 budget."
"A new Section X has to be created in the budget and the 2010 budget has to be modified in order to provide 100 additional posts in the EEAS establishment plan and a financial envelope for financing an additional 70 contract staff."
"The bulk of resources necessary will simply be transferred from the sections of the European Council, Council and Commission."
"The prevailing feeling in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) is that the HR, Baroness Ashton, has not entirely lived up to the promises she made to the EP on the setting up of the EEAS."
"AFET considers that the EP should be consulted on staffing priorities within the service (e.g. when it comes to geographical balances) and that the issue of gender balance would be better addressed in the recruitment procedure for the EEAS."
"From a Green/EFA point of view, the fact that until now, Baroness Ashton has not transferred the Commission staff in DG RELEX dealing with peacebuilding and crisis response to the EEAS is considered a major shortcoming, especially as the HR has given messages of assurance to the EP on this transfer."
"We firmly oppose the creation of a European External Action Service."
"Foreign affairs and diplomacy come under national sovereignty, and that is why we voted against all the reports on this matter."
"A common foreign policy conducted in the sole interest of the European Union will necessarily find itself, sooner or later, in contradiction with the fundamental interests of one, several or all Member States."
"For instance, if there is a conflict where countries are asked to get involved, but their citizens are opposed."
"Or if a policy that is particularly hostile or particularly favourable towards a country or group of countries is promoted, going against the age-old traditions of some diplomatic services or the vital interests of some Members."
"Worse still: the treaties already stipulate that, whatever happens, all this will be subject to other commitments or constraints on an even greater, possibly global, scale: NATO, the UN, goodness knows what else."
"Therefore, it is not even a strong and independent diplomatic service that is being proposed here, but an instrument of submission to non-European leadership."
"Given that the annual allocation for financial assistance for monitoring measures in the banana sector amounted to EUR 75 million in 2010, where the major portion of this financial assistance stemmed from a reallocation of heading 4 of the budget, which equated to EUR 55.8 million, and that in 2011, this heading is only EUR 875 530, we agree with Parliament's proposal to invite the Commission to submit a new proposal to deploy the flexibility instrument for the remaining amount of EUR 74 124 470."
"This proposal is justified by the fact that there is a need for financial assistance for monitoring measures in the banana sector, particularly when we consider that EU financial assistance to ACP banana supplier countries affected by the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) liberalisation in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) must be ensured if the EU wishes to maintain its influence as a global player."
"We should also mention that it makes complete sense to implement this proposal, given that these measures are provided for in point 27 of the interinstitutional agreement on the use of the flexibility instrument."
"I voted in favour of the resolution as I agree that EU financial assistance to ACP banana supplier countries affected by the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) liberalisation in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) should not be questioned, and that the budgetary effort is not held up."
"I therefore agree with the Commission proposal to amend Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1905/2006 in order to allow the financing of Bananas Accompanying Measures (BAM) over the years 2010 to 2013, with an overall budget of EUR 190 million, with a potential supplementary EUR 10 million, if margins allow."
"The banana sector is a vital sector for some EU regions, especially the French overseas départements and territories; that is why, faced with competition from Latin American countries exacerbated by agreements under negotiation, Parliament has adopted funding measures aimed at helping this weakened sector."
"MEPs would like to see the flexibility instrument mobilised to the tune of EUR 74.12 million."
"This is a strong signal from Parliament to the Commission and the Council, which only made provision for 18.3 million."
"Similarly, it is an opportunity for Parliament to point out that it is time to stop dipping into the budget for EU external action to finance the Banana Accompanying Measures."
"The EUR 190 million in aid promised for the 2010-2013 period shall have to be financed by new funds, which is what Parliament will demand during the new financial perspective."
"The Commission is proposing an amendment to Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1905/2006 in order to finance Bananas Accompanying Measures (BAM) over the years 2010 to 2013, with an overall budget of EUR 190 million."
"The proposed annual breakdown provides an amount of EUR 75 million in 2010."
"It is worth noting that the margin available under heading 4 is only EUR 875 530."
"The most important part of this financial assistance in 2010 comes from a reallocation within heading 4 of the budget, namely EUR 55.8 million from a total of EUR 75 million, which affects instruments and actions that the EU, and Parliament in particular, deem to be of major interest."
"In addition, the need for financial assistance linked to accompanying measures for the bananas sector was not provided for in adopting the multiannual financial framework (MFF) in force."
"However, EU financial assistance to ACP banana-supplying countries affected by the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) liberalisation in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) should not be questioned, and the fiscal effort should not be held up."
"I therefore agree with the change to the draft amending budget No 3/2010, as proposed by the rapporteur."
"The report aims to establish the measures necessary for financial assistance to countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) that will be affected by the liberalisation of the banana trade between the EU and 11 Latin American countries, under which the EU is committed to not applying quantitative restrictions or equivalent measures on banana imports to its territory."
"When the Geneva Agreement was signed, which provides for this liberalisation, the EU committed to channelling EUR 200 million to ACP countries by way of compensation for the impact that this measure would have on their exports to the EU."
"We criticised this agreement at the time, as it will mainly benefit the US multinationals that dominate the global market in the sector."
"Several ACP countries, as well as several banana producers in those countries, expressed their concern about the agreement's consequences, believing that the sum of EUR 200 million will not offset all its effects."
"Now, the report provides for 'an overall budget of EUR 190 million, with a potential supplementary EUR 10 million, if margins allow'."
"Furthermore, there were no proper warnings of the impact on the banana-producing countries and regions of the EU, such as the Autonomous Region of Madeira."
"For these reasons, we abstained from the vote on the report."
"The European Parliament proposal for a resolution on Council's position on Draft amending budget No 3/2010 of the European Union for the financial year 2010, Section III - Commission, allocates new resources to finance the Banana Accompanying Measures for ACP (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific) countries."
"The Commission proposal, made in fact without the involvement of any branch of the budget authority, provides for an appropriation of EUR 75 million to be entered into the reserve pending the adoption of the relevant amending regulation."
"I am bound to point out that Parliament and Council have failed to reach an agreement over this matter."
"Parliament had, in fact, considered using the flexibility instrument, which has proved excellent for dealing with similar situations, because the funds in question are ready for mobilisation and have a legal foundation."
"Council, on the other hand, had a different idea, due to the reluctance of Member States to use the flexibility instrument, which led to an increase in their contributions as a consequence For these very reasons, the Committee on Budgets acknowledged the impossibility of reaching an agreement over the 2010 budget."
"The EU has always focused on helping developing countries, particularly the ACP countries."
"The specific case that is being handled in this amending budget proposal is that of the ACP banana-producing countries."
"This special aid takes the form of the liberalisation of the banana trade between the EU and 11 Latin American banana-producing countries."
"This kind of aid is, in our opinion, better and more effective than direct aid whereby funds are applied without discretion."
"By helping the banana sector in these countries, we are helping them develop their economy, create jobs and fight poverty."
"The thinking is that, in order to overcome the economic crisis, as much money as possible should be made available to fund the EU's priorities for 2010."
"This was made possible by reallocating budget funds."
"Financial support for accompanying measures for the banana sector were not envisaged when the current multiannual financial framework was being drawn up."
"To cushion trade liberalisation at the WTO level and the associated reduction in most favoured nation status tariffs, we are told that EU financial support for ACP countries that supply bananas is now to be maintained."
"Especially in times in which the EU itself is wrestling with the economic crisis, this kind of utilisation of the flexibility instrument must be rejected."
"in writing. - Due to changing trade arrangements, notably the liberalisation of trade within the WTO, the reduction of the preferential margin for ACP banana-exporting countries has had a negative impact."
"The European Commission proposes therefore to support the main ACP banana-exporting countries by establishing Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM) with a budget of EUR 190 million over 4 years (2010-2013)."
"The objective of this assistance is to help ACP banana exporters to launch adjustment programmes."
"Although the banana question is a long-standing issue, financing the BAM remains problematic."
"The Commission and the Council did not integrate it into Heading 4 of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for 2007-2013, and the Committee on Development considers that the proposal is not compatible with the ceiling for Heading 4 of the MFF and asks the Commission to make substantial amendments or replace it with another text."
"I am pleased with the 2011 draft budget, which is being discussed today, as it dwells precisely on the stated priorities."
"For the first time, Parliament is on an equal footing with the Council on these matters."
"This is the first budget following the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For this reason, and due to the crisis that Europe is experiencing, it is important that the reconciliation process is successful."
"It is vital that the EU is given a budget for the implementation of priority areas and the new powers that were bestowed upon it by the treaty."
"It is important to fight for our convictions and for a budget that is visionary in a time of crisis."
"Parliament's proposal reflects this ambition."
"On the other hand, the values proposed by the Council mirror the austerity of budgets adopted at a national level within the EU."
"The EU, however, must have the ability to react to policy changes caused by major challenges."
"The EU has a duty to present an ambitious European budget which can assist economic recovery."
"Only by strengthening areas such as science and innovation, and by contributing to economic growth and to more and better jobs, can we make Europe a more attractive place to live and work."
"We, the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament, have voted in favour of Amendments 700, 701 and 706 to the budget."
"We have done so, even though the comments contain a passage stating that the EU should move towards a low carbon economy."
"We are well aware that the supporters of nuclear power are attempting to use this term to conceal the fact that they are really talking about an economy in which nuclear power plays a prominent role as a source of energy."
"We would like to stress that we believe it to be a very bad idea to spend EU resources on nuclear power, and it is with this proviso that we voted in favour of the amendment."
"In the vote on the EU's 2011 budget, the Danish Liberal Party voted against a number of amendments relating to the removal of money for export refunds."
"The expenditure for export refunds is determined by law and will therefore be paid regardless of what amount is specified in the budget."
"However, if the expenditure is not specified in the EU budget it will have to be paid out by the individual Member States."
"At a time when the national budgets are being cut back, it would be economically irresponsible to burden the Member States with this significant additional expenditure."
"The Danish Liberal Party is pleased about the considerable reduction in the EU's export subsidies in recent years and will continue to work to bring about a change in the underlying legislation so that the phase-out can continue."
"The Danish Liberal Party also voted against a statement that prevents the payment of a special male bovine premium for bulls used for bullfighting."
"The reason why the Danish Liberal Party voted against this proposal is that this premium is only paid in Denmark, Sweden and Slovenia, where, as we know, bullfighting does not happen."
"Finally, the Danish Liberal Party voted against allocating DKK 300 million to a European dairy fund."
"Dairy prices have risen over the last year and, against that background, the Commission has concluded that, under the current rules, it will not be possible for money to be paid out from such a fund."
"I voted in favour of the amendment on the budget which places a portion of the 2011 budget for the European Police College (CEPOL) in reserve."
"I welcome the vote in plenary which, with 611 votes for, 38 against and 6 abstentions, strengthens Parliament's position on CEPOL."
"Indeed, Parliament will release the appropriations set aside if it receives satisfactory information from the agency on the follow-up to the 2008 discharge."
"These requirements are clear: inform Parliament of the results of the OLAF inquiry; publish the list of members of the Governing Board; provide a final external auditor's report on the appropriations used to finance private expenditure; and ensure that changes are made within the Governing Board in order to avoid a repeat of this situation in the future."
"I very much hope that CEPOL will react swiftly and provide evidence of its willingness to cooperate fully with Parliament."
"A strong and modern Europe needs a future- and growth-oriented budget, while, at the same time, the economic situation demands reflection and restraint."
"We have therefore chosen to keep to a budget-restrictive line with the focus on broad investments in research, development and innovation that create growth and jobs in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Since we want to see a Europe that is sustainable from the point of view of the economy, social matters and the climate, we voted in favour of investments in the environment and in human capital and control of the financial markets, but always within the bounds of existing resources."
"An unjustifiably large proportion of the budget is still utilised for the EU's agricultural policy, and tomorrow's challenges will not be met by applying yesterday's policy."
"We therefore voted against the proposed dairy fund of EUR 300 million and our own proposal to abolish the EU's export subsidies for agricultural products, for example, as well as subsidies for tobacco cultivation."
"Since everyone has to do their bit in these difficult economic times, we also voted in favour of reducing the EU's administration costs."
"In view of the fragile recovery of the euro area and the weak public finances in many Member States, if the budget is used wisely, it can stimulate economic recovery, but it is necessary to know how to make the most of it."
"With regard to citizens, it is worth noting the increase within the Competitiveness for growth and employment heading and the 'Cohesion for growth and employment' heading, although there is a reduction for education and training."
"There is a notable increase in the European Social Fund (ESF), but it is regrettable that only 1.4% of the funds are earmarked for the implementation of social policy, in which health sees a reduction of EUR 15.77 million in relation to 2010."
"In the field of regional development, there is an increase of about 3.2%, which is considered essential."
"Regarding agriculture, it is worth noting the extreme volatility of the dairy sector, highlighting the need for a permanent approach to address this issue, namely, through a fund for the dairy sector."
"With regard to fisheries, there is a regrettable reduction in the allocations to the common fisheries policy (CFP)."
"The EU budget for 2011 is designed to underpin the profitability of big business and the savage attack by the monopolies and bourgeois governments on workers' labour and social rights."
"It provides even more hot money, subsidies and facilities to monopoly groups, in addition to the 5 trillion or so already given to them by national bourgeois governments, in order to bolster their position in the inexorable competition between the imperialists, with a clear view to reviving the capitalist system."
"Its basic approach is, on the one hand, to give out money to capital and, on the other, to slash any - already paltry - spending on workers, small commercial and handicraft enterprises, poor medium-sized farm holdings and young people, and to provide even more money for imperialist intervention by the EU and for the mechanisms which it uses to repress and persecute the people."
"The first budget approved by the European Parliament, with its allegedly enhanced powers under the Treaty of Lisbon, is worthy of its reactionary nature."
"It proves once again that the European Parliament is faithfully serving the needs and interests of the monopolies and is deeply hostile to the workers and grassroots needs."
"The working and grassroots class movement needs to step up its fight, so that the workers do not pay the price for the capitalist crisis."
"There has been increasing volatility in international dairy markets in recent years."
"The EUR 300 million of exceptional funding given to the dairy sector in the 2010 budget was especially beneficial for dairy farmers, who were suffering greatly because of the crisis."
"We voted in favour of a new budget line, so that there would be a dairy fund to support innovation, diversification and restructuring and to increase the bargaining capacity of dairy farmers in order that imbalances in the food supply chain could be addressed."
"In addition, we welcome what the report says on the support being given to the School Milk Scheme, and the Commission's proposal in relation to increasing the funding of this scheme and the funding of the School Fruit Scheme."
"The aim of the common agricultural policy is to ensure the security of the food supply, to protect the environment and biodiversity, and ensure a proper income for farmers."
"In this regard, we welcome what the report says about asking the Commission to include a cash buffer in the 2011 budget lest there be increased market volatility in 2011, to reduce red tape, and to improve and clarify access to funding."
"I agree with my fellow Members who do not support the budget reductions proposed by the Council."
"The best argument against this is the situation of the Member States which have proceeded with this action domestically."
"I am referring in particular to Romania."
"The pressure exerted on consumption by restricting it has not brought us out of the crisis, but has actually created unprecedented social pressure."
"I agree then with the EUR 300 million increase in the milk fund."
"I have adopted the same stance in support of additional financial allocations for this product throughout the entire period of the European crisis."
"I strongly support the idea of the European stabilisation mechanism and the need for the two new budgetary lines created to be specific, with figures provided and not blank, as is the case now, so that this European intervention instrument can become a reality rather than just a theory."
"I hope that Parliament's viewpoint will be respected during the conciliation, that an agreement will be reached with the Council and that we will be able to vote 'yes' in November to the 2011 EU budget."
"The European Parliament, for the first time in its history, has discussed the draft general budget of the European Union for 2011 according to the new rules under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"A number of changes that Parliament's plenary has made clearly show that the degree of control and the democratic functioning of the European Union has increased."
"With regard to the improvement of democratic procedures, but also with regard to the structure of the budget, I supported this proposal."
"I voted in favour of the Parliament resolution as I agree with Parliament's horizontal priorities for 2011 in the areas of youth, education and mobility, which require, under the various policies, specific cross-sector investment as a means of promoting growth and development in the EU."
"I agree with the proposed increase in funding for all programmes related to these priorities, namely the Lifelong Learning, PESSOA and Erasmus Mundus programmes."
"I also agree that the mobility of youth employment is an essential tool for ensuring the development of a competitive and dynamic labour market in Europe, and as such, it needs to be strengthened."
"I welcome the increase in funding for the European Employment Service and therefore strongly support the launch of the preparatory action 'Your First Job Abroad', which aims to help young people enter the labour market or gain access to skilled jobs in another Member State as a first step towards a specific non-academic programme for the mobility of young people."
"This budget does not measure up to what the European Union needs for it to come out of the recession, bring about recovery and face up to its responsibilities in terms of solidarity."
"In this respect, I regret the fact that the proposal by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament for creating a line of 'own resources' funded by a tax on financial transactions was quite simply rejected by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"This inconsistency between what the right says and does is outrageous given that they have been saying for months to citizens and to the media that they support such a tax."
"However, when it comes to voting, and when the European Parliament has the power to make it happen, these are the very people who want to see this proposal buried."
"While the EU is expanding, and more and more powers are being entrusted to it, the resources at its disposal are dwindling."
"This is a bad signal for the recovery of growth and employment in Europe, in general, and for European citizens, in particular."
"We would like the EU's priorities for the budget to be focused more on the future, increased competitiveness, investments in infrastructure and research, rather than propping up agricultural policy."
"We have today adhered to our priorities by voting for legal certainty, increased appropriations for research and more money for climate measures, but also for a reduction in appropriations for agricultural subsidies, export subsidies, tobacco cultivation and dairy funds."
"Even though it did not contain all of the priorities that we would have liked to have seen, we have, of course, voted in favour of the EU budget for 2011."
"We have just adopted the 2011 budget that the European Parliament wanted."
"This vote has enabled us to reaffirm our priorities towards the poorest, for whom a EUR 100 million package has been requested, and also towards dairy producers for whom we would like to see the milk fund continue."
"Struggling businesses should also carry on receiving support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund which should be permanent and have its own budget."
"Finally, we would like to see the European budget be given its own resources and a tax on financial transactions finally introduced."
"At a time when States, local communities, taxpayers and businesses are accepting financial sacrifices, the Union cannot exempt itself from this virtuous process."
"Disproportionate increases in the Union budget, which some wish to see, are not acceptable."
"That does not mean that the time has come to cut strategically essential expenditure, such as the common agricultural policy, thanks to which we enjoy independence in terms of foodstuffs and benefit from a source of exports (and hence of earnings)."
"On the other hand, this would be a good time to question the contribution derogations enjoyed by certain States for historical reasons, and which have no grounds to exist today."
"The idea of a European tax cannot be contemplated in the present context: the fiscal pressure bearing on Member States should be reduced first."
"The European Parliament has spoken on the draft legislative resolution on the Council's position on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2011."
"The European Parliament's examination of the general budget of the European Union has always provided an opportunity to see more clearly how this Union's powers have been extended over the years and, vice versa, how the Member States' sovereignty has been lost."
"This report lays open the fiscal pressure that will be brought to bear on taxpayers."
"Even though citizens' disillusionment with the European Union is clear, the latter is still increasing its budget by 6% to finance policies that it has arrogated to itself."
"Why this increase, when 10% to 15% of resources remain unused and the Commission is demanding restraint in all Member States?"
"in writing. - I believe any proposal to increase the EU budget to be unacceptable, on the basis that I cannot justify to my constituents increasing EU spending by nearly 6% in 2011."
"Today, the UK Chancellor is outlining drastic public sector cuts - cuts that the EU have urged Member States to make."
"Yet, at the same time, the same EU deems it appropriate that the budget of this place increases by 6%."
"Do as I say, not as I do, seems to be official EU policy."
"I find that unacceptable."
"I could not look my constituents in the eye, some who will undoubtedly lose their jobs as a result of cuts in UK spending, and say that MEPs spent even more of their money wisely - and remember it is their money - by boosting the coffers of the EEAS, Europol and regulation of financial services."
"And I certainly could not justify increasing the entertainment budget of this place either."
"That is why I voted against this budget."
"It is for others to justify why they endorsed it."
"A strong and modern Europe needs a future- and growth-oriented budget while, at the same time, the economic situation demands reflection and restraint."
"I have therefore chosen to keep to a budget-restrictive line and have focused on broad investments in research, development and innovation that create growth and jobs in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Since I want to see a Europe that is sustainable from the point of view of the economy, social matters and the climate, I therefore voted in favour of investments in the environment, in individuals and in control of the financial markets, but always within the bounds of existing resources."
"A large proportion of the budget goes to the EU's agricultural policy."
"Unfortunately, the current structure of the common agricultural policy is rarely focused on meeting the challenges of the future."
"Thriving rural areas are very important."
"However, continuing with export subsidies and subsidies for tobacco cultivation are not the right way to go."
"What we need instead are reasonable conditions for food production in Europe, decent animal protection and incentives for farmers to produce green energy."
"Since everyone has to do their bit in these difficult economic times, I also voted in favour of reducing the EU's administration costs."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the draft EU budget for 2011."
"It is a restrained budget, but it also contains necessary investments in research, energy and initiatives for young people, and it enables the establishment of the EU's new External Action Service and new authorities for financial supervision."
"However, it is also a budget in which many of the EU's new priorities lack reasonable financing, for example, the EU's new strategy for growth and employment (EU 2020), climate policy and the EU's foreign policy and aid policy, particularly the aid for Palestine."
"In order to keep the budget down, we proposed more cuts in the EU's agricultural aid, but this was rejected in the vote."
"We also voted for an examination of the system of the EU's own resources, including a tax on financial transactions."
"Irrespective of the form that a new system for the EU's revenue might take, it must be budget neutral and respect the Member States' competence in the sphere of taxation."
"With regard to Parliament's own budget, we believe that those committees that are gaining a heavier workload as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon need to be strengthened."
"This justifies an increase in staff for Parliament's and the groups' secretariats."
"However, we do not believe that MEPs need more staff."
"Parliament has now decided to maintain the appropriations for an increase in the assistants allowance in reserve, and this should not be released unless all conditions are met."
"We would have preferred to have seen Parliament's resources being increased by means of redistributions and measures to increase efficiency, rather than increasing the total budget."
"The EU budget is vital for the development of EU activities, and, especially in times of crisis, for the effective allocation of funds relating to cohesion policy."
"I believe that the Council should not reduce these funds arbitrarily, as observed for priorities such as funds allocated to innovation, and for objectives of growth and competitiveness."
"The Council has cut commitment appropriations by 0.55% and payment appropriations by 2.77%, approving a final budget of EUR 141.8 billion for commitment appropriations and EUR 126.5 billion for payment appropriations, which may be especially critical if it impacts on European growth and competitiveness."
"I therefore support Parliament's maintaining of the initial funding allocated to these areas."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non-compulsory expenditure has been suppressed, which means that Parliament and the Council are becoming jointly responsible for all EU spending, and that they decide upon it together."
"In addition, the annual budgetary process is becoming a special legislative procedure with the budget approved through a regulation, which is liable to be seen as a special codecision procedure or, to avoid confusion, as a joint decision by Parliament and the Council."
"The 2011 budget which Parliament is proposing is ambitious, intelligent and respects the commitments which it has taken on in a rigorous and realistic way."
"We are making a priority of policies concerning young people, education, mobility, training, research, competitiveness and innovation."
"I would like to emphasise the preparatory action in which I was personally involved: 'Your First Job Abroad'."
"This will boost the mobility of young people in the EU and help to combat unemployment."
"This EU budget continues to amount to about 1% of gross national income."
"This clearly demonstrates the need to revise the multiannual financial framework, given the tight margins for its headings, and particularly for headings 1A, 3B and 4."
"It is also clear that a debate urgently needs to take place on the necessity of new resources for the Union budget."
"We agree with the criticisms made of the arbitrary cuts and reductions effected by the Council on the draft budget, leaving it almost EUR 7 billion lower in 2011 than was agreed in the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2007-2013."
"This is all the more unacceptable as the sum agreed in the MFF is already an extremely small amount, which compromises any economic and social cohesion right from the start."
"Hence, it accentuates the damaging effects of the policies that the EU has been pursuing."
"We are, therefore, also of the opinion that a substantial reassessment of the budget is absolutely necessary, along with an immediate review of the maximum limits of the current MFF."
"However, this criticism cannot lead us to accept the intention of 'lisbonising' the budget that is mentioned in the report which would keep it subservient to the Treaty of Lisbon's fundamental pillars: neoliberalism, federalism and militarism."
"In other words, essentially keeping it subservient to the same policies that caused the profound crisis that the workers and peoples of Europe are currently facing."
"What is needed - starting with the necessary reinforcement of the Union budget, based on contributions from the Member States in proportion to their gross national income - is a break with these policies and a genuine commitment to cohesion, social progress and environmental conservation."
"The Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December last year."
"It confers new powers on the European Union: hence, new opportunities for spending money."
"No one or hardly anyone here has the decency to highlight that there is something scandalous about asking for an increase in resources allocated to the European Union or the creation of a new tax when Member States are being ordered to practise austerity and to slash their social protection."
"In France, Europe has an enormous direct cost: EUR 8 billion per year, a figure that is increasing all the time."
"In other words, it accounts for a major part of the social security deficit, for example."
"The indirect cost is even greater, in terms of unemployment, weak growth, relocations, and so on, linked to European policies. The European budget is not complementary to national budgets; it competes with and raids them."
"With structural policy cofinancing systems, which are nothing other than a sprinkling of patronage, it is also an incitement to spending."
"An aggravating circumstance is this: for 15 years, the European Court of Auditors has been unable to approve the management by the Commission of these tens of billions of euro."
"I believe it is time to have done with all this."
"I supported the European Parliament resolution on the draft general budget of the EU for 2011."
"If we want to be able to take on the political priorities of the European Union, the new expenditure made necessary by the economic crisis and the new powers conferred by the Treaty of Lisbon, we must support an ambitious draft budget, capable of delivering the investments required for more jobs and a return to sustainable growth, or, in other words, a budget that lives up to the Europe that we want."
"The Council would like to reduce the Union's budget, because Member States are facing substantial deficits."
"That is why we have introduced a new budget heading for the Union's own resources, so that the budget does not depend so much on national contributions."
"We deplore the fact that the amendment calling for the establishment of a tax on financial transactions has once more been rejected by the right."
"I support the European Parliament's proposals for the draft 2011 budget."
"The important political areas and the individual opinions have been taken into account in the report."
"Parliament acknowledges that in future, the European Union cannot manage to fulfil its extensive and varied tasks with fewer financial resources."
"That applies, above all, to agriculture."
"The Opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the 2011 budget already expressed the concern that, in the planning and utilisation of unused resources, the Commission's assumptions are too optimistic."
"Large-scale European research projects are financially coupled to recoveries, the amount of which no one knows in advance."
"The Commission is called on to ensure the long-term financing of research and development in future and to draw up precise financing plans."
"Financial recoveries from the agricultural pot should be used for their original purpose."
"I voted for this report as the European Parliament identifies the most important priorities in its policies in the areas of young people, education and mobility."
"I, too, have maintained on a number of occasions that they are vital and necessary components of the EU economic recovery strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Young people, education and mobility require specific cross-sector investments within the suitable policies in order to promote the EU's growth and development."
"I therefore support the need to increase the loans for all the programmes relating to these priorities, such as 'Lifelong learning', the 'People' programme and Erasmus Mundus."
"It is also just as important to increase the loans for the European network of employment services."
"To this end, I support the launch of the preparatory action 'Your first EURES Job', which aims to help young people enter the job market or access specialised jobs in another Member State, as a first step towards a specific non-academic youth mobility programme."
"in writing. - On individual votes, I voted against provisions which I believe have negative consequences for EU citizens and people in developing countries."
"This includes EU funding for tobacco production, as well as EU agricultural export subsidies which harm developing countries."
"I also voted against increases in budget lines relating to expenses, travel and administrative costs."
"However, I welcome the positive elements of the Parliament's first reading, including funding for economic development in our regions, support for crucial research and development and increased overseas aid in line with the UK's target to increase development assistance."
"I believe the EU budget is needed to provide long-term stability against the severe austerity measures which are being introduced by national governments in Europe."
"While national governments implement drastic cuts, in some cases, with a short-term vision, the EU budget can provide stability and long-term planning to help - through funds such as the structural funds and cohesion funds - create jobs, provide job training and boost European economies through the recovery, particularly by providing structural funds to deprived areas hit the hardest."
"For the first time since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the European budget has been adopted on a single reading."
"This is also the first time that Parliament has exercised greater decision making impact than Council."
"This increased power must, however, be accompanied by a high sense of responsibility and realism imposed by the persistent economic crisis."
"In this regard, the Committee on Budgets has sent out a clear signal by opting to respect the margins imposed by the current financial situation and implementing a tough policy based on priorities to encourage growth with the emphasis on research, innovation and young people."
"I welcome this Chamber's decision to follow the guidelines of the Committee on Budgets and the Member States, which are often forced into debt following excessive EU cash advances."
"The Union Budget must nevertheless be reconsidered in the light of the new powers arising from the Treaty of Lisbon and the need for own resources."
"These matters require firmness during conciliation in order to provide adequate financial support to such an ambitious project as the EU 2020 strategy."
"The entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) has strengthened EU policies and created new areas of competence - notably, the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), competitiveness and innovation, space, tourism, the fight against climate change, social policy, energy policy, justice and internal affairs."
"These new powers presuppose a budget that will allow them to be put into practice and thus require all bodies with budgetary authority to be coherent and consistent with respect to their increased financial powers."
"We therefore have to provide the Community budget with the necessary funds to make it able to achieve the objectives outlined for 2014, so that the Europe 2020 strategy is not compromised."
"Of course, in this situation of crisis, the Member States are putting up some resistance to the increase in contributions, but they must acknowledge the intentions of the EU and the need not to jeopardise everything that has been achieved in terms of cohesion and integration."
"One of the things that the Treaty of Lisbon changed was the financial structures of the EU, in particular, the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the annual budgetary procedure."
"The treaty gives the MFF binding legal status and states that it is to be laid down by the Council, acting unanimously after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament."
"There is no longer a distinction to be made between mandatory and non-mandatory expenditure, for decisions on which both budgetary authorities are now jointly responsible, with the process being simplified accordingly."
"The fact that Parliament now has the right of codecision on the entire budget reinforces democratic control."
"Some further steps to simplify the bureaucracy are also envisaged."
"It is important that the European Parliament, as the EU's only directly elected institution, has its budgetary rights strengthened so that it can influence important EU decisions such as the demand for cost savings in the new External Action Service."
"However, I cannot support tendencies to centralise."
"I voted in favour of the draft budget because I approve of its general position and its contents."
"I agree with the re-established ceilings in relation to the cuts made by the Council."
"I believe that this vote is extremely important and I applaud the position expressed by Parliament, which really makes use of the new prerogatives."
"Indeed, thanks to the new budget procedure brought in by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament can assert its importance and its powers in relation to the Council, defending a strong and ambitious budget, which, at the same time, is tough, in awareness of the fact that in order to relaunch the economy of the European Union - sorely tested by the recent economic and financial crisis - important investments in key sectors such as research and technological innovation are required."
"The initial draft budget tabled before the Committee on Culture and Education by the Committee on Budgets fell short in that it failed to adopt ambitious measures to achieve the primary targets of the EU 2020 strategy in education, training and mobility."
"To be precise, the competent committee initially adopted the position of the Commission and the Council and proposed a freeze on appropriations for lifelong learning, education and young entrepreneurship programmes."
"However, it is comforting that, in the wake of the opposition and concerns expressed by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education on the downgrading of policies on education and training, especially at a time when unemployment is on the rise and is causing problems in numerous Member States of the European Union, the Committee on Budgets tabled the necessary amendments, which I supported, and increased the initial planned appropriations (for example, in the case of Article 150202 on lifelong learning programmes)."
"I voted in favour of the Parliament resolution as I agree with Parliament's horizontal priorities for 2011, especially in the areas of youth, education and mobility, which require, under the various policies, specific investment between sectors as a means of promoting growth and development for the EU."
"I agree with the proposed increase in funding for all programmes related to these priorities, namely, the Lifelong Learning, PESSOA and Erasmus Mundus programmes."
"I also believe that the mobility of youth employment is an essential tool for ensuring the development of a competitive and dynamic labour market in Europe, and that as such, it needs to be strengthened."
"I therefore welcome the increase in funding for the European Employment Service and strongly support the launch of the preparatory action 'Your First Job Abroad', which aims to help young people enter the labour market or gain access to skilled jobs in another Member State, as a first step towards a specific non-academic programme for the mobility of young people."
"EUR 142 650 billion - that is the budget for the financial year 2011, adopted by the European Parliament at midday today."
"A tight budget, which is virtually identical to that proposed by the European Commission and adopted against a background of austerity."
"However, we all know that Europe cannot do more and better with less money."
"That is why I, along with several other Members and also the Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget, Mr Lewandowski, am entering a plea for the European Union to award itself its own resources."
"A financial mechanism that would guarantee autonomy and room for manoeuvre with regard to the Member States which, crisis situation or no, have long since abandoned the idea of giving Europe the means for its ambitions. I see at least two reasons for not cutting back on the European budget."
"The first derives from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the new powers for Europe in the fields of foreign policy, energy, financial supervision, to mention only a few."
"The second relates to the new 2020 strategy, which is intended to put Europe back on the track to sustainable growth, major projects and innovation."
"New challenges and powers which will need to be well funded."
"This leads us back to the one and only solution - direct financing of the European Union."
"in writing. - This year's budget debate again underlines the need to agree a meaningful system of own resources for the EU."
"The annual squabbling over the budgets between the European institutions leads to chaotic decision making and creates an acrimonious diversion, which could be so easily avoided through an own resources system, such as allocating part of the revenue from an EU financial transaction tax, a tax on aviation fuel or a carbon tax to fund the EU budget."
"Despite this, today's vote broadly strikes a balance between responding to the extra demands created by the Lisbon Treaty, whilst limiting the growth in the EU budgets, in response to current budgetary difficulties."
"I have chosen to abstain in respect of the decision regarding Parliament's draft budget."
"The enhancement of the Daphne programme dealing with violence against women is gratifying."
"I am also pleased that Parliament is rejecting the Commission's and the Council's proposal for cuts in financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority."
"However, I would also like to point out that I think that Parliament is acting irresponsibly by granting the EU system and itself such large sums in the form of programmes and subsidies and aid for bureaucracy, while the Member States are being forced into making brutal cuts in order to meet the requirements of the Stability Pact - in other words, the neoliberal pact that the majority of Parliament wholeheartedly supports."
"The main winner is agriculture, particularly the establishment of a dairy fund of EUR 300 million."
"This decision will be embarrassingly difficult for us MEPs to explain to those struggling people who are demonstrating in one country after the next."
"Why should they suffer while the EU system's budget expenditure is completely unaffected by reality?"
"This is the first EU budget that has been voted upon in accordance with the rules of the Treaty of Lisbon at the very first reading."
"Although some sensitive points still remain for conciliation which deal with issues that I consider to be of the utmost importance, such as an allocation for cohesion and agriculture, I welcome this proposal."
"The approved document restores the Commission's initial proposal relating to the section on cohesion for growth and employment after the Council had reduced the amount allocated."
"Although the amount for 2011 is already set out in the multiannual financial framework (MFF) with an upper limit of EUR 50.65 billion at current prices, it is worth noting that the rapporteur states that this heading will require a higher level of payments."
"I also welcome the allocations in the competitiveness section for growth and employment, which includes provision for funding for most of Parliament's proposals, such as those relating to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and programmes for young people, education and mobility."
"I am voting in favour of this document, although it does not include the proposals made by the European People's Party (EPP) on intervention measures on the storage of cereals, milk and dairy products and powdered milk, which were unfortunately rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI)."
"Abstaining from voting is not a solution."
"Those who are absent are always in the wrong."
"I think that in the resolution as a whole, there are many more good measures than those which are of less value."
"We need the European External Action Service."
"It should begin its work as soon as possible, to increase Europe's importance in the world."
"The resolution which has been adopted says that all Member States will be represented in the service."
"Now we have to take care that this does really happen."
"This creates confidence in the process of establishing the External Action Service."
"It should be remembered that it was on mutual trust that the European Union was built, and that Poland has greatly benefited from this."
"I am going to be watching the process very carefully."
"in writing. - I welcome the positive elements of the 2011 budget, which include funding for economic development in Wales, support for research and development, and overseas aid."
"I recognise that extra expenditure resulting from the European External Action Service and new European supervisory authorities is required and is supported by all Member States, including the UK, in the Council."
"However, I am concerned about expenditure in a number of areas that do not reflect value for money or have negative consequences for EU citizens and people in developing countries."
"This includes EU funding for alcohol and tobacco production, which conflicts with the EU's health objectives, and EU agricultural export subsidies, which harm developing countries, as well as increases in budget lines relating to expenses, travel, publications and other administrative costs."
"In the current economic environment, it is more important than ever to justify expenditure on our priorities by tackling all wasteful and excessive spending in other sectors."
"I did not feel able to oppose this budget."
"During challenging economic times, voting against vital funding for a wide range of priorities would be counterproductive."
"However, I also believe that some increases were not justified and therefore I took the decision to abstain."
"The key points in the EU budget for 2011 are investment in training, research and innovation - a necessity given the current situation on the labour market."
"The reduction in current unemployment in Europe needs to be at the heart of every decision - including when it comes to actually implementing the ambitious Europe 2020 targets."
"Prioritising youth in connection with the training and mobility programmes is a very worthwhile investment, with good opportunities for development for the labour market."
"There are some increases, but also cuts - the budget is a compromise, like every multi-party decision."
"Redirecting money into nuclear research, however, cannot be in the interests of the people of Europe and this money would be better spent, for example, on renewable energy sources."
"in writing. - The EPLP welcomes the positive elements in the Parliament's first reading position, including funding for economic development in our regions, support for crucial research and development and increased overseas aid in line with the UK's target to increase total overseas development assistance."
"We also recognise that extra expenditure resulting from the European External Action Service and the new European supervisory authorities is essential to implement these important new activities, and is supported by all Member States, including the UK, in the Council."
"However, we are deeply concerned about expenditure in a number of areas that do not reflect value for money or have negative consequences for EU citizens and people in developing countries."
"This includes EU funding for alcohol and tobacco production, which conflicts with the EU's health objectives, and EU agricultural export subsidies which harm developing countries, as well as increases in budget lines relating to expenses, travel, publications and other administrative costs."
"In the current economic environment, it is more important than ever to justify expenditure on our priorities by tackling all wasteful and excessive spending in other sectors."
"The EPLP voted against the final budget resolution at this stage, to send a clear message ahead of negotiations between the institutions."
"I have great pleasure in congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Jędrzejewska, on her excellently prepared report."
"Today, for the first time, we have adopted an EU budget under the provision set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and, also for the first time, we have not exceeded the financial limits set out in the current financial perspective."
"I believe that the solutions proposed by Mrs Jędrzejewska express a realistic and pragmatic approach at a difficult time of economic crisis."
"I am also pleased to note that the budget adopted today strengthens Parliament's priorities in financial terms."
"The extension of maternity leave from 14 to 20 weeks should be considered a fundamental right."
"This new period should not be seen as a threat, even taking into account the introduction of rights for fathers."
"Its implications for the legislative framework of the different Member States are negligible, including their impact on the economy, when, for instance, we consider the possibility of creating temporary work vacancies at a European level which promote professional mobility, which can stimulate the sharing of best practice and the continuation of the professional duties of women on maternity leave."
"The guarantee of a monthly salary of 100% while on maternity leave, along with the extension of the period prohibiting dismissal from six months to a year should not be called into question, taking into account both the demographic concerns and the current economic climate."
"Other simple yet significant measures are, for example, the possibility of flexible working hours in the period following maternity leave, preventive measures with regard to health and safety, and the extension of these rights to couples who adopt children, thus promoting a fairer legal framework."
"Unfortunately, in Europe, the birth rate varies from country to country and often depends not only on the guarantee of rights being protected but also on the social services available to working mothers, such as nurseries, for example."
"We still have a lot to do to reconcile working and family life."
"The maternity protection system in force in Italy is, on the whole, in line with the new parameters proposed in the directive, not only with regard to the number of weeks of compulsory maternity leave, but also with regard to the payment of 100% compensation to cover income during the period of absence."
"It is significant that the directive clearly introduces paternity leave: an important objective to guarantee equality of rights between men and women and strengthen the responsibilities shared between parents."
"I agree with extending the period of maternity leave to a minimum of 20 weeks with full pay, while providing, however, a certain flexibility to the states which already have provisions for this kind of leave."
"Workers who take their maternity leave must receive their full salary, which is 100% of their salary in the last month they worked or the average of their monthly salaries."
"The amendments adopted will prevent pregnant women from being sacked from the start of their pregnancy up until six months after the end of their maternity leave."
"Furthermore, women must have the right to return to their job or a job with the same remuneration, professional category and career path as they had prior to going on maternity leave"
"Extended maternity leave, improved working conditions ... women have been at the heart of the debate today in the European Parliament."
"Eighteen years after the first directive on pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth and/or are breastfeeding, the economic and demographic situation in Europe has certainly changed."
"We have therefore voted today in plenary to amend the legislation in force on maternity leave, in order to encourage the employment of women while enabling them to have a family in the best possible conditions."
"Enabling women to reconcile their family life with their professional life, but also fulfilling gender equality objectives: that is what we are protecting today for all European women."
"The European Parliament has, by a majority, supported a fully paid 20-week period of maternity leave."
"We shall therefore now have to negotiate with Member States to reach a compromise on this text."
"If we had to give a title to the results of this initiative having found out the results of the vote, it would be Rebellion in the halls."
"Before the vote, we were aware of the resistance among Members from the various groups to adopting the extension of maternity leave to 20 weeks, the need to pay people in that situation 100% of their salary, extending the measures in the case of disabled children, and the inclusion of paternity leave."
"All the signs were that these measures would not be adopted, but that was not the case."
"The fact that many Members did not comply with their group's voting lists made the miracle possible."
"Today, Parliament has lived up to the expectations of the men and women of Europe."
"This is also one more step forward along the road towards equality, which we are still a long way from achieving, but which we have to make a reality by working together as men and women."
"I welcome the fact that following much anticipated discussions, today, the European Parliament approved this very important directive."
"On the basis of this new directive, the length of maternity leave will be extended from 14 to 20 weeks on full pay."
"Today, in order to solve as soon as possible the demographic problems we face due to the low birth rate and ageing society, we must share family commitments."
"Therefore, it is very important that this directive should lay down the right for men to take at least two weeks paternity leave."
"A child also has an undisputable right to bond with both parents."
"This proposal will allow us to create a better balance within families and will improve integration in the labour market."
"Parliament has shown that it can achieve the objectives laid down in the Europe 2020 strategy of enabling families to balance work and personal life better while striving for economic growth, welfare, competitiveness and gender equality."
"I really hope that this directive adopted by Parliament will also be approved by Council as soon as possible."
"The EU is currently facing demographic problems caused by the falling birth rate and rise in the number of elderly people."
"Improving the provisions promoting a work-life balance is one of the ways which can be used to respond to this demographic decline."
"Gender stereotypes obviously persist in society, which pose an obstacle preventing women from accessing jobs, especially high quality jobs."
"Women are still regarded as being the principal carers of children and other dependants, which means that they are faced on many occasions with the need to choose between motherhood and a professional career."
"Women are frequently seen as 'high risk', 'second class' or 'unsuitable' workers, given the strong likelihood of them getting pregnant and exercising the right to maternity leave."
"It is therefore fundamentally important that the new forms of leave do not reflect or confirm current stereotypes in society."
"Parents' involvement in their children's lives, from the very first months after they are born, is of paramount importance to the child's healthy development from a physical, emotional and psychological perspective."
"The birth rate in many Member States is still undoubtedly very low."
"The institutions must therefore encourage births by means of an appropriate family support policy."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Estrela's report as it heads in this direction."
"I consider it right, in fact, that we should harmonise maternity rights between Member States (always taking into account first and foremost the health of the new mothers and their newborns) in order to avoid discrepancies and a reduction in the competitiveness of States that adopted advanced measures to protect motherhood some time ago."
"In this regard, I appreciate the proposal to extend maternity leave to 18 weeks in all EU countries, a practice which is already in force in several Member States: in Italy, for example, twenty-one and a half weeks' leave are granted."
"Lastly, I consider it essential to guarantee the right to resume the same job or be allocated an equivalent working position."
"in writing. - I am against the concept of 20 weeks at full pay and voted against that particular amendment."
"Nevertheless, I decided to vote in favour of the final text as amended because of the insertion of a clause that was negotiated by the PPE, allowing for a degree of flexibility during the last four weeks."
"I have thus decided to support my political group in the attainment of this compromise."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament has made progress on this matter since the debate on the demographic challenge for which I was the rapporteur in 2007."
"This vote proves that it is still possible these days to achieve new social acquis: with mobilisation and political action we can protect the achievements of past victories, but also obtain new rights."
"Today, we have strengthened women's rights, but also those of men, with this paternity leave."
"The latter represents a real change in attitudes and, over the years, will contribute to improving the allocation of roles between parents."
"in writing. - Regarding Amendment 9: UKIP voted in favour of this amendment which merely stated that 'All parents have the right to care for their child'."
"UKIP by no means supports the legitimacy of this directive, as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies."
"However, the UK Government is far too cavalier in taking children into state care, so voting in favour of this recital will be a shot across their bow."
"Regarding the proposal in general: UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies."
"This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time."
"This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses, which are the backbone of the UK economy."
"UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt."
"However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so."
"UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats."
"I voted in favour of the report because it is very important for gender equality and to the defence of the rights of workers - men and women - in terms of maternity and paternity rights."
"This is an important step forward in defending and promoting women's rights and equality in general in the workplace, given that, according to the report, 'the vulnerability of pregnant workers and of workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding makes it necessary for them to be granted the right to maternity leave of at least 20 continuous weeks, allocated before and/or after confinement, and renders necessary the compulsory nature of maternity leave of at least six weeks allocated after confinement'."
"I also voted in favour of the report on the basis of an additional, very important element in it: the recognition of the father's right to two weeks' paternity leave."
"in writing. - Regarding the proposal in general, UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies."
"This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time."
"This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy."
"UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt."
"However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so."
"UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats."
"This proposal aims to improve the conditions of security and health associated with parenthood."
"On this issue, I would argue that the asymmetries between men and women must be reduced, and that a balanced reconciliation of professional life with family and private life must be promoted."
"This will be the only way to promote parenthood with shared responsibilities."
"Starting from this presupposition, I agree with the rapporteur's proposal and believe that extending maternity leave to 20 weeks, six of which must be after giving birth and which may be shared between the parents, would make it an appropriate period."
"I also welcome the proposal included in the report that aims to guarantee payment of the full monthly wage during maternity leave, which is 100% of the last monthly salary or the average monthly salary."
"Finally, it would seem appropriate to me to apply the same measures in cases where a child younger than 12 years old is adopted, and to apply them to self-employed women."
"I declare that I voted for this report for the reasons outlined above."
"Gender equality is often a slogan, an empty statement of rights that is not always accompanied by the shouldering of responsibilities and solid arguments."
"This draft directive, on the other hand, strikes a correct balance between the biological role of the woman and the rights owed to those who perform that role to the full."
"With demographic matters that are coming more and more to resemble an emergency and an economy that demands higher and higher female employment rates, these measures are a common sense response."
"Recognition of equality is complete when certain rights are also extended to fathers, allowing family undertakings to be shared in the most appropriate manner, and when flexibility of organisation is left up to each family."
"I voted to improve the safety and health at work of pregnant workers out of respect for the principle of equal gender rights and non-discrimination based on gender, as well as to encourage women to become more involved in the labour market."
"One of the upshots of this measure is to create a work-life balance for women."
"In addition, women need this legislative support to protect their health and children."
"Another important aspect of this measure, aimed at job security for women, is the ban on making them redundant during the period from the start of their pregnancy until at least six months after the end of their maternity leave."
"A salary ceiling has also been set for the maternity leave period, which again is intended to meet social security needs."
"Last but not least, one crucial argument in support of this vote is to increase the birth rate, which is a particularly serious problem facing EU Member States."
"According to the statistics, the birth rate is falling in the EU."
"This low birth rate, combined with an ageing population, will pose a real problem for us in the future in terms of paying for pensions and medical care charges in Europe."
"Families, particularly women, should not be penalised if they want to have children."
"Pregnant workers and workers who are breastfeeding must not carry out activities which, based on assessments, pose a risk of exposure to certain agents or particularly harmful working conditions that jeopardise the safety or health of these workers."
"This is why I support the notion of implementing measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding."
"These measures must not put women at a disadvantage in the labour market or be detrimental to the directives on equal treatment for women and men."
"France is one of the countries of the Union with the highest birth rates."
"This is due to a set of measures contained in an all-embracing family policy."
"The resolution as it stands after the votes on the amendments does not bring about any real improvement."
"On the contrary, it will throw everything into question because the budgetary burden of the measures cannot be borne at this time."
"Those are the reasons that led me to withhold approval from the text, which is, incidentally, well meaning."
"I broadly agree with the measures proposed in this report, as I believe that this issue is one of the major challenges that Europe will have to overcome in the coming decades: the ageing population."
"This is the case in Portugal, for example, where I see it at close hand."
"However, like other EU countries, the birth rate is not high enough to ensure that generations are replaced, and this harsh situation is jeopardising the future."
"I believe that more flexible policies with regard to maternity and paternity leave can help to reverse these trends."
"It is therefore vital to send families a consistent message of support for motherhood and fatherhood, with concrete measures for the better reconciliation of professional, private and family life."
"Meeting this challenge is vital in order to achieve the economic and social objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and as a way of trying to reverse demographic ageing on our continent."
"In Portugal, too, maternity leave is already paid at 100% of earnings for 120 days."
"I would therefore argue that women's salaries should be assured during maternity leave in the manner described in this report."
"The vote for a legislative motion for a resolution amending Directive 92/85/EEC was taken not only to support new and better measures for the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding but also, more generally, to support new measures to promote a better work-life balance."
"Even though the Italian legal system is more innovative, the increase in the number of weeks of maternity leave at European level represents a strong boost in favour of family assistance to newborn babies."
"The support for paternity leave is also a step in the same direction even though making this compulsory is not perhaps the best way to pursue the laudable aim of ensuring the greater effective presence of both parents at the most demanding time for the new household and ensuring the father is more aware and involved."
"Support for and extension of the rights of adopted children allows a reinforcement and, it is to be hoped, also a simplification of the adoption process."
"Finally, with a view to striking a better work-life balance, I feel it is also important to have supported the call to Member States to strengthen childhood services with care facilities for children up to the age of compulsory schooling."
"The vote on the Estrela report on the rights of pregnant women and young mothers at work will make it possible to harmonise the length and pay of maternity leave with a minimum level."
"The European Parliament has chosen to have a strong position to negotiate with the Council and has therefore supported the principle of a 20-week period of leave paid at 100% (may I point out that in Sweden, maternity leave can be as long as 75 weeks, with 14 weeks exclusively for the mother, and the remaining can be shared with the father)."
"This is a strong gesture in favour of European parents and as a result, women and men will be helped in finding a better balance between family life and work life."
"It is now up to European governments to look into the budgetary possibility for taking on such a change and accepting it."
"In the end, it is likely that the minimum leave will be the one proposed by the European Commission and supported by the MODEM delegation, namely, an 18-week period of leave, which would be in line with recommendations from the International Labour Organisation (ILO)."
"I believe that this vote, which has passed by a large majority, is a strong signal that is being sent to the Council: in addition to the extension of maternity leave from 14 to 20 weeks on full pay, we have voted in favour of the introduction of two weeks' paternity leave."
"It is our duty to ensure that no one will have to choose to give up children for work or work for children."
"What is more, I welcome the fact that Parliament has voted for measures that will allow adoptive mothers to be treated equally in law with birth mothers."
"This is a parliament that has, at last, given equal rights to adoptive mothers and biological mothers."
"Adoptive parents are parents in the full sense of the word and deserve to be treated as such."
"Legislation cannot continue to discriminate against this type of parenthood."
"This is therefore a great day for the many families that are unable to reconcile their family life with their professional life."
"Furthermore, the difficult economic conditions were no reason to decide to leave all those families that also make a significant contribution to our society in the lurch for more decades to come."
"Extending the period of maternity leave to 20 weeks on full pay is a false friend."
"Such a legislative measure will harm the employability of women in businesses, which will regard it as too great a burden to bear in the event of maternity."
"It will, furthermore, compromise a woman's return to work in exactly the same position as she held before going on leave."
"Finally, opting for 100% remuneration over a long period represents a cost for social security systems (in a context in which the European institutions are calling strongly on States to reduce their budget deficits)."
"It is for these reasons that I have been unable to support this report, and why I consider that we should retain a sense of realism and allow Member States to keep a certain degree of flexibility on this matter."
"Parliament has just voted at first reading for extending maternity leave to a minimum of 20 weeks all over Europe, paid at full salary, except for high earners, and the possibility for fathers to take at least two weeks' leave following the birth of a child."
"This is a victory for the proponents of a social Europe and a step towards more equality between men and women in Europe."
"A section of the right used the future cost of these measures as an excuse to reject this progress."
"Yet helping parents to reconcile family and work life will make it easier for parents to go back to work, will boost European birth rates and will safeguard the health of mothers and babies."
"The left of Parliament, with Portuguese Socialist rapporteur Mrs Estrela, held strong, the European right was divided and the move towards progress won the day."
"The battle must now be won at the Council, where several governments are threatening to block this directive."
"Members of national parliaments should take this up and intervene with their government so that governments do not undo what the European Parliament is proposing for a Europe that protects its citizens' rights."
"in writing. - Whilst I support the rights of pregnant women, I cannot, in this current economic climate, support this report."
"The impact assessment estimate for the UK, if maternity leave is extended to 20 weeks, is almost GBP 2.5 billion per year on average."
"This would result in the cost of maternity leave in the UK doubling."
"Evidence shows that women are currently benefiting considerably from the provisions already in force within the UK, 9 out of 10 women taking the 20 weeks maternity leave, as well as 3 in 4 women taking all their paid leave."
"With such a high uptake, it is clear that more European red tape on top of the current legislation is unnecessary in the UK."
"In addition, the proposed requirement for 20 weeks' full pay would result in social regression. This is due to the fact that women on the highest salaries will receive the highest compensation."
"I fully support the need for adequate, flexible maternity leave, but I believe it is for the elected UK Government to decide, with an input from parents and their employers, how much our own economy can afford to give and how a maternity package is to be delivered."
"Working to achieve a society in which men and women are equal is a matter of principle that is extremely important - no one should be discriminated against on account of being a parent."
"We should add that it is extremely important from a socio-economic perspective for women and men to be able to combine family and working life in order to achieve a high level of employment."
"We therefore think it is regrettable that the report does not constitute a clear step forward for equality in Europe."
"It reflects an outdated view of equality where the mother is to take the main responsibility for the children instead of both parents sharing the responsibility."
"It is also wrong to propose, as the report does, that it be compulsory for mothers to be prohibited from working for six weeks after giving birth."
"We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of those parts that we believe to be positive, such as the amendment that protects national systems that have more ambitious parental insurance, the increase in the minimum length of maternity leave and the inclusion of paternity leave in the directive."
"However, we abstained from voting on the report as a whole, as we believe that it is too vague, ambiguous and outdated."
"The main reason is the lack of a clear and unambiguous gender equality perspective."
"We Swedish Social Democrats chose to support Mrs Estrela's report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding."
"We would have liked the directive to focus on parental leave rather than maternity leave."
"We would also have liked it to be less detailed and more flexible - particularly as this is a minimum directive - for example, with regard to the level of remuneration and the time limit for the period immediately after confinement."
"However, we believe that the report is important in terms of improving the current directive, which provides very limited possibilities for combining work and parenthood in many EU Member States."
"With this decision, we now have a first bargaining offer, with regard to which the Council must adopt a position."
"The Democratic and Social Centre - People's Party (CDS-PP) has long seen the birth rate issue as a state priority and recognises that it is impossible to stimulate the birth rate without protecting parenting."
"The chapters dedicated to the family and the birth rate are not a new inclusion in our programmes."
"Likewise, our defence of the rights of mothers and fathers to raise a family without this being seen as an extra burden or a cause of work difficulties is nothing new."
"Policies that support families and the birth rate, like those that we advocate, are, however, cross-sectional and are not confined to extending maternity leave."
"Nonetheless, this is a measure that we applaud, having advocated an extension of parental leave to six months in our 2009 government programme."
"That is why we would like to see the Socialist Party at our side in Parliament defending mothers and fathers."
"This would be a very different position from the one that this party has taken in national politics, where it is cutting child benefit, the reimbursement of medicine costs for the chronically ill and income tax deductions for spending on education and health, and where it is drastically increasing the tax burden on the public, particularly lower income families with children."
"The EU is facing a demographic challenge marked by low birth rates and an increasing proportion of elderly people."
"The improvement of provisions to promote a balance between professional and family life helps to address this demographic decline."
"In Portugal, the birth rate is not high enough to ensure that generations are replaced, and this situation is jeopardising the future."
"I would therefore argue that in order to counter this trend, improved health and safety should be encouraged for workers who are pregnant, who have recently given birth, or who are breastfeeding, which calls for the promotion of a balanced reconciliation of professional life with private and family life."
"I agree with the position of the rapporteur and with the changes introduced, such as the extension of the minimum period for maternity leave from 14 to 20 weeks, the principle of pay equivalent to complete earnings, the establishment of health and safety requirements in the workplace, and the prohibition of dismissal."
"I also agree that, if adopted, the right to divide a period of parental leave between both members of the couple should be recognised."
"The vote in favour of the report on improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, is the culmination of a long discussion process in the European Parliament, which was already left over from the last session and in which we have actively participated, contributing to the report's adoption."
"Although we are still in the first reading of the directive's proposal, it is positive in the area of women's rights because of the signal that it sends out, particularly to the countries that still do not have 20 weeks of maternity leave on full pay and that are still not applying two weeks of paternity leave, also with full pay."
"The adoption of this proposal for negotiation with the Council acknowledges the fundamental social value of maternity and paternity, respecting the rights of working women who want to become mothers."
"The adoption of this proposal also represents a victory over the most conservative positions that still exist within the European Parliament, meaning that the struggle to defend women's rights, maternity and paternity rights, and the rights of children, will continue."
"We hope that the Council will now accept the European Parliament's position, which increases the Commission's proposal from 18 to 20 weeks, and aims to amend the directive that is currently in force and which only sets aside 14 weeks for maternity leave."
"I supported my colleague, Mrs Estrela's, calls for an improvement in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding."
"Woman is the future of man, wrote Louis Aragon."
"Children are precious."
"They must be protected."
"So must their mothers."
"By voting in favour of a 20-week minimum maternity leave (it is currently 14 weeks) with full pay, and by endorsing a compulsory two-week paternity leave in the European Union, the European Parliament has moved in the direction of undeniable social progress."
"Having said that, I voted for extending maternity leave to 18 weeks rather than 20 weeks."
"Indeed it seems to me that a 20-week period, although an extremely generous proposal, is liable to backfire on women and be used as an additional argument to not recruit them or to complicate their return to work."
"Moreover, I regret that the provision that planned the possibility of extending maternity leave in the event of complication (premature birth, disability, etc.) was rejected."
"I regret the outcome of this vote."
"We all share the desire to enable new mothers to form a strong bond with their babies during the period of convalescence after giving birth."
"However, I am deeply concerned about the economic impact of such a measure, which will cost our country EUR 1.5 billion."
"During this time of economic crisis, it is not demagogy that will pay the bill."
"Businesses will not be able to pay it, Member States' budgets even less so."
"Such measures could penalise certain careers or put a brake on the employment of young women."
"Perpetuating a traditional system in which the father brings home the pay and the woman looks after the children, as some would like, is a step backwards."
"Freedom of choice is also a right for women."
"The negotiations that will now begin between the 27 Member States in the Council will be difficult."
"I did not wish to support this report insofar as an increase from 14 to 20 weeks on full pay would have catastrophic financial consequences for several Member States."
"The OECD study shows that there will be very substantial costs for the social budgets of Member States."
"For France, the annual amount is EUR 1.3 billion, and for the United Kingdom GBP 2.4 billion."
"In the current economic situation, increases in these budgets cannot be absorbed."
"What is more, businesses would have to bear these additional costs, which is impossible."
"However, supporting women during maternity is essential."
"Applying these measures poses a very great risk to the employment of women."
"The OECD study also shows that extending maternity leave would result in a decrease in female employment."
"In wishing to help women, there is a risk of penalising them in the job market."
"I wish to help women in their employment and to support them during maternity."
"The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward."
"Another advance would have been to have progressive measures concerning childcare methods."
"I voted for the Estrela report and I am glad that Parliament has taken such a progressive position towards mothers, future mothers and fathers."
"The extension of maternity leave to 20 weeks is undeniable social progress, which embodies the social Europe that we earnestly desire."
"This text improves the balance between family life and work life."
"The introduction of a compulsory two-week paternity leave is also a big step forward in the change in attitudes and in the division of roles between parents."
"The argument of additional costs that this measure would incur would be valid if women did not already supplement their maternity leave with sick leave and/or paid leave."
"Businesses and social protection systems are already paying these costs."
"in writing. - I am proud to have voted for the extension of maternity rights and condemn Conservative and Liberal Democrat MEPs who first conspired to obstruct parliamentary agreement of this directive and today voted to deny decent rights to working women."
"I want to record the fact that I wished to vote for a different compromise on the length of the period for maternity pay but respect that this option fell because a majority in Parliament supported 20 weeks."
"I recognise there will be a further negotiation on this point before the directive is finally agreed, and that it was vital for this Parliament finally to agree a text to enable the process to move forward."
"I fully agree with my British Labour colleagues who seek to protect low paid women in particular and, in this respect, call on the British Government to fully respect the non-regression clause in the directive."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has pointed out that many of the proposals (amendments) put forward exceed the scope and purpose of the directive."
"I do agree with them but, in deciding how to vote, I have made an exception this time."
"The position of women in the EU in terms of employment, wage levels, exposure to poverty ... is significantly weaker than that of men."
"I believe that equal opportunities are one of the basic principles underpinning the work of the EU and, for that reason, I will be using every opportunity to make the positions of women and men equal."
"Today's vote is not a final one, but it will give us a strong negotiating position in the Council."
"Extending the period of maternity leave to 20 weeks with full pay for this duration are measures which restore the dignity of mothers."
"This is why I voted unreservedly for the proposal in the report, in the confidence that Member States will heed our decision and incorporate it into their national legislations."
"Apart from supporting mothers, this report also recommends states to introduce fully paid parental leave, thereby recognising the role of both parents in bringing up children."
"We have sent out an important message with our vote today, which calls for a decent living, extending beyond ideological limits and national social systems."
"I did not wish to support this report because extending the period of maternity leave from 14 weeks (as provided by the current directive) to 20 weeks on full pay would have a considerable financial impact on Member States (EUR 1.3 billion for France) at a time of economic crisis that is hardly favourable to budgetary growth."
"Second, the additional costs for businesses in Member States where the latter partly finance maternity leave (for example, Germany) would be very high."
"Third, the negative consequences for the employability of women are real, not least when it comes to returning to the job market."
"Finally, the European Parliament, in adopting measures that are not financially practicable and which could even be counterproductive in terms of women's participation in the job market, is damaging its credibility in the European decision-making process."
"Extending maternity leave to 18 weeks, as proposed by the Commission, would have been an important step in improving the situation of women, by avoiding the pitfalls in the text as finally adopted by the European Parliament, when what is really important is to enable women to reconcile their professional life with their family life."
"In the face of an ageing population and the difficulties with which the European economy is dealing, we have to use all opportunities available to us to encourage women to have children and to make it easy for them to return to work."
"Many women are eminent specialists in their fields, and Europe's economy cannot do without the services of this highly qualified workforce."
"The situation is similar with women living and working in the countryside."
"Often, they are not given maternity leave in the full meaning of the word, but have to return to work as soon as possible."
"This obviously puts both their health and their child in jeopardy."
"That is why they should have the same privileges as women working outside agriculture."
"I expressed a different opinion in the votes on the question of leave."
"I prefer the Commission's proposal of 18 weeks."
"The proposal is realistic and balanced in relation to market conditions, not only because of the economic crisis, but also because of the demands and professional obligations and ambitions of working women themselves."
"Women should not be over-protected beings shunned by the labour market."
"Moreover, as I have consistently argued, efforts to reconcile family life with work and raising children basically require social infrastructures and corporate social responsibility throughout a woman's working life."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted against the Estrela report because extending maternity leave to 20 weeks is, in reality, a good idea only at first sight."
"Indeed, this extension is portrayed as granting more rights to women, whereas in my opinion, it would have negative repercussions for women trying to access the labour market."
"It is to be feared that this proposal, if it were to be implemented, could backfire on women and would, as a result, make them less employable."
"Contrary to what the rapporteur and those who support this text are claiming, there is no obvious connection between birth rates and the length of maternity leave."
"What is more, the proposal to extend from 14 to 20 weeks with full pay is not a financially acceptable position for many countries."
"Indeed, the extra costs incurred by this extension can be afforded neither by businesses nor by Member States."
"The initial proposal by the European Commission, namely the increase from 14 to 18 weeks, was a big enough step forward."
"I would like to underline that on Mrs Estrela's report, I voted in favour of the rules on 20 weeks' maternity leave, protecting women from unfair dismissal six months after returning to work and in favour of full pay and protection of women while breastfeeding, but in this case, without specific recommendations, as I believe that these rules should stay within the competence of the Member States."
"In the case of multiple births, I believe that leave should be extended correspondingly."
"I am always in support of any ideas that will help women have a safe maternity experience and guarantee them better conditions for returning to the job market."
"The delegation of the Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to the European Parliament has today voted against the proposal for a directive extending (paid) maternity leave to 20 weeks."
"We are of the opinion that the previously established minimum of 14 weeks is sufficient."
"Women who find that they are still unable to return to work at the end of their maternity leave can take leave under the provisions of their countries' Sick Leave Act."
"This proposal would entail an extension of social security, which is a matter that Member States should be able to decide on themselves, certainly in times such as these, when all the Member States have to economise."
"There are other, less rigorous ways in which measures allowing a better balance between work and private life could be put in place."
"The proposal carries the risk that young, talented women might be left with fewer opportunities in the labour market, because employers will not want to run the risk of having to pay many months' maternity leave to their female employees."
"Nor does an increase in birth numbers in the EU, which is the desired solution to the problem of an ageing population, have to be regulated at EU level."
"As far as the VVD is concerned, EU rules to regulate exemption from work for breastfeeding purposes are superfluous."
"The VVD Group in the European Parliament: Hans van Baalen, Jan Mulder and Toine Manders"
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report."
"As all EU citizens have the right to live and work throughout the EU, it is vital we afford women a minimum entitlement to maternity leave wherever they are working at the time of having a baby."
"Decent maternity leave is part of a wider issue of female participation in the labour market and tackling the financial implications of an ageing society."
"The EU goal is for 75% labour participation by 2020, and a crucial element of this will be giving all mothers the ability to take maternity leave which they can afford and then return to work."
"In an ageing society, where the demand for social care is increasing and the number of people providing the care is decreasing, more realistic leave such as maternity leave is needed."
"Women should not feel that having children is incompatible with their work - our policies need to enable care for younger and older persons."
"The implementation of this will not come into force for at least 5 years."
"Furthermore, with an increase of just 1.04% of women's participation in the labour market, the additional costs of extending maternity leave would be covered."
"in writing. - (IT) One of the priorities laid down in the EU's social agenda is the need to promote policies to facilitate a work-life balance, aimed at women and men alike."
"A better work-life balance is also one of the six priority areas of action set out in the 2006-2010 'Road map for equality between women and men'."
"Improving these provisions is therefore an integral part of European policy in response to the dwindling population recorded of late."
"Motherhood and fatherhood are certainly inalienable fundamental rights for the purposes of social balance."
"It is therefore to be hoped that the review of the directive in question will be to the advantage both of working women and men who wish to take responsibility for their families."
"We cannot separate respect for a better balance between the principle of protecting health and safety from that of equality of treatment."
"These and other aspects persuade me to support the need, however, to leave Member States plenty of room for flexibility in establishing rules on leave when necessary."
"This is only for reasons of economic sustainability, in order to cover the additional costs arising."
"The report adopted proposes maternity leave of 20 weeks without any loss of earnings."
"This measure alone could mean a big social improvement in women's lives in about two thirds of EU countries."
"This is the case in Portugal, where women are only entitled to 16 weeks fully paid."
"The inclusion of two weeks of paternity leave is also an important step in the struggle for equality between men and women."
"More importantly, this report has been approved even though it goes against the measures that have recently been adopted as a result of austerity policies which favour cuts in public spending and the reduction of social rights."
"I therefore hope that this report can contribute to the strengthening of work and social rights across the EU and in all the Member States."
"The unanimous view within the EU is that one of its main problems is low population growth due to low birth rates."
"Anything that can contribute to changing this situation is therefore important."
"The protection of pregnant and breastfeeding mothers in the workplace and the reduction of imbalances between men and women are important steps in that direction."
"In spite of the crisis that we are currently experiencing, the measures approved here today are very important in reversing the decreasing population trend that the EU is facing in the near future."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament legislative resolution on 'the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding', because I believe that improving women's rights in the workplace is a real step towards gender equality in an area in which, unfortunately, many barriers exist."
"The discrimination suffered by women in the labour market is very worrying because, in most cases, it is they who must take charge of domestic duties and juggle them with their professional employment."
"This situation is exacerbated in the months before and after childbirth, requiring greater protection in order to prevent the discrimination women currently suffer."
"It is my understanding that the increase to a continuous period of maternity leave of at least 20 weeks allocated before and/or after confinement, with a compulsory minimum of six weeks after childbirth, is a step forward in terms of a woman's right to reconcile family and professional life."
"Extending the period of maternity leave is an important project in terms of the place that is given to babies and parenthood in our society."
"I support the proposal to grant 18 weeks of maternity leave and also the principle of paternity leave."
"We must avoid the adverse effects of measures that are too generous and risk bringing about discrimination in employment."
"I am, moreover, a supporter of more freedom of choice for pregnant women or women who have recently given birth."
"They must be able to decide when they wish to take the non-compulsory part of their maternity leave."
"That should help them to achieve a better work-life balance and to remain employable."
"It is equally important to create a proper status for women who wish to return to work after taking a career break."
"I should also like to draw attention to the fact that the right to parental leave and the guarantee of the same job to come back to must be workable for employers, in particular, in small and medium-sized enterprises, or else they may well hesitate to hire or promote women of child-bearing age."
"In view of the far-reaching demographic changes and the ageing of European society, the European Union must actively adopt measures to support parenthood."
"The extension of the minimum time period of maternity leave will, in my opinion, make provision for the fact that the first months of a child's life are crucial for his/her healthy growth and mental balance."
"Therefore, I support the payment of salary in full for the duration of the maternity leave."
"This should have a positive effect on women so that they may become mothers without worrying about the risks of poverty and social exclusion."
"The right to return to the same work position or an equal position with equal working conditions after birth must be guaranteed."
"Moreover, the possibility to apply for a change of working hours or working arrangements must be granted, as well as the possibility to refuse overtime work shortly after giving birth."
"I am opposed to the project of extending maternity leave to 20 weeks with full pay."
"The adoption of this scheme would have major consequences on the budgets of the Member States and businesses; for France, the additional annual cost would be EUR 1.3 billion, an unbearable financial burden at a time of budgetary cuts."
"Although it is a nice idea, the consequences on women's employment could be negative."
"We would not want this measure to mean a step backwards for women."
"Women returning to work following their pregnancy and young women seeking work run the risk of being heavily penalised by this measure."
"In contrast, the proposal for a maximum of 18 weeks was still socially fair."
"I am calling for innovative ideas to be implemented as quickly as possible with regard to childcare and work-family balance, in order to enable mothers as well as fathers to play their role of parents fully."
"My decision to vote in favour of this proposal arises out of the need to improve the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding."
"The amendment to the directive is, in fact, aimed at promoting gender equality in the world of work, promoting a better balance between women's working and private lives."
"Women are frequently perceived to be 'at risk' or 'second choice' individuals given their high probability of becoming pregnant or taking maternity leave."
"It is important to support certain forms of leave to combat certain prejudices and stereotypes."
"We must not, however, forget that motherhood and fatherhood are essential rights if we are to ensure the possibility of achieving a work-life balance."
"There are clearly certain points connected with some amendments on which I have voiced a contrary opinion."
"I believe, in fact, that European law must establish a general framework that offers minimum guarantees and safeguards within which Member States can be left room to decide on the most suitable measures at their own discretion."
"There are, in fact, differences linked to culture, to welfare and to social security systems that must be taken into due consideration, and also by virtue of respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding."
"Two important factors determined my vote on certain amendments: firstly, the vital importance of guaranteeing the safety and health of young or future mothers and, secondly, the fact that Greece has specific legislation to protect pregnant women."
"I voted in favour of the proposals on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, which include 20 weeks maternity leave and two weeks paternity leave, both without any reduction in earnings."
"These are social measures that fit with the Europe that we want, with the aim of supporting the birth rate, the family, the health of babies, and parents' jobs."
"However, this is a project that is difficult to carry out, and it may, perversely, exacerbate discrimination against women in the world of work because: (1) it puts extra pressure on social security systems, which, in many cases, are already only just sustainable; and (2) it introduces new constraints on the labour market, which already no longer meets the needs of the current workforce."
"I am afraid, therefore, that these measures to support working parents may lead to increased levels of unemployment and/or precarious work among young mothers."
"Parliament's negotiations with the Council have to be realistic and pragmatic, and also ambitious, if the future law, when it comes into force, is to really fulfil and promote the values of the proposal that was voted upon in plenary this week."
"With my vote, I call for a new global approach that will make it possible to send a powerful message to companies to the effect that human reproduction concerns men as well as women."
"The framework agreement on parental leave is an important aspect of the equal opportunities policy that promotes the reconciliation of working life and private and family life, but limits itself to setting minimum requirements and may therefore only be considered a first step."
"I agree with the communication that considers children's rights to be a priority of the Union and calls on Member States to observe the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocols as well as the Millennium Development Goals."
"As far as this directive is concerned, this means guaranteeing all children the possibility of receiving care appropriate to their developmental needs as well as access to appropriate, high quality healthcare."
"Today, the European Parliament has made an investment in the European Union's future by promoting motherhood through extending the period of maternity leave to 20 weeks, with full pay."
"This can be described as both a quantitative and qualitative improvement."
"The simplistic argument of short-term economic benefits did not stand up, with the sustainability of European society prevailing, which is impossible to achieve without healthy demographics and therefore, by extension, without greater protection for mothers and their children."
"I drafted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and I voted in favour of: motherhood not being penalised and full pay being given; pregnant workers not being sacked during a period from the start of their pregnancy until six months after the end of their maternity leave; mothers being entitled to return to their job or an 'equivalent position', which means with the same remuneration, professional category and career path as they had prior to going on maternity leave; going on maternity leave not affecting their pension scheme; female workers not being obliged to work at night or overtime during the 10 weeks prior to the date they are due to give birth and for the remainder of the pregnancy if this is required for the health of the mother or foetus, and during the whole period of breastfeeding."
"I voted against this resolution because I believe that maternity pay is a matter which must be decided at national level, based on the principle of subsidiarity."
"Furthermore, I think that, at a time of crisis, adopting this measure may have the totally opposite effect, as it will act as a factor dissuading companies which want to employ women."
"I support improving the European minimum standard for maternity protection."
"However, in the end, I voted against this report, as I come from a country that has established a particular combination of maternity protection and waged/unwaged parental leave."
"Alongside 16 weeks of leave on full pay and an absolute ban on working, women also have the right to unwaged maternity leave with child benefit."
"The amount of child benefit drawn during unwaged maternity leave depends on its duration and the most recent level of income."
"The Austrian rules go far beyond the minimum standards stipulated in this report."
"Moreover, I am also in favour of introducing fully paid paternity leave, although a different legal basis should be chosen for this."
"I believe that such paternity leave should not be regulated by the directive on maternity protection, but should instead be regulated by a dedicated directive that is not aimed at the protection of the health of mothers and children."
"I voted in favour of maternity leave lasting 20 weeks."
"Longer periods of maternity leave are important for the development and welfare of children, who represent society's best form of capital."
"In Finland, there is a viable system for maternity and parental leave."
"A system like ours is not, however, available to everyone in Europe."
"For this reason, it is important to ensure that women do not have to suffer financially if they decide to have children."
"Businesses alone should not be saddled with the financial burden of maternity leave: the public sector must unquestionably share the costs."
"Small and mediumsized enterprises, in particular, are at risk of facing difficulties."
"Neither should the female dominated sectors have to bow to excessive economic pressure."
"The position of women regarding pay is alarming."
"It must not be made any weaker."
"It is vitally important to see that that does not happen."
"Finally, Parliament has done a little justice for working mothers in the European Union, although it is not all the justice that they deserve."
"It has been a long process."
"At the end of the last parliamentary term, we were on the verge of adopting a text in Parliament that would have meant a giant leap forward for the rights of working mothers."
"We could not vote because the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE Group) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE Group) joined forces against it and decided to return the report to the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"After months of work, today, we once again voted on a text which, although not as ambitious as the one previously rejected by the PPE and ALDE Groups, is quite brave: it allows mothers to maintain their salary during maternity leave; it increases their legal protection against redundancy; it allows greater flexibility in terms of working hours in order to better balance motherhood with work; it extends maternity leave to at least 20 weeks (although some of us would have liked it to be 24 weeks, as the World Health Organisation recommends); it facilitates the mobility of working mothers within the EU and it makes progress on joint responsibility for fathers, although not as much as some of us would have liked."
"Today's vote encourages workers who wish to become mothers, marking an important step forward toward greater protection that will help millions of European women to reconcile the role of mother with that of worker more effectively."
"Economic interests have not helped: now we are embarking on a path that goes towards meeting the needs of new families."
"The outcome of the vote looks toward a society that places growth, training and education at the centre of political action."
"I believe that fears that extending maternity leave on full pay from 14 to 20 weeks will penalise women are unfounded: it is our specific duty to protect the weakest workers, allowing them the right to stay at home with their children."
"Today's victory in Parliament also represents a personal satisfaction due to the efforts I have personally made with the aim of ensuring that no breastfeeding workers have to carry out heavy or dangerous duties, exempting them from overtime and night work."
"Now we pass the baton to the Member States and I hope they will commit themselves to it to the full."
"With today's decision, the European Parliament has shown that it no longer wants women who are on the horns of a dilemma but women who are free and aware of their role in our society."
"In an ageing Europe, policies favourable to women who choose to have children are essential."
"With legislation as fragmentary as it is today, there are too many differences between Member States in supporting motherhood, which prevent many women from being able to become mothers."
"This directive establishes a minimum period of maternity leave of 20 weeks, of which at least six will be on full pay."
"It is obvious that in countries such as Italy, this law is superfluous because the period on full pay is much longer than the minimum period laid down by the directive, and the periods when women can be absent from work to look after their children extend up to eight years of age."
"In other countries, however, this finally means laying the basis for guaranteeing dignity to mothers."
"The proposal also envisages that fathers may have two weeks of paid leave so that they can be with their wives during the period immediately following birth."
"in writing. - Today, I voted to support improved rights and a better work-life balance for working parents."
"Of special importance in this report are the provisions for women who are breastfeeding at work."
"Breaks for breastfeeding allow mothers the time they need to provide the best and most natural form of nutrition for their developing child."
"Nutrition is a key determinant of health throughout life."
"I am pleased that this report is favourable to those mothers who have gone back to work and still choose to breastfeed their child and provide them with the nutritional benefits."
"We believe that well-developed statutory parental leave is of the utmost importance for every country."
"In the final vote, however, we did not want to vote in favour of Parliament's legislative proposal because it went against several principles that are very important to us."
"Firstly, the proposal wants to introduce a mandatory six weeks' leave just for the mother."
"We believe that parents themselves should be able to choose how they take their parental leave and that this proposal would be a step in the wrong direction for gender equality in Sweden."
"Secondly, we do not believe that it is reasonable to set the level of remuneration for parental leave at full pay."
"As far as Sweden is concerned, this could force a reduction in the length of parental insurance in order to finance such a costly system."
"We are of the opinion that the organisation of social security systems is a matter for the national parliaments."
"in writing. - The EPLP wholly supports the need to increase protection for women who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, and therefore voted in favour of a number of the directive's key proposals."
"These include the extension of maternity leave to 20 weeks, full payment for mothers for the first compulsory six weeks after childbirth, and two weeks fully paid paternity leave."
"However, the EPLP is concerned that the proposals adopted by Parliament could have unintended consequences in countries which already employ a more complex set of maternity provisions."
"In particular, we are concerned that the proposals could allow a regressive government to cut its maternity provision so that the lowest paid working women could actually lose out over the period of their maternity leave."
"While some aspects of this report will form an invaluable improvement in Member States with very low levels of maternity provision, these amendments may lead to social regression in other countries."
"Today, the European Parliament has adopted a report to ensure the health of pregnant mothers and those on maternity leave."
"By adopting a common position in this form, we are sending out a clear signal that we support changes to improve European standards for the protection of young mothers."
"Women are guaranteed a minimum duration of maternity leave, which will henceforth be on full pay."
"By preventing unfair dismissal, we have also increased protection for the jobs of women returning to work after their maternity leave."
"The changes the directive introduces are a step in the right direction, guaranteeing women in Europe a minimum entitlement to maternity leave."
"I am also pleased that fathers will be encouraged to care for their children by introducing a two-week paternity leave."
"The vote on Mrs Estrela's report is vitally important."
"The position adopted is purely demagogic and irresponsible."
"By demanding 20 weeks of maternity leave, we are discrediting the European Parliament."
"We are the citizens' voice; to adopt such unrealistic positions would not do justice to them."
"Very significant costs for the social budgets of Member States would be incurred: as regards France, for instance, the amount would be EUR 1.3 billion."
"The current economic situation does not allow us to absorb this kind of increase within state budgets, not to mention the consequences for our companies who will have to bear part of these additional costs."
"We need to support and encourage women to better reconcile maternity and work, not scupper their chances of finding a job."
"The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward; a step that could have been built on by giving some thought to new childcare options."
"The message conveyed by this text carries huge responsibility: maternity would clearly become a barrier to personal development in the workplace."
"I welcome the adoption of this report on the proposal for a directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, and of measures aimed at helping workers to achieve a work-life balance."
"We have made maternity leave longer and better paid, and we have, for the first time in European history, introduced paternity leave."
"This vote will stand out in the history of the fundamental rights of European mothers and fathers."
"To all those who wanted to sacrifice social rights on the altar of the economic crisis, I tell them to go and get the money where it is and not to penalise citizens further."
"An improved maternity leave and the introduction of paternity leave; these are also fights for a more human society, whilst the family is increasingly becoming the final safeguard against the upheavals of life."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of a legislative proposal guaranteeing enhanced and extended paternity/maternity pay in Parliament today."
"I did so after lobbying from supporters and opponents."
"I am well aware of the financial conditions in the UK, which will be further worsened by recent budget announcements of more spending cuts."
"Nevertheless, the European Parliament was in favour of 20 weeks' maternity leave at full salary, and 2 weeks' paternity leave, and I believe that this is a sensible investment in the economy, helping reach the EU target of 75% labour participation by 2020."
"It improves the health of babies and protects the health and welfare of mothers."
"It is a step to close the existing gender pay gap."
"On average, in the EU, women earn 17% less than men."
"If we do not guarantee decent wages during maternity leave, women are punished in their earnings for having children."
"It is also a positive encouragement to increase fathers' involvement in caring for children."
"Apart from death and taxes, birth is the only certainty in life."
"Our children are the future and the improvements voted through today will provide a better and more secure start to their lives."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to get more men and women into work, and ensure they stay in work, if we are to preserve our prosperity and be in a position to afford to pay out pensions."
"In addition, at a time of stiff international competition and budgetary stringency, we must therefore have the courage to take measures which invest in families and which take some of the pressure off the task of juggling work and family."
"Extending maternity leave is one of the means to that end."
"For this reason, I support an extension to maternity leave."
"However, at a time of budgetary difficulties, we have to be realistic."
"A twenty-week maternity leave period on full pay is not a feasible solution for our social security systems and government budgets."
"On those grounds, I have abstained from the final vote, even though I support an extension to maternity leave."
"On the other hand, I do support the Commission's original proposal for an extension of maternity leave to 18 weeks, provided the current capped compensation scheme is enforced."
"I hope this proposal will stand a better chance in the second parliamentary reading."
"I voted for the report on the proposal for a directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding."
"I believe that it is of paramount importance for workers on maternity leave to be paid their full salary and that the maternity allowance should be 100% of their last monthly salary or average salary, if the monthly salary is lower than this."
"This means that women will not be penalised for the period of maternity leave they have taken when it comes to their retirement pension."
"Given the demographic trends in the EU, the birth rate needs a boost by means of specific legislation and measures aimed at contributing to a better balance between professional, private and family life."
"In order to help workers achieve their work-life balance, it is vital for longer periods of maternity and paternity leave to be provided, including for the adoption of children under the age of 12 months."
"Setting the statutory period of maternity leave to 20 weeks is in line with the recommendation made by the World Health Organisation on 16 April 2002 on a global strategy on infant and young child feeding."
"I voted against this report as it fails to stringently observe the principle of subsidiarity and interferes with national payment arrangements and the obligations of the Member States."
"Furthermore, it also contains elements such as abortion and the freedom to reproduce for which I am unable to share in the responsibility on religious grounds."
"Ladies and gentlemen, women must not be punished because they have decided to have a family."
"It is not simply an ethical question, but also a strategic one - the EU is currently experiencing demographic changes due to the low birth rate and greater numbers of elderly people."
"During these difficult times in particular, we must not frighten women away from the labour market."
"We need more working women if the EU wants to increase its competitiveness globally."
"The time has come to combat stereotypes that have taken root in society."
"Working women are often perceived to be 'high risk' or 'second rate' workers."
"It is essential, therefore, that the new leave arrangements presented in this report should help break these stereotypes."
"We should also offer more help to women who have been abandoned by society."
"EU statistics show that in Lithuania, single mothers face the greatest risk of poverty."
"The risk of poverty for working people in this group is 24%."
"It was a long road until the EU legally guaranteed gender equality."
"However, we must achieve even more and turn theoretical gender equality into real, tangible gender equality, which is applied in everyday life."
"I have voted in favour of the Estrela report because I do not want there to be any misunderstanding about the following: it goes without saying that women have particular needs during and immediately after pregnancy, that it is very much in the interests of society as a whole that these needs are met and that society, therefore, must also bear a great deal of the responsibility for this."
"However, I would ask some questions of principle."
"First of all, is it really reasonable for us to impose, from our European ivory towers here, mandatory rules which would apply throughout the whole Union, including in Member States which, in economic terms, still have a long way to go?"
"Who is going to foot the bill for that?"
"That brings me to my second fundamental comment: is it reasonable to impose the burden, so to speak, of these measures exclusively on the shoulders of employers?"
"Will this ultimately not lead to a situation which is the precise opposite of that intended; that is, there will be fewer jobs available for young women, because employers will simply not be inclined to bear all on their own the consequences they risk entailing should their young female workers get pregnant?"
"It is all very well to vote 'socially' in this House, but we are not the ones who have to carry the burden of social voting."
"The directive on maternity leave has finally been adopted today, 20 October, by the European Parliament."
"I voted for this text, which represents genuine progress for women."
"The directive has yet to be accepted by the Council."
"The text passed today aims to confer on women in the European Union the right to 20 weeks' maternity leave, which is four weeks more than in France, where women currently have the right to 16 weeks' maternity leave."
"The text we have adopted also provides a right to 20 days' paternity leave (more than the 11 days granted at the moment in France)."
"The directive also provides that women must receive the whole of their salary during their leave: a significant signal in the current crisis situation."
"Moreover, the text includes a social non-regression clause, which means that where the law in Member States is more generous on certain points, it will continue to apply."
"This is certainly a case of progress therefore, and I welcome it."
"I voted in favour of this report, as there is a wide disparity in many countries as regards the payment terms to businesses when the state, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and large companies are involved."
"We are well aware that in the current economic crisis, and with its increased difficulties, companies are increasingly struggling with liquidity problems, and that in many Member States, they are even exposed to an increased risk of bankruptcy."
"The directive which attempted to regulate this matter had a limited effect, and the proposal that we have now adopted represents an important step in setting and meeting deadlines for payment, not only in relations between the companies and public bodies, but also in the relationships that companies establish with one another."
"We will now have legislation that offers us greater effectiveness in meeting payment deadlines, with a clear system of penalties for late payment, and that also represents an effective improvement in counteracting the frequent abuse by the state and large companies of their dominant position over the SMEs."
"This directive must now be implemented quickly by the Member States, so that the serious problems caused by the establishment of long payment terms and the dragging out of payments are finally resolved."
"Fulfilling contractual obligations in commercial transactions by both public and private administrations is not merely a question of civic duty, but also of taking responsibility for a set of negative conditions that could afflict creditor companies, particularly SMEs."
"Being able to count on prompt payment means guaranteeing these enterprises stability, growth, job creation and investments."
"Unfortunately, according to European Commission data, late payments represent a frequent occurrence in Europe and damage competitiveness."
"Public authorities are particularly to blame for creating difficulties, often due to incorrect management of their budgets and cash flow or as a result of too much red tape in their administrative machinery."
"Sometimes, a decision is also made to work on the basis of new expenditure structures, without taking into account undertakings made previously, which should be honoured within the contractually agreed terms."
"I therefore consider it our duty to adopt measures that make up for the shortcomings in the previous Directive 2000/35/EC, seeking in this way to discourage the phenomenon of late payment by adopting measures that induce debtors not to pay late and other measures that allow creditors to exercise their rights fully and effectively in the event of late payment."
"I voted in favour of this timely report and for the establishment of a 30-day target period for paying bills."
"SMEs are a cornerstone of the European economy; these smaller enterprises constitute 99.8% of all EU enterprises, and they create 70% of all employment in the EU."
"The measures for tackling late payments contained in the report are practical measures for supporting SMEs and for ensuring that smaller companies do not lose out because of unpaid bills."
"The new rules could create better conditions for investment and should enable SMEs to focus on innovation and development."
"In addition, I welcome what the report says about ensuring that new measures do not increase the existing level of bureaucracy and that no extra bureaucracy or administrative problems are created for SMEs."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted for this report and am pleased that the European Parliament and the Council managed to reach this agreement, which is very important, particularly for small enterprise."
"While small and medium-sized enterprises are the foundation for European Union competitiveness and the largest creator of jobs, the crisis has shown very clearly that, at the same time, the owners of small and medium-sized enterprises are the most vulnerable, and the policy pursued by the Member States is not especially favourable to promoting and developing them, because EU legislation, such as the Small Business Act, is not being fully implemented and applied."
"Many companies went bankrupt during the crisis and this is a huge loss."
"I am therefore very pleased with this step which, although small, is of great significance to small business, providing clarity on payment periods."
"We will begin to really create an environment that is clear and understandable to small enterprises and will help to establish a business culture."
"With the adoption of the new directive against late payments, a measure that represents tangible support to companies, and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, the European Parliament is making a decisive contribution for the benefit of citizens and the European production system."
"The recast directive in fact lays down categorical payment terms and appropriate penalties to encourage prompt payments within the Union by both public authorities and private companies."
"According to estimates, this measure should put back approximately EUR 180 billion into circulation in the economy: this is the actual sum owed by public authorities to the enterprise system in the Union."
"The late payment problem is particularly keenly felt in Italy, where public authorities take 128 days on average to make payments as opposed to a European average of 67 days."
"The negative effects of late payments in commercial transactions are therefore considerable."
"I hope that this directive is implemented as quickly as possible by national governments in order to remove one of the greatest obstacles to development in the European internal market."
"At last, we have got here, after months of postponement: we have voted on the report that is a real breath of fresh air for the future of our companies."
"Late payments represent a phenomenon which, especially in Italy, has brought tens of thousands of companies to their knees, costing the Italian economic system in the region of EUR 30 billion, according to calculations by professional associations."
"Leaving aside specific considerations and national situations, I am voting in favour of the report, which sets out black and white rules once and for all for both public and private operators."
"The economic crisis has already caused dramatic numbers of bankruptcies and closures of plants, companies and the cessation of business activities."
"Through this measure, Europe can really give a hand to many small businesses that are permanently strangled by bank loans due to the crisis and may already be sailing through stormy waters due to unpaid receivables that are late in arriving."
"When this directive is applied, at least we will avoid many cases where companies are forced out of business due to debt caused by other public or private operators."
"In an unstable economic climate, late payments can have an extremely adverse impact on small and medium-sized enterprises which need money to pay their employees and suppliers."
"The new regulations on late payments in commercial transactions, which Parliament and the Council agreed on, on 5 October, should facilitate and speed up the process for companies to recover the money they are due."
"It is small and medium-sized enterprises which keep the economy going, even during a crisis."
"This is the case in every European economy."
"The European Parliament has ensured that all parties will be on an equal footing and that the rules will apply to all, which will benefit many European SMEs."
"Thanks to this agreement, SMEs will stop operating as banks for public enterprises or large companies."
"Along with the European Parliament's recommendation for SMEs to be charged VAT only after invoices have been paid, setting a definite deadline for paying invoices will help those who are worried about their survival at a time when markets are in decline."
"I voted in favour of the report because I feel it is of fundamental importance to deploy all possible actions with the aim of strengthening the competitiveness of SMEs."
"Furthermore, combating late payment in commercial transactions, which represents an unacceptable abuse, must be pushed forward, particularly at a time of economic recession such as the one we are experiencing."
"The negative effects of late payment are considerable, representing considerable costs for creditor companies, reducing cash flows and the possibility of investment, and impacting on the competitiveness of SMEs."
"This directive rightly includes measures to discourage debtors from paying late, measures that allow creditors to exercise their rights, and also identifies specific and precise rules such as default notices, compensation for recovery costs and the 30-day deadline, unless particular derogations apply, for the payment of debts."
"These put public authorities under an obligation and discourage them from forms of behaviour that could have negative impacts on SMEs, compromising the credibility of policies adopted."
"Fast payments are also a necessary and preliminary condition for investment, growth and job creation."
"I also declare myself satisfied with the solution found regarding payment deadlines and I am pleased that the proposal by the Socialists and Democrats allowing a longer timescale for public health services, where complex budgetary procedures result in longer payment deadlines, has been taken up."
"Furthermore, if contractual freedom between private businesses is respected, a substantial safeguard is introduced by prohibiting excessive payment deadlines towards creditors, who are often SMEs."
"I abstained in the vote on the report because it reinforces the Commission's efforts to put pressure on debtor states, by proposing strict measures at a time when their public finances are in poor shape."
"The pressure for debts to be settled immediately, with the threat of serious monetary penalties in the form of interest, mainly serves the interests of the businesses taking advantage of the crisis to seek cutbacks in social protection and a freeze on or cuts to workers' wages."
"The argument that this will help small and medium-sized enterprises does not stand up because, with the figures quoted in the regulation, the enterprises in question are not small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This sort of action would be warranted if preceded by bold support for the real economy of wage-earners and action to promote social and economic cohesion."
"I support the need to reinforce Directive 2000/35/EC and identify instruments necessary to eliminate or reduce late payments in commercial transactions."
"My focus is on the SMEs that represent an essential part of the European market in creating wealth and jobs."
"This political choice by the European Commission is a step in the right direction, with the aim of making the business climate more favourable for SMEs."
"With regard to the deterrent 8% interest rate, I am somewhat concerned about the results from certain regions of my country and other European states that are really struggling to respect the new rules."
"I hope that this new approach can be a real opportunity for change."
"Now we must concentrate on monitoring implementation of the directive within internal legal systems, with the involvement of regional and local authorities, to ensure that this is carried out everywhere in a standard manner."
"I hope that the entry into force of the directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions will benefit most the European Union's small and medium-sized enterprises, which will therefore be afforded more protection and be provided with resources to increase investments and create new jobs."
"At the same time, I hope that the directive will facilitate the development of debt-collecting mechanisms, as late payments from public authorities cause imbalances in the operation of small and medium-sized enterprises and, by extension, of the market too."
"Late payments in commercial transactions between undertakings, and between undertakings and public authorities, are one of the things currently hampering the recovery of economic growth."
"Approval of the new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions represents a major innovation that will require appropriate preparation, above all, of the public sector, in both political and administrative terms."
"In political terms, so that financial and budgetary planning can take account not only of the impact of European Union rules on the Stability and Growth Pact, but now also of the impact of the new rules on late payments, which, if not satisfactorily managed, could have both a direct and reflex effect on the room for manoeuvre of governments at various levels."
"In administrative terms, appropriate preparation is required for the correct financial management of public bodies, beginning with the ratio between liabilities and expenditure, so that tax revenues and, hence, the people, are not weighed down by burdens such as interest payments which could have a significant effect on public finances."
"Finally, it seems important for there to be particular awareness and flexibility regarding several sectors, such as the health sector, in which the public authorities have run up significantly late payments owed to undertakings, for regular goods and services provided."
"in writing. - In the current economic climate, it is hard enough for small and medium businesses to survive without the added burden of late payments in commercial transactions."
"Therefore, any mechanism that helps to protect these businesses from the added costs and financial implications surrounding late payment should be welcomed."
"However, I believe it is up to the British Government to regulate on this issue, not the European Union, to ensure firms and government bodies live up to their payment obligations."
"This report, while with merit, does require further clarification on certain aspects and therefore I have chosen to abstain on this vote at this time."
"I voted for the report on combating late payment in commercial transactions because it will enable the adoption of harmonised measures, which could be particularly important to the performance of companies - small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular - in the current situation of economic crisis."
"However, I consider guaranteeing a system of abolitions for the health sector to be positive."
"Delayed payments are a problem with extremely serious consequences for the health of the global economy and a particularly devastating impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"The effects of this are even more pernicious in the current period of economic and financial crisis."
"The bad example given by public administration is unacceptable, as is happening to a particularly severe degree in Portugal."
"Measures are needed to rein in late payment in commercial transactions so as to protect the good health of the European economy, avoiding situations where production structures are financially stifled and there is overcharging on financing products, thus increasing dependence on the banking sector."
"I would like to highlight the particular case of agricultural producers, who often see settlements that are owed to them delayed by supermarkets and distributors."
"The maximum period of 30 days - which may be waived to up to 60 days - for payment after services have been rendered and billed is quite reasonable for the balance of commercial relations, and it will be key to fostering a culture of timely fulfilment of commitments."
"in writing. - The adoption of the Weiler report today marks an important shift in the threshold of the payment dimension in business relations."
"Currently, it is common practice - and, more worryingly, an accepted practice - for public authorities to pressurise SMEs to sign off agreements allowing the delayed payment of bills."
"Malta is a case in point."
"Numerous SMEs, which account for over 70% of employment in the private sector, have encountered serious cash flow difficulties due to delayed payments from undertakings, especially from public authorities, including the government."
"In a number of Member States, the 60 day capping on public authorities will serve as an important protective clause for SMEs and citizens."
"However, for this provision to be truly effective, there must be correct transposition and implementation of the directive in each Member State coupled with stringent monitoring on the part of the Commission."
"It is only then that this new rule can be truly translated into tangible benefits for citizens and SMEs in particular."
"Payment terms in business transactions are a priority issue for the proper functioning of the European economies."
"Unfortunately, there are considerable disparities between Member States when it comes to complying with terms of payment, and this makes it necessary to verify carefully Directive 2000/35/EC of 8 August 2002, which is currently in force."
"Lack of discipline in transactions is a particular threat to small and medium-sized enterprises in countries which have been hit by the economic crisis."
"Late payment frequently causes difficulties both on the internal market and in cross-border trade."
"For this reason, I support the rapporteur's proposal to tighten up legislation, introduce instruments to protect enterprises and introduce mandatory compensation to enforce the late payment of invoices and interest."
"I welcome the decision of the report to stand firmly on the side of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Late payment is a massive economic problem in commercial transactions within the EU."
"In the agricultural sector, too, it is a serious matter if liquidity problems are shifted on to agricultural undertakings."
"Clearly defined payment deadlines will put a stop to these methods."
"I support the 30-day payment deadline as standard proposed in the report and also the introduction of a general upper limit of 60 days."
"I find it incomprehensible that, in many Member States, payments of public money in connection with transactions with public administrations are delayed."
"Late payments seriously impair the business environment and the internal market and have a direct effect on the Member States."
"The flat-rate compensation that has been called for, which is to be paid from the first day on which the payment becomes late, represents a tangible method of preventing this."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Weiler's report because I believe it is essential to safeguard the creditors of public administrations, which largely consist of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This measure will allow approximately EUR 180 billion of liquid funds to be put back into circulation: this is the amount of the overall debt owed by public administrations to businesses throughout the EU."
"This is a truly important step because enterprises will be granted the automatic right to demand the payment of overdue interest and also obtain a fixed minimum amount of EUR 40 as compensation for the costs of recovering the debt."
"Enterprises will also, in any case, be able to demand reimbursement of all reasonable costs incurred for this purpose."
"I believe that this initiative will serve as a spur to Member States to draw up prompt payment codes."
"They may, in fact, maintain or introduce laws and regulations containing provisions that are more favourable to creditors than those established by the directive."
"Among the many proposals contained in the Small Business Act, the one regarding amendment of Directive 2000/35/EC was among the most urgent, in my opinion."
"Late payments have become a routine practice for public authorities in many countries (and this certainly includes Italy)."
"If the European average is 180 days from the due date, we can only imagine the extremes of lateness in some cases and the consequences for those who manage small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The paradox is that a State demands prompt payment of duties and taxes, handing out penalties and applying interest from the first day of lateness, but ignores its own commitments when it is the debtor."
"The amendment we are voting for is very important, above all, at this time of severe economic difficulty, but it will not be enough on its own to resolve the problem."
"If individual Member States do not amend their procedures for recovering debts from public authorities in order to make them shorter and more effective, the approved provisions will be ineffective."
"The late payment of commercial transactions, whether between companies or between companies and public entities, is responsible for cash flow problems in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and, in turn, often contributes to further delays in payment, thus starting a vicious cycle that is difficult to counteract."
"We are sure that the implementation of the new rules proposed here will represent an important step towards ending this situation and thus help companies to face this period of economic and financial crisis."
"The proposed penalties are proportionate and necessary, and it is hoped that they will discourage the improper commercial practices that have been adopted by commercial operators."
"It was essential that the resolution on the Late Payment Directive be accepted, and that is why I voted for the resolution."
"The debate this morning also revealed that the effects of the crisis, which, in the recent past, did not spare our Member States, either, are still closely felt."
"We need to make numerous changes in view of the smooth operation of the internal market."
"As part of these changes, the report rightly recommends the transition to a culture of timely payment."
"This will make it possible for payment delays to incur consequences which will make them disadvantageous."
"According to the impact assessment preceding the review, the authorities of several Member States are known for poor payment practices."
"I sincerely hope that today's decision will be able to change that as well."
"Finally, making life easier for SMEs can be at the forefront of our concerns in this regard as well."
"The proposed alternative dispute resolution mechanisms can offer a solution, as can making public the practices of Member States."
"Making the most of the opportunities offered via the European e-Justice portal can help creditors and enterprises operate with fewer worries."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal tackling the problem of late payments which is becoming a serious issue, particularly in cross-border commercial transactions, because it violates legal security."
"In order for the consequences of late payment to be such as to discourage it, it is necessary that fast-acting procedures for the recovery of undisputed outstanding debt related to late payment be introduced within the establishment of a culture of prompt payment."
"The amending proposal, aimed at the enforcement of payment of such claims against an enterprise or a public authority via a broadly accessible on-line procedure, will be a positive step towards the simplified and speedier recovery of this kind of outstanding debt."
"It will be beneficial primarily to small and medium-sized enterprises which suffer most from late payment and laborious recovery procedures."
"Outstanding debts represent a considerable financial risk, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"A lack of a payment moral, especially in times of crisis, can severely restrict liquidity."
"There is certainly a benefit to be gained from measures that lead to a greater consciousness about payment."
"I have abstained because I am not convinced that it makes sense to regulate this at the pan-European level or that doing so would have a positive influence on the payment moral."
"The report tackles the problem of late payment, a problem that destabilises the market and, above all, damages small and medium-sized enterprises, for which I have a particular regard."
"My vote in favour of the report should be seen as a hope for the birth of a new commercial culture which is more prone to timely payment, and in which late payment is considered as an unacceptable abuse of the client's position and a breach of contract, and not as a normal practice."
"I voted for this legislation because I believe that better handled payment arrangements are beneficial to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and business culture in general."
"I believe that one of the provisions put forward in this document is particularly progressive: the call to publish lists of reporting entities quickly."
"These measures would not only encourage companies (particularly SMEs) to pay one another on time, thus reducing the risks of liquidity problems, but would also increase the credibility and, in turn, the competitiveness of such companies."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Weiler's report, inasmuch as I believe that it is essential to establish a maximum ceiling under which enterprises must be paid.."
"This need is even more pressing and essential at these times of crisis."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises, together with entrepreneurs, play a significant role in all our economies and are key generators of employment and income and drivers of innovation and growth."
"Unfortunately, all too often recently, we have seen situations of companies that are owed several millions by public authorities but are unfortunately forced to close down or declare bankruptcy due precisely to these late payments."
"I therefore hope that at the implementation stage, other factors are also considered, establishing a loosening of stability pact ties for public authorities and, at the same time, a gradual reduction in payment terms."
"This would bring both requirements together and the entire system of the country would benefit."
"I hope that the directive is quickly transposed by the Member States so that it may be applied as soon as possible."
"It is a duty on the part of we law makers and a right owed to creditor companies."
"Late payments can result in financial difficulties, and even bankruptcy for some businesses, especially SMEs: according to the European Commission, late payments cost the European economy around EUR 180 billion every year."
"Other studies talk about EUR 300 billion per year, an amount equivalent to the Greek public debt."
"In the current economic climate, I am glad that the Council and Parliament have been able to agree from the start on an ambitious review of European legislation in this area."
"The European Parliament's contribution was substantial in this matter."
"We were successful in making sure the final text is inspired by the many improvements voted for in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, in particular: higher legal interest rates payable in case of delay; for business to business transactions, a default 30-day rule and an extension to 60 days which can be prolonged under certain conditions; for public institutions, a maximum of 60 days; greater flexibility for public health institutions and for public medical and social institutions; and finally, a simplification of the compensation for recovery costs (a flat rate of EUR 40)."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her outstanding work."
"The European Parliament has given the green light to new laws to limit late payment by public authorities to their suppliers, the majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Parliament has provided that public authorities must be bound to pay for services or goods acquired within 30 days."
"If they do not do this, they must pay interest on late payment at a rate of 8%."
"The principle of paying for work on time is a fundamental principle of correct behaviour but is also of crucial importance in determining the solidity of an enterprise, its available funds and its access to credit and finance."
"This new directive, which will now be implemented in national legal systems within 24 months of its adoption, will therefore benefit the entire European economy."
"in writing. - Given that late payment is a phenomenon with numerous and interlinked causes, it can only be combated with a wide range of complementary measures."
"Parliament therefore considers that a purely legalistic approach with the aim of improving remedies for late payment is necessary, but not sufficient."
"The Commission's 'hard' approach with a focus on harsh sanctions and disincentives must be broadened to include 'soft' measures with a focus on providing positive incentives to combat late payment."
"In addition, practical measures, such as the use of electronic invoices, should be encouraged in parallel with the implementation of the directive."
"Italy is the country where enterprises suffer most due to late payment by public authorities, with an average period for payment to suppliers of 180 days as opposed to the European average of 67 days."
"This leads to financial problems, a drastic reduction in investment opportunities and a loss of competitiveness, particularly for SMEs."
"The directive we have voted for today discourages debtors from paying late and allows creditors to protect their interests effectively against such lateness, introducing the right to legal interest caused by late payment even when not specified in the contract."
"It also forces public authorities to pay within a maximum of 60 days from the payment request, provided the service has been performed satisfactorily."
"The adoption of this directive is truly a great help for our enterprises: nowadays, one company in four closes down as a result of problems of insufficient financial liquidity."
"These new rules on payments will mean that companies will regain their market competitiveness and no jobs will be lost."
"By adopting with a resounding majority the report by my colleague, Barbara Weiler, on the proposal for a directive on late payments, the European Parliament has introduced balanced and clear rules which promote solvency, innovation and jobs."
"Small businesses and public hospitals will benefit from the measures that we are proposing."
"The former will no longer be faced with financial issues following late payments and the latter will be able to benefit from an extended payment period of 60 days because of their special status, with funding coming from reimbursements in accordance with social security systems."
"Moreover, the agreement that we should get with the Council will allow a speedy entry into force of the directive and transposition by Member States as early as January 2011."
"I welcome the effectiveness of this vote."
"Over recent years, late payments have become an increasingly important burden in the financial management of businesses."
"They represent a serious and dangerous problem that drags down the quality of the tender system, seriously undermining the survival of small businesses and contributing to the European economy's loss of competitiveness."
"The statistics are alarming, above all, with regard to Italy, where the average payment is made at 186 days, peaking at 800 days in regional government with regard to the health sector."
"It is a real disgrace, which has very often forced many SMEs to close."
"Through this report, we are taking a great step forward by setting 60 days as the limit for payments from the public sector to the private sector."
"Of course, the adoption of this legislation will not solve the problem as if by magic, but it definitely represents a starting point to set off a virtuous cycle, above all, with regard to dealings with public authorities."
"The efficiency and immediacy of public authorities in paying invoices is an important step that will also have benefits for the European economy."
"I hope that the Member States, above all Italy, transpose the legislation very quickly."
"This report has made a significant contribution to resolving the problem of late payments in commercial transactions between companies or between companies and public entities."
"The initiative is aiming for greater liquidity among the European Union's companies through harmonisation."
"The struggle against late payments is particularly welcome in the current period of crisis, since long delays have negative repercussions on companies' activities."
"The measure aims to contribute to the smooth operation of the internal market by urgently reforming the deadline required and the penalties to apply where it is not respected."
"In this context, I welcome the legislative proposal, whose stipulation of a general deadline of 30 days for paying for transactions between companies and between companies and public entities - with the latter able to benefit from 60 days in exceptional cases - garnered widespread support in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), of which I am a member."
"I also view positively the establishment of an interest rate to be applied, where payment is late, based on the European Central Bank's reference rate plus 8%."
"In my opinion, this measure equates to a strong boost for the economic activity of small and medium-sized enterprises, which often see their economic performance seriously damaged because of bureaucratic obstacles."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just voted on the revised directive on combating late payments in commercial transactions."
"I have thrown the full weight of my support behind this agreement."
"Excessively long payment periods and, indeed, late payments, are a threat to healthy company management, they affect competitiveness and profitability and could ultimately jeopardise the company's continued existence."
"As the current directive does not appear to be effective enough in discouraging late payments, I also support the strengthening of the existing rules."
"As far as maximum payment periods are concerned, we will be putting in place additional guarantees for companies because, in principle, payments have to be made within 30 days."
"This is of particular importance for payments between companies and government bodies."
"After all, from now on, Member States and governments will themselves have to lead by example."
"This is a question of credibility, that is, a question of European institutions in future being required to comply with the same legal deadlines as everybody else."
"The fact that the directive clearly stipulates that any contractual deviation from standard payment terms will only be possible for objective and fair reasons will be an important factor in its enforcement."
"To conclude, I hope that the fixed compensation in respect of recovery costs will force late payers onto the straight and narrow path and, better still, keep them there."
"That would be good for our companies and good for jobs."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Weiler's report on combating late payment in commercial transactions."
"Business activities are greatly hindered by debts or late payments that often represent the reason why otherwise solvent enterprises fail due to a kind of domino effect."
"Late payments represent a frequent event in Europe that is damaging to enterprises, particularly small enterprises."
"Furthermore, in most Member States, public authorities customarily pay late in situations of financial difficulty."
"A need has therefore emerged to strengthen existing legal measures by undertaking to combat late payment to support companies, particularly SMEs, and establish exact terms and appropriate penalties for those who are in breach."
"I voted in favour of this report, as poverty is a very serious problem which affects 85 million of our fellow Europeans, so no one should remain indifferent to it."
"It needs to be at the forefront of our priorities, and it merits a collective response which ensures that those who find themselves in a situation of social vulnerability have a modicum of dignity."
"Poverty affects our young people and our elderly, but also, increasingly, our workers."
"6 million jobs have been lost in the last two years alone, along with a worsening in the low level and instability of workers' wages, even if they manage to stay in their jobs."
"We need a systemic approach that addresses and resolves the causes of the problems, nipping incipient problems in the bud."
"However, at the same time, we cannot currently provide immediate and urgent responses to their consequences."
"In view of this, ensuring that those who are vulnerable in our society receive a minimum income for living and are given immediate responses to enable them to get out of this situation is not only a necessity, but also a requirement that we should endorse, and one that must be achieved within a framework of responsibility and exigency."
"The EU has shown its commitment to combating poverty in Europe within the framework of initiatives promoted for 2010, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, and with regard to achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals."
"Considering the severity of the economic and social crisis and its impact on the increase in poverty and social exclusion, some vulnerable population groups such as women, children, old people and young people have experienced the negative effects of the situation more keenly."
"In this situation, even though a minimum income may constitute an appropriate system for protecting such categories, it does not take into account the principle of subsidiarity and, therefore, the fact that this subject is the responsibility of individual Member States."
"Because inequalities exist between wages and social levels in Europe, it is difficult to establish a minimum common income threshold."
"I believe that it would instead be useful to encourage individual Member States to improve policy responses to combating poverty, promoting active inclusion, an adequate income, access to quality services and a fair redistribution of wealth."
"Above all, however, Member States should be encouraged to make better use of the Structural Funds at their disposal."
"The international community has confirmed its commitment to combating poverty on several occasions."
"Such a global approach is required because poverty is not confined to the underdeveloped countries in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia, but to 17% of the EU population as well."
"I believe that last month's UN summit marks an important development, leading to the adoption of a specific action plan for achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"The EU, for its part, has suggested a 25% reduction in the number of people living in poverty by 2020 and an allocation of 0.7% of gross national income to development aid."
"Moreover, the European Parliament is encouraging, by adopting this report, the active inclusion of disadvantaged groups and providing effective economic and social cohesion."
"I would like to mention the large contribution made by Romania to the UN programmes for combating poverty, amounting to EUR 250 million."
"As development aid must be reciprocal, my country will continue to observe its commitments."
"However, I think that more attention must be focused on groups at a high risk of poverty, such as the rural population or the Roma ethnic minority."
"The aim of this initiative is for various measures to be adopted at European level to eliminate poverty and social exclusion."
"The economic crisis has exacerbated the situation of many Europeans."
"Unemployment has risen and, under these circumstances, the situation of the most vulnerable people, such as women, children, young people and the elderly, is more precarious."
"This is why we need to adopt measures at European and national level, and minimum incomes are a good tool for ensuring that those who need them can live in dignity."
"The ultimate objective, however, is full integration into the labour market, which is what enables genuine social cohesion."
"In this respect, I hope that we will be able to ensure that economic development is accompanied by social development and, in particular, to influence the development of the social economy."
"I also hope that we will be able to fulfil the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million."
"I voted for this report because, despite all the statements on combating poverty, European citizens continue to live in poverty, social inequalities have increased and the number of poor workers is also increasing."
"The European Union must take more active measures to combat poverty and social exclusion, paying particular attention to people in precarious employment, the unemployed, families, elderly people, women, single mothers, disadvantaged children and people who are ill or who are able-bodied to varying degrees."
"Minimum income is one of the basic measures for combating poverty, helping to lift these people out of poverty and ensure their right to have a decent living."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that minimum income will only achieve its objective in combating poverty if the Member States take concrete actions to guarantee minimum income and implement national programmes for combating poverty."
"Furthermore, in some Member States, minimum income schemes do not meet the relative poverty threshold."
"Therefore, the European Commission should address good and bad practices in the evaluation of national action plans."
"Hence, minimum income - the main element of social protection - is undoubtedly important in ensuring the protection of people facing poverty and their equal opportunities in society."
"Almost 300 000 families in Romania receive a guaranteed minimum income from the state, under a law which has already been in force since 2001, and for which a fiscal effort of almost EUR 300 million is made available."
"Against the backdrop of the current economic crisis, whose impact is especially being felt by citizens from those countries less developed economically, the recommendation made by the European Parliament for a minimum income scheme to be introduced in all Member States provides an obvious solution."
"Although no one can argue against the need for such a guaranteed minimum income scheme, it may obviously be open to abuse."
"A good timeframe and control framework for the scheme are required because there is a risk of this scheme encouraging people not to work."
"Precisely to ensure that this does not happen, it is recommended that anyone receiving this income is also able to provide some hours of work for the benefit of the community."
"As of the end of 2008, 85 million people were living below the poverty line throughout the EU."
"These figures highlight the need for support, especially when we are talking about young or elderly people."
"The economic crisis has made poverty considerably worse."
"Over 85 000 people are currently living below the poverty line in the European Union."
"In the context of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, I welcome the political commitment taken by the European Parliament to ensure economic and social cohesion that is strong and effective."
"The Figueiredo report points out that introducing a minimum income at national level is one of the most effective ways of tackling poverty."
"However, I am against having a minimum income at European Union level."
"Such a measure would be demagogic and totally ill-suited in the current situation."
"The Structural Funds, too, play an essential role in tackling social exclusion."
"The European Social Fund, in particular, is a strong European investment designed to make the labour market more accessible to those experiencing difficulties."
"It should remain a strong instrument of the cohesion policy during the 2014-2020 period."
"I voted in favour of this extremely good report, because it insists on the need to take specific measures to eliminate poverty and social exclusion, by promoting a fair redistribution of income and wealth, thereby guaranteeing an adequate income and giving real meaning to the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"It calls on the Member States to 'take a fresh look' at policies to guarantee an adequate income, knowing that decent and viable jobs need to be created in order to combat poverty."
"It considers that social objectives should form an integral part of the crisis exit strategy and that job creation must be a priority for the European Commission and the Member State governments, as the first step towards reducing poverty."
"It considers that adequate minimum income schemes must set minimum incomes at a level equivalent to at least 60% of median income in the Member State concerned."
"It also stresses the importance of the existence of unemployment benefit that guarantees a decent standard of living, and also the need to reduce the length of absences from work, inter alia, by making state employment services more efficient."
"It also stresses the need to adopt rules on insurance, so as to establish a link between the minimum pension paid and the corresponding poverty threshold."
"We, the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament (Dan Jørgensen, Christel Schaldemose, Britta Thomsen and Ole Christensen), have voted in favour of the own-initiative report on the role of minimum income in combating poverty and promoting an inclusive society in Europe."
"We believe that all EU Member States should adopt poverty targets and introduce minimum income schemes."
"At the same time, we believe that these targets and schemes should be adapted to the circumstances of the individual Member States."
"We believe that there are many ways to assess poverty and it ought to be up to each individual Member State to find the best way to do this and to construct a minimum income scheme that is tailored to that Member State."
"The current economic crisis has had an enormous impact on increasing unemployment, on unchecked impoverishment, and on the social exclusion of people all over Europe."
"Poverty and social exclusion have attained unacceptable levels: almost 80 million Europeans are living below the poverty line, 19 million of whom are children - the equivalent of almost two in 10 children - and many others are facing serious obstacles in terms of access to jobs, education, housing, and social and financial services."
"Unemployment has also reached unprecedented levels in all the Member States, with a European average of 21.4% in which one in five young people is unemployed."
"This situation is unacceptable and we need to do everything in our power to help resolve the tragedy that these people are living."
"To this end, 2010 has been designated the European year for combating this scourge with the purpose of strengthening the EU's political commitment and taking measures that have a decisive impact on eradicating poverty."
"I agree that there needs to be a minimum wage in every Member State, accompanied by a social reintegration strategy and access to the labour market."
"Economic and social cohesion is a fundamental prerequisite of any common policy, in Europe as in smaller contexts."
"Where there are differing interests, objectives will also diverge and it will be impossible to plan anything shared."
"Raising the living standards of those living beneath the poverty threshold is a priority."
"Public resources put to use in this context are, without doubt a medium-term investment since, if they are well distributed, they trigger instances of growth which feed themselves."
"Transferring fixed sums of money is always an uncertain business, if they are not part of a wider programme of incentives."
"Two situations require a different approach."
"The first situation, relating to social welfare, is where a worker is unable to earn enough to lead a dignified life due to physical or mental disabilities, or other related reasons."
"The second situation, relating to legal and economic issues, involves the rigidity of the labour market, which does not adequately equate productivity and salaries, or which does not allow you to work as much you would like or in proportion to how much you want to earn in order to lead a decent life."
"In these two situations, the public sector can and must intervene, leaving an incentive to hard work to be created in the others - and never the other way around."
"Approximately one fifth of the EU population lives below the poverty line, with increased rates of poverty among children, young people and the elderly."
"The proportion of poor employees is growing hand in hand with the proliferation of precarious, low paid jobs."
"In 10 Member States, the material deprivation rate affects at least a quarter of the population, with the proportion exceeding half of the population in the case of Romania and Bulgaria."
"All these factors add up to the EU facing a poverty problem exacerbated not only by the recession, but also by the anti-social policies implemented by right-wing governments."
"The minimum income can guarantee social protection for broad groups of the population who are now living in poverty."
"This minimum income has an absolutely paramount role to play in preventing tragic situations caused by poverty and in halting social exclusion."
"In order to combat poverty effectively, there is also a need to improve the quality of jobs and salaries, introduce the right to an income, as well as the wherewithal to provide social welfare benefits, pensions and allowances."
"2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, continuing the campaign for an inclusive society, adopted by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This provides another reason for me to vote in favour of this campaign."
"I believe that action needs to be taken at both European and national level to protect consumers against unfair terms for repaying loans and credit cards and to establish terms for accessing loans which will prevent households from getting into excessive debt and, consequently, from facing poverty and social exclusion."
"In Europe, 20 Member States have got national legislation which sets a minimum wage and differences between countries can be very substantial."
"Thus, the minimum wage in Luxembourg is approximately EUR 1 682, whereas in Bulgaria, it is only EUR 123."
"That is why the European Parliament has reiterated its call for a European minimum income."
"This minimum income could be one of the solutions to explore to prevent millions of Europeans from sliding into poverty."
"We feel it is important to point out that guaranteeing a minimum income should naturally be accompanied by an overall social strategy including access to basic services such as healthcare, access to accommodation, education, lifelong learning, and this for all ages and in a way that is suited to each country."
"MEPs have highlighted that the real aim of minimum income schemes should not only be to assist but also to support beneficiaries so as to enable them to move from a situation of social exclusion to a working life."
"My support for this report highlights the importance of solidarity within our European societies, particularly in this European Year for Combating Poverty."
"Certain Member States, such as France, have played a pioneering role by creating a 'minimum guaranteed income' 20 years ago."
"However, experience has taught us that this system can generate adverse effects and, for example, encourage idleness in some."
"That is why the Union must consider measures which, like the French revenu de solidarité active, or earned income supplement, create a sense of responsibility in recipients and encourage them to seek employment, which is the first real element of social inclusion."
"I have always called for, and I already included this in my election programme for the 2009 European elections, the introduction of a minimum income equivalent to 60% of the average income for each citizen of the Union."
"Today, however, this House has unfortunately voted against this legislative proposal at Community level."
"In this European year 2010 for combating poverty, I am convinced that a framework directive on minimum income could have served as a reference text for national policies and legislation."
"I believe this was the most effective way to reduce poverty and to bring 20 million people out of poverty by 2020."
"As a reminder, 80 million people are living below the poverty line in Europe."
"I think that the risk of poverty exacerbation in Europe must be avoided at all costs as it can have an extremely adverse structural impact in the long term, from both a social and economic perspective."
"I voted for this report because I believe that a reasonable minimum income must be guaranteed to ensure a decent level of social protection, in particular, for the most vulnerable groups of people who have been hit hard by the austerity policies implemented by European governments during the current economic and financial crisis."
"Without being insensitive to the severe consequences of the current crisis on the public, as it is creating or exacerbating a situation of poverty for many Europeans, I do not agree with the statist view that aims to solve this problem with more social benefits, as in the case of a minimum income that is fixed at a European level."
"More social benefits require more money from the state, and as this does not create wealth, it can only be achieved by increasing tax revenue."
"This means more taxes on everyone, making everyone poorer and more dependent on the leech-like state itself."
"The fight against poverty must be carried out by employment policies and economic competitiveness."
"If Portugal were not seeing several companies closing week after week, it would not be seeing so many Portuguese people unemployed and living in poverty."
"I therefore believe that the fight against poverty should be carried out by stimulating the economy and the market, not by way of subsidies, which will always have to be funded by taxes which, as we know, stifle taxpayers and the economy and are an obstacle to economic competitiveness."
"As I said in this House a year ago, I advocate a new concept of sociality within the European Union which is able to ensure that everyone has a basic standard of living."
"In a Europe that is socially conscious, fair, evolved and cohesive, it is imperative to ensure measures that eradicate and minimise the risk of social dumping and the degradation of living conditions for its people when faced with the devastating effects of the current economic crisis."
"In order to make Europe stronger and more united, we must ensure the protection of basic rights for people throughout Europe."
"I understand that minimum standards are needed in the areas of healthcare, education and social pensions, and even at the level of pay, ensuring greater uniformity in employment conditions."
"In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, I welcome this report for its contribution to encouraging all Member States to fulfil their responsibilities for active inclusion by rectifying social inequality and marginalisation."
"I would like to stress that there should be a realistic balance and respect for the subsidiarity principle."
"In view of this, I am voting for this report and against the proposed amendments."
"I would stress the importance of the adoption by the plenary sitting of the European Parliament of this report proposing the introduction of minimum income schemes in all EU Member States, for which I was responsible."
"It was adopted in this Chamber by 437 votes to 162, with 33 abstentions, and has emerged as a specific measure of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"As this report says, 'introducing minimum income schemes in all EU Member States - consisting of specific measures supporting people (children, adults and the elderly) whose income is insufficient by means of a financial contribution and facilitated access to essential public services - is one of the most effective ways to combat poverty, guarantee an adequate standard of living and foster social integration'."
"The adopted resolution argues that minimum income schemes must fix minimum incomes at a level equivalent to at least 60% of median income in the Member State concerned."
"It urges the Commission to draw up an action plan, designed to accompany the implementation of a European initiative on minimum income in the Member States."
"It calls attention to the increasing number of working poor and to the need to tackle this new challenge, and it calls for a fair redistribution of income."
"Rarely have I come across such a demagogic and unrealistic report."
"Demagogic, because its aim is to introduce a minimum income equal to at least 60% of average income in all Member States and for everyone, without any nationality requirement."
"Is that gross average income or net average income?"
"Is that the average standard of living which is used to calculate the poverty line?"
"In my country, that is tantamount to encouraging assisted inactivity and to creating a powerful magnet for immigration."
"Because, according to the definition used, this income could be higher than the minimum wage, which is what 15% of French workers earn; a record among developed countries."
"It is not assistance that Europeans need, but real jobs that pay a decent wage."
"Yet, and this is the unrealistic part, the report is silent on the true causes of poverty: the pressure on wages brought about by the external competition of low cost countries where social dumping is practised, and by the internal competition of non-European immigration; and the explosion of unemployment, relocations and business closures caused by unfettered globalisation."
"It also overlooks the extremely worrying case of the impoverishment of Europe's middle classes."
"Priority must be given to fighting these causes."
"in writing. - Even though the European Union is one of the richest areas in the world, one still finds a high percentage of European citizens facing the problem of income poverty, limiting their ability to afford the basics in relation to food, health, energy and education."
"Poverty affects 85 million people in Europe."
"Moreover, following the current financial and economic downturn, there is a higher risk of poverty mainly affecting children, the young and the elderly, putting many households at a higher risk, reducing their access to medicine, healthcare, schools and employment."
"We have to ensure that wealth is evenly distributed among rich and poor Member States, among small and big countries, and among their citizens."
"More funds have to be allocated to different studies and analyses relating to poverty and social exclusion, comparing the systems of the 27 Member States and identifying which policy works best."
"We have to continue combating poverty and social exclusion in Europe and around the world by taking urgent action and, more importantly, by working in solidarity despite the different fiscal or political pressures we might face."
"Currently in Europe, 17% of the population, equivalent to around 85 million people, are living below the poverty line."
"Behind these figures, extreme poverty is the most worrying and is making progress, especially in these times of recession, which is why a minimum income is crucial."
"As 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, and following the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, we voted, in the European Parliament, for a resolution that calls for a European minimum income equal to 60% of average income in each Member State."
"Our report emphasises that introducing minimum income schemes in all Member States is one of the most effective measures to fight against poverty, ensure a decent standard of living and encourage social integration, and I welcome the adoption of this resolution."
"I supported the report inviting Member States to tackle poverty by introducing minimum income schemes on the model of the RSA ['revenu de solidarité active' - earned income supplement], formerly RMI ['revenu minimum d'insertion' - basic guaranteed income], in France."
"This type of tool has been clearly recognised as being very useful when tackling job insecurity."
"The text proposes that this kind of minimum income amounts to 60% of the average salary for each country and, above all, is part of a comprehensive strategy for integration, with a lasting return to work and access to public services, primarily accommodation."
"The text was adopted, but unfortunately, the alternative versions proposed by the left-leaning political groups, calling for a binding framework directive for implementing the minimum income throughout the Union, were rejected."
"The position that we have taken in favour of these minimum income schemes is therefore encouraging, but is likely to be insufficient."
"Current data show that poverty levels in the European Union are increasing."
"In many Member States, poverty hits children and elderly people the hardest, and the increasing use of short-term job contracts and low, unsecure incomes bring the risk of deteriorating living conditions across the whole of society."
"Add to that the demographic crisis that is affecting some countries, and we have a recipe for guaranteed economic decline."
"It is our job to secure a decent life for all citizens."
"We cannot allow our children and grandchildren to live under the threat of hunger, unemployment and social exclusion."
"We must guarantee future generations decent wage levels, career stability, access to public services and social integration throughout their lives - from the earliest age until retirement."
"in writing. - There are an estimated 85 million people throughout the EU suffering from or at risk of poverty and I believe that at a European level, everything possible must be done in order to tackle it."
"It is vital that procedures such as this are introduced to help reduce the number of people at risk of poverty in the EU, in order to ensure that the EU 2020 goal of removing the risk for 20 million European citizens is met."
"The economic and financial crisis has exacerbated the situation which the labour market is in across the whole of the European Union."
"Just recently, approximately 5 million jobs have been lost, which has caused poverty and social exclusion in Member States."
"I firmly support this report because I believe that urgent measures are needed to reintegrate those affected into the labour market, as well as the guarantee of a minimum income which will be able to ensure a decent standard of living and a life worthy of human dignity."
"I think that we must develop relevant indicators to enable us to introduce minimum income schemes in Member States, thereby ensuring an adequate standard of living fostering social integration and promoting social and economic cohesion throughout the entire European Union."
"One effective tool for fighting poverty is guaranteeing citizens of the European Union a minimum income which includes salaries, pensions and benefits."
"A minimum income should be a universal right, and not depend on contributions made."
"We should pay particular attention to social groups which are particularly susceptible to poverty and social exclusion, which include, in particular, disabled people, large families and single-parent families, the chronically ill and the elderly."
"An analysis of the experience of several Member States shows us what an important role minimum incomes play in fighting poverty and social exclusion, and that is why I voted for Mrs Figueiredo's report."
"Nowadays, it is essential to include the prevention and combating of poverty and social exclusion in other EU policies with the aim of guaranteeing the respect for fundamental human rights, universal access to essential public services and the right to health, to education and to vocational training."
"All this requires social sustainability of macro-economic policies, which implies changing monetary priorities and policies, including in the Stability and Growth Pact, and also all competition policies, internal market policies, and budgetary and fiscal policies."
"This report uses the term 'minimum income', which is a controversial term defined as an instrument that makes it possible to accompany beneficiaries in moving from situations of social exclusion to active life; it also underlines the importance of broader policies that also take into consideration other needs: healthcare, education, training, social services and housing."
"I voted in favour of this report because I support the idea of the need for a European coordination strategy."
"I nevertheless believe that the minimum income is a responsibility of individual Member States, based on the principle of subsidiarity."
"It is difficult to establish a minimum threshold in the various Member States when great differences exist between wages and the cost of living in general."
"The contents of the Treaty of Lisbon, the provisions of the 2020 EU strategy and the principles included in the Millennium Development Goals do not seem to be reflected, even in terms of future prospects, in the disconcerting reality, which is that great numbers of people live in misery even today."
"In Europe alone, nearly 80 million citizens live in conditions of poverty, 19 million of whom are children."
"The ambitious policies that the international community has set itself for poverty eradication have all too often proved ineffective and difficult to implement or amounted only to social welfare measures."
"The objectives must instead be achieved by considering a more structural approach, evaluating specific initiatives coordinated at European level that have an impact on income, on social services and on healthcare with the aim of alleviating the impact of a financial crisis that has hit those who are most at risk in the labour market, namely women, older women in particular, and young people."
"I believe that the valuation of European initiatives aiming to establish a minimum income might represent one of the ways for combating poverty provided the principle of subsidiarity is observed."
"The implementation of minimum income in all the countries of the European Union is a pivotal measure for combating poverty."
"I am therefore voting in favour of this important report."
"The minimum income is, however, calculated for each country, and thus does not contribute to social convergence within Europe."
"National inequalities are being maintained in the crisis that we are experiencing at present."
"More cross-cutting social policies are therefore needed at a European level in order to ensure a fairer distribution of wealth."
"This is an important part of the EU's role."
"The European Union has always proclaimed 'social inclusion' as one of its founding principles."
"It is difficult to combat the many situations that lead to marginalisation, removal and abandonment."
"Among these, poverty must certainly come high up on the list."
"Unlike causes such as disease, anti-social behaviour, race or gender, this represents a condition for which civilised countries should organise ordinary preventive measures."
"A minimum income for citizens is a remedy, not a solution."
"In the resolution, I support the Commission's call to include State actions within a framework of European coordination and ensure that the minimum income is accompanied by an integrated approach that includes healthcare, education and housing."
"I also add my own personal appeal to the Commission, in other words, that actions to support inclusion with the aim of prevention should be prioritised in the 'Platform for combating poverty and social exclusion'."
"The Member States cannot be insensitive to situations of extreme poverty, and they must ensure that no one is simply left to their fate in situations that are often deeply degrading."
"Extraordinary and exceptional help should be considered in these precise cases."
"Nevertheless, experiences such as the Portuguese one of awarding minimum incomes without truly effective monitoring, but with an enormous number of people who are registered as beneficiaries, who could and should work, but neither work nor try to, are a perversion of the approach that must be addressed."
"I therefore abstained because of the fact that the aspects of proper monitoring of the system that I have described call it into question, both from a financial and a moral point of view."
"The Member States cannot be insensitive to situations of extreme poverty and must ensure that no one is simply left to their fate, in situations that are often deeply degrading."
"Extraordinary and exceptional help should be considered, strictly in these cases."
"Nevertheless, experiences, such as the Portuguese one, of awarding minimum incomes without any truly effective monitoring, but with an enormous number of people who are registered as benefit claimants who could and should work, but neither work nor try to, constitute a perversion of the logic that should be contemplated."
"That is why I abstained: because of the fact that the described aspects of proper monitoring of the system call it into question, both financially and morally."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the role of minimum income in combating poverty and promoting an inclusive society in Europe, because I agree with most of the requests and opinions it contains; for example, the fact that Member States, the Council and the Commission need to implement 'concrete measures to eradicate poverty and social exclusion' and that 'combating poverty begins with the creation of decent, sustainable jobs for groups at a disadvantage on the labour market'."
"On that point, I consider its advocacy of the establishment of a minimum income threshold in all Member States to be of great value, so that everyone, whether or not they are employed, can live with dignity."
"I supported this resolution because, in general, it demands greater social intervention to combat the poverty suffered by millions of citizens."
"To that end, it demands that Member States and the European institutions establish concrete measures to promote reintegration into the labour market worthy of those people who are living in poverty."
"As a female Member, it particularly disturbs me that in the present economic crisis, women in the EU are threatened by extreme poverty much more than men."
"If you look at the figures from Eurostat, 27% of women today, before receipt of social security, are at risk of poverty."
"In European society, the sustained trend towards the feminisation of poverty shows that the existing framework of social security systems and the various social, economic and employment policy measures adopted in the EU are not designed for the needs of women or for abolishing the existing disparities relating to women's employment."
"I therefore support the rapporteur, who says that women's poverty and social exclusion in Europe require concrete, diverse and gender-based policy solutions, and accordingly, I also supported the raising of this issue with my vote."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Figueiredo's report."
"Work represents the greatest priority for the population."
"The solidarity on which the European model of social market economy is based and the coordination of national responses are vital."
"The initiatives undertaken by individual states will be ineffective unless we have coordinated action at EU level."
"It is therefore essential that the European Union speak with a single strong voice and have a common vision, subsequently allowing individual states a choice over the concrete application of measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"In the social market economy enshrined in and fostered by the treaty, the public authorities must implement settlement measures with the aim of accelerating and facilitating the achievement of balance in order to prevent difficulties for the public or at least minimise them."
"We need social policies to protect families, limiting inequality and the impact and the effects of the crisis."
"We need to improve systems of social protection by implementing long-term policies, also with regard to jobs, giving greater stability to employment while avoiding unsustainable burdens on our national budgets."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution - Amendment 3 - (Article 157(4) of the Rules of Procedure) to replace non-legislative motion for a resolution on the role of minimum income in combating poverty and promoting an inclusive society in Europe."
"This provision, especially in the present times of economic crisis, does not conflict with the principle of a social market economy, a principle to which I subscribe unreservedly."
"Poverty is a major social problem all over the world, and unfortunately, the EU is not immune."
"Moreover, the already protracted financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has exacerbated the poverty of people within Europe, creating a new wave of poor in some countries, such as Portugal, and even affecting what is commonly referred to as the middle class."
"The allocation of a minimum income is an important social measure with a significant impact in economic terms, and many see it as a moral obligation."
"The crucial thing is that this minimum income is regulated in such a way that it acts as a lever to elevate people in poverty to an acceptable standard of living, and that it can never be an incentive for people to act passively in a difficult situation, namely by potentially lacking commitment in looking for a job."
"Poverty is a reality which affects people whose income is insufficient to provide them with an acceptable living, with the number of people in this situation on the increase due to the current crisis."
"In 2008, 17% of the EU's population (approximately 85 million people) were exposed to the threat of poverty."
"The at-risk-of-poverty rate was higher for children and young people up to the age of 17 than for the total population, reaching 20% in the EU-27, with the highest rate being recorded in Romania (33%)."
"The at-risk-of-poverty rate for those in employment was 8% on average in the EU-27, with the highest rate again in Romania (17%)."
"I voted for the need to adopt a system for calculating the minimum income (equivalent to at least 60% of median income in the Member State concerned) in every Member State, consisting of specific measures supporting people whose income is insufficient with a funding supply and by facilitating access to services."
"This step could be one of the most effective ways to combat poverty, guarantee an adequate standard of living and foster social integration."
"Lifting 20 million European citizens out of poverty by 2020, such is the ambitious target set by the EU 2020 strategy, a target that could well remain a pious hope if Europe does not come to grips with the growing impoverishment that now affects more than 80 million citizens."
"That is why the introduction at European level of a minimum subsistence income or its expansion to all Member States is important."
"Designed to be the 'last safety net', minimum income already plays a role in combating social exclusion."
"We now need to increase its effectiveness while bearing three main things in mind: we must keep the differential between minimum income and guaranteed minimum wage, because work must remain attractive and being in employment is still the best way not to fall into poverty; we must make minimum income a part of a coordinated and comprehensive policy for helping vulnerable people (access to accommodation, healthcare, childcare and homecare); and we must cross out heading I concerning the integration of objectives that are assigned to it, and harness minimum income as a means to assist financially, at a given time, a person or family experiencing hardship."
"Eighty-five million people are threatened with poverty in Europe."
"The economic crisis that we are going through is making young people (of whom one in five is unemployed), women and single parents even more vulnerable."
"Precarious conditions among workers are also increasing: the number of those who are affected by poverty is currently 19 million."
"Whereas 2010 was declared 'European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion', a recent Eurobarometer survey on citizens' opinion of the EU showed that 74% of them expect the EU to play an important role in this area."
"Let us listen to them and act."
"I supported the resolution on the role of a minimum income in tackling poverty and in promoting an inclusive society in Europe."
"Unfortunately, the 27 Member States do not all have a national minimum income."
"Consequently I supported the invitation made to the Commission to use its right of initiative in order to propose a framework directive establishing the principle of a suitable minimum income in Europe based on common criteria, although this invitation was unfortunately rejected."
"With our proposal for a framework directive on a minimum income, Parliament today had the chance to provide Europe with an essential tool for truly combating poverty and for giving every young person, adult and elderly person the right to an income high enough to lift them out of poverty and to enable them to live in dignity at last."
"This required political boldness and courage, to put an end to the outrageous scandal of long-term poverty."
"However, due to its cowardice and political inconsistency, the European right will carry the heavy responsibility of the failure of the EU 2020 strategy and will cause yet more disillusion among our fellow citizens and among all those organisations that fight day in day out for the most vulnerable."
"In a modern society populated by honest and active citizens, it would be an excellent thing to introduce a minimum income for those who happened to be unemployed."
"In actual fact, guaranteeing an income to those who do not work leads to a distortion of the world of work."
"Many people would, in fact, prefer not to seek jobs, supplementing their minimum guaranteed income with undeclared work or turning to petty crime."
"Such negative situations would certainly affect population groups less well-equipped for survival, particularly non-EU families who often have to make do with sharing small and therefore low cost accommodation with one another."
"The guarantee of widespread welfare will clearly lead the poorest peoples of the world to try and live in Europe because even though very little would be guaranteed them, this would certainly be better than nothing."
"I am firmly opposed to the report on those grounds."
"Poverty and social exclusion are a manifestation of lack of respect for human dignity."
"Combating the phenomenon is a priority of the European Union, and is also enshrined in the Millennium Development Goals."
"What can we do, and what tasks should we undertake in this respect?"
"The most important factors are education and ensuring conditions for development, since these are solutions that would teach people how to deal with the problem of poverty themselves by using their own potential, supported by systemic solutions."
"In other words, we should give them the know-how they need."
"In developing countries, it is important to support infrastructure building, particularly giving people access to clean water."
"Development aid must be linked to the creation of conditions for developing trade."
"Facilitating development and new jobs is the best way of combating poverty in various regions of the world, rich as well as poor."
"Poverty cannot be effectively tackled merely by means of administrative regulations, even those which set minimum incomes."
"The economic crisis has been aggravating the social inequalities in the EU."
"At the end of 2008, almost 17% of the European population - that is, 85 million people - were living below the poverty line."
"The effects of the crisis, namely increased unemployment and fewer job opportunities, have been leaving many people in a difficult situation."
"It is essential for Europe to involve itself in promoting a more inclusive society using poverty-eradication measures."
"2010 is the 'European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion', and one of the Europe 2020 strategy's objectives is reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million. The truth is that the level of poverty does not just affect social cohesion, but also the economy."
"Therefore, and taking into account Parliament's commitment to participate in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, I believe the minimum income scheme based on 60% of median income in the Member State concerned is an important contribution to economic and social cohesion."
"I voted in favour for the above reasons, and because I believe that the report highlights the need for concrete action towards more effective social and economic cohesion that respects subsidiarity."
"I voted against this report because it turns budgetary consolidation by the Member States on its head and contains the usual flowery Communist dross about inter-State transfers."
"Moreover, there is a very clear violation of the principle of subsidiarity in the social sphere."
"In the Federal Republic of Germany, social assistance and the State-guaranteed income via Hartz IV long-term unemployment benefits are already so high that for low-end jobs, it is not worthwhile working."
"In this connection, there needs to be a mandatory minimum separation between welfare payments and income."
"The prerequisite for all prosperity remains, as it always has been, healthy economic growth."
"Ladies and gentlemen, despite all the declarations on poverty reduction, social inequality has increased - approximately 85 million EU residents are at risk of poverty."
"This is a huge problem for Lithuania, since 20% of our population is at risk of poverty."
"We need a strong employment policy which would stimulate growth and competitiveness in the European social market economy and would prevent macro-economic imbalance and guarantee social inclusion."
"However, that is not enough to combat unemployment."
"Simply having work does not offer protection from poverty."
"The increase in precarious employment and low wages means that the percentage of workers at risk of poverty is rising."
"According to EU reports, the incomes of more than 20% of full-time workers in Lithuania are less than 60% of average incomes, whereas the EU average is 14%."
"An increase in the minimum monthly wage would help reduce poverty, but would not guarantee a society without isolation."
"Mostly young people leave Lithuania, not just because of a lack of money and work (last year, unemployment among Lithuania's young people reached almost 30%), but also because they feel abandoned and powerless against decisions taken that have an impact on their daily lives."
"This must change."
"in writing. - Despite efforts around the globe and commitments from many international institutions, the EU included, the fight against poverty is still far from won."
"The percentage of people living in poverty in Europe increased from 16% to 17% between 2005 and 2008."
"Across Europe, there is consensus among governments and people alike that we must fight to eradicate poverty."
"As we consider the Europe 2020 commitments, we must once again think about what measures can be taken to fight poverty."
"I support the Figueiredo report, which calls for a re-evaluation of the EU's commitments to fighting poverty and social exclusion and for the inclusion of challenging but achievable and clear objectives in the Europe 2020 Agenda."
"I echo the call of the European people to put an end to poverty and inequality through the implementation of effective, inclusive and forward-looking strategies that fight proactively against global poverty."
"Around 85 million people in the EU are currently facing the threat of poverty."
"This includes various different groups: children and young people up to the age of 17 have a higher risk of poverty, which, in specific terms, means that one in five children and young people are victims of poverty."
"Elderly people also face a higher risk of poverty than the general population."
"In 2008, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for people aged 65 years and over stood at 19%."
"However, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for those in employment was 8% on average in 2008 - the so-called 'working poor'."
"The concept of a minimum income will contribute significantly to the social integration of groups that are at risk."
"However, in the drawing up of the directive, the greatest possible attention needs to be paid to maximum control and avoidance of any possible 'exploitation' of this social assistance."
"If we just look at the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, there are 23 million people who need to receive unemployment benefits in order to be able to live with dignity."
"I voted in favour of this report as it supports the continuation of the work carried out by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis which, since its creation, has reached a conclusion and made specific recommendations on certain points."
"However, more in-depth work is still needed to reach an exchange with the national parliaments on this basis, to transform these recommendations into legislative proposals and to translate the resulting objectives into a programme of work."
"Putting a stop to work by this special committee would give the impression that the crisis had been overcome, when the financial market situation has not been stabilised and the economic and social effects of this huge crash are still unknown, with a profound, long-term impact."
"All the files opened or to be opened now, namely, the Europe 2020 strategy and new directives, economic governance, financial perspectives, regulation and supervision, reform of global governance and EU representation, should start by acknowledging the crisis of the current model."
"Among other things, such a continuation would allow this multiple agenda to be followed up in depth, and the analysis and political recommendations to be developed based on a programme of work to be defined, and on that basis, would allow a follow-up report to be drawn up for the second half of 2011."
"I voted against the report because the attack on the working class by the capitalist system and its political representatives is a blanket attack which has nothing to do with either financial deficits or excessive debt."
"The stand taken by Community officers and in the European Parliament resolution confirms that."
"The infighting between the imperialists cannot be overcome and will get progressively worse."
"The EU and G20 are making simple plans to slash grassroots incomes, to put grassroots property into the hands of big business and increase their profits, to increase the exploitation of the working class and to cut insurance and labour rights."
"The blanket measures decided strengthen the monopolies and shift the burden of the capitalist crisis on to the workers' shoulders; at the same time, the EU and the plutocracy are trying to gild the pill by promoting new models of economic governance and green economies and are promising that there is light at the end of the tunnel in order to generate vain hope and wheedle assent out of society."
"The massive demonstrations in Greece, France, Italy and other countries are blatant proof that the choices made by the capitalist system are rejected by the workers."
"This rejection can - and must - become a rejection of the monopolies and imperialism and must be turned into a fight for grassroots power."
"The EU 2020 strategy is critically important for the competitiveness, sustainability and social characteristics of the Union and I voted in favour of what the report says about directing more attention towards initiatives related to the energy, research and innovation sector, as well as health and education matters in the years ahead."
"I totally agree that education matters should be at the core of the Union's economic strategy and that there should be more support for programmes such as 'Lifelong Learning', 'Erasmus' and 'Leonardo' for education and training abroad and that the people of Europe should be given greater access to these programmes."
"Research and development is crucial for competitiveness, and students and researchers must be given support and encouragement when trying to avail of cross-border mobility, while access to funding must be transparent and simplified."
"I also support what the report says about improving the ability of small and medium-sized enterprises to obtain credit, reducing the bureaucracy associated with public procurement contracts for SMEs, and establishing a one-stop shop for addressing those companies' administrative issues."
"There have been a variety of factors in the current crisis: the speculative behaviour of the financial markets, and the development of internal demand over recent years based on consumer credit, among other things."
"There are many reasons, which we have discussed a great deal in Parliament, but we need to look to the future."
"The future is part of fulfilling the content of this initiative."
"In order to do so, Europe needs to overcome the problem of the ageing population."
"It must regulate, reorganise and supervise the Union's financial market, improve its coordination, and use this strength to play an active role at global level."
"It must adopt measures to improve coordination between the different levels of governance, define a new model of economic growth that goes hand in hand with human and social development and focus on European solidarity, improving competitiveness, quality, improving education, innovation, new technologies, and on knowledge."
"This is the only way that we will be able to ensure that Europe is a great opportunity for the world."
"We have voted on an extremely long and very complicated report, with an intricate text and structure."
"There is one thing, however, that is quite unconvincing: the real, deep-seated cause that unleashed the economic crisis we find ourselves in was not given adequate attention, although it is included in the recitals of the text."
"The cause was not contingent, but structural - and not just in economic terms."
"The financial crisis was caused, primarily, by the illusion, cultivated by the world's financial and political elites, that in the third millennium, the economy and wealth could be based more on finance than on the production of goods, more on the astonishing creation of products of financial engineering than on that which is really created, produced, sold and marketed by hundreds and hundreds of millions of enterprises across the world."
"Unless we recognise the economic and political importance of restoring the real economy, rather than the virtual economy, the report runs the risk of making a fatal mistake: suggesting ways out of the crisis which would ultimately not be a real solution."
"Europe does not need further centralisation of economic powers at EU level."
"Europe needs enterprise and less bureaucracy."
"I have therefore voted against the report."
"I voted for this report because the current financial crisis that has affected the economic and financial sectors has caused a general economic and social crisis in which European citizens continue to live in poverty, social inequalities are becoming even more pronounced, and the number of poor workers is also increasing."
"I would like to underline that the recession was further exacerbated by the fact that the various national economic recovery plans are insufficiently coordinated, because it is highly likely that with coordination at European Union level, it would be possible to have a greater impact than that which can be achieved with most programmes at national level."
"According to the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Union has committed to combating unemployment and increasing employment and reducing poverty and social exclusion, but this strategy must be a concerted effort - part of the crisis management and post-crisis strategic planning process."
"I agree with the position of Parliament that this European Union strategic objective should also be pursued by cooperating closely with national governments, social partners and civil society, and that the European Parliament should be involved to a greater extent in its execution."
"The adoption of this complex report represents a very important step for the European community who are calling loudly for clear responses and quick solutions to overcome this difficult economic crisis."
"I voted in favour because the text adopted today includes principles that have always formed the basis of my group's economic policy."
"I refer, for example, to the need for greater budgetary consolidation, reinforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact and completion of the single market."
"I am, in fact, convinced that Europe needs radical transformation to double its growth potential and this result can only be achieved by greater coordination of Member State's economic and fiscal policies."
"Before this, however, I consider it necessary to review the financial regulation sector that has proved not only fallacious but one of the main causes of the crisis."
"The EU must also quickly face up to various challenges, beginning with employment, the demographic challenge and the pension system."
"Even before this, we need to implement policies to support SMEs, the driving force and economic heart of Europe, above all, by promoting fiscal packages and incentives that allow easier access to credit."
"I voted for this report as I agree that the Commission should take responsibility for ensuring the monitoring and funding of projects in the following areas: new investment in research and the development and deployment of renewable energy, in energy efficiency, especially in the European building stock, as well as in resource-use efficiency more generally; strengthening the European energy network by interconnecting national networks and distributing power from major centres of renewable energy production to consumers, as well as introducing new forms of energy storage and the European High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) 'super-grid'; promoting EU space-based infrastructures in the area of radio navigation and earth observation in order to foster the provision of new EU services and the development of innovative applications, as well as to facilitate implementation of EU legislation and policies; providing fast Internet access throughout the Union, ensuring the rapid execution of the EU's digital agenda and providing all citizens with reliable, free access."
"in writing. - This report takes a detailed and thorough look at the causes of the economic crisis and the developments that have been made at EU level in order to prevent, pre-empt or at least diminish the impact of future crises."
"The conclusions that have been established in the report are well balanced and present an accurate overview of the causes and effects of the crisis."
"The report also adds value to the current debate concerning the possible ways forward in this regard."
"I have thus decided to vote in favour of this report."
"Whereas the recession that we have been through since the summer of 2007 will have cost USD 60 trillion, and the recovery is not guaranteed, I voted for this text because through this vote, together with fellow MEPs, we wanted to prove that political responsibility and ambition can go hand-in-hand."
"As an alternative to the cacophony between the Commission, the Van Rompuy working group and the Merkel-Sarkozy tandem on economic governance, we are suggesting a clear proposal: creating a Mr or Mrs Euro responsible for the internal and external consistency of the Union's economic policy choices."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Berès report because of my support for the vast majority of its contents."
"There is, however, a need for continued detailed debate on one issue in particular, a CCCTB."
"I agree it is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime."
"However, particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland, whose prosperity and employment levels depend, to a large extent, on its capacity to attract foreign investment."
"I wish to note also that the Irish Labour Party does not support a CCCTB."
"I voted against the report, because the left cannot accept a report born of compromise between the socialists and the European right, a report which does not get to the heart of the problem, namely, the basic causes of the economic and social crisis."
"The report binds Parliament politically to the disastrous neoliberal proposals by Merkel, Sarkozy and the task force to tighten up the treaties and the Stability Pact, which will break up the social state and disenfranchise the workers."
"Our side criticised the anti-social, anti-growth Stability Pact, the institutional and political weaknesses of EMU, the anti-democratic way in which the ECB functions and the unbalanced growth within the EU, and proposed ways of getting out of the crisis which respected labour and social rights."
"Unfortunately, however, the spirit and letter of the text remain faithful to disastrous neoliberal policies which work to the detriment of the workers, lead to recession and unemployment and are exacerbating the crisis."
"The crisis has taught us a tough lesson and it still has much to teach us about the static and dynamic aspects of economic policies."
"It is our task to learn from these lessons and put them in practice in order to get going again."
"We need to avoid the mistakes that were made in the past and recognise the phenomena that had not been identified before, but, above all, we need to be thorough in establishing the relationships between the real economy and finance, protecting employment and general welfare from shocks of this kind. However, the European Union must do more."
"It must create added value, strengthen the instruments that have worked well (such as the currency), refine those that can be improved (such as the coordination of fiscal and budgetary policies), and create economies of scale for a rapid and long-lasting recovery."
"I find it very positive that Parliament is reflecting on these issues and that it continues to monitor the situation, as long as these signs are translated into tangible and effective measures."
"We voted in favour of this report, but we voted against, and are strongly opposed to, the recommendation for the introduction of a financial transaction tax and the distribution of the debt amongst the countries of the euro area."
"I voted to adopt this report for two reasons."
"The first reason is that its authors have done a wonderful job, reflected in an extensive analysis of the causes and impact of the economic crisis on the global economy, on the one hand, and on the European economy, on the other."
"The second reason why I voted for it is that the report contains a series of important recommendations featuring in the section of the report entitled 'The future - a Europe of added value'."
"We must acknowledge that a short-term, narrow focus on profit has led to the loss of a huge number of jobs in Europe in industries offering high added value, while creating precarious and poor quality jobs."
"It is time to reverse the trend and reindustrialise the European Union and restore its ability to be innovative and create jobs in sectors linked to R&D and new technologies."
"I welcome this vote for it was important to mention at last the issue of sanctions for non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which the Member States all too often happily disregard."
"We need to create an effective system of incentives and penalties relating to the implementation of the SGP which would help ensure that the current crisis does not become any worse and that any future crisis is averted."
"That is why I supported the paragraph in which the Commission is asked to introduce a binding system of penalties unequivocally under its control to force Member States to comply with SGP rules."
"The crisis has revealed the shortcomings of Economic and Monetary Union: it nearly brought down the euro and has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs throughout the continent."
"With Pervenche Berès's report, the European Parliament has just adopted a coherent strategy proposal to lift Europe out of the recession and to address the latter's financial, economic and social repercussions."
"This proposal includes the introduction of real financial supervision, which we have started to implement, but which will have to be considerably strengthened; the taxing of financial transactions in order to regulate the markets and finance public assets, and to reduce public deficits; the coordination of Member States' economic policies and budgets for the benefit of sustainable growth; the appointment of a Mr or Mrs Euro to be in charge of the euro area and to unify its representation at the G20 and IMF; and the creation of the European Energy Community."
"It is now time for Europe to get going again."
"This is what the public expects."
"In a constantly changing world, inertia is tantamount to decline."
"That is why we now need to move on from this report and take practical action."
"I voted for the report on the financial, economic and social crisis: recommendations concerning measures and initiatives to be taken, because it sets out concrete measures for overcoming the economic and social crisis through the construction of a genuine European social market economy, with a view to sustained growth, employment and social inclusion."
"The effects of the economic and financial crisis are persisting well beyond what we might have hoped, with ever more serious social repercussions."
"As I have argued, and as this report also substantiates, this crisis has shown that we need more Europe."
"In a large area that has borders open to free movement and an internal market, it has become unacceptable to allow the resistance of a system of mediation, monitoring and supervision based on the power of individual states, which is small and limited in scope given the situation in Europe and the rest of the world."
"The strengthening of economic governance, financial supervision and the power to coordinate policies and economic and monetary matters on the part of the EU institutions will ensure greater stability and a greater ability to act swiftly and efficiently."
"I would like to highlight the recognition of the importance of the Europe 2020 strategy, where research and innovation are central to the competitiveness of companies and job creation."
"I would like to reiterate the importance of the internal market and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for the revival and dynamisation of the economy, to which end measures are being deployed to promote their consolidation and sustained development."
"I voted against this report because the rapporteur's initial proposal has been distorted, and positions have been included that urge the application of measures that were at the root of the crisis."
"It also calls for penalties for Member States that do not comply with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Although it has kept the odd proposal here and there in the social field, its general direction is negative."
"By contrast, the proposals that we were endorsing in the plenary sitting were rejected, specifically in the following areas:"
"The rejection of the Commission's recent legislative proposals on economic governance, including penalties - which will have depressive effects on the already weak growth rates in the Member States - while advocating an ambitious European plan of investments to foster jobs."
"The welcoming of the widespread participation in the European day of mobilisation against austerity and insecurity organised by the unions on 29 September 2010, stressing its important political significance and expressing support for their demands, demanding secure jobs for a living wage, strong social protection and protection of purchasing power, the guarantee of better pensions, and the guarantee of high quality public and social services that are accessible to all."
"The strong condemnation of the role played by tax havens in encouraging and carrying out fraud, tax evasion and capital flight."
"in writing. - (FR) As is usual when faced with the economic, social and financial crisis in this Chamber, the report by Mrs Berès overlooks the main issues and concentrates on saving the system rather than fundamentally calling it into question."
"This report even adds a profession of faith among the self-regulating virtues of the market, which it pretends to believe can be made more ethical."
"It believes in the benefits of global competition and of the free and unrestricted movement of capital and goods."
"Supervising a system that does not work will not enable us to avoid its worst aberrations."
"The banking system has demonstrated its cynicism by repaying in advance the State aid that did, after all, prevent it from going under, so that it can avoid having to change its behaviour, including its most scandalous practices."
"The entire global financial system, such as it exists today, is harmful to the real economy."
"It encourages speculation and the creation of complex products, products that are often opaque and potentially toxic."
"It produces wealth founded on hot air."
"It forces businesses to follow extremely short-term strategies, and it favours shareholders at the expense of other economic stakeholders."
"Pretending to supervise it is not enough."
"It must be changed."
"Beyond the loss of millions of jobs across the European continent and the various threats to the Euro, the recession has had the effect of highlighting the absence of strong and harmonised economic governance within the European Union and the failings in financial supervision."
"So if I voted in favour of this resolution, it is because it intends to remedy these ills and promotes the introduction of a tax on financial transactions which would have the advantage of limiting speculation on financial transactions, of regulating the markets, of financing public assets, but also of reducing public deficit."
"This is a powerful measure that I have been earnestly calling for for a long time and I welcome it."
"I supported the report by my French socialist colleague, Mrs Bérès, on the financial, economic and social crisis."
"This ambitious text proposes many ideas and solutions for coming out of the recession, securing a sustainable recovery and preventing similar financial crises from happening again through governance and supervision mechanisms."
"With this vote, the European Parliament proves that political responsibility and ambition can go hand-in-hand."
"Priority is given to employment, since the economic recovery is in danger of taking place without a reduction in unemployment."
"The text calls for establishing a true European Community for energy."
"The appointment of a Mr/Mrs Euro responsible for the economic and monetary choices of the Union would also be a major advance."
"Finally, the text reminds us of the need for a tax on financial transactions so that those responsible for the recession are made to contribute at last."
"in writing. - The Fine Gael MEPs do not support the proposal for a directive on a common consolidated corporate tax base but did not see this as grounds for voting against this important report as a whole."
"The Danish Liberal Party abstained from voting in the final vote on the Berès report on the financial crisis as it positively recommends the establishment of a financial transaction tax."
"in writing. - I, along with my Labour colleagues, voted in favour of the Berès report because of my support for the vast majority of its contents."
"There is, however, a need for continued, detailed debate on one issue in particular, a CCCTB."
"I agree it is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime."
"However, particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland, whose prosperity and employment levels depend, to a large extent, on its capacity to attract foreign investment."
"I wish to note also that the Irish Labour Party does not support a CCCTB."
"The Berès report covers issues of importance to the stability of the euro area, which I voted for."
"However, I abstained in the final vote, because I believe that, firstly, a general and simplified approach is being taken to the economic and financial problems of the EU and to the measures that need to be taken and, secondly, it refers to the Commission proposals on sanctions for undisciplined Member States, such as other fiscal or financial measures, which the European Parliament has not yet debated and on which it has not yet reached any conclusions."
"I therefore reserve the right to express a specific opinion at a later date."
"I voted in favour of the Berès report because I believe in the need for effective cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission to find a way out of the economic and financial crisis."
"The International Monetary Fund recently made public an analysis of the current state of the world economy, showing that the recovery process is still fragile and patchy."
"In effect, we are facing two different scenarios: on the one hand, a stage of strong growth for emerging countries and, on the other, high levels of unemployment and an overall slow rate of recovery in economically more advanced States."
"I therefore believe that it would be useful to embark on a path with the aim of guaranteeing appropriate solidity of public finances to maintain confidence in the markets and ensure that the public can again believe in the worth of the European project."
"I voted in favour of the report by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, which represents a constructive compromise between all the groups involved."
"We do not need less Europe, we need more of it!"
"Our national economies are closely intertwined - national egotisms will only intensify the crisis."
"This report calls for Europe to be unanimous on essential issues."
"Sustainable EU financial, economic and employment policy needs to be the cornerstone of our action."
"The recommendations for action show a clear way forward: in future, businesses must have their credit ratings assessed by an independent EU ratings agency."
"An end must be put to high risk speculation through a financial transactions tax."
"The Stability and Growth Pact needs to be better connected to the Europe 2020 strategy."
"We are unambiguous in calling on the Commission to create a balance between growth, equality of opportunity and financial market stability."
"There is a need to reduce the taxation on work in order to strengthen investment and thus, Europe's competitiveness."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, need easier access to credit."
"In the social sphere, the advancement of human resources - through real, tangible measures to get people trained and qualified - takes top priority."
"Numerous public hearings, workshops and analyses have enabled us, as committee members, to make well-founded, fact-based contributions to the public debate."
"It is important for Parliament to offer clear answers to crises."
"Only in that way can we strengthen our credibility and reliability in the eyes of the citizens."
"My vote in favour of the report is entirely due to the new agreement obtained thanks, above all, to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"The draft initially tabled by the rapporteur was a clear ideological provocation and therefore had to be altered in its entirety."
"According to the International Monetary Fund, the priorities are to correct the remaining fragilities in the financial sector, ensure strong growth in demand and employment, maintain debt sustainability, work for greater equilibrium in world growth, and to resolve the challenges deriving from widespread and volatile movements of capital."
"The report, in which the contingent necessity of ensuring adequate solidity in the public finances to maintain confidence in the financial and real markets is recognised, is perfectly in tune with the last budget approved by the Italian Government, which aims to reduce the deficit to below the 3% threshold."
"The constitution of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis (CRIS) was aimed at diagnosing the factors that led to the crisis, determining what the EU failed to notice which meant that the crisis was unexpected, and devising future measures and initiatives to avoid similar situations and to be able to revitalise economies and definitively halt the crisis scenarios that persist in some Member States."
"I believe that the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis has carried out its tasks well and that in this document, it sets out new paths, measures and initiatives which will allow the EU to be much better prepared for any crises that might occur in the future."
"I support Mrs Berès's report, which calls for more Europe and not less, for more efficiency and less bureaucracy, and for one European Union voice on the international stage."
"Despite the return to growth, we should not be mistaken in believing that the recession is entirely behind us, and, above all, that we have solved its causes."
"If there is one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, it is the absence of world governance (absence of a world State)."
"We need a fairer distribution of wealth between countries and within each country."
"Therein lies the real crisis."
"That is why I am in favour of the European Council convening a G20 summit exclusively dedicated to this issue."
"With respect to development, I would stress - as Mrs Berès does in her report - that it is important for Member States to honour their 2005 commitments in terms of official development assistance (ODA)."
"Nothing justifies a reduction in official development assistance."
"Official development assistance should carry on increasing and should not suffer the consequences of the financial crisis."
"The financial crisis put an end to the fairytale of self-regulating financial markets."
"In particular, the non-transparency of financial products and high-risk packaged structures, together with the United States' soft currency policy and conflicts of interest in terms of ratings, gave rise to a global financial crisis."
"The Member States of the EU and their populations have plenty of food for thought in connection with the resultant economic crisis, with its growing rate of unemployment and social service sector cuts."
"The rescue packages were only able to arrest the downward spiral in the short term."
"In the long term, they only displace the underlying problems."
"The crisis must absolutely not be used to extend EU competences."
"Eurocracy and bureaucracy are no answer to the crisis."
"Rather, thanks to their enforced conformity and the fact that they ignore cultural differences, they helped to create it."
"I am all in favour of better coordination and consultation at the EU level."
"European-level economic governance, on the other hand, must be rejected in the strongest terms, and I therefore definitively reject this report."
"I voted in favour of the mid-term report of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis."
"As a member of this Special Committee, I took an active part in the proceedings and contributed to the production of this report."
"In particular, I believe that within the social market economy, as recognised and made an objective by the treaty, the public system should make some adjustments aimed at accelerating and facilitating the reaching of an equilibrium, in order to avoid losses and difficulties, or to limit them to the minimum level."
"Instead of leaving the search for new paths to take to the production sector, which must undergo radical change, we need to address transformation plans, credit, changes of direction and other suitable means."
"Europe must once again attract investment and production, establishing itself as a worldwide model for innovation and growth."
"Public and private financial institutions must do their best to ensure that the markets work to benefit the real economy and small and medium-sized enterprises, in order to put them in a position to contribute to the economic recovery and growth in Europe."
"I abstained on the Berès report, because the proposals on European economic governance do not address the structural problems of incomplete economic union and do not alleviate the asymmetry between 'truncated' economic union and full monetary union."
"More to the point, I abstained because they do not Europeanise economic policies and the economic risk."
"They only Europeanise the penalties, which are now even stricter."
"There are no strategic guidelines whatsoever to safeguard balanced growth and stimulate the competitiveness of all Member States."
"I voted for this report because I believe that the Commission should ensure the steering and financing of projects in the following fields: (1) the research, development and deployment of renewable energy; (2) strengthening the European energy network, along with using new forms of energy storage and the European High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) 'super-grid'; (3) promoting space infrastructure in the EU in the field of radio navigation and earth observation; (4) providing fast Internet access; (5) developing EU leadership in the field of e-Health; (6) completing the development of, and creating common standards for, electric mobility."
"In terms of financial regulation, Parliament should seek to establish a system of regulation and supervision that does not leave out any financial market, instrument or institution."
"The following should therefore be significant: (1) introducing more counter-cyclical regulation; (2) reducing systemic risk posed by large institutions and derivative markets; (3) strengthening pan-European and global regulation and supervisory structures; (4) investigating the use of off-balance sheet transactions; (5) introducing a tax on financial transactions; (6) introducing new standards on statistical data on the financial sector."
"This mid-term report on the financial, economic and social crisis represents a useful tool for analysing the current financial situation in Europe but, above all, it indicates the main road that Europe must boldly take to prevent situations such as these from happening again."
"I believe that to do this, as the report rightly says, Europe must immediately set up strong and authoritative bodies that are able to offer standard governance for economic policies in all States."
"I am convinced that Europe can no longer stand by and watch Member States come up with fragmented and inconsistent responses to economic crises whose consequences are a real threat to the growth potential of our economies."
"The process of Member States converting the EU 2020 strategy into national programmes must help establish a more competitive, social and sustainable European Union, which places citizens and environmental protection at the heart of policy making."
"Member States' priorities must be focused on high quality jobs and ensuring that labour markets operate properly, as well as guaranteeing the existence of appropriate social conditions with a view to improving employment performance."
"The rate of unemployment among the EU population is 10% on average, reaching 20% in some countries and more than 40% for young people."
"This highlights the importance of high quality, responsible public spending combined with fostering the entrepreneurial and innovative potential of the private sector in order to drive economic and social progress."
"I voted to support the need for Member States to draw up viable programmes which will boost the labour market by improving incentives and conditions for workers, while also making the incentives more attractive for employers to recruit and retain staff."
"At the same time, emphasis must be placed on decent work, which includes combating undeclared work, and on providing access to the labour market to people who are currently excluded from it."
"I was sad to vote against the Berès report."
"Frankly, the first version was promising, in terms both of its analysis of the causes of the crisis and of many of the proposals for overcoming it."
"However, the demands of the groups on the right have distorted the original report on critical issues."
"Although it is true that several good proposals are retained - such as the creation of a European Credit Rating Agency - it is also true that, with regard to economic governance, the report has been returned to the 'Brussels Consensus'."
"As the choice is between deficit and public debt or growth and employment, and as the report is undecided on this crucial issue, I cannot support it."
"I voted in favour of this report as I agree that the Commission should take responsibility for ensuring the monitoring and funding of projects, particularly in the areas of new investment in research and the development and deployment of renewable energy, and also the provision of fast Internet access throughout the Union, ensuring the rapid execution of the EU's digital agenda."
"In terms of financial regulation, Parliament should seek to establish a system of regulation and supervision that does not leave out any financial markets, instruments or institutions."
"In order to reach such an agreement, pan-European and global regulation and supervisory structures will need to be strengthened."
"in writing. - I am glad the report was adopted by an overwhelming majority but overall, because the attempt by ALDE to weaken the paragraph on the financial transaction tax failed and the text based on our amendment, calling for the introduction of an FTT at EU level as a first step, passed."
"This report is the outcome of a compromise because no fewer than 1 625 amendments were tabled on it and it is divided into a series of key points covering the causes of the crisis, ranging from the property bubble to unsecured bank products, the lack of European tax harmonisation and the failure to observe the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We are all able to see the effects for ourselves: reduced wealth and unemployment."
"The answers can only be to create new employment by promoting enterprise and research and development, adopting measures that reward transparency and foster common European rules, for example, on tax, VAT and indirect taxation."
"The only thing that is dubious is the introduction of a new tax on financial transactions, which would effectively become the first European tax directly financing the Union budget."
"We cannot accept the fact that Europe should put its hands into the already empty pockets of its citizens during a time of crisis such as the one we are experiencing at the moment."
"The European Union is currently experiencing what must be its most serious economic and social crisis since it was founded."
"This sets the great challenge of finding responses to the current situation, with a view to long-term prospects."
"I welcome the creation of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, as well as this report."
"I advocate the need for economic governance mechanisms, not least by coordinating and supervising the policies of the Member States regarding the sustainability of public finances."
"However, I find it regrettable that the European Parliament is not more involved in this strategic exercise of seeking solutions to the crisis: it is desirable for both the European Parliament and the national parliaments to be more closely involved in the future."
"I would stress the importance of cohesion instruments in this process."
"Firstly, the EU needs to strengthen coordination, and make better use of cooperation between the various levels of governance and the different policies."
"Second, territorial specificities and the asymmetrical impact of the crisis should be taken into account."
"As is stressed in the report, in fact, the strength of the cohesion policy in establishing a link between recovery and long-term growth is exactly as follows: establishing strategic guidelines, and giving the Member States and regions cause to implement them, and grant the instruments to pursue the objectives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Europe has become a victim not just of the financial and social crisis."
"We are also experiencing a huge crisis in public confidence."
"Both in Lithuania and throughout Europe, we must regain public confidence in our financial and political institutions and establish a viable and sustainable financial system, which would offer protection from future crises."
"We need a transparent, multi-level regulation mechanism, based on healthy morality, which would serve the general public."
"The financial crisis dealt Lithuania a particularly severe blow - in 2009, our economy shrank by 15%."
"In drawing up a crisis exit strategy, we should take regional features and the varying impact of the crisis into account."
"I welcome the fact that the special committee stresses the importance of cohesion instruments crucial for providing assistance to the EU regions that need it most."
"They may help us overcome the consequences of the crisis by supporting essential investment in infrastructure, businesses and job creation."
"The success of the recovery also depends a lot on the success of the EU 2020 strategy."
"It is important for any long-term EU investment strategy to be concerned with maintaining competitiveness and strengthening the internal market (one of the main engines of European growth)."
"in writing. - Recent years have shown how our economies are interdependent, and the problems that can be caused by lack of legislation regulation or cohesion of economies across Europe."
"As we steer our way out of the crisis, we must look to European solutions that promise to build a stronger European economy and better-integrated financial systems that benefit the people of Wales and the whole European Union."
"I therefore voted in favour of the recommendations concerning the measures and initiatives to be taken following the financial, economic and social crisis as present in the Berès report."
"We must look towards common solutions to Europe's problems, whilst respecting the choice of each EU Member State by allowing them to decide how we progress."
"The Council, Commission and Parliament must work together to ensure that we build a stronger, more robust, global economy that works for the European Union as a whole."
"The European Parliament has adopted today, Wednesday 20 October, the report by its Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left voted against this report, because the proposals it contains are somewhat surreal and totally ignore the social rallies that have been taking place for several months in EU Member States against austerity plans, anti-social measures and the dismantling of social security systems and public services: these are the only measures envisaged to limit the Member States' budget deficits."
"This report follows on from the pension counter-reform put forward by Nicolas Sarkozy and his government, which the French protest movement has been fighting against and condemning for several weeks now."
"This report thus continues to praise the Stability Pact and the measures and policies that we have been condemning for years and which our fellow citizens increasingly regard as a failure."
"The very large majority (501 votes for) that voted for this report obviously does not understand the message of those citizens who have been protesting across Europe for several weeks against the austerity plans and their associated counter-reforms."
"I voted in favour of the report that was presented and discussed here today, as it represents a step forward for the EU by advocating the establishment of an institution like the European Monetary Fund (EMF), and thus leading to the establishment of an overseer of sovereign debt developments to complement the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) as a mechanism of last resort for the Member States."
"It is also worth highlighting the proposal to establish a high-level policy group chaired by the Commission with a mandate to study potential institutional changes within the ongoing economic governance reforms, including the possibility of creating a European Common Treasury (ECT), with the objective of endowing the EU with its own financing resources and reducing its dependence on national transfers, as well as producing a feasibility assessment in order to establish, in the long run, a system under which Member States may participate in the issuance of common European obligations."
"Thus, with a proper impact assessment and by spelling out the different legal alternatives, along with a clear definition of the objectives and financing for European infrastructure, the long-term strategic projects for building a stronger EU will be easier to achieve."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted for this report."
"The current economic, financial and social crisis has shown that the existing economic governance model in the Union has not worked as effectively as it was envisaged."
"In recent years, there has been insufficient convergence between Member States, and macro-economic and fiscal imbalances have remained and even become larger in the last decade."
"The surveillance framework was too weak and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact were not sufficiently respected, in particular, as regards preventive provisions."
"I agree with the proposals given in the document that we must aim to better coordinate actions with and between Member States, particularly in order to prevent a repetition of the situation that came about recently."
"It is crucial for Member States to apply in full the rules and decisions agreed at EU level, such as the rules and instruments of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The greatest attention must be paid to long-term sustainable growth, providing the conditions for the creation of quality jobs, rather than short-term profit, which has done huge harm to the financial stability of European markets."
"The current economic crisis has demonstrated that coordination of economic policy has not worked in the Union, nor have the frameworks for governance, for economic supervision or for regulating financial services."
"All this has sown instability and decline in Europe."
"In this respect, I would like to highlight and express my thanks for the recommendations that accompany the proposal, which are aimed at: establishing a coherent and transparent framework for supervising macro-economic processes in the Union and in the Member States, and improving supervision; improving the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact; improving economic governance; establishing a strong mechanism for preventing and resolving excessive debt in the euro area; and revising the budgetary, financial and fiscal tools."
"I would like to point out that I entirely agree with improving the external representation of the Union in the field of economic and monetary affairs."
"I would like to thank Mr Feio for his excellent work in drafting this complex report."
"I voted in favour of it because I consider it of fundamental importance to improve the economic governance of the European Union."
"The financial crisis has indeed highlighted the lack of true political and economic coordination between Member States and the inefficacy of the various control instruments."
"It is now therefore time for Europe to set up a more reliable legal framework that observes the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy while also implementing greater control over debt and public income, fiscal incentives for SMEs, internal market development and integration of labour markets."
"In the light of recent agreements, I do not, however, support the introduction of numerical rules that could prove too mechanistic for some Member States and difficult to achieve."
"We should not forget that toxic assets and, to an even greater extent, excessive personal debt (sub-prime mortgages) lie at the root of the financial crisis."
"In other words, the crisis was caused by imbalance in the private and banking sector, not by state public debt."
"Lastly, I agree with recommendation 3 on enhancing state coordination by means of annual euro area surveillance reports."
"I voted in favour of this report as I agree that a coherent and transparent framework must be established for multilateral surveillance of macro-economic developments in the Union and in the Member States."
"I would like to call for an annual debate between Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the representatives of national parliaments on the Stability and Convergence Programmes (SCPs) and the National Reform Programmes (NRPs), as well as on assessing national economic developments as part of the European Semester."
"I would also like to call for the establishment, at a national level, of a mechanism to assess the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy priorities and the achievement of the relevant national targets included in the National Reform Programme in order to support the annual evaluation by the EU institutions."
"I voted against the report which, for the sake of economic governance of the European Union, adopts a sovereign perception and policy on strict discipline in the Stability Pact and supports preventive sanctions to the detriment of the Member States 'in breach' of the Maastricht indictors."
"It proposes the objective of budgetary stability and strict supervision of national budgets and ends up adopting harsh measures to the detriment of workers' incomes, pensions and labour and insurance rights."
"All this, despite the fact that we can see the effects of these policies in Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and elsewhere."
"All this, at a time when the workers in numerous countries in Europe have come out on to the streets in protest against becoming the victims of the crisis and the neoliberal counter-attack being launched by the EU, the ECB and the IMF."
"Adopting the euro was a gamble of fundamental importance for the EU."
"The main risk factor is associated not so much with matters of monetary technique, where the European Central Bank is doing an excellent job, but with economic cohesion and the link with the real economy."
"The problem really made itself felt during the crisis: the single currency makes less and less sense for a market that is still fragmentary and with fiscal policies that are not always sufficiently homogeneous."
"Considering these issues should not be, and must not be, a mere exercise or excuse for claiming legal sovereignty over matters that are currently the responsibility of individual nations."
"Instead, it is useful to apply consistency and a systematic approach to economic action in the face of increasingly complex situations, where currency challenges are not the same as in the past and require different instruments and objectives where the responsibilities shouldered by the technicians must be backed by ongoing and consistent monitoring as well as political direction based on a considered view of the future and an eye to resolving contingent problems."
"We voted in favour of this report without relinquishing in any way our opposition to a European tax."
"We will also continue to say 'no' to the establishment of a high-level group that is to discuss the possibility of creating a European Common Treasury (ECT) with the objective of endowing the European Union with its own financing resources."
"On other points, too, we have used our vote to express a different view."
"The issue of economic governance at European Union level is a tricky matter and the reticence shown by some of its Member States with regard to new transfers of sovereignty are understandable."
"The crisis in Greece has highlighted the limitations of the current intervention mechanisms, not to mention the inadequacy of the instruments required to enforce compliance with the convergence criteria, especially in the countries belonging to the euro area."
"Establishing a coherent, transparent framework supporting the multilateral monitoring of macro-economic trends in the European Union and Member States, along with consolidating fiscal supervision, as proposed within the document, marks a step forward in the right direction, even though it may entail a partial amendment to the Constitutional Treaty."
"Overall, the recommendations in this document are important and address real issues, offering relevant solutions."
"This is why I voted in favour of adopting the document."
"It is with satisfaction and a sense of responsibility that I am voting in favour of the recommendations to improve EU economic governance suggested in this report."
"Given that the EU is facing fierce competition from emerging economies and that the stability of public finances is vital for consolidating opportunities, fostering innovation and stimulating economic growth, which are fundamental elements of a European knowledge-based society, and considering that economic growth and sustainable public finances are a precondition for economic and social stability in the EU and for long-term fiscal consolidation, the current rules of the Stability and Growth Pact combined with their poor implementation have proved insufficient to ensure sound macro-economic and budgetary policies."
"It is therefore important to support a more rigorous application of preventive measures and sanctions, as well as encouraging improved monitoring and economic governance through more accurate and comparable statistics on the policies and economic positions of the Member States, particularly in the euro area."
"By adopting the resolution on economic governance, the European Parliament is reaffirming its main objectives for the negotiations on the Commission's six legislative proposals."
"MEPs deplore the fact that implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is inadequate and propose the creation of an effective mechanism of incentives and sanctions, as well as stressing the importance of investment in energy, research, innovation, healthcare and education."
"To end the recession, we need to plan the required funding at European level, and the idea of own resources should be put into practice."
"We maintain that introducing a tax on financial transactions would reduce speculation and would improve the functioning of the internal market."
"In addition, the income generated by this tax could help finance global public goods and reduce budget deficits."
"This tax should be established on the largest possible basis, and certainly at European Union level to start with."
"in writing. - It is timely indeed that Parliament addresses this matter only days after the agreement between President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel to seek to change the Lisbon Treaty in order to provide for an orderly handling of future sovereign debt crises in the eurozone."
"Of course, this is all set against the continuing crisis in the eurozone, as each day goes by evidencing the folly of the single currency model. But it does something else."
"Clearly, if this goes ahead, there would be an onus on the coalition government in the UK to hold a referendum."
"That has been the assurance given by David Cameron, and unlike his cast-iron guarantee of before, he must hold to this promise."
"If France and Germany can seek changes to the Lisbon Treaty, it is vitally important that the UK Government use the renegotiation process to win back powers to our sovereign parliament."
"I voted for the Feio report, which is the result of successful negotiations between the political groups of the European Parliament, and is based on a broad consensus on the need to reinforce growth and employment policies, with a view to improving economic governance that will enable the crisis to be overcome and the European economy to recover."
"In the wake of the current economic, financial and social crisis, Parliament has taken on a leading role in providing the European Union with mechanisms to ensure effective intervention which cannot only stem further crises, but, above all, ensure the stability that is necessary for sustainable development and cohesion within Europe."
"This report by Mr Feio fleshes out Parliament's responsibility for the institutional consolidation of the EU for greater unification in Europe and in terms of the global economy, in the interests of the European public and their well-being."
"The proposed recommendations are a very significant qualitative development in improving economic governance within the EU, highlighting the strengthening of rules to promote the stability and growth of the states and the Union, as well as mechanisms for preventing and also correcting and solving problems and challenges to the strategy for EU development."
"The reliability of EU statistics is also an important element in providing structures and authorities with better capabilities for assessing and determining intervention."
"I would also like to highlight the concern with the need to prevent situations of public debt, apart from public deficits."
"This is not about improving economic governance at EU level, but about holding sway over Member States' economic, budgetary and taxation policies, which are subject to the essential requirement not of creating economic prosperity, but of safeguarding the interests of the single market and of Brussels."
"It is also about the reactivation and worsening of the Stability Pact, which continues to cause harm."
"This is not acceptable, and nor is the creation of a common public treasury responsible for managing a European tax and the institutionalisation of a European economic government (to do what?)."
"Admittedly, the level of public deficit and public debt, most of which is held abroad, is dangerous both financially and in terms of sovereignty."
"However, this deficit and debt would no doubt be lower if it were not for your policies and the obligation for States to borrow on the markets."
"Nearly a sixth of the French State's budget is spent on paying interest on its debt."
"As long as we are paying that, we cannot use that money for anything else."
"The economic and financial crisis has clearly shown us that there is an urgent need to improve economic cooperation within the European Union."
"To do this, the Stability and Growth Pact must be reinforced and expanded to include suitable and effective sanctioning options."
"There is also a need, however, to keep a closer eye on the national budgets and the competitiveness of the Member States."
"In future, we need to identify imbalances between the countries of the euro area and any shortcomings in competition earlier and we need the ability to demand effective countermeasures."
"The object must be to make the monetary union and the euro durably strong and robust in order to be able to prevent a crisis like the one in Greece."
"The Danish Liberal Party voted against one particular amendment to the Feio report, which recommends that a study be carried out into the advantages of establishing a European tax collection system."
"The Danish Liberal Party voted in favour of the overall report, which was otherwise a well-balanced one."
"in writing. - It is very important that the rules of economic governance are reinforced, especially in light of the economic crisis that many EU countries are still going through."
"However, I agree with the Parliament's amendments that remove the recommendations on automatic sanctions on Member States that incur an excessive deficit because, as this crisis has shown, it is necessary, in extraordinary circumstances, to exceed the deficit requirements in order to stave off more serious economic effects of a crisis."
"The report with recommendations to the Commission on improving the economic governance and stability framework of the Union, in particular, in the euro area, that we have just voted on, is part of a wider debate, that has been going on for several months, on initiatives to combat the financial crisis."
"A need is clearly emerging for strong economic governance of the European Union, especially after what happened in Greece a few months ago."
"Any day now, we will see the final report by the European task force on economic governance, set up by the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy."
"Even now, however, we can state that there is an absolute need to identify rules for surveillance of economic policies, rules that are not mechanistic but realistic and sustainable, able to strengthen fiscal policy and improve European governance as a whole."
"One observation which could be made during the recent period of economic and financial crisis was that monitoring and economic coordination at EU level needed to be strengthened significantly."
"Major macro-economic imbalances were noted and some states are faced with a major rise in public debt and its proportion of their GDP."
"I voted for this report because I strongly support all eight recommendations made by the rapporteur with the intention of reflecting good governance and economic stability in the European Union."
"I believe that we are going to face major challenges in the years to come."
"We must be able to set definite priorities and make some difficult choices in order to support the EU's economic growth potential and consolidate public finances."
"EU-level coordination will be vital in this respect and may help eliminate the adverse effects."
"The joint debate on the European Council, the G20, the report by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, and the report on European governance, have not produced clear guidelines or pertinent recommendations regarding the financial crisis."
"Everyone had their say and gave their own personal interpretation of what are confused and woolly texts."
"This is, unfortunately, the reality for these own-initiative reports, which bring large majorities together but, at the same time, do not say a lot."
"The Feio report was discussed much too late in the day, the European Commission having already tabled the directives that will reform the Stability Pact and the governance of the euro area."
"What is the point, in these conditions, in voting on recommendations to the Commission?"
"Parliament should equip itself with far more stringent rules of procedure and abide by them."
"Its effectiveness and credibility are at stake."
"The reform of the Stability Pact and governance of the euro area will have its decisive moment when the legislative texts are analysed."
"Along with colleagues, I will get down to this work, with an open mind and with diligence."
"It is important that Parliament supports a realistic yet ambitious reform so as to build the monetary union on new foundations."
"It is through painstaking work that an institution earns its legitimacy within the European structure, not by ..."
"(The explanation of vote was cut short pursuant to Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Without rules or supervision, you cannot make any progress."
"Applying the rules that we have imposed upon ourselves during this time of crisis, to improve coordination and surveillance in economic matters, is the least we must ask of ourselves and of the Member States."
"In this vein, the report by Mr Feio allows us to focus on some considerable distortions, seeing how 'recent economic developments have shown clearly that economic policy coordination within the Union and, in particular, in the euro area, has not worked sufficiently well and that, despite their obligations under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Member States have failed to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern'."
"My vote is therefore, without doubt, in favour of the report."
"The current financial and economic crisis has demonstrated that the EU needs increasingly strong economic and monetary governance so that the stability of the euro and the monetary union itself are not undermined."
"Thus, the Europe 2020 strategy should seek to promote economic growth and create jobs, as the sharp fall in GDP, the drop in industrial production and the high numbers of unemployed are a major social and economic challenge which can only be overcome by strong, harmonious and united governance."
"Mr Feio's report points out ways and defines strategies towards a real strengthening of economic governance and the EU's stability framework, with the main focus on the euro area."
"Examples of this include the establishment of a coherent and transparent framework for surveillance, the strengthening of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the strengthening of economic governance in the euro area, among others."
"The economic, financial and social crisis has shown the limits of the European model of economic governance."
"That is why we need an agreement at the next European Council on economic governance and on the Stability Pact."
"There is an urgent need to adopt reforms that will enable us to take a big step forward in quality terms with respect to economic governance and to introduce transparent and targeted supervision instruments."
"I am in favour of Mr Feio's report because it supports the Commission's proposal, which, to my mind, is a balanced compromise proposal."
"I am in favour of greater parliamentary involvement in the Union's economic governance and of the centralisation at European level of the exclusive supervision powers of the major cross-border financial institutions."
"I also think it would be useful to provide the Union with its own financial resources in order to help it plan its actions and activities."
"To my mind, the Feio report is the most professional report we have had in the last three months."
"All the issues and solutions detailed in the report are extremely timely."
"The lack of information, distorted reporting and, occasionally, downright lies from EU states' governments, has led to dreadful results."
"By fearfully concealing the glaring gaps in their budgets, Greece, Latvia and Hungary have shaken confidence in the euro."
"The European Commission and the European Parliament must strictly and effectively react to any distortion of the facts and concealment of the truth."
"It is essential to draw up measures in respect of dishonest politicians, on whose account the EU has ended up in crisis."
"In order to come out of this complicated economic situation, we must draw up not only regulations for supervision and statistics, but also a plan for overcoming the crisis."
"That means, firstly, clear criteria for fiscal policy, and deadlines and guarantees for taxpayers."
"We must also ensure that this tax legislation not be amended every day at a nod from investors."
"Unfortunately, today, the Latvian Government amends its regulations as the mood of the officials from the International Money Fund and the European Bank takes them."
"I hope that the Feio report will act as a signal to the European Commission that the time for getting down to work has come."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Feio, but as I have already had the chance to emphasise, Europe badly needs major reform in this area even if Europe's new economic governance cannot consider solely the sum of the public debt."
"We do not need mechanisms to tackle debt that are excessively automatic and pro-cyclical, which risk failing to meet the objective and, if anything, risk hindering actions to boost economic growth."
"Instead, I favour the adoption of surveillance mechanisms equipped with flexible, reasonable formulas, which can be easily implemented by the Member States."
"The results and benefits for the budget of important reforms in social and economic matters, above all, pensions reform, are not seen in the following financial year but, after a number of years in the medium and long term, in the sustainability of the public finances."
"In any case, these are the most important and necessary reforms."
"Therefore, we must give more and better consideration to the structural reforms required to stimulate competitiveness and economic growth in Europe."
"Competitiveness brings economic growth and growth brings more tax revenues and effective financial consolidation."
"I abstained on the Feio report, because the proposals on European economic governance do not address the structural problems of incomplete economic union and do not alleviate the asymmetry between 'truncated' economic union and full monetary union."
"More to the point, I abstained because they do not Europeanise economic policies and the economic risk."
"They only Europeanise the penalties, which have been made even stricter."
"There are no strategic guidelines whatsoever to safeguard balanced growth and invigorate competitiveness for all the Member States."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe that: (1) a coherent and transparent framework for multilateral surveillance of macro-economic developments in the European Union and the Member States should be established, ensuring an annual debate between Parliament, the Commission, the Council and representatives from national parliaments on the Stability and Convergence Programmes (SCPs) and the National Reform Programmes (NRPs) and on assessing national economic developments; and that (2) a mechanism should be established at national level to assess the implementation of the Europe 2020 priorities and the achievement of the relevant national targets included in the National Reform Programme in order to support the yearly evaluation by the EU institutions."
"I also believe that the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact should be strengthened, with a view to: (1) taking the debt level, debt profile and debt dynamics more strongly into account in the pact of convergence towards Member State-specific Medium Term Fiscal Objectives (MTFOs) to be included in the SCPs; (2) encouraging the establishment of early warning budgetary control mechanisms at national level; and (3) establishing pre-specified and pre-emptive measures within the euro area, both for the preventive and the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The report by Mr Feio is dedicated to the central issue of European economic coordination."
"It seeks to guide the Commission's legislative documents and is being discussed 24 hours after the position of the Franco-German directorate became known."
"The positive suggestions included in the report are fatally coordinated, whether because of the Franco-German position, or because of the proposals for automatic penalties which were already present in the Commission's and Council task force's texts.."
"The report does not break with the fashion for disciplinary penalties in the Brussels Consensus, seeking only to water these down."
"This consensus cannot be reformed: it can only be replaced with another that puts employment and the correction of serious inequalities at the centre of economic coordination."
"I voted in favour of this report as I agree that a coherent and transparent framework must be established for multilateral surveillance of macro-economic developments in the Union and in the Member States."
"in writing. - The global economic crisis has challenged the current mechanisms of economic policy coordination in the EU and has revealed some of its weaknesses."
"The functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union has been under particular pressure, due to earlier failures to comply with the underlying rules and given that existing surveillance and coordination procedures have not been comprehensive enough."
"This INI report intends to set out the position of Parliament as regards the legislative package on economic policy coordination (six proposals, including four under Codecision) released by the Commission two weeks earlier."
"The Council's position is foreseen for the end of October through the final report of the Van Rompuy task force on economic governance."
"Following the economic and financial crisis, the European Parliament has approved a series of reports and Commission directives on its outcomes and ways to combat it."
"In order to avoid repeats of the speculative bubbles like the one we are currently struggling to escape from, it is indispensable to establish a series of measures and checks amongst and together with the Member States."
"For example, it is essential to respect the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Serious, far-reaching monitoring would probably have avoided the extreme situations in Greece and Spain."
"The current economic, financial and social crisis has demonstrated that the European Union's economic governance model has not worked as well as would be ideal."
"Therefore, it is necessary to find solutions for better and more efficient economic governance in Europe so as to prevent the already serious effects of the crisis from getting worse."
"In this context, the rapporteur recommends that the European Commission establish a coherent framework for economic surveillance, strengthen the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and economic governance in the euro area, and review the EU budgetary, financial and fiscal instruments."
"Moreover, it is also proposed to establish a robust and credible excessive debt prevention and resolution mechanism for the euro area."
"Finally, it is suggested improving the reliability of EU statistics as well as the external representation of the Union in the area of economic and monetary affairs."
"Subsequently, it is necessary for the Member States to fully respect the rules and decisions of the European Union."
"I would also stress the importance of aligning the reform with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, not least in the sense of strengthening the internal market and the role of small and medium-sized enterprises as essential motors for economic growth."
"I am voting for the report for the reasons given above."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the current Stability and Growth Pact regulations and the weak system of implementation have failed to sufficiently ensure a strong fiscal and macro-economic policy."
"The recommendations provided in this report are a good start."
"The rapporteur is correct to observe that we need to proceed with structural reforms regarding social policy and the integration of labour markets, and fiscal incentives to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The process of reducing long-term deficits must be combined with other efforts stimulating the economy, such as improved preconditions for investments and an improved internal market, providing increased competitiveness."
"I also welcome the fact that the rapporteur recognises that any new proposed measures should not have a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable Member States, in particular, the Baltic countries."
"That would impede our efforts towards economic growth and cohesion."
"Last year, enthusiasm for the euro waned slightly in non-euro Member States, including Lithuania."
"Therefore, it is important for us to appreciate that decisions taken in the first half of the year to safeguard the stability of the euro are only temporary and will need to be supported by a better economic governance framework at EU level."
"in writing. - The EU 2020 objectives re-establish the need for closer integration between Member States' economies throughout the European Union in order to encourage productivity, competitiveness and growth."
"The current economic crisis has demonstrated that the present economic governance model does not go far enough and cannot allow for progressive integration that will ensure the stability of EU economies."
"It is for that reason that I am voting to support the recommendations of the Feio report, which highlights the need to strengthen EU economic provisions and to review and improve them in the longer term."
"I understand that Europe needs to look critically at its current economic and financial stability plans in order to move forward together, towards a stronger, more closely intertwined economy that fulfils its potential as a global economic superpower."

"Instrument for Stability - Financing instrument for development cooperation - Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide - Financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries - Financing instrument for development cooperation (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"the report by Franziska Katharina Brantner, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability - C7-0042/2009 -,"

"the report by Helmut Scholz, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1934/2006 establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories - C7-0101/2009 - and"
"the report by Charles Goerens, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation - C7-0079/2010 -."
"Mr President, we have a number of financing instruments to deal with today."
"We have already debated one aspect this morning, but I am going to start by talking about the Instrument for Stability."
"This instrument was created in 2006 and is the best funded instrument in the areas of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, conflict prevention, civil post-disaster support, civil peacebuilding measures and also for justice and policing in the anti-terrorism sphere."
"Despite this, the size of the funding is relatively small."
"So far, it only amounts to EUR 1.4 billion in the financial perspective."
"This is not a lot of money, but it is good money, as it can be used relatively flexibly."
"Consideration has repeatedly been given to cutting this, but so far, we have always managed to ensure that it has not been cut in the budget."
"What is the mid-term review of this instrument about?"
"What is up for debate?"
"Well, there are a small number of points, but some of them are important in terms of content."
"First of all, the long-term measures under Article 4(3) are designed to make it possible to put in place measures to promote women in political processes, in particular, with regard to the media."
"What we are actually talking about here, therefore, is the transfer of an already very successful field into Article 4(3)."
"So far, support has been given for media appearances by Afghan women standing for parliament."
"We would like to have this incorporated into the long-term measures, rather than only being in the short-term measures, so that these women can continue to be supported in this way over the longer term."
"Secondly, we want to see the peacebuilding partnership explicitly mentioned in the directive, not only in order to reward the development of formal dialogue with civil society, but also in order to bring the concept into the new era of the European External Action Service."
"It should not be allowed to disappear, and we therefore think it is important that it should receive specific mention."
"Thirdly, we are voting in favour of the increase in the proportion of funding for long-term measures under Article 4(3) from 5 to 10%."
"However, I would like to remind the High Representative, once again, that the Committee on Foreign Affairs did endorse this increase at the last minute, as we were promised that, in future, extensive measures would be undertaken under the auspices of the Instrument in the fight against landmines, cluster bombs and leftover stocks of ammunition."
"In other words, this increase in the long-term measures of 5% of the overall budget line to 10% was agreed on a conditional basis and we expect that you, Baroness Ashton, and the External Action Service will stick to this agreement and that the strategy paper for 2012/2013 will reflect that."
"This is important to us, in other words."
"To do otherwise would not be in the spirit of the agreement."
"If Parliament and the Commission prevail, however, the biggest innovation in the content of the text in the mid-term review will be the explicit expansion of the remit to include small arms and light weapons (SALWs)."
"At this point, I want to call on the Presidency once again to accept this idea."
"The European Court of Justice has ruled in favour."
"I know that it still pains some to accept this, but I hope that, with the External Action Service, we will now perhaps be able to overcome this disjunction between the Council and the Commission and to obtain agreement on how to proceed on the issue of small arms and light weapons."
"I found this to be a very important point."
"My final point concerns the issue of delegated acts."
"We have already discussed this issue this morning."
"I believe that we need a political solution in this regard and not a judicial one, which would represent a dead end."
"One final very brief point: when it comes to the Instrument for Stability and programming in the External Action Service - we are truly convinced that planning and programming must continue to rest with those people who have been responsible for this up to now and that those people must not be downgraded to 'financial management' but instead must continue to carry out content planning."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to voice my displeasure about the fact that, while we are today dealing with important topics such as funding, development aid and democratic principles, only 14 Members - I believe I have counted correctly - have been able to make it, obviously thanks to some competing or unfortunately-timed event, as everyone else has been disciplined enough to attend the other event."
"It is unfair on those making presentations and on those acting as rapporteurs today, as well as on fellow Members, and I am not even going to mention the staff and the representatives of the Commission who have to sit here in front of an empty Chamber."
"Colleagues, this is not a point of order: it is an interesting point and it might play on some local TV, but it is not a point of order."
"Kindly do not interrupt the session with such points."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur for the Committee on Development, Mr Mitchell, has asked me to substitute him because he could not be present today."
"I would like to thank him for the work he has carried out with his customary punctuality and for the quality of his proposals, which received a favourable opinion - I would say unanimously - from the Committee on Development."
"For the reasons I will state, but, above all, for the work that Mr Mitchell has carried out up to today, I am convinced that the report can be voted through with a broad majority."
"I now turn to the report."
"During 2009, the European Commission tabled a proposed amendment to Regulation 1905/2006, which establishes a financing instrument for development cooperation."
"Through this proposal, the Commission asked Parliament to adopt an amendment that would allow non-governmental organisations to benefit from tax relief when operating in developing countries."
"We accepted the request."
"However, the regulation for development cooperation also contains implementing rules for the European Union's development policy."
"These rules provide that when the Commission accepts financing, it must follow comitology procedures."
"This means that Parliament can examine these financing proposals and, if the Commission oversteps its authority, Parliament may adopt resolutions to ask the Commission to change the decisions in question."
"Merely between 2006 and today, Parliament has felt that the Commission had exceeded its executive competences in at least 12 cases, but only in three of these did the Commission in fact amend or withdraw its draft decision."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Committee on Development proposed the application of the procedure for delegated acts established by Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The adoption of this procedure would mean that Parliament would have a more significant role, at least in the strategic financing decisions that the European Commission has to adopt."
"In effect, according to the Treaty of Lisbon, in some well-defined cases, Parliament can delegate the power to take strategic decisions to the Commission, but what could these decisions be?"
"In our opinion, the legislature is responsible for choosing which countries the European Union should supply with development aid."
"There is then this question over which sectors to give funding priority to: education, health, environmental protection, capacities for good government or development of small businesses?"
"Also, how are we to ensure transparency in the management of development aid?"
"These are the choices and the subjects in which the European Parliament must play a more important role than it has in the past."
"In these sectors, it must be the legislature that gives precise indications to the executive."
"In the end, I believe that this is the way that the requests of European citizens are going."
"I sincerely hope for the greatest possible consensus on this report by Mr Mitchell."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the European instrument for democracy and human rights is the financing instrument that supports human rights, the rule of law, the protection of democracy and the prevention of conflicts around the world."
"The beneficiaries of this financing instrument are, in the first instance, civil society organisations, those civil society organisations and individuals which fight for human rights in the most difficult conditions, in third countries."
"The great advantage of this financing instrument, as opposed to other geographic instruments, is that it can be paid out without the consent of the government of the country receiving the aid."
"Therefore, its role is of great importance."
"Nevertheless, in the case of this instrument, it has not been possible to finance the costs relating to VAT payments out of Community funds."
"Therefore, the European Commission's initiative suggested a technical amendment that would have helped the work and operation of civil society organisations in third countries using these funds."
"Since such organisations are of crucial importance for the promotion of human rights in these countries and for developing political pluralism, it is very important not to make the work of these organisations, which already face difficult situations, even more difficult."
"We therefore welcome the Commission's initiative and, with the consent of my fellow rapporteur, Mrs Lochbihler, we lend it our full support."
"However, this is only one side of the coin."
"On the other side is the political significance of this matter."
"The issue of the financial instrument has become part of the interinstitutional struggle which has been going on for a year now."
"It is precisely because the instrument for financing human rights is essential for civil society organisations that it is important for the European Parliament to have a part in shaping the strategic and multiannual framework programmes."
"What we are fighting for is that the European Parliament should have a say, insofar as it deems it necessary, in the elaboration of strategic plans for the financing instrument, through annual reviews rather than at seven-year intervals, at the time of the budgetary cycles."
"This is the purport of the amendments which we hereby wish to support."
"The Treaty of Lisbon confirmed the European Parliament's right of oversight, which is, in effect, the institution of a 'delegated act' which my fellow Members have already mentioned, and which we think we need to enforce and implement in this case."
"The matter at hand is indeed the first example of the increased role of the European Parliament since 1 December 2009."
"Following the discussions we have had so far and the parliamentary debates, we, the rapporteurs on the financing instruments, have reached the joint conclusion that the dossier should be sent for second reading, and we are sending a serious political message to the institutions, because now, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we should act in the spirit of the treaty."
"We believe that these are the very instruments for which it is most crucial that Parliament truly exercise its democratic right of oversight."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights is a very recent instrument."
"It can already be said, however, that it does a lot of meaningful and important work."
"You can see that from the feedback that we get from representatives of civil society, both within and beyond the EU."
"It is also a very positive complement to our human rights policy in the European Parliament and in the EU as a whole."
"Work on human rights often takes place under very difficult conditions."
"It is therefore particularly important that these instruments provide the ability for the EU to grant financial support to civil society establishments without the government in question having to give its consent, and potentially without it even having to be informed of the financial support in question by the EU."
"We should stress a number of times that this aid is to be retained and - where necessary - extended."
"Like my co-rapporteur, Mrs Gál, I can endorse the Commission proposal that there should be a tax abatement in those countries where payments from this financing instrument are still taxed."
"That, too, would significantly ease the work of the NGOs in question."
"However, I see it as a constant challenge in work with this financing instrument that, on the one hand, we also have complaints or negative feedback in this connection that makes quite clear that it leads to more red tape for civil society organisations that seek support from this instrument."
"On the other hand, of course, there is the necessity for transparency with regard to what money is spent on and whether and how it is used."
"However, we should take seriously the repeated complaint by small organisations, in particular, that they are put off from using this support and this is an issue we need to tackle now."
"By the same token, I see it as a challenge that it is difficult to reach a lot of local organisations in the countryside, rather than in the metropolises of the global South, in other words, to make them aware that a financing instrument of this nature exists and how they can administer it."
"Imagine the following situation: in a rural area where there is not always electricity, paper trails are perhaps an exception rather than the rule - that makes it necessary for particular attention to be focused on achieving these initiatives."
"I see an opportunity in enlarging the EU embassies on the ground at this point - and it is, of course, actually settled that there are also to be responsibilities, and staff on hand, in each local EU embassy to speak up for human rights and democracy - in these civil servants - who I will now refer to as human rights agents - intensively engaging in taking on precisely this role as a mediator and this remit to provide information and communications, and also in getting through to local initiatives that perhaps do not have the ability to communicate in English, French, Spanish or another EU language."
"It is still far too early, at present, to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the Instrument."
"The timeframe is much too short - the results would not stand up very well."
"In a few years' time, however, we need to very intensively devote ourselves to a comprehensive evaluation of this kind. By evaluation, I mean not only looking back at what went well, but also considering what new ideas we should adopt and how we can further develop the financing instrument."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs - Ms Brantner, Ms Gál and Ms Lochbihler, as well as Mr Mitchell, Mr Scholz and Mr Goerens."
"The proposals before us result from the mid-term review conducted by the Commission in 2009 at Parliament's request."
"That review concluded that the instruments are working well."
"This is very positive and it gives a stable framework for our external relations until 2013."
"In some cases, the Commission proposed only technical amendments in order to bring them into line with the other instruments."
"We are glad that we have your support on these technical issues."
"The big issue identified in the review was Parliament's objections concerning aid under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) which could not be considered to be official development assistance."
"Here, the Commission took the views of this House fully into account."
"We tabled a proposal broadening the industrialised countries' instrument to cover activities which cannot be eligible as official development assistance."
"This is about engaging with important bilateral partners and global players with whom the European Union has a strategic interest in promoting diversified links, such as India, China or Brazil."
"These countries are also interested in engaging in economic, academic, business and scientific exchanges with the European Union."
"This amended instrument, called ICI Plus, is a short-term solution for three years."
"We do not prejudge the future revision of external action financial instruments for the period after 2013."
"Parliament has already approved a budget for this instrument in 2010."
"In order to implement the budget for 2010, the instrument needs to be adopted now, so I very much welcome the work done by the rapporteurs in finding a large measure of agreement."
"On the instrument for stability, the Commission proposed to include EU action against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, following the ruling of the Court of Justice in 2008."
"We are discussing the issues raised in Council and must find an agreed solution."
"I can also assure you that funding for civil society under the crisis-preparedness component of the stability instrument will further increase this year."
"Moreover, funding is scheduled to double over the years 2011-2013 for the peacebuilding partnership."
"This will provide ample scope for funding civil society actions."
"Even more important is the share of 22% for civil society funding under the crisis response budget since 2007."
"This shows the capacity of NGOs in peacebuilding and crisis response."
"It is an excellent example of the added value the stability instrument has brought to comprehensive EU action in fragile and conflict-affected countries worldwide."
"Since the proposals concerning the mid-term review, another amendment to the DCI was presented on 17 March 2010."
"The so-called Banana Accompanying Measures have a clear objective: to support the adjustment of 10 ACP banana-exporting countries to changing EU import tariffs for bananas."
"Bananas were the subject of the world's longest-running trade dispute."
"The EU had to find a solution and conclude an agreement in compliance with WTO rules."
"The Banana Accompanying Measures are an integral part of this agreement and the tariff reductions are already in place."
"I would very much like to thank again the rapporteur for his very constructive attitude."
"I think we now have an effective programme that could start as soon as we have adopted it."
"The tariffs are already in place and the ACP countries are urgently looking for the financial support the EU promised during the negotiations."
"Now we come to the most debated issue."
"Committees have all adopted amendments in order to treat strategy papers and multiannual programmes as delegated acts under the new treaty procedure in Article 290."
"As you know, the Commission and also the Council do not share this point of view."
"We think these strategy papers and multiannual programmes do not fall within the scope of Article 290 since they do not supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act."
"However, we fully agree with the necessity to ensure Parliament's strong involvement in overall strategic decisions."
"It is also in the interests of us all to ensure that programming can be done in a practical and smooth way."
"So far, Parliament has been involved through the democratic scrutiny procedure which was agreed in 2006 as regards the strategic papers and multiannual programming."
"Through these procedures, the Commission engages in dialogue with Parliament on the content of the strategies."
"This consultation process goes beyond the strict bounds of comitology."
"Let me be clear: we definitely need to find a solution now."
"The Commission is open to discuss with Parliament in order to find a way forward that addresses Parliament's concerns."
"The three chairpersons last week sent an invitation for an informal meeting between the steering committee in charge of this issue in Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"We very much welcome this invitation."
"The High Representative, a representative from the Council and myself met the steering group this morning."
"It was a very fruitful meeting and it very clearly confirms that it is necessary to find a solution in the shortest possible time so as to give full effect to the Treaty of Lisbon by also respecting pressing practical concerns, not least as regards the budget."
"I feel confident that we can find a solution if we act together."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner Piebalgs, honourable Members, I too, on behalf of the Council of course, should like to thank the rapporteurs for their work and their involvement."
"Allow me to add a few words to Commissioner Piebalgs' comments, which the Council naturally fully endorses."
"The Commissioner rightly drew attention to the main issue that remains unresolved, namely, Parliament's wish to see the strategic papers and multiannual programming treated as delegated acts."
"I do not intend to present in detail the Council's position here this afternoon, but I will just say that the Presidency is obviously more than happy to reach an agreement that satisfies the three institutions and that enables us to adopt the financing instruments as quickly as possible."
"Admittedly, I am thinking more specifically in this context of the previously mentioned ICI Plus and of the Banana Accompanying Measures."
"I am delighted with this morning's meeting with Baroness Ashton, Commissioner Piebalgs and the rapporteurs."
"We feel that this meeting is a clear testament to the genuine will of our three institutions to secure an agreement, and the Presidency believes, as you know, that the current debate on the financing instruments should be kept separate from the negotiations under way between Parliament and the Council with regard to the committee procedure and delegated acts."
"For the time being, you are aware that the Council is still examining these two issues and that any possible solution must indeed be endorsed by your Parliament."
"That is why, in view of the urgent need to adopt the financing instruments, we must take the exceptional step of developing a solution that is specifically tailored to them."
"The Belgian Presidency will ensure, for its part, that the work which was asked to be carried out following this morning's meeting makes swift progress and produces tangible results that will allow us to reach an agreement as soon as possible."
"This morning's meeting leads us to believe that Parliament fully shares this objective."
"Mr President, I am speaking on the subject of the ICI+ Instrument."
"The Instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories (ICI) was launched in the previous parliamentary term."
"In an opinion, the Committee on Foreign Affairs called for a financing instrument for foreign affairs to be created that had no connection with development aid but was aimed at the countries of Latin America, Asia and the Middle East."
"The Commission then created the little instrument that is the ICI Instrument."
"Unfortunately, the Commission saw this as an interim solution."
"It replenished the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) countries but otherwise, produced little that was new and treated it as a trade instrument."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs therefore put forward an amendment concerning the title of the instrument that clarified the original intention to identify it as a foreign policy instrument."
"The new title is a 'Financing instrument for cooperation with countries in the Middle East, Asia, the Americas and South Africa'."
"We ask for your support for this."
"It would be worse than regrettable if the EU had no foreign policy financing instrument that was actually named as such."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, we must look at how the financing instruments - the DCI, the stability instruments and the human rights instruments - are important for the soft power that the European Union exercises around the world."
"That soft power is growing, as demonstrated by our election monitoring, observation, democracy campaigns, and so on."
"Parliament gave up 16 scrutiny instruments when it created the DCI."
"We had 16 core decision powers which we gave up to the Commission in order to control the DCI instrument and facilitate greater cooperation."
"This is working well."
"Now we have a stability instrument for post-crisis development."
"It needs to be fortified with a substantial amount of money, as there are many civil crises, civilian crises and military crises around the world."
"There are currently 36 civil conflicts."
"In the same manner, I think the human rights instrument needs to have oomph."
"It is just not good enough for us to talk and talk and talk: we need to have people on the ground, instruments for monitoring elections, good governance and all the other things for which we require funds."
"I am very pleased to support this."
"Allow me to begin by expressing my full agreement with the conclusions from Mr Goerens's report on the need for the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and its benefit to the European Union's policies to continue."
"I also agree that the European Union must find a way to continue supporting banana-growing countries, even after the World Trade Organisation banned the granting of soft terms from the start of this year."
"Incidentally, the Commission has not, strangely enough, carried out even once, between 1994 and now, an assessment of the assistance's impact on these 12 countries, which is something that must be changed in the future."
"The point which the Committee on Budgets is insisting on and which we do not agree with is resources being cut from other policies so that the EUR 190 million in question is allocated for the next three years."
"There is a principle which we insist must be protected, namely, new policies must be funded using new resources."
"This means that this new policy, even though it could be provided for in the financial framework from the European Commission, ought to be provided for in the budget and not funded at the expense of other programmes."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I would like to welcome first of all Commissioner Piebalgs' detailed and positive statement on the situation and his conclusions that the financial instruments are working well."
"I think the stability instrument has been very useful in addressing conflicts and crises and we should, therefore, focus more on prevention and follow-up."
"This also means robust support for civil society building."
"Here again, the announcement of a substantial increase in funds for peacebuilding is to be welcomed."
"We also welcome the news of, and understand the need for, the rise in the ceiling of measures under Article 4(1) from 7% to 10%."
"At the same time, it is crucial to ensure that the different EU instruments and programmes are used coherently and with an understanding of complementarity."
"The Lisbon Treaty has to make the EU more coherent and efficient."
"We have understood in this Parliament the need for technical modifications."
"The question is rather about the political solution, as has been pointed out."
"This concerns delegated acts and the European Parliament's right to scrutiny."
"Today, I am encouraged by the statements of openness on the side of both the Council and the Commission."
"This is a sign that you are prepared to reach agreement in the shortest possible time."
"I very much hope that we can reach such an agreement guaranteeing the rightful balance between the EU's three institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Scholz for drafting this report, which establishes a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries."
"It is right that this instrument is managed by the Committee on International Trade because, above all, it relates to cooperation with industrialised countries and emerging countries, so there is a certain difference compared to other instruments."
"First and foremost, I think it is necessary to emphasise the role of Parliament."
"We have lost too much time in a tug of war with the Council and the Commission on an obvious issue after the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We must defend the centrality of Parliament, in regard to both delegated acts and executive acts."
"Secondly, I think it important to underline the strategic importance of this whole game and, thirdly, the need to intensify collaboration with developing countries and emerging countries, without taking money away from the poorest countries."
"We must make an effort, within the budget of the European Union, to divert more resources to the poorest countries, bearing in mind that the problems with emerging countries are mostly to do with rules, rather than financing."
"In any case, innovation must also be supported, but with additional resources that have not been taken away from the poorest countries."
"Mr Chastel, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are debating various financial instruments that enable the European Union to act in foreign affairs."
"All these instruments are of a relatively recent date and are, moreover, of quite an original nature."
"We have previously had nothing comparable and, elsewhere in the world or in other international or supranational institutions, there are, in fact, very few models of the kind of instruments that the European Union is developing."
"Because of the groundbreaking nature of this body of instruments, we wisely agreed that we would evaluate them after only a few years and, where necessary, adjust them."
"That is what is keeping us busy here this afternoon."
"However, there are other important changes which have occurred in the meantime."
"These days, we have a High Representative who is also Vice-President of the Commission."
"During this sitting, we have been asked to approve the basic texts on the subject of the European External Action Service, which is, so to speak, a diplomatic arm of the European Union."
"That, too, is a very important innovation."
"Last, but not least, the powers of this House have been considerably extended."
"We have, so far, had ample opportunity to exploit those powers and, as tends to be the case with young institutions, you push as far as you can to assert those new powers to the maximum."
"Therefore, we are currently discussing with the other institutions where exactly lines need to be drawn."
"I am also pleased at what both Commissioner Piebalgs and the President-in-Office have said about there being a will to reach an agreement."
"Given that I used to be part of the executive power in my country in a former life, I understand all sides of the argument and I hope that we reach an agreement."
"I also dare to hope that this House will not overplay its hand, as the English sometimes say."
"To conclude, as regards the Instrument for Stability - I still have a few seconds - I would like to say that I very much welcome what Commissioner Piebalgs said, that, indeed, the intention is that we should concentrate, among other things, on the fight against the trafficking of small arms and light weapons."
"That the intention is to involve NGOs more closely in the working of the Instrument for Stability and to make full use of the even more groundbreaking body of instruments for peacebuilding."
"If that becomes a reality, you will be able to count on the full support of our group."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) in which I, and also colleagues from the Committee on Development, see an urgent need to strengthen the scrutiny power of Parliament."
"That is because Parliament has the duty to control where the Commission spends the money and whether it is spent as intended, in this case, on Official Development Assistance (ODA)."
"We have, in the past, found bad examples of where money was not spent in accordance with ODA criteria or where we found that it did not comply with the goal of poverty eradication."
"Merely having the right of consultation, our proposals and our ideas were not taken up."
"This clearly shows that we need a stronger position."
"We need the power to codecide on where the money goes."
"Not only the Commission, but we too as a Parliament have an obligation as regards policy coherence in development."
"We also need to make sure that the money that is spent goes in the right direction and that other policy fields also work towards the eradication of poverty."
"Parliament also has a responsibility towards the citizens of the European Union."
"We must better control where the money is spent, namely, on poverty eradication."
"European citizens are in favour of development aid."
"They are even in favour of providing more development aid - as surveys have shown - but we also have to show clearly how we spend it and that we spend it to the benefit of poor people."
"Therefore, the Committee on Development and I urge you to accept delegated acts for the DCI."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the EU is the world's largest multilateral donor of development aid and humanitarian assistance."
"It also plays an important political role supporting the promotion of human rights and democracy in third countries."
"My group, the ECR Group, strongly believes that properly structured new EU financial instruments are therefore essential."
"They ensure a more efficient and effective way of disbursing EU taxpayers' money and enable Parliament, particularly post-Lisbon, to scrutinise spending and strategic policy in a more open and transparent manner."
"This democratic accountability is vital, especially at a time when Member States are themselves making severe cuts to their national expenditures."
"Investment and development, democracy and human rights are potentially an important way to support, through soft power in particular, the EU's wider foreign policy goals and could also contribute to reducing inward migratory pressures on the EU's external borders."
"Strong mechanisms to prevent corruption and misuse of EU money are, however, fundamental and we should also be careful not to force our own western liberal values, in particular, so-called reproductory rights, on to others ill-equipped or reluctant to absorb them under the guise of human rights."
"Mr President, it is important to make clear at this point that, when it comes to the EU's foreign policy financing instruments, the Treaty of Lisbon abolished the European Parliament's right of supervision."
"In so doing, the competency for these financing instruments was fully transferred to the Commission and to the High Representative, and with her, to the European External Action Service."
"I find it completely unacceptable that Parliament and the Council are to be ignored, despite the fact that what is at issue is the European Union's far-reaching foreign policy measures and their implementation."
"We support Parliament's cross-group efforts aiming to re-establish parliamentary supervision of the financing instruments."
"Accordingly, we will support the amendments to the delegated acts in this regard, which, of course, were discussed earlier."
"All the same, I would like to close by expressing my major concern in respect, in particular, of the Instrument for Stability and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, as I believe that these instruments are used in an undemocratic and non-transparent way and, in some cases, against the will of the countries in question, which gives them the character of an interventionist EU foreign policy."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, there is an anecdote going around the bazaars of Karachi roughly as follows."
"A thief holds up the President of Pakistan and says: I want your money."
"The thief says: in that case, I want my money!"
"This is relevant to the debate today because it emphasises the key point."
"The European Commission has no money."
"All the Commission's money comes from the taxpayers of the Member States or, to be precise, the taxpayers of the 14 Member States which are net contributors."
"Even if the Commission gets its own resources some time, which, on the basis of the votes earlier today, looks depressingly likely, the money spent by the Commission would still be money from taxpayers."
"I therefore leave you and ask you to consider very carefully this question: can you really suppose that hard-pressed European taxpayers and UK taxpayers, especially in today's environment, really want an extra EUR 2 billion to be spent - because that is what these proposals provide for - just so that the EU Commissioner can strut about on the world stage?"
"(DE) Mr President, as ever, the funding bodies of the EU are having some problems."
"Financial aid is difficult to obtain due to its complexity, while the monitoring systems continue to be designed in a less than optimal way."
"One example of this is pre-accession aid, which, as we all know, is awarded to potential candidate countries, but which it only makes sense to pay if the states in question are getting to grips with their corruption problems or if the necessary structures are actually established."
"I hope that, in this connection, the EU has learnt from its overhasty enlargement of 2007."
"When it comes to the Instrument for Stability and development cooperation, the budgetary funds far too often do not reach, or only partially reach, the local institutions for which they were intended."
"This is partly due to the weak institutions in the recipient countries, but it is also due to faulty incentive structures and a lack of documented accountability."
"There is food for thought in the fact that, according to an IMF study, the public expenditure of 33 countries is more than 50% dependent on international development aid."
"When it comes to financial aid from the EU, of whatever kind, the monitoring needs to be tightened up."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like, first of all, to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Scholz, for the positive and open cooperation that we enjoyed."
"In the trialogue, in particular, there was not always agreement, but we did enjoy a constructive atmosphere for discussions."
"Expanding the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories will give the EU the opportunity to establish cooperation with the crucial emerging and developing economies on an equal footing."
"This includes educational exchange programmes under the Erasmus Mundus scheme, and supporting entrepreneurial or cultural cooperation, and is something that I very much welcome."
"There is one point that I would like to draw your attention to, and that is that, given the EU's current financial situation - and that of every Member State - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) does not find it acceptable to demand new, not currently available funding to realise the measures just described."
"There needs to be a financial evening out with the financing instrument for development cooperation, the resources of which were only intended to be for all the emerging and developing economies."
"I have therefore tabled an amendment on behalf of the PPE Group that makes it possible to achieve such a financial equilibrium."
"I also want to say a quick word about the delegated acts."
"This is an important issue - it has already been mentioned twice this morning."
"There is absolutely no doubt, as far as I am concerned, that Parliament must have a right of supervision and veto over the whole package on the financing of foreign cooperation currently under discussion by means of delegated acts."
"The spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon needs to make itself felt here."
"There can be no compromise on the issue of whether delegated acts are or are not to be included in the financing instruments."
"Mr President, the European instrument for democracy and human rights is crucial for an EU foreign policy seriously committed to the promotion of democracy, the rule of law and human rights worldwide."
"It is the only instrument that we can now mobilise to help those who stand up for democracy and human rights in countries where basic freedoms are restricted."
"We can do it without the consent of their respective governments."
"Obviously, such a valuable instrument must be under proper European Parliament scrutiny, and this is why we demand the delegated acts procedure."
"However, we should realise that this instrument is rather limited in terms of the funding available, and a sizeable part of it actually pays for the EU election observation missions: 22% for the period 2011-2013."
"This means that the budget allocated to the European instrument for democracy and human rights must be significantly increased."
"I would like to use this opportunity to point out a new tool which the European Parliament should help create, and which this instrument could fund in order to assist even more efficiently and with more flexibility the people who often risk their lives in fighting for democracy, rule of law and human rights in countries with dictatorships or oppressive regimes, and in countries seeking a transition towards democracy, but where they meet violent anti-democratic forces and where they need much more assistance in terms of building capacities to defeat these anti-democratic forces."
"What we need is a cross-party non-governmental European foundation similar to the National Endowment for Democracy established by the US Congress."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor."
"My question to Mrs Gomes on her excellent proposal is to ask her what she thinks we could actually learn from the US models for this kind of more flexible and, let us say, less bureaucratic, financing of democratisation and human rights."
"Mr President, it is exactly in the flexibility that the beauty lies."
"Having a cross-party foundation, we would be able to identify particular cases which, on a broad basis, we would see as needing particular assistance, bypassing obstructive governments or authorities or forces, to build capacity for those who are fighting for human rights."
"I think that the example of the NED in the US is indeed a very enlightening one, and we should not be shy of following what works from other parts of the world, in this case, from our American partners."
"We already have the foundations of the different parties working in Europe, but often with different agendas, and certainly there are many cases where they should converge and would then be more efficient in providing assistance to those who are fighting for democracy and human rights."
"You deceived me there, Ana."
"I thought you were finishing, then suddenly you continued your speech, so I did not know whether or not to bang the gavel."
"The fact is that in the blue card procedure, the questioner has 30 seconds and the person who answers has only 30 seconds."
"(FR) Mr President, I am very embarrassed because I would have liked to have taken part in this discussion."
"I very much doubt that the US model is more effective than the European one."
"The US model, when it deals with human rights, is essentially selective and completely self-serving because, in truth, the US model is first and foremost about active bilateralism."
"I would like to congratulate my colleague, Charles Goerens, on his work, since he has succeeded in strengthening the development dimension of the approach, and I would, of course, like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for the careful and favourable attention he has paid to this request."
"For my part, I would like to make three brief observations."
"Firstly, dismantling the Community preferences system too quickly can and will have dramatic consequences in some ACP countries that still export bananas."
"Some of these consequences will directly affect the ability of ACP countries to promote sustainable development."
"That is why I would like to argue in favour of a reasonable and slightly flexible interpretation of the criteria for allocating aid."
"Aid should be allocated as a priority to those ACP countries that wish to maintain their banana sector because of the latter's impact on their country's sustainable development."
"In this respect, it would have been helpful - this was requested but not obtained - to have already had an ex ante impact assessment on the situation of banana exporting countries."
"I have two other general observations, and I will certainly come back to these in the following weeks."
"From my point of view, the best way to channel this aid is, without a doubt, general budgetary aid wherever possible, and sectoral aid wherever desirable."
"It would have also been helpful perhaps to have had a debate on the quantity of aid and on honouring the commitments made in 2005 by Member States."
"This is central to the debate."
"Moreover, what I have heard from some fellow Members here is deeply worrying."
"Evidently, selfishness is king."
"I must say that this is rather surprising."
"Finally, to answer a number of questions, I would also like nonetheless to revive the idea of including the European Development Fund in the budget, since this would obviously enable us to monitor the Commission's political action directly."
"(FR) Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Goerens for having taken into account international standards concerning the health and safety of workers and international environmental standards, especially those which relate, of course, to exposure to pesticides."
"This report's defence of small producers is crucial in my view because, need I remind you, in the end they receive only 1.5% of the price paid by the end consumer."
"It is worth remembering, as you already know, that every year, millions of small farmers are forced to move into shanty towns."
"Now that the fight against pesticides and large-scale exposure to pesticides has been addressed in this Chamber, I feel it is crucial to apply the same requirements to the French West Indies, where chlordecone is used, and to the outermost regions."
"I call on the Commission to do just that."
"To conclude, although I welcome the progress made, I would like to reiterate that the fundamental problem with the banana trade is obviously the agricultural model, which should be rethought because it is geared towards exporting only."
"The agricultural model should be reshaped towards greater self-sufficiency."
"(PL) I fully agree with Mrs Gomes that the issue of human rights is one of the most important issues with which we have to deal, which is why I completely fail to understand Mrs Lösing's statement that money spent on human rights is sometimes, if not frequently, misspent."
"Human rights are our constitutive, if not our most important task as a European Community."
"I would also like to refer to one of the instruments for supporting democracy and human rights throughout the world, and to the statement that these instruments should be introduced and made operational regardless of whether third parties and other public authorities have given their agreement."
"This, I believe, is a key statement which illustrates our duty."
"We sometimes have to help build democracy and strengthen human rights despite the governments of some countries."
"I believe that it is a worthwhile exercise, particularly and, above all, in places where the right to freedom of expression is violated."
"It is our duty."
"Mr President, there is an air of unreality about much of this debate."
"All these reports concerning the promotion of democratic and human rights worldwide and financing instruments for development cooperation must be seen in the context of the chilling statement made yesterday in this very Chamber by the United Nations Secretary-General."
"He said that 65 million more human beings will be plunged into extreme poverty in our world this year alone."
"That is the harsh reality that flies in the face of fine words by government and the Commission."
"Outside the doors of this Chamber, huge banners with EU logos proclaim: Halt poverty."
"At the same time, the EU Commission - and indeed the major groups in this Parliament - are pushing neoliberal economic policies that slash budgets and public services, savaging the living standards of ordinary people, while transferring massive resources in bailouts to banks and speculators."
"On financing development cooperation, the Commission congratulates itself on the new tariff reductions for bananas agreed with Latin America banana producers, but, in reality, this new arrangement is for the benefit of powerful transnational corporations."
"The huge banana exporters, like Chiquita and Del Monte, will gain hugely but African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and small producers will be devastated."
"Of course, the subsidy to small banana growers who face ruin because of the new agreement must not come from established social funds but from elsewhere in the EU budget."
"Trade should be for the benefit of small producers and working people - the majority - not major transnational corporations."
"(EL) Mr President, I fear that the European Union budget for 2011 has erred, both in the provision for medium-term review and by establishing direct revenue from new taxes which, in the final analysis, will be paid by end users, in other words, by European citizens."
"I feel that this is not the right time to levy these taxes, while Europe is sinking into recession and workers are losing their jobs, their purchasing power and, more importantly, their insurance rights."
"Instead of giving to European consumers, we are taking away from them."
"It would appear once again that, in our efforts to achieve budgetary discipline, we have put aside our plans for growth and that, in applying economic theory, we have forgotten political theory."
"We must convince European citizens, by example, that we are taking care of them in the best possible way."
"At this particular juncture, therefore, we should not behave like Marie-Antoinette."
"I therefore have two specific proposals: firstly, our pay as MEPs should be cut by EUR 1 000 in 2011 and we should each use that money to recruit a young unemployed European citizen from our own country."
"Secondly, we should cut our travel costs by flying economy class."
"Mr President, as is so often the case with EU proposals, these financial instruments include measures which have great emotional appeal."
"All decent people like us want to stop drug smuggling, people trafficking and the supply of small arms to conflict zones, but it is very easy to be emotional and generous with other people's money."
"Thus, while ordinary people in Greece, France, Ireland and Great Britain are having their societies ripped apart by cuts and their backs broken by taxes, the Scholz report will add EUR 176 million to the EUR 172 million already committed to help third-world capitalists gobble up even more of our jobs."
"The Goerens report will blow EUR 190 million, including EUR 17.4 million for a facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries."
"It may have escaped your attention, but food prices are soaring in our constituencies as well."
"Worst of all, however, is the Brantner report."
"Here, on page nine, it speaks of a financial envelope of EUR 2 062 billion by 2013."
"This is, of course, a misprint."
"I hope to God it is a misprint, but the fact that such a ridiculous error could slip past all the experts and MEPs who have read this report speaks volumes for the careless abandon with which the European Union spends money."
"This money does not grow on trees."
"It is not handed out by a giant tooth fairy."
"It is not the Commission's money; it is not MEPs' money."
"It is taxpayers' money and a hugely disproportionate amount of it is British taxpayers' money."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many years, the European Union has maintained a special and strong relationship with ACP countries."
"This special relationship has resulted, in particular, in the granting of tariff preferences."
"Such is the case for the banana sector, in which ACP countries have benefited from a preferential trading arrangement for their exports to the European Union."
"This preference has been challenged at the WTO, especially by the Latin American countries, which are large exporters of bananas."
"Therefore, in order to comply with WTO rules and to end a long dispute, the European Union accepted to reduce its tariffs in the banana sector in December 2009."
"On account of the privileged partnership that it maintains with ACP countries, the European Union nonetheless wanted to help banana-producing ACP countries to cope with this increased competition."
"Consequently, Europe has pledged EUR 190 million until 2013 to help banana-producing ACP countries to adapt, be competitive and restructure their sector if need be."
"In the report on which we will vote tomorrow, the European Parliament is reaffirming its commitment to, and support for, banana-producing ACP countries, and I very much welcome that."
"Thus, we have suggested, among other things, that the European Union could adopt complementary measures after 2013 if necessary."
"Mr President, we need to push for a maximum of transparency and accountability on the budget as this will contribute highly to the legitimacy of the EU's external policy."
"We are talking about significant sums spent on the basis of regulations which leave a considerable margin of manoeuvre for the Commission."
"This is all right, but we need to exert our full scrutiny on strategy papers, multiannual indicative programmes and the like, as they are of a general scope and supplement the financial instruments by defining priority areas and objectives."
"The Commission should show its result in an annual report to Parliament with particular attention to the ODA eligibility of all projects."
"Programming and planning should be carried out by the same expert people who are doing this now, but the External Action Service itself needs more development and human rights experts to understand and work with these instruments in Brussels and in EU delegations in third countries."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to refer briefly to the issue of democracy and funding to support it abroad."
"We consider that democracy is a human achievement that needs to be safeguarded."
"Is, however, democracy as we know it the democracy that we want to - and must - export?"
"I am absolutely certain that the first thing we need do is to improve democracy at home."
"When we have a country in which abstentions exceed 50%, how can we talk of democracy?"
"When millions of people are unemployed, can we talk of democracy?"
"When, instead of being expressed through elected representatives, democracy is mainly expressed through and, at the same time, is controlled by the media, then what can we say?"
"Is this the sort of democracy that we can be proud of and want to export?"
"I believe that there truly are nations that need help in order for their rights to win proper support and acceptance from their governments."
"Surely, however, this should be done with caution, following lengthy investigation of any potential negative, rather than positive, results?"
"Can anyone say that funding democracy in Afghanistan pushed democracy forward?"
"I think that there is far more we can do to make our democracy an example to be copied, rather than paying people to copy us."
"(SV) With the Treaty of Lisbon and the new External Action Service, we have the possibility of a greater presence on the world stage."
"With this, of course, also comes an increase in responsibility."
"We have a particular responsibility in all sorts of relations with countries that are not democracies, whether it be in relation to aid or trade."
"Europe and the EU should and must take the lead."
"The EU must show the way."
"Among the financing instruments that we are now debating, there are building blocks that provide us with the prerequisites to really make a difference."
"The prerequisites are there, but this does not automatically mean that we will succeed."
"In order for every euro in aid to have the optimum effect, our development work needs to be constantly permeated by democracy promoting initiatives and opinion forming."
"This may seem self-evident but, in fact, it is not for everyone."
"In the United Nations, it is the EU that takes up the cudgels."
"It is the EU that stands up in the negotiations against totalitarian regimes, and it is we who consistently and unswervingly stand on the side of the vulnerable, and, of course, that is how it should be."
"It is therefore disappointing to see that, globally, the direction of change is not the one we would like when it comes to democracy and human rights, and I have a feeling that some Members of our Parliament do not fully appreciate the importance of democracy as the most significant and fundamental building block for development."
"At regular intervals in the Committee on Development, we see attempts to initiate texts that subtly, between the lines, or even quite openly, give a degree of concession to totalitarian regimes."
"It was recently claimed, for example, that the main problem in dictatorships is that there is a risk that healthcare will be privatised."
"The fact that widespread starvation has never occurred in a democracy is seldom pointed out by anyone."
"This attitude is quite simply not tenable."
"In order for our financing instruments within the aid budget to function in an optimum way, we must place the promotion of democracy at the centre of all our external relations, and this must not only happen in formal contexts and verbally, without any practical action being taken."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to focus my speech on Mr Goerens' report, which deals with the ACP Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM)."
"As I myself come from one of the only European regions to produce bananas, I can only show solidarity with the ACP producers in question."
"Solidarity, first and foremost, because a strong historical link unites the European Union to these countries, and we should do our utmost to ensure that they, too, are able to maximise the benefits of globalisation, of which they are, more often than not, the first victims."
"Solidarity, also, because the trade concessions generously granted by the Commission to the WTO are in danger of dealing a fatal blow to this agricultural sector in our ACP partner countries."
"Solidarity, but definitely not naivety, lastly, since the proposal for a BAM regulation as tabled by the Commission put much too much emphasis on the economic diversification aspect."
"Given the loss of tariff preference that resulted from the WTO agreement, this programme's main goal is clearly to ensure the sustainability of ACP banana exports and hence, to help make them competitive."
"Furthermore, let us be honest, the funds set aside by the BAM are by no means enough and do not extend over a long enough period to make diversification happen."
"Finally, I would add that, if we are aware of the urgency of the situation, we can accept these accompanying measures being financed through the extensive redeployment of heading IV of the budget."
"The Council must be responsible and work towards finding a viable solution for the multiannual financing of this programme."
"(PL) The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights is, in my view, an instrument that is used and approached too technically at present."
"It should be a political tool of the European Union to a greater degree, as it has a huge potential to support and promote democracy."
"However, this would require a change in the way this European financial instrument is approached."
"To date, the question of supporting democracy has been overshadowed by the issue of human rights."
"Of course, these are extremely important, but I believe that supporting democracy itself, which is a different matter, should be given a much higher status and much greater weight."
"That is why we must also strengthen non-governmental institutions in countries with authoritarian governments."
"We should focus on grassroots democracy in those countries, building it from the bottom up."
"This means focusing on civil society organisations which offer innovative methods of expanding the public space."
"In order to succeed in this, we must first introduce regular monitoring of the impact of those organisations which receive European funding."
"We must also, as the organisations themselves agree, set up a forum at which regular meetings are held to facilitate communication between donors and recipients, and not only donors from the European Union, but also from elsewhere."
"Our application forms need to be simplified."
"At present, they are simply beyond the understanding of many."
"Finally, the Commission must work to relax financial regulation."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the title of this debate is likely to create a certain optimism because in theory, it is about defining the procedures for helping banana-producing ACP countries."
"The reality is entirely different, and I have to say that the way they have been treated throughout this report is quite simply unacceptable."
"We must first and foremost bear in mind the fact that the banana sector is vital for many African and Caribbean countries."
"Yet, despite this, they have made the effort to accept, at the WTO, an agreement which lowers the European customs tariff to EUR 114 per tonne, in order to put an end to a long-standing dispute with Latin American producer countries."
"However, the Commission seems to have forgotten to inform them of the bilateral negotiations under way with these same countries on a far lower tariff: EUR 75 per tonne."
"Faced with this situation, during the last plenary session of the ACP-EU Assembly in Tenerife, all the members agreed to adopt as one a declaration calling for support measures tailored to producers' needs to be implemented without delay."
"Back in Brussels and Strasbourg, I see that, unfortunately - and this is no surprise - the right is backtracking and even opposing any reference to this declaration."
"I am tired of this double-dealing, but, above all, I fear that this weariness is shared by our historical partners, who no longer believe in our will to truly support their development."
"Mr President, I welcome this mid-term review of the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), commend the work of the rapporteur and welcome the changes allowing tax payments to be made."
"Two-thirds of human rights organisations have been unable to obtain local exemptions, so this loophole which has diminished the real needs of the projects will now be filled."
"To the Commission, I welcome the structured cooperation which has allowed Parliament to be consulted on your annual programmes, and I support the further amendments today on delegated acts."
"I also remind you of the need to integrate the findings of the electoral observation missions into follow-up in the country."
"And, to the Member States, I remind you that when it comes to the next financial perspective, do not be tempted to cut the EIDHR."
"It has been tried before and failed, and this Parliament would ensure it would fail again."
"(RO) I would like to highlight the implementation of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights in the separatist Transnistria region in the Republic of Moldova."
"Transnistria is committing serious violations in the areas of democracy and respect for human rights."
"In this regard, using this instrument offers a good way to promote democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in this region."
"Projects have been launched as part of the instrument, including the one launched in 2009 on capacity building and promoting human rights and democratic institutions in Moldova's Transnistria region."
"It entailed the involvement of the region's civil society in the democratic process."
"However, experience has shown that this instrument has not been used to its maximum capacity as there have been frequent implementation delays and transparency problems."
"I must stress the need to review this instrument with the aim of devising effective implementation strategies in this region."
"(SK) With its budget of EUR 1.1 billion for the period 2007-2013, the European instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights contributes significantly to the upholding and advancement of human rights and the strengthening of democracy worldwide."
"I am pleased that the set of additional amending and supplementing measures takes into consideration and simultaneously makes provision for the changes ensuing from the Treaty of Lisbon by appropriately strengthening the right of Parliament for control in this area."
"I also consider the explicit stipulation of the possibility to object to the delegated act within the period of two months from the date of notification a substantial asset for Parliament."
"I believe that the empowerment of the authority of Parliament will help make this instrument more flexible, comply with the new requirements stipulated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and better face the challenges involved in the protection of human rights and democracy worldwide."
"(RO) The common denominator which the three reports we are currently discussing actually have is that they examine the instruments intended to fund development cooperation and the actions taken to promote democracy and human rights globally."
"I believe that it is natural for us to carry out such evaluations of the instruments for funding development cooperation, just as I think it is natural for us to exercise our right of control as part of the comitology procedure and highlight a series of problems linked to the way in which the Commission has implemented the instrument and interpreted some of its basic provisions."
"I wanted to speak in support of the proposals tabled by the Committee on Development, which will supplement the accompanying measures proposed by the Commission, especially for the banana sector."
"On the other hand, I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of the European Union's development policy is to reduce and, in the long term, eradicate poverty."
"I, too, believe that, in addition to human rights and the promotion of democracy, we must not forget this fundamental objective of eradicating poverty."
"(SK) The proposal of the Commission, amending and supplementing the instrument on cooperation with industrialised countries, relates to the extension of the geographic jurisdiction from the original 17 countries to a further 46 countries, to which, thus far, the financing instrument for development cooperation has applied."
"I am glad that the European Union has decided to extend cooperation in accordance with the programme of the instrument on cooperation with industrial countries by adding more countries."
"However, I do not understand the motivation for including some of the countries in this list."
"I admire the citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for tolerating and withstanding the long decades of abuse by the military regime, but I fail to understand the Commission officials who, in the submitted proposal, indirectly recommend to us that we help Kim Jong-Il improve the technological base of his military industry so that he may intimidate and threaten neighbouring countries more efficiently."
"I firmly believe that modernisation of the Korean democratic people's army should not be a priority to which the citizens of the European Union should make financial contributions, and that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea does not yet belong to the list of countries proposed in the appendix by the Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, before I start, I would like to thank you for the constructive way in which you chair our session and for your fairness in naming who is to speak and who is not to."
"The OECD countries pump over USD 100 billion per annum into development aid."
"This means that they make up 90% of the publicly funded development aid in the world."
"The EU is the world's biggest donor of development aid."
"However, every year, EUR 3 billion worth of aid gets lost due to qualitative defects."
"What can be done about this?"
"In future, we expect monitoring that ensures that the funds are employed in a way that is traceable and durable."
"We also expect the recipient countries to be reminded of their obligations, for example, with regard to cooperation in the repatriation of illegal migrants."
"It is absolutely possible to use development aid as a means of applying pressure to conclude readmission agreements."
"Uncooperative countries of origin for millions of illegal migrants must not be allowed to continue to look forward to millions in development aid."
"I expect clear words in this regard at the forthcoming EU-Africa summit in November."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financing instruments for development cooperation and for the promotion of democracy and human rights should be flexible in order to prevent stalemate situations of the kind we have already experienced many times."
"The European Union is, in fact, releasing substantial funds."
"These funds should not be made inaccessible because procedures are too complex."
"Above and beyond the flexibility given to these instruments, however, I would like to stress the importance of really ensuring that small organisations and structures, too, can benefit from these grants, because nowadays, we are unfortunately too often faced with situations in which only large NGOs benefit from them, and only for a short period."
"Indeed, I believe that prioritising small NGOs over longer periods could produce far better results."
"These days, there are many small grass-roots organisations that do excellent long-term work at local level."
"They are the real conduits of change, and that is why they, too, should be able to benefit from this aid."
"Mr President, giving money from one's own pockets is an act of generosity."
"Giving money out of other peoples' pockets, those of the taxpayer, is both less generous and less honest."
"The additional EUR 176 million will not just be given to the poorest countries, but also to emergent countries whose exports are already and increasingly destroying our manufacturing bases and the jobs of our taxpayers."
"A desire on the part of the EU to promote democracy and human rights in the Third World might be admirable, if it were not for the fact that European Union countries can, and do, imprison people who have committed neither acts of violence nor theft, but simply expressed heretical or dissenting opinions on political or academic subjects."
"European Union countries can, and do, ban political parties openly, as in Belgium and Germany, or by the back door by civil action, as in the United Kingdom."
"If we wish to spread democracy and human rights worldwide, we would do so more effectively and more cheaply by setting a good example."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this has been a fascinating debate."
"In a way, it very much coincides with yesterday's speech here by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, when he clearly said that the EU and the United Nations share responsibility in this world in the fight against poverty, the fight against climate change and the fight against nuclear proliferation."
"It is a common challenge that we face."
"On the whole, our citizens today are not too worried about this issue because they believe that we take care of this issue and also promote our values."
"Transnistria was mentioned."
"It is not thousands of kilometres away from us; it is very close."
"Concerning peace and security, it is true that we do not have too much conflict, but that is because we have an extremely active external policy in order to prevent any conflict as soon as it starts."
"I believe that we have experience that we can be proud of."
"Financial instruments definitely help us to address these challenges."
"I believe that today's debate was basically very positive about the experience that we have had from the financial instruments."
"At the same time, I would emphasise that we have full accountability, and that it is taxpayers' money."
"Whenever we start a project, there are ex ante controls and there are ex post controls afterwards."
"There is a Court of Auditors of the European Union that looks not only at whether the money is spent correctly, but also at the political reasoning behind this."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control is quite tough with regard to any Commission spending, so I can assure you that taxpayers' money is very much valued and is spent with good purpose."
"We always discuss how to be more effective, but I can assure you that we follow policy objectives that have been agreed with this House."
"Today's debate has already started the next debate, because ambition concerning the revision of financial instruments has been rather humble until now."
"We wanted just to adopt them until the year 2013, with some particularities."
"Some of you address the challenge for countries that will have particular issues because of our agreement on the banana trade."
"It is necessary to adopt banana accompanying measures as soon as possible."
"It is not only our credibility which is at stake; countries really face a challenge."
"That is the reasoning behind it."
"I believe that this House was very supportive of it."
"We have started to debate what will happen after 2013, and I would draw your attention to the fact that this is the beginning of the debate."
"We are not prejudging what will happen after 2013."
"The budget review was adopted by the Commission yesterday; it will be considered in this House."
"I intend to discuss the Green Paper on modernisation and development policy within the Commission."
"I believe my colleagues will also come forward with issues."
"We need to agree on policy priorities and also financial instruments well in advance so that we do not need to make an adjustment later if we find that there is not sufficient money in one instrument and we try to cover some of the priorities with reallocation."
"I understand that this is not the best possible way, but it means that before adjusting the financial framework, we should agree what we would like to achieve, which instruments should be applied, and what scope we would like to see."
"I would like to emphasise that, as a Commissioner, I have two budgetary authorities."
"One is definitely this House, but the other is the Council."
"I believe this means that, for all the scrutinies that we will carry out and on which we should agree, we need to follow the letter of the Lisbon Treaty, with the political willingness to find the right compromise so that democratic scrutiny can be fully emphasised to show that it is efficient, swift and effective."
"This is exactly what we have discussed today in the meeting that I mentioned in the first speech."
"I have every reason to believe that we will find the necessary compromise."
"It will not be easy; it will require a lot of political will."
"On the Commission side, we definitely have the political will because I know what the stakes are, particularly for some of the measures where we need a swift conclusion of this process."
"Thank you very much."
"I very much commend the work of the rapporteurs, which was very much appreciated from our side."
"rapporteur. - What will happen after 2013?"
"As regards the stability instrument, we have seen that it is wonderful because it is more flexible than other instruments, but that also occasionally leads to misuse for food crises, for humanitarian and natural disasters."
"That should really be stopped and we should clarify, for the period after 2013, that this is really for conflict situations, and maybe add more flexibility to other instruments in order to address more emergency situations."
"Then there was another thing that I would like to highlight."
"The recent British defence review puts conflict prevention at the core of the External Action Service."
"I find that quite interesting and correct."
"I think it is the right way forward to say that the External Action Service should become the hub for conflict prevention, in the interest of internal coherence."
"The tools that it needs include the stability instrument."
"I see others, like a mediation cell, being created within the appropriate structures."
"I think we should build on this when we look at the period after 2013, and ask: What do we need in terms of money and resources so as to really become a driving force for conflict prevention?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to offer a heartfelt greeting to Commissioner Piebalgs and appeal to him to take an active part, as I believe he sincerely will, in the measures to be voted on tomorrow, because it is a matter of great importance for the European Parliament, which will have greater power after the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Thank you, Commissioner Piebalgs."
"I should also like to thank all the speakers who gave their support during today's debate."
"I sincerely hope that tomorrow's vote will obtain a very broad majority, if not unanimous approval, thereby ensuring a great victory for the report by Mr Mitchell, precisely because it is important that the European Parliament has greater powers after the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I would like to thank my fellow Members for participating in this debate."
"Your comments have actually drawn attention to the same question that we, the rapporteurs, have had to grapple with in the past period."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his constructive approach to this debate."
"What we have seen today is that - as almost all speakers confirmed - the European financing instrument for democracy and human rights is a very important and perhaps the only instrument of the European Union for the democratisation of third countries and the defence of human rights designed in such a way that civil society organisations can receive it directly."
"It can be paid out directly to organisations working in the field, without the support of the third country."
"This is why it is important and we consider it necessary to promote every technical facilitation that will enable these organisations to access the aid that is often crucial to their survival."
"At the same time, and for this very reason, since this programme involves such a priority area and we are talking about an instrument that is intended directly for these NGOs and civil society organisations, it is important that Parliament has a say in the elaboration of the strategy and long-term programme, and it is essential that Parliament should see how these funds are used, and not only at the end of the seven-year financial framework."
"This is why we consider it important to emphasise Parliament's democratic right of oversight and its right to have a say."
"I believe that a joint solution will be found, especially after the meeting this morning with both Mrs Ashton and Commissioner Piebalgs, and I, too, seriously believe that if the political will is there, the legal obstacles will be overcome."
"This, then, is the view we should take as we look ahead to the coming weeks."
"Mr President, the cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in relation to the Instrument for democracy and human rights was good; the relationship was very cooperative, in fact."
"Occasionally, MEPs were invited to take part in an exchange of opinion between the Commission and civil society on specific programmes."
"The debate, too, has shown that there are hardly any problems in administering the instrument."
"That does not mean, however, that we can rule out occasional problems in application in future."
"That is why Parliament's right of supervision is very important."
"However, the one point on which we have not been able to reach agreement so far is the establishment of a binding right of supervision for Parliament, which the Treaty of Lisbon allows for."
"I therefore join the multiple others who have expressed the hope that we reach a compromise - in other words, a political solution - quickly and one that takes full account of Parliament's rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, as the debate draws to a close, I would just like to express my sincere thanks, once again, to the shadow rapporteurs and to Mrs Lochbihler, for the constructive and results-oriented cooperation stretching back over a year of working together."
"The debate today has demonstrated that financial issues, the use of budget resources, planning and the issue of the political control of the instruments are highly political issues."
"To close this debate, I would therefore like to summarise what form the instruments are to take."
"How we realise them has much to do with how European citizens perceive the European Union and thus, also with how the use of resources for one instrument or another is accepted by citizens."
"I can therefore only repeat what I said to Baroness Ashton and to you, Commissioner, this morning during the briefing of the steering committee for the working group on delegated acts, which was that I think there is an urgent need to quickly reach a solution in relation to delegated acts, whilst preserving the legal and political responsibility of the legislator and the Commission."
"The Instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories (ICI) is being fundamentally amended in this parliamentary term."
"We plan to release up to EUR 348 million for cooperation in the fields of science, academic exchanges, the Erasmus Mundus programme, culture, environmental protection and renewable energy sources and the stimulation of bilateral trade relations."
"The aim is for particular consideration to be given, here, to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I have the following to say to the empty benches facing me, including because Mr Griffin is no longer there: I believe this to be a very important contribution towards the European Union's openness to the rest of the world and towards its acceptance, both by its own citizens and by other countries with which we enter into exchanges."
"In conclusion, then, we have started this financing instrument on its way through successful compromise negotiations between the Council and Parliament and attempted to adapt it to the challenges of the future and to reach agreement on all the issues of content."
"I hope that, with the vote in this House tomorrow, we will take a decisive step forwards."
"Mr President, I make no secret of the fact that the provisions set out in the Banana Accompanying Measures are a gamble on the future, for various reasons."
"Firstly, the general trend of reducing trade preferences, from which ACP countries have benefited until now, is not going to change any time soon."
"Negotiations under way are already aiming at tariffs close to EUR 75 per tonne of bananas, whereas we are working here on the basis of EUR 114 per tonne."
"Secondly, the Commission had no other choice but to agree to negotiate a tariff reduction agreement with the countries competing with the banana-exporting ACP countries."
"The alternative would have meant leaving the Dispute Settlement Body to sort out the problem."
"Personally, I believe that a negotiated solution is the lesser evil for ACP countries, and this is the spirit in which we must also approach the Banana Accompanying Measures, since they would not have been the automatic outcome of a judgment by the Dispute Settlement Body."
"Thirdly, since the world is not going to end in 2013, which is the year when the Banana Accompanying Measures will end, we continue to believe that it is important to start preparing right now for the period after 2013."
"Indeed, the EUR 114 tariff paid at the borders of the European Union on each tonne of bananas is already soon going to be exceeded in practice."
"I said at the outset that we were already talking about EUR 75 per tonne."
"I feel it is wise, therefore - and this is my fourth point - to preserve the European Parliament's supervisory powers."
"We must ensure that the right to oversee strategy papers, laid down in Article 290, does not become a dead letter."
"I think we can safely say that, in this instance, our cooperation with the Commission has been extremely fruitful."
"This Parliament is not a troublemaker; on the contrary, it is forever enriching the debate and helping the Commission move forward on this matter."
"Finally, Mr President, this is a personal observation, but I am making it as rapporteur, even so."
"Once more, we are witnessing here a squabble between emerging countries, on the one hand, and least developed countries, on the other."
"Moreover, were it not for the European Union acting as an ally of the weak in order to mitigate the likely effects of a trade agreement, in all its brutality, the least developed countries would feel even more isolated."
"I invite the Commission to start thinking right now about the period after 2013, because I believe that the measures which will be decided on now and which, I hope, will come into force before too long, will suffice to make banana production sustainable in the countries concerned."
"I hope that these measures can help ensure the long-term survival of the banana sector and that those who are unable to keep producing can find alternatives."
"I think that, post-2013, as I have already said, water will continue to flow under the bridges over the Rhine and the problems with regard to the banana sector will still be there."
"We already need to be thinking about a post-2013 strategy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 21 October 2010, at 12:00."
"Ukraine (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Ukraine."
"Baroness Ashton was not able to remain with us today."
"Commissioner Füle will present the matter on her behalf."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this opportunity and I apologise on behalf of Catherine Ashton, who asked me to share with you what she intended to tell you."
"I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement on the current situation in Ukraine."
"I should like to make my remarks in the light of three important upcoming events: the EU-Ukraine Ministerial meeting which will take place in Luxembourg on 26 October, the local elections which will take place on 31 October, and the 14th EU-Ukraine Summit which will be held in Brussels on 22 November."
"In recent times, Ukraine has enjoyed a high level of political freedoms."
"Successive elections have been recognised as having been conducted in accordance with international standards."
"Ukraine has developed a dynamic and diverse civil society and media environment."
"There have been consistent improvements across the board with regard to respect for human rights."
"As a consequence of these developments and of the commitment of successive governments to the path of closer ties with the European Union, relations between the European Union and Ukraine have acquired considerable momentum."
"This is reflected most clearly in the ambitious and far-reaching European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement which we are currently negotiating, and which aims at achieving the twin goals of political association and economic integration with the European Union."
"President Yanukovych's government has undertaken a number of important economic reforms in recent months, which should be commended."
"These include the adoption of a public procurement law, which should play an important role in the fight against corruption and in increasing competitiveness."
"The adoption of a gas sector reform law, which paves the way for Ukraine's imminent accession to the Energy Community Treaty, as well as the agreement it recently reached with the IMF for a standby agreement, are also critical steps in securing macro-financial stability, transparency and a return to growth."
"These reforms go in the right direction and must be sustained."
"The Ukrainian Government has also managed to achieve a level of stability which has eluded Ukraine's political establishment in recent years."
"This is an important and necessary development in ensuring effective governance of the country."
"Nonetheless, we are concerned at consistent and widespread reports of a deterioration in respect for fundamental freedoms and democratic principles in Ukraine."
"Particularly worrying are complaints related to freedom of the media, freedom of assembly and freedom of association."
"Respect of these fundamental values is essential."
"They are the best guarantors of individual freedoms."
"They ensure a genuine competition of ideas."
"They are an essential component of truly open, innovative and competitive societies."
"On 1 October, the Ukrainian Constitutional Court handed down a judgment which overturned constitutional changes made after the 2004 Orange Revolution."
"This decision only increases the need for Ukraine to achieve wider constitutional reform through an inclusive constitutional reform process and, to a great extent, takes up a key theme of the European Parliament's resolution of 25 February this year."
"Such a process should seek to establish an effective and lasting constitutional system of checks and balances in accordance with European standards."
"For the European Union and our Member States, respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law are fundamental principles that bind us together."
"They are principles that cannot be compromised, so too for our relations with key partners such as Ukraine."
"The pace and depth of our rapprochement with Ukraine will be determined by full respect of these values."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the people of Ukraine have come out impressively in favour of a European future for their country again and again."
"Disturbing reports from Ukraine, however, indicate developments that distance the country from Europe."
"That is why we are having this debate ahead of the municipal elections."
"We will be able to discuss economic reforms in November in connection with the EU-Ukraine summit."
"We therefore need to talk about intimidation by the secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press and the ability to take part in the elections unhindered."
"Developments like this cannot be balanced out by positive news in the economic sphere."
"'Economic prosperity through authoritarian rule' is a Chinese approach, not a European one."
"Those who hold power in Ukraine today should not be allowed to believe that they can escape just because the broad European public takes no notice or because the previous government admittedly did have failings in relation to good governance and combating corruption."
"These things are true, yet there was no atmosphere of being watched, there were no visits from the secret police, as has been experienced by the rector of the Catholic University of Lviv and by young people involved in NGOs and opposition parties."
"Cutting off power to businesses, seizing computers, occupying party offices on the grounds of supposed risks of attacks - the whole gamut of the déjà vu is on show in Ukraine."
"There is method to it."
"The secret police is headed by Mr Khoroshkovsky, who actually runs a media empire and is now also a member of the committee to appoint the most senior judge in the country."
"That, too, distances Ukraine from Europe."
"There is little left of equality of opportunity in the political contest before the municipal elections."
"The opposition is being partially excluded from the elections, while puppet parties are being spontaneously formed and authorised to take part in the elections by compliant local authorities."
"In Kiev, the district councils are being unceremoniously abolished so that no elections are taking place there - the governing party knows that it will not win there are the moment."
"The power vertical has the objective of achieving control over regions that have previously been inclined to disagree with it."
"We put forward our European experience as an alternative."
"Our Member States took important decisions in democratic consensus between government and an opposition ready to take responsibility - for European reforms, for the rule of law, for a competitive market economy, for European integration."
"We want Ukraine to continue down this road with us."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(PL) Thank you for allowing my question."
"It is always good to be able to start such a debate."
"You have actually painted a rather gloomy picture of what is currently going on in Ukraine, even going so far as to compare it with China."
"Do you really believe that the current situation in Ukraine is so dire that we should hurl such grave accusations against the country?"
"What are your views on Russia in this context?"
"Is equating Ukraine and Russia not doing Ukraine an injustice?"
"Mr President, I said that looking to achieve economic prosperity through authoritarian rule is not a route that we in Europe can go down."
"We know this from China."
"I did not make a comparison, I merely stated that that would be the wrong route to take, that it would not be a European route."
"The image that I sketched is a very realistic one, I think, for the people on the ground."
"The supposed economic achievements there still need to demonstrate their effectiveness."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, Ukraine is a very important country to us."
"It is a country which faces a lot of challenges."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for a perfect description of the situation, as well as a perfect description of our expectations."
"A new government was elected through free and fair elections, recognised by all of us."
"Today is the right time to leave this government to deliver, and not to prejudge its achievements or non-achievements from the first minutes of its mandate."
"The real problem of this debate is a problem we have here."
"We were too fast in dividing that country into pro-westerners and pro-easterners."
"Now we have a problem, since the pro-westerners are not in power, in recognising the pro-easterners' capacity to deliver and to help the country promote its European expectations."
"This is the real problem with this debate today and we should understand that the real pro-Europeans are the pro-Ukrainians - those who are able to bring the rule of law, democracy and European modernisation to their country."
"I would conclude simply by asking colleagues to decide to postpone the resolution we are expected to adopt, because the Ukrainians are facing elections and they face negotiations with us."
"We should not adopt resolutions in the middle of a political process and before we have the facts on the basis of which we can indeed draw conclusions."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we seem to have difficulties in knowing how to deal with our Eastern neighbour, Ukraine."
"It is just as difficult for Ukraine, which treats Europe one day as an ally, another day as a problem."
"This is why I believe we should be pragmatic, recognise the realities on the ground, and find common items on our agendas to reach agreements."
"Economic cooperation has always been Europe's most powerful engine for greater integration and Europe has owed its success to this pragmatic approach since 1956."
"So we must continue to focus on both institutional and economic reforms to be undertaken by Ukraine in parallel."
"This two-track approach is the only one possible if we want to create a virtuous circle that could lead to democratic stability in this country and in the Eastern neighbourhood."
"A priority should be to support a healthy business environment and the achievement of a functioning market economy in Ukraine by encouraging their property and VAT reforms and their efforts to combat high-level corruption, among other priorities."
"This is why I see the association agreement as a powerful instrument of reform, and it is why we should continue our negotiations on the establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area and on Ukraine's accession to the Energy Community Treaty."
"In that context, I welcome Ukraine's accession to the WTO, which should be seen as an important step in Ukraine's acceptance of European economic standards."
"I hope that we will be able to overcome the continuous postponement of the FTA and encourage the virtuous circle of mutual trust, which is beneficial to the whole region and to Europe."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that I share the concern about the intensification of the situation and the undemocratic developments in Ukraine."
"There are more and more reports about the repression of the freedom of expression of journalists, regular threats to committed individual members of the NGOs and people working for democratic development."
"The role of the secret police, too, gives real cause for concern."
"However, I do not believe that the altercations about freedom of the press and democratic development in general begin with the last election, rather - and I have said this here often - all the leading players in Ukraine have repeatedly abused their power for purposes including bringing their own interests to fruition."
"This abuse is getting worse and that really must concern us."
"We would be doing ourselves no favours if we were to adopt this resolution without being worried about certain economic developments in Ukraine."
"I am watching with just as much concern how Russia's influence on the Ukrainian economy, its energy sector, but also other sectors, has been systematically expanded."
"I would therefore also advise that we do not have to vote tomorrow but instead after the delegation has visited Kiev - a delegation is going there the weekend after next - and before we have the summit here, after careful preparation in all areas to agree what the European Parliament's position actually is regarding the situation in Ukraine."
"I have gone down this path from the pre-democratic times to the new times with numerous Ukrainian friends."
"Ukraine was on a very good path."
"It was our impression that the last elections took place in accordance with democratic conventions."
"If the situation should not now improve, but instead worsen, we should nonetheless consider very carefully how we intervene and how we do not intervene."
"In any case, I would advise against making a decision before our next visit to Ukraine."
"Our voice will be louder if we bring up the debate on the things about which we have spoken in the resolution over there."
"As I say, I really am concerned."
"I am receiving a lot of reports that everything is heading in a negative direction."
"However, we would be doing ourselves no favours if we were to rule out debate on the ground over there and make too fast and too hasty a decision."
"Many of us here played an active role in the Orange Revolution by helping the Ukrainian democrats at a time of hardship."
"However, we always stressed the fact that the aim of our involvement in Ukraine was not to support any particular political force, but to help make Ukraine a democratic and free country."
"Today, we should remember that the European Parliament did not play a role in Ukraine's internal politics, but acted as a guardian in two very important ways: on the one hand, by upholding and assisting Ukrainians' European aspirations and, on the other, by upholding democracy, human rights and all the values we regard as European values in Ukraine."
"I say that the tone of the proposed resolution is not one which will help those who regard themselves as friends of Ukraine."
"Today's resolution will only push Ukraine closer to Russia, and to those who say, 'you will see, there is no room for us in the West."
"It is closing its doors to us'."
"We have to be open to Ukraine, we have to tell it what European standards are, and we must keep up the pressure to ensure they are observed, while, on the other hand, we must absolutely prevent Ukraine from returning to the East."
"I would like to ask Mr Gahler, whose involvement in human rights and international politics I value greatly, why he finds it necessary to use such damning words about Ukraine."
"I would like to hear from him whether his colleague, Angela Merkel, used such damning words about Russia during her recent meeting with Mr Putin."
"Mr President, at the beginning of this week, Ukraine made headlines in the Dutch press - and I will say it in this auditorium - not very flattering headlines, unfortunately."
"That was on Monday."
"In brief, Ukraine is the Wild West of Eastern Europe."
"Foreign investors are said to fear the lawlessness that reigns in this country where, last week, no fewer than 3 000 buildings and companies were expropriated through fraud and violence."
"This process involves wide boys acting in cahoots with the country's politicians to dupe entrepreneurs."
"Meanwhile, Member States of the EU have been the largest direct foreign investors in Ukraine since 1991."
"Commissioner Füle, are you aware of these major concerns which affect European investors in Ukraine and what specific steps has the Commission taken to protect legitimate, legal European business interests in the Ukrainian economy?"
"That would be showing commitment."
"We have nothing against Ukraine."
"My party even strongly advocates Ukraine's eventual membership of the European Union, but we do have to maintain a sober perspective, of course."
"We are witnessing worrying developments, not only in the field of human rights, but also in the fields of economy and business."
"(DE) Mr President, within a few months of the presidential election in February of this year, in which Mr Yanukovych celebrated his comeback, the democratic accomplishments of the Orange Revolution are clearly being lost."
"When, however, even the financial markets judge the new government to be more stable and predictable than the government put in place by the Orange Revolution, that is probably a sign that democracy according to Western - according to our European - preconceptions cannot be transposed on a one-to-one basis to every country, including to those of the post-Communist sphere of influence."
"The current decision by the Constitutional Court would indeed strengthen the position of the President and weaken that of the parliament, of that we can be sure."
"Those who know the region say that a de facto presidential system was already in place before the pro forma court judgment."
"Growing restrictions on the freedom of the press and of opinion put Mr Yanukovych's reassurances that democratic standards will be maintained in doubt."
"If the President succeeds in both reinforcing his own power base and achieving an economic recovery by carrying out central reforms in Ukraine, which is, of course, one of the poorest countries of this continent, he will perhaps keep himself on his presidential throne for longer and I believe that that would be something that, plainly and simply, the European Union would have to take note of."
"Mr President, developments in Ukraine clearly illustrate the old saying about how power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
"The present ruling élite has been exercising power since the election of President Yanukovych and much of what has been done points in the direction of favouring the concentration of power."
"This is all the more striking if we recall the results of the presidential elections which gave Yanukovych a small majority and demonstrated that he had strong support in the south and east of the country only."
"Yet - and this is the striking feature of Ukrainian politics currently - there has been a steady movement in the direction of marginalising alternative centres of power."
"The media, rule of law, the opposition, the autonomy of the state administration, have all been affected."
"What is particularly worrying is that the secret police have acquired the capacity to intervene very extensively in the affairs of the country."
"All this augurs badly for the future, especially if Ukrainians genuinely seek a European future, because the system being built by Yanukovych points away from Europe, not towards it."
"The most that can be said for the changes is that they have brought a degree of stability to the country, but increasingly, this stability foreshadows stasis and immobility."
"At the same time, it is true, Yanukovych has certainly improved relations with Russia, but has thereby accepted a degree of subordination to Moscow that is new."
"Whether Ukrainian society will accept this transformation in the longer term is an open question."
"(PL) Let us ask ourselves what has actually happened in Ukraine: a coup d'état, or a military coup, perhaps?"
"Those would be the only situations in which we should sit up all night drafting resolutions, sitting down at the negotiating table the next day."
"We are negotiating in such a way that the absolute majority simply dominate the way the resolutions are worded and what they say."
"The language of the draft resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is the language used to condemn African dictators and South American regimes."
"This is not the right kind of language to use for the situation in Ukraine."
"I would like the members of the PPE to decide whether we should describe Ukraine using the language of Commissioner Füle, who says 'yes, but...', or in other words that some things are good, but there are a lot of things we do not like, or whether we should use negative language, whereby there is nothing we like, and everything is to be condemned."
"Ukraine was in chaos for five years."
"We witnessed this chaos."
"We helped the democrats and we helped everyone who wanted to move towards the European Union."
"We have had six months of consolidation, consolidation which may have a negative outcome, and our job is to point out these negative outcomes, but not now and not in this manner."
"I understand the PPE's regret that Yulia Tymoshenko lost the elections, but I say to you: it is unfortunate, maybe she had a chance of winning, but she lost."
"Now she has lost, let us acknowledge what is really happening and let us keep the Ukrainian authorities under careful observation, but let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater."
"(PL) I am very grateful to Commissioner Füle for his constructive attitude."
"It is one which will bring great changes in relations between the EU and Ukraine."
"I also thank Mrs Harms for her balanced position, and her wise - as ever - words on the subject of Ukraine."
"All information from the OSCE shows that Ukraine is one of the few countries of the former Soviet Union in which proper elections have, to date, been held."
"This is an achievement of Ukraine, both on the orange and on the blue side."
"It is an achievement that we cannot question before the next elections are over."
"It would be a serious political error on the part of the European Union and our Parliament if we listened to the voice of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and threw doubt on the fact that elections can be held successfully in one of very few countries in the East."
"Let us help Ukraine conduct normal elections."
"Let us not make any judgments before they have been held."
"I would like to address the Ukrainian guests present in this House today: Ukraine's place is here, in this Chamber, and that is why we are subjecting you to the same standards that we apply to the countries of the European Union."
"That is what you fought for together, whether blue or orange."
"Every issue, even the tiniest one, to do with human rights or press freedom will be scrutinised here."
"Do not be surprised - I am talking to our Ukrainians brothers."
"That is because you are being treated as a European country, according to European standards."
"My last appeal to you is to act together in your dealings with the European institutions and Parliament."
"We believe that in the future, you will be among us."
"We know that it will not happen soon, but we want to help you with this."
"I agree with Mrs Harms that the time for resolutions is after the elections."
"It is then, before the EU summit, that we will be able to discuss the issue frankly and draft a position with which to present the European Parliament's common position."
"(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, Ukraine is a country of great strategic significance for the European Union."
"That is why we cannot be indifferent to what happens in that country."
"On 1 October, tens of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets to protest against the constitutional changes initiated by Yanukovych and confirmed by the Constitutional Court, the composition of which was changed shortly after the election of the President."
"These reforms were carried out without democratic debate and without the agreement of the Venice Commission."
"The changes weaken the balance of power and threaten the independence of the judiciary in Ukraine."
"Economic reforms are also put under threat."
"Our Ukrainian friends have expressed concern over the organisation of the coming elections, over the excessive representation of the ruling coalition in the Central Electoral Commission, the restrictions on non-governmental organisations and state interference in the activities of opposition parties."
"This is precisely why this resolution is needed today."
"Unfortunately, the ruling coalition rejected the opposition motion in the Ukrainian parliament to make membership of the European Union a priority of Ukraine's foreign policy."
"We must, however, continue to stress the importance of cooperation with Ukraine and monitor the implementation of agreements that have been concluded."
"The European Union must demand that corruption be fought and, at the same time, help in that fight, and that press freedom be ensured."
"A situation in which a media magnate at one and the same time both heads the state security service and is a member of the High Judicial Council, which has the power to appoint and dismiss judges, is not characteristic of a democratic state."
"In conclusion, we also need to take positive steps, providing not only for the introduction of a visa-free regime in the future, but also economic cooperation, especially in the energy sphere, while, at the same time, we await the democratic development of Ukraine."
"That would be the objective of the next resolution, which we should draw up after the election, and should cover energy, the economy and other issues of significance for Ukraine. Thank you."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I have a very simple question."
"Maybe this is an interpretation problem, but you said that the current Ukrainian Government rejected future membership of the European Union."
"As far as I know from the declaration of the President and the official statement of the Ukrainian Parliament's long-term policy, membership of the European Union is one of their top priorities."
"So the question is whether I misunderstood you, or you misunderstood the President of Ukraine."
"(LV) Yes, I shall gladly clarify this point."
"Clearly, that was an inaccurate translation."
"The President of Ukraine has announced a willingness to continue convergence with the European Union."
"Nevertheless, membership of the European Union has, according to the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament, not become the first priority."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to ask Mrs Vaidere: now that we have put down in black and white all the points concerning our consternation in relation to the misuse of power and the repression in Ukraine, what objection can there be to taking this text to Kiev in a fortnight's time in order to discuss it and then to decide how we proceed from there?"
"I would like to know the answer to this question, as, from the previous experience of our delegation, I think this is the best and most productive way to move forwards, especially if we want to gain democratic influence."
"(LV) Yes, I am happy to reply."
"Personally, and yet I do not know why, Mrs Harms, nevertheless I am personally worried, even after our participation in the Ukraine summits, about these signals that we are currently receiving from our Ukrainian friends on the composition of the Central Electoral Commission, media freedom and the restrictions on non-governmental organisations."
"These all exist, and it is precisely if we express our concerns about this that the regional elections could, in my opinion, take place in a much better atmosphere."
"There is no one to prevent us from going to Ukraine next week, even with our resolution."
"No one is preventing us from drawing up another resolution, as I said, on economic issues."
"We must definitely do this, but as regards these concerns about the deterioration of the democratic situation, we must unfortunately, that is, I think we ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I would say that the quality of the debate today shows that it was not prepared."
"We did not need this debate and now is not the time to adopt resolutions on Ukraine, neither today nor tomorrow."
"I must remind you that six months ago, the country was in freefall and on the verge of falling into chaos."
"We had political, economic and financial instability - even a deep crisis - but now we have a very different picture."
"We have to recognise that in the space of a few months, the Ukraine Government has succeeded in bringing the country back to normal; back to political, economic and financial stability."
"There are problems."
"We do not deny that."
"But we must admit that they are listening to our voice; some corrective measures have been taken, for example, on the issues of electoral law and some electoral practices."
"In this sense, our voice will be heard there as long as we do not cry out on each occasion, but adopt a decent approach to Ukraine."
"That is why I think we are doing a disservice to our parliamentary committee which is going to Ukraine in 10 days time; we are doing ourselves a disservice in undermining our own role by adopting such resolutions 10 days before the elections."
"Such a move has never happened before."
"It is a clear attempt to influence the elections."
"We should not allow our parliament to be part of this game."
"Therefore, I propose that we postpone the adoption of the resolution, and that we ask our colleagues in the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee to check with the colleagues there, to discuss those issues ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the new Ukrainian authorities are new only in name."
"A regression towards authoritarian practices is sweeping the country."
"The legal framework for the forthcoming local elections has been altered and could jeopardise the participation of the opposition parties."
"The Constitution has been changed, and a de facto presidential regime is back in place."
"The media and civil society are under constant pressure, and the Ukrainian secret service seems to be reliving its Soviet days."
"It is time for us to clearly express our concern through a resolution."
"The Ukrainian authorities should get the message that closer ties with the EU cannot be guaranteed by friendly declarations alone."
"An undemocratic Ukrainian Government cannot be a reliable partner for the EU, especially in the strategically sensitive area of the Black Sea."
"(DE) Mr President, I think we all need to live up to our responsibilities."
"The government in Ukraine needs to implement the rule of law and the freedom of the media, and it needs to do so effectively, but the opposition, too, needs to show that it is responsible and must not give out false information."
"When I look at how many of the claims contained in your draft resolution were then immediately denied by the people in question, it shows how much false information is often passed on here."
"We, too, need to show that we are responsible."
"We cannot allow ourselves to become embroiled in the internal political argument."
"Ladies and gentlemen - and I address this in particular to Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - there is no point in us defending one group or another in Ukraine on party-political grounds."
"That is not our job."
"Next week, we will be having discussions with the Foreign Minister, then we have the elections, then the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, which is travelling to Ukraine, and it has always been the case - Mr Gahler, I am appealing to your sense of fairness here - that we say whether or not things went well after the elections, rather than pre-empting the elections by saying that things will not go well."
"That is not our job, and I am appealing to your sense of fairness - something that you normally always demonstrate - and I beg you to remain fair in this case, too."
"(PL) Only those who have lived under the socialist system can fully understand the nations which experienced lack of personal freedom, lack of press and media freedom, or the difficult road these nations had to follow."
"I understand those who are today raising their concerns and speaking of the lack of respect for people's rights and the multifaceted problems that Ukraine is grappling with today."
"Yet we must also acknowledge the small but positive changes, such as the recent democratic elections at which we, as representatives of the European Parliament, were observers."
"I appeal for sensitivity to the situation of millions of citizens of Ukraine and hundreds of young Ukrainians."
"They are counting on the European Union, on our help in building democracy, and on our help in building a civil society."
"It is very easy to criticise, but as a Polish woman, I remember that we were once helped."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(EL) Mr President, I, too, should like to add my voice to those who have argued that there is no reason for such a quick resolution, especially before the elections, before the visit and, more importantly, before the European Parliament is present in Ukraine."
"This government was elected just recently; it is a fact that there are problems, but we need to recognise that it was democratically elected and allow it to pursue its efforts."
"A resolution would only make sense after the forthcoming elections in Ukraine."
"(ET) I had a question for my colleague, Mrs Vaidere, but I would like to speak about what is on my mind."
"The fact that we want to adopt the Ukraine resolution now and not tomorrow is not well-timed, and the Ukrainian people, who are looking to the European Parliament with recognition, would not understand us."
"This is because what we have today in the draft is firstly not the best in terms of tone, it is not the most accurate, and there are also some factual errors."
"Mrs Vaidere mentioned here that the Chair of the Venice Commission has criticised the amendment of the constitution."
"I have a letter by him with today's date in which he says he is astonished that this point appears in our resolution, and he says clearly that he did not do this, here, there or anywhere else."
"(PL) Unlike Mr Vigenin, I believe today's debate has been excellent, and very useful."
"It is rare for such an interesting debate to be conducted in this Chamber, for which I would like to thank everybody."
"Mrs Łukacijewska's speech shows that even the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is divided on this issue, which is good news."
"We should thank the socialists, and particularly Mr Swoboda, Mr Severin and Mr Siwiec, for understanding that decisions which are so unfavourable to our Ukrainian friends should not be taken before the elections."
"Commissioner Füle and Mrs Harms are also right to bring up certain facts which are cause for concern, and of which we are also aware."
"(CS) Pull yourselves together, ladies and gentlemen, and try to think for once."
"For a week, there has been no change to laws, nor to the composition of the Electoral Commission."
"It is interesting that whenever certain political forces feel that their allies in a country outside the European Union have not won, these forces abroad instantly express their concerns about the state of democracy in that country."
"I agree with what Mr Kamiński and others have said."
"We definitely need action from the European Parliament to contribute to the development of democracy and the improvement of conditions for the mutual development of relationships."
"Efforts to support stabilising actions by the Ukrainian Government apparently stepped on the toes of some of those who revel in chaos and lawlessness."
"My colleagues probably consider them better partners than the current government."
"I recommend postponing the draft resolution and returning to a discussion on this topic after the delegation returns from Kiev."
"(SK) I believe that Ukraine is one of the closest potential partners of the European Union."
"The Ukrainians are much closer to Europe civilisation-wise than are the Turks or the Albanians."
"The Ukrainian people have freely elected a change because the democratic orange powers have run the country into poverty, hopelessness and decay."
"Yanukovych was long in opposition and his attitude to the current opposition reflects the treatment he received from the orange leaders."
"Moreover, we must also recognise the fact that he probably remembers the earlier period when he was victimised by the orange league, and the European Union reacted by simply smiling benevolently."
"Unless we want to lose Ukraine as our future member, let us be patient and concentrate on economic cooperation; let us build up a climate of mutual trust."
"We must explain to the government that the opposition has its legitimate place in a democratic society, and to the opposition that unless it gains sufficient support from the people, it has no right to compete for power."
"(DE) Mr President, as I was addressed personally, I would actually like to respond for a minute under the catch-the-eye procedure."
"Is that alright?"
"(DE) Mr President, the foundation of the Energy Community in 2006 established an integrated European Energy market for gas and electricity, and the planned inclusion of Ukraine is intended to secure the energy supply towards Eastern Europe."
"This is a good thing, as there have certainly been a few serious problems in recent years and the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, had a serious effect on the gas supplies of EU Member States."
"Subsequently, it was, of course, clear that Russia stopped the gas supplies during the price discussions and my home country of Austria, alone, experienced a fall of 33% in supplies of Russian gas, while France, Hungary and Italy also recorded drops of 20 to 40%."
"This calls for the Commission - as coordinator of the Energy Community - to grab Ukraine by the arm and remind it of its obligations when it comes to Europe's security of supply."
"The energy supply of our Member States cannot simply be allowed to become a pawn in the price war between Russia and Ukraine."
"Let us have good discussions, then, but let us also play hard ball and let us, I beg, secure the energy supplies of our Member States."
"(BG) The European Parliament has always supported Ukraine on its journey towards democracy, based on the principles of the rule of law and sharing with us common values on European integration."
"Elections act as a barometer in any democracy."
"This allows us to evaluate the quality of the democratic process, institutions' stability, the maturity of the political parties and the views of civil society."
"I welcome the Ukrainian authorities' decision to invite observers to the elections to be held on 31 October."
"I am confident that their mission will provide greater trust in the election process and their observations will help confirm the transparency and impartiality of the workings of Ukrainian institutions."
"Apart from elections, the constitution, as the supreme law in Ukraine, must guarantee the authorities' balance and their reciprocal control."
"Ukraine can rely on its European partner to support consistently its efforts to achieve reform and stability."
"The opinion of the European Union and its civil society provides additional impetus and a guarantee of ultimate success."
"(LT) Last week, Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine, paid an official visit to my country, Lithuania, and confirmed once again that Ukraine's goal is to become a Member of the European Union."
"Without doubt, this will take several years and a lot of homework has to be done and many reforms have to be carried out in various fields, such as ensuring human rights, combating corruption, overcoming poverty and strengthening democracy."
"However, I agree with my colleagues who spoke here in the European Parliament; we must not immediately condemn Ukraine as a country and we should not stop it from becoming an equal partner and therefore, I repeat that we in the European Parliament really must cooperate as equal partners and help Ukraine move towards the European Union."
"(SL) Ukraine is a large and important partner of the European Union and a country which undoubtedly has a European future."
"The worst service, I think, that we can do for Ukraine, a country with a complicated internal structure and a difficult history, would be to speak of it as if it were the subject of our cross-party or ideological bartering."
"For that reason, every document we adopt must be well thought out and well balanced."
"The opposition of yesterday is the government of today and that can happen in any other country holding democratic elections."
"It is easy then to understand that the opposition is dissatisfied because it has lost power."
"However, it will get its chance, when the time is right and if voters so decide."
"I think it is wrong for us to rely on the arguments of only one side and, above all, I would like to say that I am confident ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Ukraine is our major European democratic associative partner and I, too, hope that one day, it will become a member of the European Union."
"Like many speakers, I have some doubts as to the appropriateness of an EP resolution shortly before their local elections, and my group, the ECR Group, has submitted a number of amendments to make the resolution more balanced and less repetitive."
"Yanukovych won the election to become President democratically, albeit by a small margin."
"There are indeed some worrying authoritarian trends in Kiev, from attempts to re-establish the temniki censorship of press freedom to the use of the FBU security service, led by an oligarch for political purposes."
"However, the West is watching the process closely."
"President Yanukovych is now under pressure."
"The legacy of the Orange Revolution is still strong and the Ukrainian civil society that emerged from it very robust."
"Everyone knows that I have close relations with the opposition's leading figures, but I, too, think we should avoid too much interference in Ukrainian internal domestic and political affairs which may well backfire on this Parliament and we should give the ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Exactly the same arguments were made before the presidential elections, when we were wondering in this Chamber what resolution to adopt, and what our position should be with regard to what was going on in Ukraine prior to the presidential elections."
"We decided that we would issue a resolution after the elections, and that is what we did."
"We called upon the government and the opposition to observe human rights, freedom of speech and freedom of association."
"Several months have gone by since that resolution, and we can already see that some of its provisions have not been observed."
"I therefore understand the concern that the local elections, which are key in terms of fostering democracy, strengthening it and establishing it, may involve certain rights being violated."
"That, too, is why I am one of the authors of the resolution."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity to react to what has been a very interesting debate indeed; my reply will focus on three points."
"First, let me respond to a concrete question by Mr Belder concerning the investment and business environment."
"More needs to be done in Ukraine in this field."
"That is obvious, and I have raised this question a number of times, whether in the framework of the Association Council or in the framework of various meetings."
"The last time I had the opportunity to raise this issue was with Prime Minister Azarov, just last week."
"There are a number of issues, such as the procurement law and the possibility of going back on this law through various amendments which are now being debated in the Ukrainian Parliament."
"More needs to be done as far as the rule of law is concerned and, of course, we have watched with great interest the Mittal case in recent days."
"More needs to be done to deliver on the commitment and promises made to deal with the VAT issue, which is also an irritant for our businesses."
"Through our contacts with the Ukrainian authorities, and through regular contacts with businessmen, we are set to protect the interests of European investors and European businessmen."
"My second point is that it is not an easy process in which we are engaged with Ukraine."
"This is a process where proclamations about the European future might sometimes be helpful, but will not deliver."
"What is going to deliver is building more of the European Union within Ukraine."
"They need our assistance."
"They also need us to give them a reality check from time to time."
"That is what they expect from us."
"What we do not need is to be pushed into a false debate about what is more important: stability or adherence and commitment to values, and that leads me to my third point."
"Who am I to comment on the draft resolution before this House, but I think the very fact that this debate has happened has already given a valuable signal."
"I think the fact that this House's representatives are going to Ukraine soon, and will pass on most of these messages, conveys a very valuable message in itself."
"I think that another very valuable message in terms of what we should expect from the Ukrainians is that the forthcoming local elections on 31 October will reconfirm the democratic stance of their country."
"I shall stop speaking now, if I may."
"Mr Gahler has the floor under Rule 151(1) due to personal allusions."
"Please be very brief and respond to the personal allusions."
"(DE) Mr President, I wanted to respond in detail to what Mr Swoboda had to say."
"He made a point that was not entirely correct."
"It is true that, in our resolution, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) did incorrectly quote the Venice Commission."
"I have spoken with Mr Markert and he told me what he actually said."
"That is why the joint resolution no longer contains the quotation."
"You can see, therefore, that this is no longer a subject of debate."
"You spoke about the rule of law in general."
"However, I would have liked to have heard you, as the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, say something clear and specific about the things that the secret police do there."
"When parties there are not permitted to take part in elections, that is something that you can criticise even before an election, as, in such circumstances, the results of the election obviously cannot meet democratic and European standards."
"(DE) Mr President, this is not supposed to be a dialogue."
"However, Mr Gahler, you should at least be made aware that I made very clear, in a press release, no less, which was also on behalf of my group, that the secret services must be monitored."
"I also brought this up in my talks with Prime Minister Azarov."
"We have a clear position on this matter."
"I would ask you, once again, to consider overnight whether it would not really make more sense for us to adopt a resolution together, as a broad community, rather than adopting one with a narrow majority as would be the case at present."
"Have another think about that."
"That would be sensible."
"To conclude the debate, I have received six motions for resolutionstabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 21 October 2010, at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (LT) Ukraine has always played a special role in the EU Eastern Partnership."
"Its size, location and the vicissitudes of history make it an important bridge between East and West."
"It is hardly surprising that now as before, Europe is closely following political events within Ukraine."
"However, the current picture is not without ambiguity."
"We must recognise that the new government was elected in free and democratic elections and it helped pull Ukraine out of the economic and political chaos that dominated six months ago."
"On the other hand, we cannot ignore tendencies in the area of media freedom that cause concern."
"However, I agree with colleagues who stated that today's resolution is ill-timed."
"I think we must postpone it, and following the visit by a European Parliament delegation scheduled for next week, following the coming council elections and the EU-Ukraine High-Level Meeting, we would be able to give a more balanced and objective parliamentary position."
"After all, Ukraine may provide a good example to other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States of how to go down the route of rapprochement with the EU while, at the same time, fostering good relations with Russia."
"in writing. - I appreciate the debate on Ukraine, where opinions are expressed clearly."
"My conclusion is that Ukrainian democracy needs assistance, but not in the form of this document."
"It would be more important to create conditions for development."
"One of those is easing tension in the region."
"And that is why, ceterum censeo, the French plan to sell Mistral warships to Russia must be stopped!"
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0552/2010)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities"
"The Belgian Presidency has highlighted its firm intention to make progress in the fight against discrimination and to promote equality."
"In this context, what concrete measures, if any, is the Presidency taking to move forward the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by all 27 EU Member States?"
"On 7 June 2010, the Council adopted the resolution of the Council of the European Union and the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on a new European Disability Framework."
"This resolution invites Member States and the Commission, in accordance with their respective competences, to promote the ratification and application of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities concluded by the European Union on 26 November 2009."
"To date, the convention has been ratified by 13 Member States of the European Union."
"Within the Council, we are therefore clearly expecting those Member States that have not yet done so to ratify this convention."
"In particular, Articles 3 and 4 of Council Decision 2010/48/EC stipulate that a code of conduct between Member States and the Commission must be adopted before the deposition of the instrument of formal confirmation on behalf of the European Union can take place, in order to lay down details of the point of contact function conferred upon the Commission."
"The work relating to the code of conduct is now in its final phase and should be finished by the end of the year."
"I would like to thank the Council for its response."
"I am particularly pleased to hear you say that it could be concluded before the end of this year."
"I think you said 13 - my figure is that 16 Member States have ratified."
"Can the Council tell me what will be the impact of the EU itself ratifying this convention?"
"You mentioned a number of articles, and there are obviously a number of articles within the convention referring to the issue of reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities and the right to live independently."
"What do you think the impact of that will be?"
"In particular, my question is what will be the impact of the EU itself ratifying the convention on those countries that have not already ratified it?"
"I would like to return to a point mentioned."
"Thirteen Member States have indeed ratified the convention."
"I will in fact list them so that you can castigate one or the other of them: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and France have ratified this convention."
"What is the current situation?"
"We are waiting for an agreement on the code of conduct between Member States and the Commission before laying down the instrument of formal confirmation."
"This will complete the ratification by the European Union of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
"What are the next steps likely to be?"
"Once the convention has been fully ratified, the Council may come back to the issue of a possible 'toolbox' for actively promoting the rights of disabled persons - an idea that was, incidentally, suggested by several Member States."
"Work on this project would go hand in hand with the preparation by the Commission of a 2010-2020 European strategy for disabled persons and, as its name suggests, this strategy will put forward an action plan for the next 10 years with the aim of ensuring that disabled persons can fully enjoy their rights and freedoms."
"(PL) I would like to ask the Minister a question which I consider rather important."
"The situation leaves a great deal to be desired."
"Thirteen out of the 27 Member States have ratified the convention, but 14 Member States, or, in other words, the majority, have not."
"Why have only half the Member States of the European Union ratified a convention that is so important to disabled people?"
"(LT) Thank you for your answer."
"Really, it would be very interesting to know why the Member States are taking so long to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?"
"Are they afraid of shouldering the responsibility for creating equal opportunities for people with disabilities?"
"Minister, once again, if it is not too difficult, I would like to ask whether the drafting of the anti-discrimination directive has moved forward at least a little and how negotiations, discussions and consultations with the Member States on speeding up the anti-discrimination directive are progressing because it is very important for people with disabilities."
"Concerted efforts are being made within the Member States, but even so, I must say that one can, in fact, be disappointed, sceptical even, about the pace at which a number of Member States are ratifying."
"Indeed, I repeat for the third time that it is true that only 13 Member States have ratified."
"I do not think there is any particular reason for this."
"It is just that the Member States ratify in accordance with a process that can sometimes differ from one Member State to the other."
"I am not hiding behind this argument, but I must also tell you that, in this matter as in others, national sovereignty is still a factor in terms of the way in which Member States progress through the ratification process."
"Indeed, one could argue that it could go faster, that all the Member States could cooperate much more from the outset."
"Nevertheless, the fact remains that national sovereignty comes into play on a number of issues."
"Subject: Epilepsy treatment"
"In August 2010, I attended the European Conference on Epilepsy and Society in Porto, where the Global Campaign Against Epilepsy launched its report entitled 'Epilepsy in the World Health Organisation European Region'."
"According to the report, epilepsy surgery programmes are non-existent in 58% of European countries, yet 6 million Europeans suffer from the illness, generating costs of €20 billion per year."
"Is it not time for the EU Member States to adopt a common and consistent approach to the treatment of this illness?"
"Honourable Members, I should like to begin by thanking, even if he is not present, the honourable Member who tabled this question for his interest in this matter."
"It is true that neurodegenerative diseases, neurological development disorders and non-psychiatric brain diseases, of which epilepsy is one, are a major concern for many of our fellow citizens."
"In accordance with Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union shall encourage cooperation between the Member States in the field of public health and disease prevention."
"A horizontal approach is therefore taken at EU level, with the focus being on combating stigmatisation of and discrimination against people affected by neurodegenerative diseases, neurological development disorders and non-psychiatric brain diseases."
"Hence, the Council invited the Member States, in its June 2003 conclusions on combating stigma and discrimination in relation to mental health, to give specific attention to the impact of stigma and discrimination related problems due to mental illness in all age groups, and to ensure that these problems are recognised, in this context, giving special attention to the reduction of risks of social exclusion."
"In its conclusions of 3 June 2005 on Community action in the field of mental health, the Council invited the Member States to implement the declaration and action plan adopted by the European Ministerial Conference of the World Health Organisation on mental health, held in Helsinki in January 2005."
"Finally, the Council is particularly committed to combating another illness that is part of the group of neurodegenerative diseases, neurological development disorders and non-psychiatric brain diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease."
"I should mention in this connection the conclusions of 16 December 2008 on public health strategies to combat neurodegenerative diseases associated with ageing and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease, and the conclusions of 3 December 2009 on joint programming of research in Europe, covering, in particular, the launch of the pilot joint programming initiative dedicated to the fight against neurodegenerative diseases and Alzheimer's disease in particular."
"author. - Thank you, Council, for your response."
"I will pass on your appreciation to my colleague, Gay Mitchell."
"Could you address the realities in the different Member States, which must be of concern to the Council?"
"It is a fact that the treatment you get for epilepsy depends on where you live, and there is a huge problem with the lack of neurologists in some Member States."
"Could you also address the implications of this for the cross-border healthcare package which is currently under discussion?"
"If epilepsy is not treated, people suffer more deeply than when there is adequate treatment."
"It is regrettable that in different Member States, there are different levels of care for people with epilepsy."
"I think that your observation concerning the quality of medical care in the various Member States is quite right."
"We are still a very long way away from harmonising the quality of healthcare management as a whole."
"This is also down to the fact - and it should be pointed out - that the Union's powers in healthcare matters are still fairly restricted compared to national powers."
"Moreover, you are right to mention the cross-border package, because it is something that can improve a number of quality aspects in terms of healthcare."
"Need I remind you that, under the Belgian Presidency, the Council is still negotiating, and will continue to do so until the end, with the aim of gaining as much support as possible for a second-reading agreement on this cross-border healthcare package?"
"This is a difficult task, and the timescale is tight, but we have the ambition to achieve it before the end of December."
"Subject: Coordination of the EU's position in Cancún"
"Ahead of the 2010 United Nations Climate Change conference in Cancún, what concrete measures is the Council taking to coordinate the EU's position at the negotiations, with the emphasis on the whole EU speaking with one voice?"
"Honourable Members, during its meeting of 14 October, the Council adopted conclusions on the European Union's position in view of the Climate Change conference in Cancún, during which the global framework for climate protection is to be examined."
"On the basis of this text, the October European Council, which will take place next week on 18 and 19 October, will establish the European Union's position in view of the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change."
"This EU position encompasses all the important aspects of this conference: the expected outcome, the conditions for the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012, the progress to be made in the various areas outlined in the Bali road map - mitigation, adaptation, forest technology aspects and financing."
"For all these aspects, the Council has strived to present a position which is clear and easy to communicate."
"It is now incumbent on all European Union players to use this position to send a clear and unequivocal message to our international partners."
"As the Council has just pointed out, the European Union hopes that the Cancún meeting will result in the adoption of a balanced series of decisions that will aid the introduction of an international policy to protect the climate after 2012."
"Moreover, there will be several bilateral meetings and contacts before Cancún, and they will provide an opportunity for us to explain our position to our partners."
"During the conference itself, this position will be clarified if necessary during the regular coordination meetings held by the European Union."
"Of course, we are counting on all the institutions to help make our position clear by conveying, if possible, the same message in all our external representations."
"President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate your response and I think it is very important that we do have a positive impact in Cancún, unlike what unfortunately happened in Copenhagen."
"I would just ask a supplementary question: from the contacts I presume you have with other countries around the world, arising out of Copenhagen, how confident would you be of getting agreement on binding targets?"
"At the end of the day, they have to be binding."
"Anything else will not deal with this unfortunate situation."
"I should say and make it clear that, yes, it will be difficult to make progress in Cancún."
"There are three reasons for this relative pessimism."
"Firstly, the economic crisis that is obviously affecting the European Union and many other countries outside the EU has led to goodwill and investment promises in this matter being levelled down; secondly, the refusal of emerging countries to accept binding commitments; and lastly, the United States' failure to enact clear legislation on the subject."
"The European Union has kept the same positions it had in Copenhagen, and I think we should exercise caution in the way in which we are currently committing ourselves, in order not to trivialise the positions and guidelines that we could adopt in Cancún in a month's time."
"(RO) Minister, I would like to ask you whether you are considering linking climate change and pollution reduction objectives with the millennium goals because there are, admittedly, developing countries which think that it is too costly for them to move to an emission-reducing process, even though this can entail job creation and, by extension, a sustainable economy."
"I am therefore asking you whether you intend to establish a link between the Millennium Development Goals and climate change."
"(DE) Madam President, in Copenhagen, even cooperative countries like Indonesia and Brazil ultimately fought on the side of the G77 states, thus joining forces to form a bloc against the so-called rich states of the North."
"The climate debate became a debate about fairness and, even in the preparatory conference, the emerging economies made it clear that they had no intention of making concessions in Cancún."
"My question to you, then, is as follows. How can the formation of blocs like this be avoided and how can this kind of changing of the subject be prevented?"
"Should the EU not take on an important role as a mediator here?"
"To answer these two questions, I cannot agree with you more."
"The Union should change strategy in relation to Copenhagen."
"The Union should explain its position much more, the Union should talk much more with groups of countries that have significantly different opinions to ours and, yes, you are right, the link between climate change and the Millennium Development Goals is plain to see."
"Clearly, we cannot expect, and especially not in the coming years, in the next few years, the same effort from those who have to reduce a heavy industrial base, such as we have within the Union and developing countries have."
"This is seemingly not enough, but this is also why the Union contributes so much to the 'fast start' principle, which is financing aimed at helping developing countries."
"This scheme is very clearly aimed at countries that cannot afford this reduction."
"I think that this forms a whole."
"Dialogue and appropriate resources should enable developing countries to think more deeply about their own objectives in terms of reduction, in particular, of greenhouse gas emissions."
"Subject: Programme of the Presidency - early school leaving"
"The chapter of the Belgian Presidency's programme entitled 'Education, Training, Youth, Sport, Culture and Audiovisual Policy' states that the Presidency will pay particular attention to the problems associated with the failure to complete schooling, as well as to the role of education and training in social inclusion."
"What initiatives exactly has the Presidency taken so far to achieve the above commitments and what timetable does it intend to follow through to the end of the year?"
"Does the Council have any data providing evidence that the current economic situation is exacerbating the problem of early school leaving in the Member States which are affected by it?"
"Madam President, honourable Members, the Presidency, in continuing the work begun by previous presidencies on greater European cooperation in the area of school education, is paying special attention to the issue of key skills and of early school leaving."
"In so doing, it is following up on the conclusions of the March 2010 European Council, which highlighted the need to reduce the early school-leaving rate in Europe and which also set a collective target for bringing it under 10% by 2020."
"The Presidency has launched several initiatives to this end, starting with the ministerial-level seminar that it organised at the very start of its term, in July."
"This seminar, together with the meeting of Directors-General of compulsory education, which incidentally took place the day before, focused on the difficulties pupils experience in acquiring basic skills, that is to say, their mother tongue, sciences and mathematics, as well as on the experience of Member States and the policy guidelines to be developed as regards the prevention of early school leaving."
"Following on from these meetings, the Presidency has drawn up conclusions on the importance of raising the level of key skills in the context of European cooperation in the area of school education."
"Since the Council is currently discussing these conclusions, the Presidency is planning to put them on the November Council agenda."
"More generally, the Council is waiting for a proposal for a recommendation that the Commission is due to submit shortly on the issue of early school leaving at European level."
"At the same time, efforts will continue or will be stepped up at national level in order to gradually reduce the early school-leaving rate by 2020, in accordance with the target set by the European Council."
"In closing, I would add that in the context of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, the Belgian Presidency also organised, on 28 September, the conference entitled 'Breaking the cycle of disadvantage - Social inclusion in and through education'."
"The outcome of this conference will serve as material for a debate that will take place during the Education Council on 19 November."
"(EL) Thank you, Minister, for your reply."
"Following on from what you said, I should like to add the following questions: where do all these children who leave school go?"
"Do they end up on the margins, in social exclusion or do they enter a technical profession which represents a good move that will afford them a decent standard of living?"
"Does the Council have any data or has it at least asked or is it planning to ask the Commission to map the social corridors, so that we can see what happens next in these children's lives and how we can ensure that our policies have better results?"
"Honourable Members, the initiative is excellent and, moreover, contacts between ministers and those working in education show us how much the situations vary from one EU country to another, because some countries have programmes that can be very specific and very selective, to ensure that those who leave school early are not marginalised."
"This map-making process is therefore particularly important."
"It will take time, because assessing the situation in 27 Member States is not easy to do."
"I think that the work in relation to early school leaving has got off to a good start under the Belgian Presidency and that subsequent presidencies, the Hungarian Presidency in particular, will certainly be able to initiate a draft recommendation, not only to reduce the early school-leaving rate, but also to draw conclusions from this mapping of the 27 Member States about what becomes of those pupils who leave school early, in particular, when they are marginalised and when they are not picked up by a more vocational education system, as you point out."
"(LT) Thank you, Minister, for the efforts you have made, as the country holding the Presidency, to combat poverty."
"Do you not agree that poverty is also one of the reasons why not all young people finish secondary school and are forced to leave school?"
"Today, our European Parliament is approving a very important decision on strengthening minimum income throughout the European Union."
"In your opinion, as the country holding the Presidency, could this also be one of the measures to encourage young people to acquire a secondary education and not leave school?"
"(RO) Unfortunately, the school dropout rate in Europe is 19%, while it is 40% in countries like Portugal."
"The economic crisis and the decrease in budget and population resources have resulted in some countries in the closure of many schools, especially in rural areas."
"When we talk about education, we are talking about the future of Europe."
"I would therefore like to ask you, Minister, in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, to set compulsory targets, at Council, and perhaps even at European Council level, for reducing the school dropout rate."
"I would like to say that I agree with the two honourable Members in that, yes, early school leaving is linked to poverty and social exclusion."
"It is clear to me that a number of our children, depending on their family status, their parents' financial status, are disadvantaged in their schooling and that the economic crisis has obviously made this phenomenon much worse."
"Having said that, both the Council and the Commission have taken this on board since, together, we have adopted, as you know, this 2020 strategy, which combines at the same time economic development, research for development, the quality of our teaching and also the fight against poverty."
"All these elements form a whole that enables us, in my view at least, to come up with a coherent response."
"I wish to return briefly to key skills, because this is an important issue."
"The conclusions that the Belgian Presidency will submit for adoption at the November Council will target a number of objectives."
"I will mention them quickly: the implementation of national strategies for improving pupils' performance in reading, mathematics and science."
"Another objective is to analyse the effectiveness of current national strategies in order to have a source of information that can be used, as we were saying previously, in the decision-making process."
"However, the aim is also to launch pilot projects carried out between Member States on a voluntary basis and with the aim of improving young Europeans' basic skills, and - why not? - to ensure the more effective use of the instruments that we have available to us and which are relevant, such as those that are part of the open method of coordination, the programme for education and lifelong learning and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development."
"Those are a number of objectives that we will pursue under the Belgian Presidency and that will most certainly be taken up by subsequent presidencies, in particular, by the Hungarian Presidency."
"Subject: EU goal of total elimination of landmines"
"What steps does the Council intend to take to counter the devastating consequences of landmines?"
"A number of countries continue to use APLs and some are also believed to continue to produce landmines - approximately 65 countries remain affected to some degree by mines and UXO."
"Global estimates of new landmine casualties each year vary between 15 000 and 20 000 people, many of whom are civilians, including children."
"The EU has been very vocal about its wish to eliminate landmines and their use and stockpiling, but as yet, an ambitious plan of action with deadlines has not been forthcoming, yet alone been implemented."
"The European Union has been working for years towards the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines, thus helping to solve the enormous humanitarian and development problems they cause."
"Back in May 1995, the European Union adopted, by means of Council Decision 95/170/CFSP, its very first joint action to help combat the use and proliferation of anti-personnel landmines throughout the world."
"The European Union was therefore the first to act within the international community, in November 1997, following the adoption of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction."
"On 18 September, the Council adopted a new joint action designed to continue the Union's political efforts with regard to the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines and, more specifically, to establish a joint moratorium on the export and production of anti-personnel mines and to facilitate a multi-dimensional contribution, within the Union, to mine clearance efforts and other related activities."
"Since then, the European Union has continually promoted these commitments, which have been based, since 2003, on the European security strategy."
"In June 2008, a new joint action was adopted to support the universal adoption of the Ottawa Convention."
"This joint action is also aimed at specifically helping the States Parties to the Convention to implement the convention's provisions, particularly those concerning mine clearance, victim assistance and the destruction of stockpiles."
"Furthermore, although the number of States Parties to the Convention has considerably increased, and the number of victims of anti-personnel landmines is going down, there is still a need to assist victims and to improve their lives in practice."
"The European Union was involved in drawing up the 2010-2014 action plan - which it fully supports - adopted in Cartagena, Colombia, during the convention's second review conference from 29 November to 4 December 2009."
"A new Council decision is currently being drafted in order to specifically support the action plan and its victim assistance component."
"In addition to the Council's more political action, the assistance programmes managed by the Commission in the context of development aid and of the Neighbourhood Policy - together with the Member States' national programmes - have increased the European Union's contribution to mine clearance and victim assistance to EUR 1.8 billion, which is half of the total global contribution."
"I would like to thank the President for his very comprehensive reply."
"He mentioned the Ottawa Convention or Mine Ban Treaty, we have had the international Convention on Cluster Munitions signed in Dublin in 2008, and now we have an action plan, but the reality is that the European Union committed EUR 1.8 billion to landmine awareness projects for the period up to 2007, but only 1.5 billion of this has actually been spent."
"The reality is that landmines are still being used."
"It is a barbaric practice; 2 000 people die or are maimed every single month and we really need to get to grips with this issue comprehensively and on an international basis."
"You are right, we have spent 1.5 billion, and there are still 2 000 victims every month."
"The European Union cannot single-handedly do everything that needs to be done in this matter - it is already doing half the work."
"I think I have clearly explained how sensitive we are to the human aspect of this problem."
"Unfortunately, we cannot go much further in terms of decision making."
"Only substantial and concrete progress with respect to disarmament is probably still possible, and we are particularly involved in the aspect concerning the prohibition of anti-personnel mines."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Chastel, landmines will probably continue to be a major problem even far into the future."
"Do you believe that it is possible to initiate dedicated research programmes into the detection of landmines?"
"Of course, this is not a European problem, it is a global problem."
"Can you envisage also finding suitable institutions that grapple with research programmes in this field?"
"Firstly, thanks to my colleague, Mr Higgins, for raising this very important question and thanks also to the Council for their comprehensive response."
"I think, in fairness, the European Union has been pro-active in dealing with this unfortunate situation."
"I would like to ask the Council: is it happy with the way the United Nations is dealing with this issue and can it make a better contribution, similar to what we are doing?"
"The two questions are very much linked, and I was going to answer the first one by referring to the second one."
"It is true that any search programme to find anti-personnel mines around the world would be welcome."
"The introduction of such a programme requires close cooperation with the United Nations and, crucially, it must be possible to reach agreement, within the UN institutions, with all those who make up these institutions."
"This work is long and exacting, because there is a need to convince others who do not necessarily agree on the resources that will have to be invested in this kind of search programme."
"Subject: Creation of an Observatory on Violence Against Women"
"The Council conclusions on the eradication of violence against women, adopted on 8 March 2010, call for the establishment of a European observatory on violence against women, building on existing institutional structures, in order to collect high quality statistical data for use as a basis for the policies to be introduced."
"There is no place in a civilised society for violence against women, and it must be eradicated."
"There is a need to collect better quality statistics, improve the coordination of measures, exchange best practices and organise effective information campaigns on violence against women."
"When does the Council intend to reach a decision on the establishment of this future observatory?"
"What will be its objectives and missions and when will it become operational?"
"Honourable Members, combating violence against women is a goal shared by both the European Parliament and the Council."
"As you know, our two institutions have been working on this topic for several years and in many different contexts."
"Let me remind you of the resolution that you adopted last year, when we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the United Nations resolution establishing 25 November as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women."
"In that resolution, you invited the Commission to submit a targeted and more coherent EU policy plan, and urged Member States to introduce a coherent system for collecting statistics."
"As the honourable Member has reminded us, in March, the Council asked the Commission to draw up a European strategy for preventing and combating violence against women."
"One of the priorities identified by the Council in this matter is to prepare the creation of a European observatory on violence against women, based on existing structures."
"The Commission is currently drafting a new strategy on violence against women, which will also touch on the creation of this observatory."
"However, as you can imagine, for the time being, we still do not know what will be in the strategy."
"We expect to receive it some time next year."
"It is therefore highly likely that a separate proposal will be required thereafter in order to create this observatory."
"Obviously, as you know, the Council can only intervene as legislator on the basis of a Commission proposal."
"Such a proposal will be duly examined by the Council, acting as colegislator with the European Parliament."
"Evidently, it is a little premature at this stage to make assumptions about what the objectives of a future observatory on violence against women will be, and especially about the date when it will come into force."
"(LT) Minister, thank you for your answer."
"There is still hope then, that at some point, there will be a centre which will collect reliable data about the violence against women that continues to exist."
"However, I would like to know whether, in your opinion, the Member States hold sufficient data for the fight against violence towards women to really become a priority."
"To my understanding, we do not yet have reliable data and this is one of the reasons why rather a lot of different types of violence still exist in the European Union."
"What you are saying is not wrong."
"It is difficult today to accept that, in order to create this observatory and identify the issues involved, we need only rely on what the various Member States have already individually come up with in terms of census, type of violence and prevalence of the various types of violence."
"This is a start."
"What we are expecting from the Commission is a plan, a direction, a methodology so that we can harmonise throughout the EU, in the 27 Member States, a reliable way of listing all the types of violence and their prevalence and so that we can draw up, together if possible, a strategy that will bear fruit."
"(DE) Mr Chastel, we do have agencies that already deal with these issues."
"I would remind you of the Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna."
"Would it not be possible to ask that agency to focus on this issue and to concentrate its work on it so that we do not have to create a new body but could instead pass this activity on to the existing agency in Vienna?"
"We have very qualified staff there."
"It would be good if that could be arranged."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) (off-microphone) easily answer that question."
"I am very much in favour of using an existing agency rather than creating a new one."
"I think there are too many agencies, and so there is no need to create new ones."
"In any case, I hope that existing structures, such as the Vienna agency, will be involved in the drafting of the tactical plan that the Commission is due to present to us."
"Subject: Bio-waste"
"On 6 July 2010, Parliament adopted, by a large majority, resolution P7_TA(2010)0264, on the Commission's Green Paper on the management of bio-waste in the European Union, urging the Commission to draw up a proposal for a specific directive on bio-waste by the end of 2010."
"During the subsequent exchange of views between the Committee on the Environment and the Belgian minister, Joke Schauvliege, held on 14 July 2010, the latter, speaking on behalf of the Belgian Presidency, welcomed the resolution adopted by Parliament and promised further action on the matter."
"Now that we are halfway through the Belgian Presidency, can the Council state what action it intends to take before the end of the Presidency with a view to implementing the measure called for by Parliament?"
"Madam President, honourable Members, like the European Parliament, on 25 June 2009 the Council adopted conclusions on the Green Paper on the management of bio-waste in the European Union."
"In its conclusions, the Council encourages the Commission to continue its impact assessment with a view to preparing, if appropriate, an EU legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010."
"You will tell me that we are in 2010 now."
"In particular, the Council invited the Commission to consider preventive measures, measures for introducing separate collection of biodegradable waste, a quality assurance system based on the principle of integrated chain management and traceability throughout the process, and the establishment of requirements on labelling and on quality criteria for compost and digestate."
"Furthermore, the Council of 11 June 2010 took note of the Commission communication on future steps in bio-waste management in the European Union."
"In that communication, the Commission indicated its intention to continue working towards the introduction of technical rules to assist bio-waste management and, accordingly, to amend Directive 86/278/EEC on sewage sludge."
"The Council is obviously going to examine a new proposal along these lines, and the Belgian Presidency organised a conference on bio-waste on 21 September to discuss, among other things, the substance of the Commission communication."
"The outcome of this conference was communicated to the Council on 14 October, so it is very recent."
"(PT) Madam President, Mr Chastel, on 6 July this year, the European Parliament adopted, by a large majority, a specific directive on bio-waste."
"For the sake of clarity, for the sake of simplicity and for the sake of legal certainty, we believe that instead of this legislation, which is spread across several legal texts, instead of this situation, a specific directive would be better."
"In this way, we will also be able to be in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, with intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"In this way, we will also achieve more green jobs."
"In this way, we will also successfully combat climate change."
"Using high quality compost will enable us to better help our soils and will also aid biodiversity."
"I question, therefore, whether the Council agrees: whether the Council, too, is advocating a specific directive, and what it will do to achieve this end."
"I have been relatively gentle with you all tonight because we have had a reasonable amount of time, but it is meant to be 30 seconds."
"I will try to be as brief as possible, Madam President, so as not to be called to order at the end of my speech."
"However, this is an interesting question."
"As you know, it is up to the Commission to propose or not such a specific directive."
"The Council is aware that in its communication on future steps in bio-waste management in the European Union, the Commission did not note any shortcomings in the current legislation which would require specific legislation, but it did announce a proposed amendment to the Sewage Sludge Directive."
"This is not going to satisfy you, but please also be aware that, when the Council conclusions were being drafted in 2009, the Member States appeared to be divided on whether or not there was a need for a specific directive on bio-waste."
"Therefore, I will not answer with a 'yes' or a 'no', since the Member States are divided."
"The Council will obviously examine with interest the Commission's proposals concerning this Sewage Sludge Directive and particularly its provisions on bio-waste, which will, of course, be covered by this proposal."
"Thank you, Minister."
"My comments were not directed at you."
"Subject: The possibility of a double-dip recession: sustainability of the 3% target"
"Can the Council respond to comments by the respected Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz that the European economy risks sliding back into recession due to spending cuts imposed by EU governments in an attempt to reach the 3% deficit limit laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact?"
"Is this 3% target a realistic one, considering that some Member State finances are under severe strain at present?"
"Madam President, honourable Members, the main objective of the Stability and Growth Pact is to maintain price stability within the European Union."
"Under the terms of the treaty, Member States should conduct a national policy that is consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines."
"The Council of 7 September agreed on the introduction of the European Semester from 2011."
"The main objective of this exercise is to align the timetable for presenting the stability and growth programmes and the national reform programmes, with a view to ensuring consistent structural surveillance at every level of budgetary discipline, macro-economic stability and growth, whilst preserving formally separated individual procedures."
"This process will allow for better coordination of economic policies within the European Union and will help to strengthen budgetary discipline, macro-economic stability and growth."
"This same concern has led the European Union, in accordance with the powers laid down in the treaty, to envisage measures aimed at promoting the recovery while also ensuring this budgetary discipline."
"Europe 2020, the new EU strategy for employment and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, adopted by the European Council on 17 June, meets this challenge."
"Its aim is to change the focus of policies from crisis management to the introduction of medium- and long-term reforms, which specifically promote growth and employment, and which also guarantee the viability of public finances."
"As you know, the major objectives identified in the Europe 2020 strategy include an increase in the number of jobs, better conditions for research and development, an improvement in education levels - we touched on this in a previous question - and the promotion of social inclusion, including poverty reduction."
"To my mind, therefore, there is no mismatch between a stability pact and measures to restore growth and employment."
"Thank you for your response."
"I had expected more detail but I thank you for it."
"The party of which I am a member, Fine Gael, supports the 3% target, as do all the major parties in Ireland."
"I believe having the target and a date to achieve it is vital, not just for our own self-interest, but also for the sake of the European Union."
"I would draw Members' attention to an excellent speech delivered this morning by a former Taoiseach of Ireland, John Bruton, a friend of this House, who speaks in very straight terms about the challenges, but also the fact that we are able to do what is set out for us in these tough targets and that Ireland as a country has many qualities which will allow us to achieve the targets without suffering."
"There will be pain, but we will be able to manage that pain."
"I would like your comments on that please and also to draw your attention to that speech."
"You mention the Irish problem."
"I understand, and we are obviously all sensitive to the Irish problem."
"My answer to your first question is obviously a very broad one covering 27 Member States, because we must have consistent policies, we must have monetary and budgetary stability policies, and recovery policies."
"Furthermore, it is fair to say that some will, of course, have more difficulties than others, depending on their level of debt, depending on their annual debt in the last two or three years and since the beginning of the recession."
"So, yes, it is true that Ireland is going through a difficult time."
"You can rest assured that Europe understands that it is going through this difficult time, but I think that several countries are in this situation, several countries will experience the same thing in the future, and austerity and solidarity are not mutually exclusive."
"I therefore think that the economic governance measures that the Commission has put on the table this week will invariably include a concern not to leave any country by the wayside - you know what Europe was capable of in terms of solidarity in the case of Greece."
"Let us not compare the situation of two countries, but rest assured that under no circumstances will Europe leave any of the 27 Member States by the wayside."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer."
"Just two points very briefly."
"First of all, when discussions are held with regard to the 3% deficit issue, there appears to be different accounting standards used in different Member States according to certain criteria."
"Secondly, on the enforcement, what level of flexibility is there because of the current crisis afflicting all Member States to allow for leverage or margins for error within that 3% figure?"
"(EL) Minister, of course, the Council conclusions and the 2020 strategy contain what endeavour to be optimistic messages."
"However, even in the budget which we passed today, when it comes to achieving the 2020 targets, I believe that - for example, in research and innovation - we have failed to respond and we will not be able to attain the targets we want with these figures."
"We also see, however, that the Council is silent on the question of the massive north/south divide in the European Union."
"I am reminded of a recent statement by a senior officer of the European Union, the Eurogroup Chair, to the effect that large countries in the Union, such as France and Germany, knew about Greece's problem - I mention this because you referred to Greece - and yet did nothing before now, because they gained massively from this situation."
"Can we expect an initiative to address the north/south divide in the Union?"
"Two questions, two answers."
"Regarding the first question: of course, there have been, and still are, a number of disparities in the accounting standards."
"These standards are, of course, being harmonised, because if, in the future, we want to be fair to all 27 Member States' economies, we need to have the same calculation methods."
"Therefore, this harmonisation is ongoing and under way."
"As for flexibility regarding the 3% limit, as you know, we really are being flexible; we have been flexible since 2009, we have been flexible in 2010, and we will continue to be flexible in 2011 and 2012 so that our various Member States can return to healthy budgets, because if we wanted to apply this 3% limit rigidly, with absolutely no margin for error, then this year for instance, practically every one of us would have failed to comply with this budgetary restraint plan, and that is not the case."
"I think that the European institutions realised that returning to stable and balanced budgets by 2013 would take time, particularly in view of the recession and the Member States' situation."
"Now to the North-South imbalance."
"Whether the imbalance is between the North and the South or between Member States which have capitalised to some degree on aid provided by the European Union in order to boost their economy, productive fabric and labour market, and other Member States which have done so to a lesser extent, I think that the European Union is actually there to safeguard this coherence, this cohesion."
"In particular, the funds available in the European budget for cohesion - the first heading in the Union's budget - should indeed be used to reduce these imbalances."
"You mention the North-South imbalance, but I am not sure that that is the only imbalance that exists within the European Union."
"Subject: Council measures in favour of free movement of labour between Member States"
"The EU's new plan for the economy for the next ten years refers to workforce mobility as an essential condition for reducing unemployment."
"The unemployment rate has risen disturbingly with the crisis, from 6.8% in May 2008 to 10% in July 2010."
"Meanwhile, according to a Commission survey published on 13 July 2010, 48% of Europeans would be willing to seek employment outside their country or region, rather than remain jobless."
"In addition, 17% said they expected to work abroad at some time in the future."
"It should also be remembered that Member States are obliged to give preference to nationals of other Member States over third-country workers."
"In the light of the above, can the Council state what concrete measures it proposes with a view to the rapid elimination of the barriers now existing to the free movement of workers from those Member States which joined the Union after 1 May 2004?"
"Madam President, honourable Members, the Council would obviously like to reiterate that the free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the treaty and secondary legislation deriving from it, and that this includes the right for citizens of the European Union to live and work in another Member State."
"With regard to the temporary restrictions set out in the accession treaties, it is up to each Member State still applying restrictions to assess the repercussions for its labour market and to decide whether to maintain the remaining restrictions or to relax them before the end of the transition period: April 2011 for the countries that joined in 2004 and December 2013 for the countries that joined in 2007."
"Moreover, the Council has invited those Member States that are still applying restrictions in accordance with the transitional provisions laid down in the accession treaties to lift them during the third phase of the transition period if it cannot be established that their labour market would suffer or is liable to suffer serious disruption."
"Since May 2009, when Denmark granted free access to its labour market, the transitional provisions applied by Member States have stayed the same, and whereas a majority of Member States do grant free access to workers from those Member States that joined after 1 May 2004, 10 Member States are still applying restrictions."
"The Council has stressed that the economic and financial crisis should not be used as a reason to justify, on its own or more generally, the continued use of the provisions in question, and has called on Member States to further develop suitable strategies and tools which would enable them to identify and analyse the barriers to the geographical and professional mobility of workers, and to help eliminate existing barriers, in accordance with the treaty."
"(RO) Minister, thank you for your reply."
"I would even request that the European Council continues to ask Member States to lift barriers and temporary provisions restricting the free movement of workers from new Member States, especially Romania and Bulgaria."
"I also wish to stress that offering equal opportunities on the European labour market to all workers from all Member States means protecting workers in the destination countries as well."
"This is why, Minister, I call on you to ask Member States to lift existing barriers."
"(EL) Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor again."
"Minister, on the one hand, we have mobility problems and, on the other, we have Europe's initiatives to boost job mobility which, in these very difficult times, will certainly be an option for many European citizens, especially young people."
"We adopted the European Job Mobility Action Plan in 2007 and it is due to expire in 2010."
"Can we expect an evaluation of this plan and a new Council proposal?"
"We also have the Leonardo da Vinci programme on job mobility."
"Can we expect further support for this programme or similar new initiatives?"
"Just briefly, what steps is the Council taking with respect to the movement of workers, or actually refugees, coming into the European Union, getting papers and then moving to other countries within the European Union, and also with respect to the safeguards under the 1951 Convention which mean that they have to claim asylum in their first safe country?"
"I am just wondering what steps the Council has taken with respect to that."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Firstly, I should like to point out that the free movement of labour is a genuine priority for the Council."
"I think that everything is being done to inform Member States that retain a number of restrictions to thoroughly analyse this transitional phase, during which they retain a number of restrictions, and to see how they can lift those restrictions."
"Moreover, to answer one of the questions, I should add that, while it is true that the free movement of workers is a priority for the Council, it is a priority in particular for the Presidency."
"You will find in the 18-month programme of work of the trio of Presidencies of the Council - Spain, Belgium and Hungary - that these three countries will work, and are currently working, on the review of the single market that is under way, by encouraging the implementation of the four freedoms, given that exploiting the full potential of the single market is essential for a return to growth."
"Our programme specifically mentions the possibility of reviewing the transition periods, which limit the free movement of workers from the new Member States."
"Should we consider that these transitional restrictions are incompatible with the free movement of workers?"
"It is not for me to judge, as the transitional restrictions are defined in the accession treaties and such restrictions have been used for all the accessions."
"It is true that, beyond the incentives we can offer them, it is the responsibility of each Member State applying these restrictions to analyse the impact on its own labour market and to decide whether to retain or lift these restrictions before the end of these transitional periods, which, as you will recall, are April 2011 for the 2004 accessions, and December 2013 for the 2007 accessions."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Composition of committees: see Minutes"
"Aid for Pakistan and possible implication for the European industrial sector (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on aid for Pakistan and possible implication for the European industrial sector."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members of Parliament, Europe is very concerned at the devastating impact of the floods in Pakistan, which destroyed livelihoods and communities throughout the country."
"The scale of the disaster is unprecedented in Pakistan's history."
"The cost in humanitarian needs, and to its already fragile economy, is immense."
"The severity of this crisis demands an immediate and substantial response, also taking into account the strategic importance of Pakistan's development, security and stability in the region."
"The European Council on 16 September called for a comprehensive package of short-, medium- and longer-term measures that will help underpin Pakistan's recovery and future development."
"The initial EU response to the floods was swift and generous."
"Our common contribution to the humanitarian aid efforts presently stands at more than EUR 320 million from Member States and the European Commission in cash and in kind."
"This alone represents more than 60% of the global initial UN appeal."
"The European Council recognised that, in addition to the immediate and significant humanitarian aid and development assistance, ambitious trade measures are essential for economic recovery and growth."
"Trade is therefore part of the long-term response to the ongoing crisis."
"To this end, the Commission adopted on 7 October a proposal for unilateral suspension of import duties on a number of important export items from Pakistan."
"This proposal is now submitted to Member States and the European Parliament."
"The Commission is proposing to liberalise 75 tariff lines on imports from Pakistan, accounting for 27% of Pakistan's current imports to the EU and almost EUR 900 million."
"This would yield an increase in EU imports from Pakistan of about EUR 100 million."
"The objective of this measure is to support Pakistan's reconstruction efforts in the medium term."
"Consequently, the special concessions will be limited in time - the Commission is proposing three years."
"Given the nature of Pakistan's industrial base and export basket, where textiles account for more than 60%, a large number of products for which we propose liberalisation are textile products."
"Other industrial products such as ethanol are also included."
"If Parliament and the Council can act quickly on this, we hope to have the measure in place on 1 January 2011."
"In parallel, we are working with other members of the World Trade Organisation to obtain the necessary permission - a WTO waiver - which has to be granted before the measure takes effect."
"The trade concessions should be economically meaningful for Pakistan but, at the same time, take account of industrial sensitivities in the European Union."
"Therefore, in drawing up this proposal, we have tried to take into account industrial sensitivities in the EU, especially as regards textiles."
"Our analysis has shown that the impact on EU production is likely to be modest."
"The potential increase in EU imports from Pakistan (EUR 100 million) corresponds to less than 0.5% of EU production value of the liberalised items, which, in fact, account for EUR 24 billion."
"The European Parliament's support in helping this proposal come to fruition is essential to the presentation of a complete picture of EU solidarity in times of unprecedented needs."
"Trade can be an important part of a long-term economic solution for Pakistan."
"We have a tight calendar to work to."
"You can count on me and my staff to explain our approach and reduce any lingering concerns you may have."
"Madam President, I must say that I fully understand what they are going through in Pakistan, but I would also say that this decision is tragic for Europe and, particularly, for some countries that are already experiencing serious difficulties, such as Portugal, Spain and Greece."
"For example, the textiles and clothing industry represents 11% of Portugal's total exports, 22% of the manufacturing industry; 80% of production for some products even takes place in Portugal."
"Perhaps, then, this 80% spread across the 27 Member States means little to the European Commission, but it means an enormous amount to Portugal."
"Europe cannot demand extremely damaging - but understandable - measures to control public audits and to fight the deficit, and, at the same time, take decisions that hurt the productive heartlands and capacities for wealth and job creation of those very same countries."
"I must say too that this decision is also an incomprehensible attack on the normal market rules."
"I do not advocate any form of market protectionism, but I demand the strict defence of its proper rules: the rules of a market that is healthy and fair."
"Please understand that this decision will make it possible for products manufactured in Pakistan to come on to the European market, and with production costs below those possible for our companies simply because the same conditions are not required of them during production; humble apologies, but I call that unfair competition."
"It is unfair competition because Pakistani companies do not have social costs relating to their workers, they do not have environmental costs, they are not particularly concerned with combating the child labour that goes on there, and they do not have equivalent restrictions on the use of primary materials for reasons of public health."
"I would even ask: how is such a radical decision possible without a report being tabled first that exactly details its negative impact on the various Member States?"
"Nevertheless, I could venture some consequences right now, and those consequences are the closure and collapse of companies in the European Union, particularly in Portugal, and increased numbers of unemployed."
"It is good for you to fully understand this, because there will come a time when someone has to be responsible for it."
"If, in the end, we can assume - as some surely will - that this proposal is inevitable, please at least give a bit of forethought to some things that are not yet under consideration."
"For example, the establishment of a tariff rate quota, which is provided for in the case of ethanol, but not in that of textiles."
"The waiver should be for a maximum of one year because aid is temporary."
"Believe me; no European company will survive three years in direct competition with Pakistani companies."
"Madam President, I am finishing now: lastly, a provision is needed on primary materials, so that Pakistan does not block European companies' access to such materials to benefit from this production itself."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, I understand what Mr Melo is saying but I cannot agree with it."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal to suspend import duties on key Pakistan imports into the European Union."
"Firstly, the common ground between us is that Pakistan, which has not had an easy history since its birth as a nation, is going through its worst possible period."
"It is in the frontline of the war against terrorism, costing it so far, it is reckoned, USD 40 billion."
"We are all very well aware of the floods, the combined impact of which is worse than the Asian tsunami of 2004 and the Haitian floods of earlier this year."
"That is a significant blow to any country."
"What I welcome about the Commission proposal is that we give Pakistan the opportunity to trade its way out of some of its difficulties."
"It is an intelligent proposal."
"Firstly, as the Commissioner has said, the 75 tariff lines that would help boost Pakistan's trade by an estimated EUR 100 million a year do little harm to EU investment."
"This will not significantly damage any European Union industry and, equally importantly - in fact, quite possibly even more importantly - it will not harm the developing countries which are on a par with Pakistan, because none of the tariff lines affect products on the DDA preference erosion list."
"That is very positive."
"The second thing that is sensible about the Commission proposal is that it is time-limited and does not unilaterally attempt to alter the GSP resolution."
"I welcome that because it still gives an incentive to Pakistan to come into line with social and human rights standards between now and 2014 in order to qualify for GSP+ in 2014."
"So it gives the emergency aid we need now but, at the same time, does not give carte blanche to the Pakistan Government."
"It says 'you have a duty yourself to put your country in order if you want to continue to qualify for these benefits'."
"This is a real test of Europe's generosity and I hope that we, in this Parliament, will be prepared to meet it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today marks a fork in the road between two crucial principles."
"On the one hand, there is the duty of solidarity towards a country that has been hit by natural disasters, bringing its society, which already has structural problems, to its knees."
"On the other hand, there is the necessity for a balanced trade policy."
"With the European Commission's proposal to suspend duties for Pakistan, the European Union is rightly avoiding a policy of mere humanitarian aid, allowing Pakistan to strengthen its economy and therefore its society."
"The fact that all 74 of the tariff lines involved relate to the textile and clothing sector is almost inevitable for a country that can export only products within this sector."
"We liberal democrats definitely prefer recourse to this kind of measure, rather than agreeing on humanitarian aid which is incapable of giving the country a genuine boost."
"However, as Mr Melo reiterated a short while ago, we must not be naive and we ask the Commission - above all - not to make the mistake of naivety."
"The Commissioner is well aware of the critical situation in which some textile districts, such as Prato, find themselves."
"Prato is a special case: The situation there has gone out of the control of the national authorities and there is widespread illegality, which is also exacerbated by the crisis in the European textiles sector."
"Since we believe that it cannot be just the European textiles sector that pays for our rightful humanitarian solidarity with Pakistan, we ask for three things to be done: 1) To set up regulatory instruments to avoid all possible triangulation with other countries that could profit from the duties from which Pakistan is benefiting; 2) Not to aggravate the crisis in the European textile sector, by implementing measures that could instead support it, such as a reduction in the cost of electricity; and 3) To avoid creating a precedent for other countries that suffer such natural disasters."
"By working in this way, I think the aid for Pakistan is shared and sustainable, including in the long term, and that is what that country needs."
"We have met this evening to discuss the Commission's proposal to help Pakistan in the aftermath of the flooding."
"We should bear in mind that almost 14 million people suffered from the flooding in Pakistan, which was of truly biblical dimensions."
"It caused unimaginable destruction in Pakistan itself, and the results will soon be felt all over the world."
"Why?"
"Cotton, which is also referred to as white gold, and of which Pakistan is one of the main producers, grew poorly this year, and on top of that, has been largely destroyed in the country."
"Clothes manufacturers and leading global brands are already forecasting an increase in the price of cotton products."
"Cotton is a raw material we come across all the time, and which is used to manufacture clothes, banknotes, coffee filters, tents and fishing nets, as well as even being found in book bindings and many other everyday products."
"It is used for a huge number of purposes."
"We are in a time of crisis, and increases in the price of daily necessities are forecast."
"This makes the scale of the problem huge."
"On the one hand, we have large-scale European importers, which will gain from Pakistani products coming into Europe."
"On the other hand, we have another small number of large Pakistani textile factories, which are actually outside the areas affected by the disaster, and which will also gain enormously from the Commission's proposal."
"That is the reality."
"The winners are not the ill, not the displaced, not the children, not the elderly whose homes were destroyed: the winners are wealthy businesspeople."
"What is happening here is that the disaster is being put to use: extreme climate phenomena are being made to serve the interests of big business."
"That is what is absolutely intolerable about the proposal that the Commission is making."
"They would do well to backtrack."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, in the past, I have often been sharply critical of British Prime Minister Cameron."
"However, Prime Minister Cameron was absolutely correct to ask for trade preferences to be granted to Pakistan."
"Now I use the word 'ask' with some care."
"Asking is exactly what the British Prime Minister has had to do."
"Since joining the EU, the United Kingdom, the world's fifth largest economy, does not have the autonomy to determine trade policy even with a Commonwealth country."
"Nevertheless, it is in the UK's national interest that Pakistan should now get trade preferences."
"I rarely agree with David Martin but I do on this."
"Pakistan is not only a developing country with 170 million inhabitants and strategic borders with Afghanistan; it is also a country which has some thirty nuclear warheads."
"The security implications of a collapse of the Pakistan State would be devastating to the security of the entire developed world."
"Trade preferences for Pakistan at this time may perhaps help stop that happening."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we should all recall, once again, how dramatic the situation was in Pakistan a couple of weeks ago and indeed still is in many places."
"Whole regions have been flooded, regions that are bigger than many of our Member States."
"Tens, in fact hundreds, of thousands of people are in major need."
"The infrastructure has been destroyed: roads, hospitals, universities, nurseries, schools, businesses."
"Many people's livelihoods have been destroyed."
"I do not think we can even imagine what that is like."
"We all agree that we have to help."
"The problem, though, as we would say in German, is 'wash me, but do not get me wet'."
"What do I mean by that?"
"Well, direct financial aid costs money, which, of course, has to be taken from elsewhere in our budget."
"Indirect aid - trade facilitation - is what the Commission is now proposing, and there, too, there are, of course, concerns from those who may be affected."
"That is why we are quite rightly having this debate on this topic today."
"The Commission has not proposed using the Generalised System of Preferences."
"That is a good thing, I feel."
"Fundamentally, I think the current solution of doing this via the WTO, taking this route and really trying to help people help themselves, is a prudent one."
"There are many unanswered questions, however, such as what will the impact on industries in the European Union really be?"
"When I look at the Commission's document, the proposal for a regulation, I see that it states in the explanatory memorandum right at the beginning that the working premise is that net imports into the EU would rise by EUR 100 million per year."
"Is that really major, durable aid to Pakistan?"
"Will it really help to move the major sums that we are actually talking about here?"
"On the other hand, the proposal will entail tariff revenue losses of EUR 80 million from our budget."
"Does this ratio add up, too?"
"Does it make sense to do without EUR 80 million in customs revenue in order to receive EUR 100 million in increased imports?"
"Are these figures correct?"
"I would like some really head-on information from the Commission on this whole issue."
"I am firmly convinced that we have to help Pakistan."
"I am also prepared to explain to the citizens of the European Union, and to those of my electoral district, that we have to do something and that aid for others always has to be paid for by someone."
"However, I am firmly convinced, Commissioner, that you should use the opportunity this evening and over the coming days and weeks to really convince the 736 Members of the European Parliament that your measures are the right ones to take, that they are sensible."
"You should also use the opportunity, above all, to highlight ways in which the workers of companies that may be affected in countries like Portugal, Italy and Spain, and in the European Union as a whole, can also find routes forward and prospects for themselves."
"I believe that these are truly the tasks to be performed in order to achieve a majority for your proposal in this House in a few weeks' or months' time."
"I believe there is a lot of work to be done by all those involved in connection with convincing people and providing information."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have to be mindful of the crisis that the European Union and its Member States are experiencing on a global level."
"With a crisis that is hitting work, employment and growth, I wonder about the logic inspiring some European countries but, above all, the European Commission, in terms of international relations."
"The Commission proposal under discussion today will heavily penalise some industrial sectors, particularly textiles and, in a situation like the present one, we must ask ourselves whether it is reasonable."
"Some people fear that these decisions are borne from the desire for Europe to take a leading role on the world stage."
"In reality, we know that this is not so and that the attempt to reduce the pressure, including terrorist pressure, within or related to some political and institutional systems, has even less to do with it."
"The truth is that not even the recent flood has anything to do with this proposal, since the main concentration of the Pakistani textiles industry is not based in the regions hit by the disaster."
"The actual reason is that once more, the aim is to penalise a sector in favour of financing the European economy and to favour large-scale retail, rather than the interests of the manufacturing industry located in some European countries."
"This is profoundly mistaken in terms of growth, work and employment in a time of serious economic crisis and the need for real EU growth on global markets, in terms of its exports and its capacity for innovation and quality."
"Madam President, may I firstly thank the Commissioner and colleagues Martin and Caspary for their very helpful comments."
"Following the floods which took place, I actually have travelled to Pakistan to see for myself the extent of the devastation. The devastation caused by the floods is the biggest natural disaster in Pakistan's history."
"It is certainly beyond anything that I could have imagined or expected to see."
"Certainly, when I met with the Prime Minister of Pakistan on 22 September, he was very appreciative of the EU's response to date and he believed it to be a very courageous response; courageous in the way that Commissioner De Gucht has described it."
"We have to be absolutely sure that we continue to react in an appropriate way."
"The Commission has now come forward with a legislative proposal to cut the tariff to zero on 75 tariff lines covering 27% of Pakistan's exports to the EU, which would boost Pakistan's exports by about EUR 100 million a year."
"This really is now a test of the EU's credibility."
"We must ensure that we translate the political agreement reached by EU leaders into action that will make a real difference and give the Pakistani economy a lifeline at this desperate time of need."
"We are, after all, their largest trading partner."
"I hear the concerns made by colleagues in this Chamber and it is only right that we are fair in our response; fair but ambitious."
"The trade concession to be offered to Pakistan needs to represent a credible effort by the EU and bring about meaningful economic benefits to Pakistan, whilst taking into account sensitivities of our own industries as well as other WTO members - in particular, those of least-developed countries."
"I believe through this proposal we are being ambitious, we are being courageous, but, above all, we are being fair to ourselves, as well as to the people of Pakistan."
"Madam President, clearly the 20 million people hit by the recent disastrous flooding in Pakistan need immediate and substantial assistance, especially the 100 000 children left homeless by the flood and in danger of dying simply because of a lack of food."
"Critical to food production at affordable prices are the millions of small farmers and landless farmers now at the mercy of the landlord class."
"The distribution of free seeds, fertilisers that are environmentally compatible and other utilities could lay the basis for a rapid recovery of food supplies, but the liquidation of landlordism in Pakistan and the distribution of land to the landless is a key to food sustainability."
"It was 140 years ago that the Irish peasantry conducted a major struggle for an end to landlordism, so it is long overdue here."
"Tariff reductions must go to the workers and the poor and not to the landlords, corrupt state officials or the profits of industrialists."
"Small farmers in Pakistan should benefit from just prices for their agricultural products on the world market, rather than callous speculators on the commodity markets."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all concerned about the floods that have devastated Pakistan and for the serious effects on the economy, but we are also concerned about the European Commission's proposal, even if it was brought up on the initiative of the Heads of State or Government."
"The regulation proposed by the Commission concentrates, above all, on the suspension of duties in the textile and leather goods sectors - which represent 60% of Pakistani exports with a turnover of almost EUR 200 million for textiles and EUR 510 million for the leather industry, both of which are characterised by production located in neighbouring areas that are not clearly affected by the floods."
"It seemed to us that the political indications were instead directed at choosing an aid policy that did not damage structural sectors for the European economy."
"The suspension of duties will have a serious effect on European textiles and leather industries, with a potential loss of thousands of jobs over the planned three years of the regulation."
"These measures will be integrated and aggravated by the Generalised System of Preferences which, in 2013, will be extended to Pakistan as well."
"Commissioner, we are all aware that exceptional and unilateral measures are being adopted because we want to help a large, poor country that is in trouble due to the disaster that has hit it and is further aggravated by the economic crisis and the failure to adjust the World Trade Organisation's rules."
"Indeed, the current rules favour countries that are already developed, such as China and India, rather than poorer countries."
"Exceptional measures in favour of one country should not, however, cause a crisis in other countries."
"The Commission proposal therefore requires significant corrections to diversify the sectors involved, including the production and exports of Pakistan, accepting a different vision and a serious reflection on the respect for human rights and the fight against terrorism."
"Pakistan must be helped, but through clear agreements, including those with regard to the political situation in the region."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, the floods in July and August of this year caused 1 800 deaths in Pakistan and affected 20 million people, 12.5 million of whom need humanitarian aid."
"The European Union has undertaken a humanitarian effort of EUR 320 million - as you said - and Spain has contributed EUR 11 million."
"What we are discussing here is not a trade agreement, but supporting the strategic development of Pakistan."
"The Commission, with a mandate from the Council, has liberalised 70 products over three years."
"There is no question that Pakistan's exports will have varying impacts on the different EU countries, taking into account the specific characteristics of each country."
"The products that Pakistan may export are ethanol, textiles and leather goods."
"The Commission maintains that it cannot amend the lists of products that will clash with textile production."
"Spain represents 16% of the volume of business from the textiles sector."
"The Community of Valencia represents 18% of Spanish textile production, and 17% of employment is in the Community of Valencia."
"The market for the Valencian textile sector is Europe and, within Europe, France, Italy and Germany."
"Therefore, textile products being imported from Pakistan reduces their market, both in Europe and within Spain."
"You said that there is a strategic study, but has Pakistan's industrial capacity been evaluated?"
"Has consideration been given to reducing the list of textile products?"
"Is there going to be an annual evaluation of the impact of this agreement?"
"(SV) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say that the abolition of duties and barriers to trade as a step in the provision of aid to Pakistan in connection with this major disaster is extremely welcome."
"I will say, probably for the first time in this Chamber, that I am impressed by both the Commission's and the Council's swift action and resolve on this issue."
"It is certainly the case that money is needed."
"However, what is the point of providing support and money - other than to assuage our own bad conscience - if, at the same time, we make it more difficult, by means of duties and barriers to trade, for people to recover by their own efforts."
"What we are doing right now, namely comprehensively and quickly abolishing duties and barriers to trade on all 75 different tariff lines, corresponding to 27% of Pakistan's exports, is an excellent response to the disaster that this country is facing."
"However, we in Parliament now have a responsibility."
"We have a responsibility to act swiftly."
"In other words, this must not turn into an example of how long the political process can take."
"Pakistan needs money and aid now - not in a year's time."
"We must demonstrate that we understand that."
"At the same time, I am disheartened to see how wide the opposition to this is."
"I received a petition from European textile producers expressing their opposition to this, as they were afraid that Pakistan would export more to Europe, which they did not want."
"However, is that not the whole point of it?"
"Is it not the intention that they should be able to trade with us in order to get themselves out of poverty?"
"If European consumers were to get slightly cheaper textiles, would that be a problem?"
"Free trade and solidarity are often embraced here right up until we are to make a decision on them."
"Let us here and now demonstrate that these values are most important to us when they are needed the most."
"There is probably no better opportunity to stand up for both free trade and solidarity than in connection with this proposal."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, by means of this short speech, I should like to show my disagreement with the possible suspension of duties in favour of Pakistan for some three years and across 74 tariff lines, almost all of them in the textile and clothing sector."
"My concerns regard the negative consequences on European industry and particularly Italian industry - and on the loss of jobs in Europe in a sector that has already been sorely tested by the economic crisis."
"I am referring in particular to the small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector that we are trying to help anyway, and which would suffer considerable damage."
"Also, the fact that Pakistan set a 15% duty on its cotton fibre exports at the start of this year in order to discourage the supply of raw materials is not insignificant."
"It is clear that the aim is to conserve raw materials by seeking to obtain more attractive exchange rates for their export."
"I fully understand the need to help a country with serious problems, particularly following the serious disasters it has suffered."
"However, the European aid that I would hope for would be contributions towards the construction of roads and infrastructure using local labour."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, it is not easy to hold an objective debate when you are talking about 100 000 children being made homeless, millions of farmers on the streets and people living in absolutely truly bitter poverty."
"I think it is right for the European Union to act quickly and provide help quickly here."
"The big question that arises for me, when it comes to the measures that you have proposed is, are we giving help in the right place or are we helping the wrong people?"
"That is something that I would like explained in more detail, as it is absolutely justified to say, in relation to the textiles industry, that the aid does help Pakistan overall, but whether it reaches the right people, I am not so sure."
"Secondly, I would also like to say that, if this aid helps people to help themselves, obviously you do have to take into account what effect all of this has back in Europe."
"I think, however, that there is already a drastic situation here, that we need to provide aid, and I hope that the aid does reach the people who really need to be helped."
"Madam President, I just want to respond to some of the comments which have been made."
"What Pakistan is trying to do at this point is actually to help itself out of the mess that it is in after the devastating floods."
"If the factories were in flood-hit areas, they would not be able to produce, so it is not surprising that the factories concerned are not in flood-hit areas."
"The direct aid that could be put in is miniscule compared to what the need actually is."
"Distribution of the income from the additional exports is important - we know that for infrastructure, for energy supplies, for schools, for roads, etc. - while there are indeed responsibilities that lie with the democratically elected government of Pakistan in terms of its effectiveness, of income, of tax revenue and so on."
"People have also talked about the need for greater diversity."
"If Pakistan had a greater diversity of industrial sectors, we would not be concentrating so much on textiles."
"I appeal to Members to offer that country this opportunity to help itself out of this disaster."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, the tragedy in Pakistan demands that Europe show solidarity, but it cannot be a pretext for putting at risk the textile industry in a number of Member States, such as Portugal."
"There are other ways of showing solidarity: more effective types of aid that are aimed at the recovery of the affected areas and the improvement of the living conditions of local people, but also fairer types of aid."
"Trade concessions are not long-term measures, as I have been saying."
"This benefits the large European importers above all, as it fulfils their long-held pretensions."
"However, it damages the textile industry, as well as the countries and regions that are most dependent on it; all this in a context of profound crisis and high unemployment."
"While it is true that the measures proposed by the Commission cannot, under any circumstances, be a pretext for more redundancies, we cannot ignore the objective difficulties that these measures are creating."
"Measures are needed to defend the European textiles sector and the jobs related to it."
"At the suggestion of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, the Union budget 2010 provides for a budget heading allocated to creating a Union programme for the textiles and footwear sector."
"Where is this programme, Commissioner?"
"What are its key elements?"
"I will leave you with these questions."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is paradoxical that instead of defending our jobs, the European Union puts them at risk by concealing the possible consequences of its actions behind well-meaning rhetoric of humanitarian aid."
"The possible reduction in duties for the next three years on clothing products from Pakistan risks plunging the manufacturing sector into an even greater crisis than the one we are currently experiencing, with the loss of 120 000 jobs across Europe, and 40 000 in Italy alone."
"Pakistan must be helped, but we cannot adopt soft trading measures when my country - Italy - and other Member States are already feeling the effects of counterfeiting of textile products, especially from Asian countries and from China in particular."
"The Commission cannot give to charity at the expense, above all, of Italy, which represents 30% of the entire European textile sector."
"I believe that along with Pakistan, our small and medium-sized enterprises must be helped to escape from the crisis by imposing duties and quotas on Asian products."
"I am from Prato and my fellow citizens and I have had quite enough of measures like these."
"(EL) Madam President, as far as manufacturing industry is concerned, I would remind the House that Pakistan is the fourth largest cotton producer in the world, accounting for 9% of global production, with the European Union following with just under 5.5%."
"Clearly, therefore, this is a very serious issue."
"Of course, we do not want protectionism, which damages healthy competition; on the contrary, we want free and open international trade."
"On the other hand, however, members have also raised this point."
"Mr Melo, who is from Portugal, a country with a fragile economy, was very graphic."
"Members referred to Italy."
"I would add Greece; you all know the problems it is facing."
"Of course, we should support Pakistan, but we should also monitor it and that is want I want to ask the Commission: do we have mechanisms to ensure that the aid we give Pakistan will be channelled in the right direction and not used for other purposes or for certain industries, to the detriment of European companies and European workers?"
"Madam President, I do not claim to be particularly au fait with the intricacies of this situation, but I do recognise the strategic importance of Pakistan."
"For that reason, I support the point made by Mr Karim, that it is in everybody's interest to have a stable regime there in a region of great volatility."
"I also have to say that a Union which was founded on the principles of peace and prosperity for our citizens should be in the vanguard of bringing peace and prosperity to other parts of the world, so I support the proposals here this evening, but I would like the Commission to answer very fully the points made by Mr Higgins and others on the Left."
"Can they guarantee that the aid we would be giving would be going to those who deserve it and not to big traders and landlords?"
"That is the key question this evening."
"(DE) Madam President, the flooding disaster in Pakistan has humanitarian consequences on an unimaginable scale."
"I consider it to be the European Union's duty to make sure that aid gets to the people of Pakistan quickly."
"Measures designed to invigorate the economy and employment over the long term are an important contribution for the EU to make in order to help this hard-hit country out of its crisis."
"However, I question whether a simple reduction in the customs tariff will have the desired effect."
"We need to clear up whether or not preferences for Pakistan flow into Third countries via indirect channels and thus, whether they have the desired effect."
"As well as the textiles industry, I am thinking here, above all, about the field of bio-ethanol."
"My specific question to the Commission is whether setting up a tariff quota for ethanol is regarded as a truly sustainable and efficient option that will help the people of Pakistan."
"Can it be assessed whether the necessary sustainability criteria for imports into the EU are also fulfilled in the production of bio-ethanol."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, I just wonder if the speaker appreciates that just this one time, we are actually not discussing aid but are actually simply discussing trade preferences."
"This would give the opportunity for Pakistan to earn its way out of its problems by its own efforts and volition."
"I wonder if the speaker appreciates that."
"(DE) Madam President, I do believe that that is the core element that we are discussing."
"The measures need to be clearly thought through in order to ensure sustainable assistance."
"Above all, there is always the question of the extent to which the cost/benefit calculation ultimately adds up for Europe."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Pakistan must undoubtedly be helped following the floods that have hit it."
"However, the question we must ask ourselves today is what kind of help this country needs most, and what kind is the European Union best capable of providing."
"We must act quickly, but also effectively."
"Indeed, it is the effectiveness of the European Commission's proposal which causes me great concern."
"I find it to be a patchy proposal which, by intervening primarily in the textile and leather sectors, would risk not being effective enough, since this aid could generate fresh tensions due to the new instances of poverty it would generate in Europe and would further hamstring the European textile sector, which is already in serious decline."
"Then we must consider the fact that by favouring exports from producer businesses, we are actually helping those areas of Pakistan which have not been flooded, whereas our aid should serve to build competitiveness and development, helping the recovery of production in the areas of the country that have been hit by the catastrophe."
"For all these reasons, I believe that the path of abolishing duties is absolutely unsuitable and we do not consent to it or support it."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all, I would like to present very clearly the figures we are speaking about."
"We are talking about a trade volume of EUR 900 million."
"The effect will be EUR 100 million of additional exports to the European market by Pakistan, but the overall balance for the European Union will only be EUR 50 million because, as a result of the more favourable position of Pakistan to export on the European market, there will also be a certain amount of trade diversion, which means that other importers will lose some opportunities on the European markets."
"So, the overall impact will be about EUR 50 million on a yearly basis."
"I am saying this because I heard again in this debate that 120 000 jobs would be lost."
"Now you all have a calculator tool on your mobile phone; if Europe is to lose 120 000 jobs because of an additional EUR 50 million of imports on the European market, then there is really a serious problem with the European textile industry, regardless of what happens with Pakistan."
"It is simply not serious to put that argument forward."
"That is my first remark."
"Secondly, we have duly taken into account the sensitivities of the European textile industry and the somewhat difficult position this industry might be in."
"Bed linen is not part of the tariff lines that we are proposing, and neither are apparel or household linen, which are three of the most sensitive product lines for Europe."
"On the contrary, a lot of semi-finished products are included."
"If they are semi-finished, it means that they will be finished in Europe, which should, in fact, generate cheaper imports for those companies which give the final treatment to such products."
"So this is not immediately harming us."
"I would even say the opposite."
"We have really been studying very carefully what would be a good proposal for Pakistan without harming European industry too much at a time when we are also coming out of an economic crisis that is certainly not easy to manage."
"A comment was also raised concerning cotton exports."
"There is a scarcity on the worldwide cotton market, and it is true that Pakistan is one of the main cotton producers."
"What I have in mind is that once we have this agreement, once we see that we are really getting somewhere, we should also ask Pakistan to make sure that our own textile industry gets enough cotton to be able to produce what the market is asking for."
"As there is such a worldwide scarcity of cotton, or at least certain varieties of cotton, you might ask why we do not import those cotton varieties from Africa."
"Well, because they do not produce the right varieties of cotton we need, and it is not easy to switch to a different kind of cotton production from one day to another, so we will have to pay special attention to that problem."
"Let me just conclude by saying that when you look at the situation with respect to Pakistan, what we need is more aid and more trade; we need both."
"The European Union has contributed EUR 320 million already, 60% of what the United Nations initially asked for."
"We will continue to do so; that is more aid."
"Trade is not aid, as has been said in this plenary."
"Trade is about giving opportunities to the Pakistani economy to produce and to export and to give jobs to the people that need those jobs."
"I think it is an essential tool in economic recovery that we should give additional trading opportunities to Pakistan."
"But it is not about aid, which means that you cannot direct those who will be, let us say, the beneficiaries."
"It is much easier to direct the process in the case of trade, but we also know that while trade has its frailties we are not going to recover an economy by aid."
"I think you need both elements, aid and trade, and that is why we are working on both possibilities."
"It is true that we should also bear in mind, as I have been saying in this plenary, that we are talking about a region that has been severely devastated."
"Many Members of Parliament from Italy have spoken, and I understand that the territory of Pakistan which is flooded is about the size of the territory of the whole of Italy."
"That is what we are talking about, so I think we should help them, but we should also bear in mind that this is a very sensitive region which is geo-strategically very important."
"It is also very important to us and to our security."
"It would be very dangerous for Europe if this region became unstable, so we should do everything we can to make sure that the stability of the region is not affected by what happens in Pakistan."
"So this is an overall array of measures which we are employing."
"We have political discussions with Pakistan; we had a summit with them recently, and we will continue to have such discussions."
"Several EU officials have been going there, as well as Commissioner Georgieva, for example, with respect to humanitarian aid."
"We have the aid package, which is considerable, and we also have an economic approach in terms of more trade."
"I think, and I hope, that this will really mean something considerable for Pakistan. I am also convinced that by helping Pakistan, we also, to a certain extent, help ourselves."
"The debate is closed."
"Indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries - C7-0048/2010 -."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many of the European Union's main economic and trading partners have, for some considerable time, been applying domestic rules requiring indication of origin for imported goods."
"In 2005, the European Commission proposed a regulation aimed at putting the European Union on an equal footing with these countries, requiring a certain number of manufactured goods imported into the European Union to include a denomination of origin."
"This regulation will help offset an imbalance suffered hitherto by European consumers who, compared to citizens of countries outside the EU, do not have the right to choose what they buy in the full knowledge of its provenance."
"A democratic right, which presupposes freedom of choice and, hence, the right of knowledge, is therefore compromised."
"The regulation makes up for a situation of inferiority for EU citizens and also proposes anew the legitimate right to reciprocity."
"It is a regulation requested by many consumers' associations and supported by many business associations."
"Production in Europe will never be able to recover if our producers are not given the same guarantees as other countries in which a regulation on origin marking for products is already in force."
"European producers - who rightly have to comply with many obligations imposed by the European Union in order to guarantee product quality and safeguard consumers and who, in order to export, are obliged to identify their products with a mark of origin - are suffering from unfair competition from producers in third countries who can export their goods to Europe, concealing the provenance."
"Today, European small and medium-sized enterprises, in whose favour a resolution was approved during the last legislature on 5 February 2009 addressing the problems encountered in enabling them to internationalise, continue to encounter difficulties because they suffer from unfair competition from those non-EU producers that can export to Europe without an origin mark and European consumers are denied their right to an informed choice."
"In order for the free market to be just that, it must be based on fair competition and be built on clear, shared and applied rules."
"This is why the approval of this regulation will finally remove this democratic deficit and unfair competition still present in Europe, which damages consumers first and foremost."
"The regulation has been approved by the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade with a large majority of 19 votes in favour and 3 votes against."
"The European Parliament has already expressed its support during the last legislature with a written declaration voted through with a full majority and, in the current legislature, with a vote on a resolution which obtained 529 votes in favour out of 593 votes cast."
"It is truly surprising that today, some fellow Members who signed the written declaration and voted in favour of the resolution in November 2009 have moved an amendment intended to reject the regulation."
"With great calmness, I feel I can say that those who are against the proposal do not wish to give European citizens the same rights as Chinese citizens."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, tonight we are discussing a legislative proposal which the Commission tabled in 2005 concerning the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries - the 'made in' regulation."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, for her dedication in support of our proposal and for her hard work."
"I wish her much success in carrying it further through the legislative process."
"2005 was long before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and, therefore, long before this House received equal legislative powers regarding trade policy, but the lack of legislative powers did not prevent the European Parliament from twice expressing its support for this proposal."
"Despite our consistent efforts, there has been no progress towards adoption in Council."
"Now that we are under the Lisbon Treaty, I am pleased the European Parliament can play its full role in relation to this proposal."
"I say this because the EU needs to adopt legislation on origin markings for certain goods from third countries."
"Today, the EU does not require origin marking: products can bear an origin mark provided that this does not mislead the consumer, in line with the EC Directive on unfair business practices of 2005."
"The purpose of our proposal is to introduce a compulsory marking of origin on imports of certain products and to establish clear rules on how origin shall be established."
"The objectives of our proposal are clear - to enable consumers to know the origin of the goods and to ensure transparency according to a single standard by which origin is determined."
"Of course, information on origin does not cover everything the consumer may want to know about a specific product, but has the benefit of being useful and clear."
"Secondly, being better informed, consumers will then be free to decide what to purchase according to their preferences."
"Incidentally, our proposal can also contribute to reducing the incidence of fraudulent or misleading origin marking."
"It is limited in scope, applying to goods such as leather, textiles, footwear and glassware, and it would not apply to sectors like electronics, ICT equipment, chemicals, machinery, cars, etc."
"Among the product categories covered, there are products for which information about origin is particularly important: those that are destined for the final consumer."
"One of the amendments adopted by the Committee on International Trade clearly refers to this condition, which I find positive."
"Of course, we will need to ensure consistency between this principle - namely 'goods for final consumers' - and the actual products that will ultimately be covered by the regulation, as detailed in its annex."
"I will not deny that origin marking has a cost for traders and exporters to the EU."
"The cost will notably depend on the production processes and technical marking rules."
"Therefore, it is important to keep these costs to a minimum."
"The Commission would be in charge of drafting the rules regarding the modalities of the marking, and will pay the utmost attention to minimising costs by relying on international practices, consulting with Member States and all the industries and traders involved."
"Setting this proposal in a wider context, other large trading partners - like the US, Canada, Japan and China - have long had such schemes in place."
"We are therefore able to draw useful lessons from the experience of others."
"In conclusion, I underscore the Commission's determination to work closely with Parliament in order to have this proposal adopted and to have an efficient, accurate and cost-effective scheme for origin marking."
"Mandatory origin marking, or the use of the words 'Made in', means that goods imported into Europe from outside the EU are to be labelled with the country they come from."
"In my opinion, this is a proposal that belongs in the last century, when something that was manufactured in Sweden, for example, also consisted of parts originating only from Sweden."
"However, in this proposal, it is as if world trade, globalisation and global supply chains have been disregarded."
"One of my favourite examples is this shirt that I am wearing."
"It is made of cotton from Egypt, which was woven into cloth in Italy."
"It was designed in Hong Kong and finally sewn together in China."
"I think that a much better description than 'Made in China', which it would probably receive under this regulation, would be 'Made in the world', to quote Pascal Lamy, former Commissioner and current Director-General of the WTO."
"That is what the world looks like today."
"This is not a proposal that provides better information."
"I believe that, on the contrary, this is a proposal that creates new barriers to trade and makes trade more difficult, and it is perhaps even protectionist."
"That is precisely why this type of regulation is prohibited within the EU."
"On the internal market, it is not permitted, for example, in Sweden to demand that articles imported from Germany be labelled with where they come from."
"It is true that many of our trading partners, the United States for example, have this type of regulation."
"The United States introduced such a provision in 1930, but this is not, of course, something we should imitate."
"We all know that the 1930s were one of the darkest decades in the history of world trade."
"Instead of introducing trade regulations from the previous century, creating new trade barriers and obstructing world trade, I think that we should do the opposite."
"In order to get ourselves out of recession, we should facilitate trade."
"My message to the Commission is therefore: rework the proposal and do it right!"
"I will vote against this proposal tomorrow and I am certain that several of my fellow Members will follow my example."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am always very happy to speak after Mr Fjellner, as I am always sure that I will not be in agreement with him."
"First, I should like to thank our rapporteur as well as all the shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, my friend Mr Susta, for their excellent work and their good cooperation on this text, which will finally enable a system of compulsory marking of origin on certain products imported into Europe to be introduced."
"I should like to thank you too, Commissioner, for your commitment."
"Our vote tomorrow will, in fact, be the first stage in the introduction of this regulation, which dates from 2005, and which the European Parliament has always supported and called for."
"Origin marking is an important step towards transparency and information, which we must constantly improve in favour of European citizens."
"Indeed, European consumers rightly want to know what they are purchasing, where the product comes from and under what conditions it was produced."
"They are therefore demanding to be able to consume in a more informed and, hence, responsible way."
"With this new regulation, we are responding to this demand, because our citizens will be better informed, in particular, of the social and environmental conditions under which the goods they purchase are produced."
"Contrary to what some people want to believe, the consumer is also a citizen, who agrees to pay more for quality European production, because this legislation is also essential for European companies, whose production is associated with a reputation for quality and high production standards."
"For those companies that have chosen to maintain production safeguarding know-how and employment in Europe, this regulation will re-establish a level playing field with our third-country trading partners."
"The text resulting from the vote of the Committee on International Trade is balanced, which is why, when it is voted on in tomorrow's plenary, I call on the Members of this House not to call this balance into question and to support this text by voting overwhelmingly in favour of it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"Madam President, if you were to visit the Ponte Rialto in Venice - perhaps with Commissioner De Gucht - and wanted to buy a pair of shoes advertised as Italian, a tie, a traditional mask or a glass from Murano, there is a chance you will be ripped off, realising that the product purchased was not made in Italy at all, but in some country in Asia."
"I believe that the proposed regulation under discussion is beginning to inject some order into an ever more confused global market."
"It seeks to protect the consumer - including you Madam President, and Commissioner De Gucht, if you go shopping on Venice's Ponte Rialto, or elsewhere - as well as the European industries that have not relocated (whilst those that have will be penalised by this regulation)."
"Above all it will correct the asymmetry on the trade markets, which sees Europe as the only large area lacking a regulation on compulsory origin marking."
"This is not a protectionist proposal; in fact, I find it to be very balanced."
"It only applies to a limited number of products, to the final product destined for the consumer, and - as far as my group is concerned - it is a 5-year pilot project because we shall support the amendment with the sunset clause."
"In addition, we also introduced in committee - through an amendment of my own - a provision that aims to avoid any excessive bureaucratic burden that would harm businesses."
"If the vote tomorrow is satisfactory, it will mean that one stage has been won, but it will not be a conclusive victory."
"We shall then need the full support of the European Commission in our dealings with the European Council."
"The Commission has already been full of suggestions and very cooperative, for which we are grateful, and this is a reason why we must continue to work together."
"I am sure that in five years, we shall be satisfied by the result we have obtained."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the good work she has done."
"We need to be better informed about the origin marking of the products we purchase."
"EU law also provides for penalty measures in the event of violation ..."
"I am sorry, there is a problem."
"I will speak later."
"(The speaker stops and then resumes at the invitation of the President)"
"We need to be better informed about the origin marking of the products we purchase."
"Community law also provides for penalty measures in the event of violation and of consumers being misled on origin."
"The European Court ..."
"No, it is not working."
"I am sorry."
"(The speaker stops again)"
"I understand why the proposal was submitted, but I do not agree with the reasons for submitting it."
"I think that the current globalised world hardly allows one to determine the country of origin; in the end, a guarantee of the quality of this or that product is far more important than its trademark or country of origin."
"We also need to note that this proposal does not deal with the protection of trademarks or protective labels, and also cannot be of any help in protecting trademarks or protective labels."
"The fact that it will lead to an increase in the specific cost of a product and, therefore, probably also to an increase in the price of the product, has already been mentioned here by the Commissioner."
"In the end, the fact that the proposal only relates to certain products - which has been mentioned several times here - could even be described as something like product-based or geographical discrimination."
"I would therefore argue here that we should stick with voluntary labelling, because in the end, where consumers put enough added value on such labelling, the majority of EU producers already use this labelling on a voluntary basis."
"The European Union is very often criticised for excessive regulation, for passing far too many laws that burden the economic environment."
"Therefore, I ask, at least in this case, that we do not contribute to the further burdening of the legal and economic environment in the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Muscardini for the work that she has done on this report and the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation."
"My group welcomes the approach of providing more transparency for consumers in relation to the origin of products, and supports the road map, as Mr Rinaldi described it, to a stage victory."
"In fact, we would prefer further information to be made apparent, such as information on products' ecological 'footprints', on whether workers' rights are observed in the manufacturing process or on the equitable sharing of profits by producers and workers."
"At the same time, we do not believe that this extended wish list belongs in a regulation on the indication of the country of origin, as the name of the country on its own does not provide any reliable information in this regard."
"Let us take the example of India, where child labour is prohibited."
"While there are black sheep amongst the companies there, the vast majority do comply with the law."
"In a European regulation, we therefore have to take into consideration the fact that neither competitors nor nationalists can drag the name of an entire country and its products through the mud."
"We advocate the development of certification systems."
"Fair trade labels represent a model to follow here, and these should now be further developed with EU support."
"Additionally taking account of low carbon production methods and humane working conditions would enable us to incorporate modern challenges."
"I call on the Commission to take steps to initiate an additional regulation in this direction."
"Allow me to add one more thought."
"A consistent introduction of the 'Made in' provision also has a part to play in solving complicated political conflicts; for example, the unhindered access of 'Made in Palestine' products to the EU market, which would deliver the chance of autonomous economic development in Palestine."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will tomorrow vote on origin marking, on which basis - as the tabled amendments stand - the origin mark would have to be applied to goods for final consumption and goods for the end consumer."
"This last definition could cause a serious chain reaction because it does not include semi-finished and intermediate products which - having been produced in non-EU countries - with a final and perhaps insignificant final processing upon arrival in Europe, could be passed off as goods made in a Member State."
"In this way, the consumer would not be fully informed of the real origin of the product whilst big industries would be incentivised to relocate to non-EU countries, thereby increasing their earnings many times over for their own interests alone, impoverishing our industrial districts."
"For these reasons, we tabled some amendments aimed at extending this definition to semi-finished and intermediate products as well, so as to guarantee transparency and traceability of products imported from third countries, along the lines of Italy's Reguzzoni law, which fully respects consumer rights."
"My fellow Members, this is truly the last chance we have to protect the manufacturing sector, in Italy and across Europe, which is one of the main drivers of the economy, unlike those few industrial giants that serve their own interests and not the good of the entire community."
"Restricting rabid relocation, counterfeiting and the exploitation of labour must continue to be one of the aims of the European Parliament."
"If we vote through the regulation tomorrow as it stands, we shall be throwing away a big opportunity along with our efforts and, above all, those of millions of workers at small and medium-sized enterprises who will feel betrayed, together with all consumers who trusted in us to make a responsible choice."
"The battle we are fighting is not against anyone, but for work, business, our workers and all European citizens."
"Madam President, we live in challenging economic times and many small businesses feel burdened with EU red tape and its associated cost."
"I believe that, first and foremost, this House and the Commission should be looking at ways to alleviate the financial burden of the red tape that we insist upon here."
"In respect of this proposal, we need to strike a balance between the opening-up of markets for European products and ensuring the quality and safety of imported products."
"I must say, however, that I do see merit in third-country labelling when it comes to food products."
"I know they are not covered by the scope of this proposal, but many of Northern Ireland's farmers feel let down when they work hard to meet the requirements laid down by Europe, and then have to compete with those who do not have to meet the same standards."
"I hope the Commissioner will take note that those of us who represent rural and agricultural-based communities have not forgotten the resumption of talks with Mercosur countries, and we hope that he is not prepared to sacrifice our agricultural industry for further markets."
"This place has a habit of taking legislation too far, and I fear that this is what is happening in this particular case."
"(DE) Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Muscardini for her hard work, particularly in view of the controversial issues, some of which have already been discussed."
"I am convinced that European consumers need to have this matter explained to them."
"I am also of the opinion that it must be our goal to protect the citizens of Europe from products that are dangerous and harmful to health."
"End users should know what raw materials are used, how these are obtained, where and how they are processed and what social and production standards apply in the relevant countries."
"The goal is clear, but we need clarity on how we intend to get there."
"Unfortunately, the current version of the proposed 'Made in' provision tell us nothing about the actual origins of a particular commodity."
"I should like to illustrate this with an example: Uzbekistan is the world's third largest exporter of cotton."
"Ninety per cent of the harvest is picked by hand, most of it using child labour."
"The gathered cotton is then shipped to Vietnam, where it is processed."
"According to the Commission's current proposals, the textiles now imported into the EU from Vietnam should be labelled 'Made in Vietnam', but what about the transparency for the European consumer?"
"Nobody knows where the raw materials come from and how they have been obtained."
"The level of information is quite inadequate."
"The European Consumer Centre in Austria has published an up-to-date analysis, which indicates that the world's leading and most prominent textile businesses are unable to guarantee that raw materials from state-sponsored companies involving child labour are not used in their production."
"A 'Made in' provision of this kind, which excludes raw materials from the production process, clearly misjudges the requirements of European end users."
"I am in favour of more truth in product labelling and therefore oppose this proposal from the Commission."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and all the shadow rapporteurs with whom I have worked on this issue, which is extremely important for us."
"I hope that tomorrow, the European Parliament gives the same strong backing to the legislative resolution that it gave in July 2006, with the written declaration of 2008, and the favourable vote on the resolution of 2009."
"We are preparing to adopt a measure that should protect the consumer, informing him or her of the origin of products for a more general purpose, which renews equality of opportunity in international trade and reciprocity between the European Union and its main competitors."
"It does not add costs for businesses in third countries, which are already obligated to mark their products in all our competitor countries in the world and in many others."
"Nor does it create any burdens for the European distribution system which, indirectly, without costing the public finances anything, favours the return to Europe of significant production, slows business relocation and also contributes to the fight against counterfeiting."
"It is a combination of very obvious advantages, which cannot be halted by calling perhaps for further measures because here, it really is the case that the best is the enemy of the good."
"We must come to the end of a process that began seven years ago, showing our concern for the interests of our businesses - above all, in this time of crisis and unemployment - but also for the potential for a trade system regulated so as to provide reciprocity, consumer protection and correct information which could be further developed in terms of traceability."
"If this measure is not voted through by Parliament, there will be trouble."
"I should like to thank the European Commission once again and all those who wish to support this measure, because it is helpful for European citizens and for world trade."
"(FR) Madam President, my apologies, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the good work she has done."
"We need to be better informed about the origin marking of the products we purchase."
"EU law also provides for penalty measures in the event of violation and of consumers being misled on origin."
"The European Court of Justice decrees that the Commission ..."
"No, I am sorry, there is a problem, I am going to record it in the Minutes."
"(The speaker stops)"
"(FR) Madam President, the miracle of free trade and of free and undistorted competition means that a consumer who purchases a knife labelled Laguiole in the Aveyron, its region of origin, has a 90% chance of acquiring a poor quality blade made in China or in Pakistan, one of many examples."
"It is a real labelling con."
"If we really want to safeguard and develop industrial employment in the European Union, if we want to avoid misleading European consumers and to protect their health, if we want to prolong the social and environmental acquis of our societies, there is an urgent need to make the origin marking of manufactured products compulsory, even if it means encroaching on the ultraliberal founding dogmas of Europe."
"This marking must be serious and not a form of deception which entails presenting a product as having been 'made in Europe' when it is, in fact, nothing more than an assembly of parts from all over the world, with only the label having been 'made in Europe'."
"The customs services and ministries of justice of the Member States will then need to be given all the means of control and law enforcement to implement strong legislation on the marking of origin and the country of origin."
"(SK) Thanks to an open trade policy, our citizens can buy products made all over the world."
"More often than not, however, they have no way of knowing where the product was made, where the materials from which it is made came from, and what technological procedures the manufacturer used for its processing."
"At the same time, the maximum amount of information the consumer can have about a product is a basic pre-condition for good decision making when choosing goods."
"To this day, our European citizens have no right to elementary information about products, something which has been routinely available not only to the citizens of the United States since 1930, but also today to the people of China, Japan, Canada, India, Mexico and other countries."
"This is why I believe it is time the European Union adopted a norm which will protect European consumers regardless of the particular interests of large distribution chains or certain interest groups, and require suppliers to mark goods imported from third countries with the necessary information about their origin."
"In this way, our consumers will be provided with an important source of information when deciding which goods to choose, while third country manufacturers will not be substantially affected in any way because they have long been indicating the origin of their products to other countries."
"However, it will be important to think through the mechanisms of the uniform application of sanctions and penalties for the violation of this legislation by any Member State in order to prevent manufacturers from seeking a point of entry to the common market of the European Union which is not properly safeguarded by sanctions, thereby avoiding compliance with the regulations."
"I firmly believe that introducing an effective system for marking the origin of products from third countries will be extremely beneficial both to our European consumers and to compliant manufacturers."
"(CS) Czech glassmakers, textile manufacturers and shoe manufacturers have, for a long time, been coming to me and calling for transparency on the origin of products."
"They must compete with imitations of unknown origin which are parasitic on the European Union market."
"We are mostly talking about poor quality and often harmful goods."
"In addition, information on where textiles, shoes, glass, jewellery or pharmaceutical products are produced is not classified information, nor does it constitute protectionism or a barrier to free trade, as liberals are labelling it."
"On the contrary, the free market and fair competition work well only if consumers can make good and free decisions on the basis of information and experience."
"I fully support the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and I appreciate her contribution to achieving a compromise, which I hope will enable us to adopt the proposal tomorrow."
"I understand that, particularly in northern countries, where traditional products have been replaced by imports from other countries, such regulation may be regarded as unnecessary bureaucracy."
"However, let us compare the adoption of the regulation with our competitors in the USA, Canada, Japan and China, where 'made in' is obligatory."
"Like the previous speaker, I want to say that it is necessary for the Commission to propose at least minimum standards for penalties, and to ensure that the rules will be followed consistently across the Union and that third-country exporters will not give preference to certain countries because of lower or no sanctions."
"We owe this to our citizens."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during a recent delegation trip on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I had the pleasure of visiting a number of production sites in Europe, small enterprises that are forced to operate in very difficult conditions: I witnessed superior quality, fair wages, good working conditions and a rational working atmosphere."
"This is a direct result of our traditions and European legal order."
"However, there are plenty of countries where such principles do not exist, where working conditions are poor, and where no guarantees exist for workers."
"I believe that, at the very least, European consumers must be able to recognise in future whether the products they are buying come from a particular country where basic principles do not apply."
"This is something that will be required in future thanks to the directive that Mrs Muscardini has so efficiently prepared."
"Accordingly, we should agree to the proposal."
"To those businesses that have moved their production abroad for their own convenience and in order to avoid bureaucracy, and which are now complaining, I would say: you have only yourselves to blame!"
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe could not escape from this duty: this is the way we can and have had to react."
"I should like to thank Mrs Muscardini for the tenacity of her work and all the other fellow Members who have worked on this issue."
"With regard to the traceability of goods from non-European Union countries, I believe that it is right that consumers know the provenance and the origin of products in order to safeguard their health and their freedom, extending this to semi-processed goods in which the supply chain is indicated."
"With regard to competitiveness, the lack of a regulation of this kind undermines the right of European citizens and consumers and prevents the proper functioning of the market, which, to be free, must have common and shared rules, without disparities or unfair competition."
"With regard to the safeguarding of small and medium-sized enterprises and their national products, it is not the big companies that need such protection."
"Indeed, I believe that they absolutely do not need it seeing as they travel the world with their brands."
"Furthermore, we must promote the specialties and traditional excellences of our countries, relaunch the European economy and guarantee the respect for the rights of workers in social, environmental and productive terms."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wonder what we have to fear by telling the truth and aiming to establish rules that are equal for all."
"We must try not to be cowed, making use of the European ordinary legislative procedure, and prevent the Council from always imposing its will."
"Hence, let us try to make this step a reality by supporting the regulation in question."
"For the rest, let us wait and see."
"(ES) Mr President, the regulation that we are debating today is of vital importance for the future of the cutlery and similar products sector, which, in my region - Don Quixote country, specifically, Albacete - represents not just the survival of more than 8 000 jobs but also part of its identity and future commitment to craftsmanship as a source of employment."
"The 'made in' stamp on knives has been demanded for some time by social groups such as Aprecu, and the government of Castilla-La Mancha has been fighting for it with the unanimous support of its regional Parliament."
"Origin marking is not interventionism; it is a commitment to transparency in the commercial rules of play and in the fight against unfair competition."
"It means increasing the capacity of consumers to make decisions by choosing a product because they are taking into account not only its final price, but also the mark of quality of the place of origin or the social conditions in which it is produced."
"Above all, it will represent a new possibility of optimism for many people who are having a difficult time, but who today are feeling that we have not been indifferent in terms of backing fairer trade, while, at the same time, giving added value to those who, as well as producing, do so while respecting social rights and the better conditions of European workers."
"I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur and Mr Menéndez del Valle for their social conscience in this matter that is so important for my region."
"(SK) First, I would like to compliment Mrs Muscardini on her approach to the report and the hard work she has invested in it."
"The European Union is neither the first, nor the second or third, to request that its citizens be informed about the origin of a product they purchase for their needs or consumption."
"The US, Canada, Japan, India and many other countries have long been providing this right to their citizens."
"This is in accordance with the regulations of the World Trade Organisation."
"So the question is why have we not yet found a compromise?"
"All of us agree on the need to inform the consumer citizen."
"However, it is also true that the indication of the country of origin, that is, the 'made in' provision, may be potentially misleading because globalisation in industry means that the end product is composed of parts made in different countries."
"Therefore, were we perhaps to add another label to that of 'made in', such as 'processed in' or 'assembled in', we might arrive at a broad agreement more easily."
"The greatest obstacle, which is the fear of providing incorrect, incomplete or misleading information, would thus be removed."
"In conclusion, I would like to express the hope that here in the European Parliament, to which the Treaty of Lisbon has granted greater authority in this very area, and led by the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, we will find common solutions which will help our citizens to make better and, most importantly, freer choices."
"I would like to apologise, sir, for disturbing you."
"The next item is the immediate comments."
"There are six of these, so we are able to give the floor to each one."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all citizens have realised the global scale of the ongoing economic crisis and we believe that they are aware of the importance of adopting common rules to avoid causing distortions in the market and dangerous reductions in trade."
"The European Union has acknowledged the need to inform citizens clearly about the products circulating within their borders and efforts have been made in this vein, bearing in mind the interests of both the Member States and citizens."
"While the interests of the first group entail promoting their resources without being protectionist, citizens are concerned with always knowing the provenance of each product, even at the expense of waiting some time for this regime to be applied to all categories of goods."
"We want the European Union to speak with a single voice, at the same level as all the other voices that express themselves strongly in international markets."
"So, tomorrow, we will support the report on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries, urging the European Council to do its part to conclude this legislative journey, which has now lasted for six long years, as well as possible."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, five years after the proposal for a regulation, tomorrow, we finally come to the vote on compulsory origin marking for some products imported from third countries."
"Over the years, the European Parliament has affirmed on numerous occasions the need for a rule that gives consumers the right to have correct information on the provenance of products, thereby facilitating a more aware choice."
"Our products are often the victims of counterfeiting and misleading markings."
"This regulation could contribute to giving European businesses greater guarantees and recovering competitiveness on an international level."
"I hope that Parliament sends a strong signal, approving by a very wide majority the report by Mrs Muscardini, whom I thank, together with the shadow rapporteur, Mr Susta."
"(DE) Mr President, in the agricultural sector too, consumers are entitled to detailed and unambiguous information about the origin of the products sold in the European Union."
"By this means, we can enable them to make well-informed, deliberate purchasing decisions."
"However, the long-term goal must be that our high product and security standards in Europe should also apply to imported products to be sold in the European Union."
"This is not a question of trade restrictions, but rather, on the contrary, aims to establish equal competitive conditions as a decisive prerequisite for fair global trade."
"Unfortunately, the motion for a resolution presented by the Commission will not achieve this aim."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we enthusiastically support this regulation, and should like to thank the rapporteur Mrs Muscardini, as well as Mr Susta and Mr Rinaldi."
"I, too, am of the belief that this measure represents an intermediate step."
"We must decide whether or not it is right that, when buying a product, a consumer knows where it has been made."
"We feel that it is right."
"This is a regulation that works towards transparency and the protection of consumer rights."
"It matters little to us right now if, in order to protect the rights of transparency and clarity for consumers, some business that has relocated finds itself penalised in some way."
"I listened carefully to the words of my Swedish colleague, Mr Fjellner, who hails from Stockholm, to whom I feel the need to respond that I would like to have the confidence to go to his country to buy a typical Swedish-made suit in the certainty that it really was made in Sweden."
"This is because it could have the brand of a Swedish business even though it has been produced by a small manufacturing business, perhaps located 10 kilometres from my house."
"I should feel quite a fool if I went all the way to Sweden to buy something that was produced in my local area."
"Therefore, I welcome the mark of origin if it gives transparency and the chance of clarity and knowledge for consumers and, finally, a minimal response to the great many businesses that have had the courage not to relocate and have been crushed by unfair competition."
"(PT) Mr President, we have advocated and evaluated the possibility that origin marking should exist, because we see it in every sense as an instrument for defending jobs in European industry, not least in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); as an instrument against social and environmental dumping."
"An important instrument, but only that: an instrument."
"It is not - and let us not delude ourselves about this - a panacea."
"It is not the magical, universal solution for tackling the tragic consequences resulting from the liberalisation and deregulation of world trade; for tackling the terrible damage that results from this deregulation."
"Some of those who have benefited from this liberalisation are the same people who have always been opposed to origin marking: Europe's large importers and distributors."
"For our part, we will continue to fight the protectionism from which these interest groups have benefited against the common good and to the detriment of thousands of SMEs in Europe, and of the workers, their rights and their salaries."
"We must seriously tackle issues linked to production and processing that cover different geographic areas, but these issues can be overcome, and they must be resolved in the most transparent and informative way possible."
"Mr President, I would like to say to my colleague, Mrs Muscardini, that - in the words of Shakespeare - you have done the state some service, because for too long we have been like a fairy godmother to the world, spreading our generosity far and wide, and being treated like a fairy in return."
"We have seen that in Copenhagen, and we see it in the United Nations, but thankfully tonight, we will begin to fight back and establish a level playing field for our consumers and for our manufacturers."
"It actually makes no sense whatsoever that goods can come into the European Union from third countries without some indication of where they came from."
"I would like to see this going much further."
"My colleague, Mrs Dodds, said that she would like to see it extended to agriculture and this is at least a first step."
"We need to help our consumers to make choices, to know that the choices they are making are correct ones, that there is no counterfeiting, and there is fair play for everybody."
"So, well done to my colleague, Mrs Muscardini."
"We are on the road at last."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I notice there is much support across Parliament for the proposal, so I will not go into many of the remarks which have been made because most of them support the Commission proposal and the Muscardini report on it."
"Let me just say with respect to the rules of origin that this is a very stabilised regime."
"These rules are very stable indeed and they are well known, because it is on the basis of these rules of origin that customs duties are paid when products come into the European market."
"In fact, our proposal fully relies on them."
"There can be no misunderstanding about that."
"The second remark I would like to make is about an amendment introduced by Mrs Muscardini, which, in fact, proposes that this 'made in' regulation would be a kind of pilot project that would be evaluated after a four-year period and perhaps changed."
"I consider this an amendment worth supporting, because I imagine that it will enhance the chances that this proposal has in the Council."
"The reason why this proposal dating back to 2005 is not EU legislation is simply that the Council does not buy it."
"It has refused it until now, but the proposal by Mrs Muscardini to make a pilot project out of this for a five-year period, with an evaluation after four years, is a very good step in the right direction."
"That is why the Commission can accept the amendment proposed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the consideration he has shown for the proposals that we worked out in committee."
"It has been a long job, with difficult mediation, but we tried to bear in mind the needs of all."
"Above all, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Susta and Mr Rinaldi."
"We were able to present a text which, in its entirety, encompasses the majority of problems that were presented to us."
"I should also like to thank my fellow Members who this evening have, in the great majority, expressed their support for the regulation, but, above all, for greater democracy and respect of consumers and European citizens."
"I hope that tomorrow, the vote can finally get a new phase of the European Union under way; a phase which, on the one hand, will see the reaffirmation of the political will of the Union and, on the other, the reaffirmation of the right of European citizens to be informed and participate in choices that the Union will make"
"It has been a long work of compromise and I really am amazed that there are still some fellow Members, representing several countries, who prefer to consider rejecting the regulation rather than guaranteeing their countrymen and women the same rights enjoyed by all Chinese, Indian and United States citizens, and so on."
"I hope that the night brings counsel and that each of us remembers that one day, we shall be asked to explain what we have done well, what we have done badly, and what we have not done at all."
"Today, we must finally act with the ability to understand what the world represents for us."
"Freedom and democracy are defended by knowledge."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 21 October 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I would like to express my full support for the report on the introduction of country of origin labelling for various products imported from third countries."
"Mrs Muscardini's proposal solves the previous absence of European legislative standards in this area."
"The requirement to indicate the origin of products may contribute to the equalisation of conditions on the world trade market, because similar protection for domestic products is also insisted on by various global economies, such as the United States, Canada or Japan."
"Protection of this type accordingly helps goods produced in the European Union to be more competitive with goods from third countries."
"Indicating the country of origin also contributes to the preservation of traditional production methods, typical product characteristics and quality."
"This type of protection of European products will also have a positive effect on maintaining employment in all Member States."
"I would also like to state that indicating the country of origin increases consumer awareness and transparency when deciding to buy specific products, and prevents possible fraudulent claims about the origin of products or counterfeiting."
"Information about the origin of the products available on the EU market is very important for all consumers."
"Indicating the country of origin allows citizens to make informed choices when they buy a particular product, and enables them to avoid the health and safety risks associated with third-country products which do not meet quality standards."
"The regulations on origin labelling also give effective protection against counterfeiting and unfair competition."
"It is important to define the detailed forms and procedures for origin labelling and to set penalties for breaching the provisions of the regulation."
"Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission's statement on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, you asked me to come to the plenary to explain where we are in the negotiations on ACTA - the international Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement."
"I share your view that this is an important dossier, and I am here for the third time in less than a year to discuss it with you."
"Where are we?"
"Well, in two words, we are almost there."
"Indeed, on 2 October 2010, negotiators from the EU and 10 other countries concluded the last round of negotiations."
"They have resolved nearly all issues with only a few still open."
"I will come back to that later."
"A consolidated and largely stabilised text of the proposed agreement was made public two weeks ago."
"I hope that this has allowed you to find out that the Commission has scrupulously respected the principles that I laid out in my previous interventions in this House."
"It is essential to remember that ACTA is an agreement concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights."
"This means that it does not oblige any of its signatories to create new, substantive rights or to change existing ones."
"It only commits its signatories to ensuring that the rights holders can fully assert their rights if, when and where they exist."
"ACTA is about establishing a new tool that will ensure that existing intellectual property rights are effectively protected."
"This is essential if we want to maintain a leading role in the 'knowledge economy'."
"Contrary to what some seem to be claiming, ACTA is not about creating some sort of 'Big Brother'."
"I know that you had concerns with the fact that the negotiations were conducted behind closed doors and that the negotiating texts were not made public."
"At the insistence of the Commission, successive versions of the text have been published and our negotiators came here after each round to answer all your questions."
"We have taken these steps to ensure that we could debate the topic in a climate of mutual trust."
"I should like to mention that the Ombudsman has recently recognised, in the precise context of the ACTA negotiations, that it was justified to maintain the confidentiality of some key negotiating documents."
"The Ombudsman confirmed that the preservation of confidentiality was legal and in line with the 2001 Regulation on access to documents."
"Let me now highlight some of the main features of ACTA."
"Firstly, a broad coverage of intellectual property rights (IPRs)."
"Given the diversity of IPRs, on which European operators rely to protect their inventions, we have fought for, and obtained, broad coverage."
"In particular, we have managed to ensure that Europe's geographical indications (GIs) will be treated equally."
"This is an EU success."
"It would not be in the draft ACTA Treaty without the European Commission."
"I know that it may not go as far as some would have liked - for example, as regards border measures."
"Justified differences will remain, and ACTA Parties will not have to adopt the EU system of protecting GIs through sui generis systems."
"Secondly, ACTA defines for the first time an international standard for intellectual property infringements on the Internet."
"The Internet is the most global, open and fast-moving market environment, where music, films, books and software circulate."
"Millions of counterfeit goods are traded every day through the Internet."
"ACTA thus represents a ground-breaking - yet balanced - level of harmonisation and transparency for the rules applicable to such infringements, whilst remaining fully in line with the EU acquis."
"Let me stress that ACTA will not change the EU acquis."
"Our negotiating guidelines requested this and we have scrupulously respected it, as you can see from the text."
"Thirdly, ACTA provides a balanced agreement, which replies to the four main concerns expressed by Members, for the following four reasons."
"Firstly, the text does not affect the protection of fundamental rights, privacy and data protection."
"Secondly, it respects the important role of free Internet and safeguards the role of service providers, as well as the European system of copyright exceptions, such as the European regime of conditional exemption of liability for Internet operators."
"European exceptions, like private or educational use, will also remain valid."
"Thirdly, the text refers to those provisions of the TRIPS agreement that safeguard the essential balance between the rights of the right holders and the public interest, and that stress the 'need for intellectual property rights to contribute to technical innovation, socio-economic welfare, or the protection of health'."
"Fourthly, ACTA explicitly recognises the importance of guaranteeing access to medicines, by referring to the Doha Declaration on the matter, as well as by explicitly excluding patent infringements from the sections on border and penal enforcement."
"What is the state of play and the next steps in ACTA?"
"Well, in Tokyo, it was not possible to finalise the text."
"The parties kept a few reservations, which still need to be addressed in the coming weeks."
"There are, in particular, two issues open."
"Firstly, should patent infringements be included or excluded from the scope of civil litigation measures?"
"I would be interested to hear your views on this issue."
"I am concerned that a blanket exclusion of patents - an important intellectual property right - might risk depriving many industries of the benefits of this chapter."
"I am thinking, for example, of the automotive, machinery, pharmaceutical and agro-chemical sectors."
"Secondly, the other important issue has to do with the EU proposal that the Internet measures stipulated in ACTA must apply not only to copyright but - at least - also to trademark violations."
"As you know, on the Internet, you can find thousands of offers for fake goods using European brands, be it for clothes, cosmetics, watches or even foodstuffs."
"I believe we should address these infringements made through the Internet because they are basically identical to real-life infringements concerning physical goods."
"To conclude, I am firmly convinced of the importance of tackling the widespread abuse of European intellectual property around the world."
"ACTA can provide an important contribution towards this goal, in full compliance with existing European legislation."
"ACTA is the first important international agreement on IPRs since the TRIPS agreement in the WTO back in 1994."
"It also strikes a proper balance with the rights of citizens and consumers."
"I look forward to a continued close dialogue with the European Parliament and towards the successful conclusion of the agreement and its subsequent approval."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for taking the opportunity several times in recent months, firstly, to report here to the plenary part-session and secondly, to attend question and answer sessions with the relevant parliamentary committee, either in person or through his staff."
"It is right and important that we should assure the European Parliament that the Commission really does report on the status of negotiations in a transparent way."
"I believe that this also places us in a position to evaluate, and therefore approve or reject, such an agreement on the basis of solid data."
"My impression at the moment is that many critics are running out of arguments against the ACTA agreement."
"I think it is a good thing that the acquis communautaire remains unchanged."
"It would be really great if the Commission could once again show us that this really is copper-fastened."
"There are still some Members of this House who have their doubts about this and I would be grateful if the Commission could explain this issue once again in a clear, unambiguous way - perhaps even having the Commission's legal service check the matter out."
"I believe it is a positive thing that the ACTA agreement is apparently focusing on the implementation of existing law, rather than the framing of new laws."
"I particularly welcome the section on the Internet."
"It is high time that we took action in relation films, music, books and software circulating on the Internet."
"I am not looking to criminalise any of our citizens, but I believe that it must be possible for artists and creators also to pursue their intellectual property rights on the Internet and I welcome the fact that the ACTA agreement offers a first step in this direction."
"I would definitely have preferred to deal with the entire issue in the context of the WTO."
"However, I also note that we lacked suitable partners in dialogue within the WTO, which is why the ACTA agreement is certainly a good start."
"I would be grateful if the Commission, possibly after the conclusion of the ACTA agreement, would do all it can to ensure that as many other countries as possible sign up to this agreement and would also demonstrate a little flexibility in cases where doubts exist."
"I particularly welcome the fact that you have succeeded in including information on geographical origin - such as champagne, Scotch whisky, Parma ham, etc. - I would like to congratulate you on this."
"I believe this is a huge step forward for the interests of the European Union."
"It must be possible to secure and protect our European origin labelling and information in the same way as trademarks like Coca Cola, Kellogg's Cornflakes, etc. I believe we must take active steps here in the interests of our producers."
"You raised a question in relation to patents: on the one hand, the title of this agreement clearly points in a different direction; however, on the other hand, our businesses are experiencing enormous problems in this regard and I would suggest that perhaps we could discuss this issue with you in detail on Monday when you attend the meeting of the Committee on International Trade."
"Congratulations on what you have achieved."
"I would encourage you to show perseverance with regard to the outstanding issues."
"I look forward to the day when this House can decide whether to approve or reject the agreement on the basis of the final wording."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are clearly faced with a text whose complexity troubles many of us and, even more, in my opinion, the citizens of Europe."
"Commissioner, I asked for transparency and you responded."
"Today, I am somewhat concerned."
"Indeed, as I see it, beyond the purely technical issues, the main risk is that of the direction we are beginning to take with regard to this increasingly complex relationship between individual freedoms and the Internet."
"The world is changing rapidly, and we are all aware of this."
"We are all aware of the revolution taking place in access not only to information but also to culture via this tool."
"In today's world, where such access is immediate and free, traditional reference points are being undermined."
"Our most complex task is, therefore, to define new regulations, because regulation is necessary not only to protect artists and rights holders; but I do not want to see individual freedoms ignored."
"As regards the protection of freedoms, one of the most important of which is the protection of the right to privacy, one of my main concerns is the possibility afforded by the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) of travellers' personal effects and baggage being checked at borders."
"Does this mean that our mobile telephones, our MP3 players and our computers may be searched by customs authorities looking for illegally downloaded files?"
"According to the Commission, this is just a possibility, because the precise term used in the text is not binding."
"It is said that the Member States may choose whether or not to allow their personal luggage to be searched."
"However, let us get serious here for a minute."
"How can one expect such wording not to be seen as incitement to carry out such checks?"
"Do you really think that a government, especially if it is pressurised to some extent by its music industry - and I cite this example deliberately - will not take this opportunity afforded by ACTA to move its national legislation towards increased screening of passengers entering its territory?"
"Another problem is that, if it is proved that the files held by a private individual are for commercial use, punishment is automatic."
"However, who determines whether the files we hold are of a commercial nature or not?"
"Some may say that a person with 500 songs on his or her MP3 player necessarily has commercial objectives, but why would others deny themselves the opportunity to fix this limit at 300, 100, 50 or 10?"
"In fact, for an ill-intentioned person, all it takes is to illegally download a single film in order to make thousands of copies of it, and that then becomes commercial activity."
"Finally, punishment will be meted out by the courts of each country, but a European citizen arrested by the border authorities of a signatory country on the basis of particularly binding legislation will have no means of challenging it."
"Is it your wish that such an abuse be possible?"
"Was it not the responsibility of the Commission precisely to do everything it could to ensure that the agreement prohibits searches of personal effects?"
"I have deliberately raised only this issue this evening, but you have raised many more, which we will incorporate into the resolution I have requested and which will ordinarily be voted on in next month's plenary."
"Commissioner, I would ask you to take account of the outcome of this vote, which will be in line with our commitment, that is, to take account of the word of the European Parliament before you sign the act."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations have been difficult, with strong opposing opinions as well as different interpretations of the consequences of this agreement."
"As far I as can make out, the current status of the negotiations provides for an imbalance in the treatment of geographic indications and marks, in favour of the latter, as well as the failure to act, in violation of Article 22 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of International Property Rights, on marks that use denominations protected by geographical indications."
"'Parmesan' - one of a number of possible examples - can be freely produced as 'Parmesan' in the United States and Australia and exported to China or elsewhere in direct competition with European products, one of the strengths of which is geographical indications."
"Consequently, European products seem to be propping up unfair competition without any effective protection from the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement."
"I should like a clarification in this regard."
"'Parmesan' means 'from Parma', not Australia or the United States, and this applies equally to all European geographic indications."
"We must be careful because if, in the course of 21st century globalisation, in a few years' time, we no longer have our geographic indications, it will partly be because of today's mistaken choices and we shall lose an enormous piece of our identity."
"In this regard, if all that were permitted by the ACTA, the agreement would be unacceptable."
"There is also the question of the Internet, as already mentioned."
"The European Union is in favour of a society of widespread knowledge, open to all, and the ACTA must not in any way constitute a restriction on the freedom of access to the Internet."
"Much has been gained on this issue."
"The Commissioner has given his important assurances, but it would be unacceptable if the acquis communautaire were tarnished, as still appears to be the case, by the possibility of legal injunctions provided for by Article 2, and by the possibility of criminal sanctions, including for individual users, as provided for by Article 2(14)(1)."
"I appreciate the highly important assurances on access to medicine for developing countries, but we know that the list of countries adhering to the ACTA is very limited and excludes the great powers of counterfeiting, in Asia, in particular, but not only there."
"So for this reason, given everything we have to lose on geographic indications and risks on the Internet, the impression - for now - is that the agreement represents only a disadvantage and on this basis, perhaps it is better to let it drop."
"Mr President, Commissioner°De Gucht, it is obvious that the ACTA agreement negotiated will shortly be adopted."
"This is an agreement that entails a whole series of commitments by the contracting parties in strengthening the enforcement of intellectual property rights."
"We, as Members of the European Parliament, will soon be asked by you, the Commission, to approve this agreement."
"However, for months now, Parliament has made it clear that a number of the declarations of intent made by the EU within the ACTA agreement run the risk of going beyond current EU law."
"Not only is it unclear whether sufficient competence exists for this kind of trade agreement, involving as it does provisions such as punitive measures or intervention in fundamental rights, we also lack information on the extent to which ACTA will necessitate the introduction of illegal measures in the EU."
"For this reason, ACTA will have to be sent back to the negotiating table."
"And yet you are willing to sign up to the agreement now."
"That is why I would ask you firstly: Have you already signed?"
"If not, when do you intend to sign?"
"Secondly: When will we receive a detailed impact assessment on the extent to which ACTA could affect fundamental rights within the EU?"
"I look forward to hearing your answers."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I think we should start off by welcoming some of these statements that were made this evening and the fact that, following the Tokyo Round, the Commission released the text to the Parliament, which will ultimately be in a position to give consent or not to these agreements."
"I think the move towards transparency is something which should be welcomed across the Parliament."
"After all, that was one of the areas of consensus across the Parliament - we may have disagreed on certain elements, but we agreed on more and more transparency."
"An increase in transparency means that we reduce false speculation about the content of the negotiations, but also, to be fair, highlights the positive role played by the Commission in trying to persuade the negotiating partners of the need for greater transparency."
"I think we played a role in this Parliament in putting pressure on the Commission, so it, in turn, can talk to its negotiating partners about the need for greater transparency."
"There are obviously differences of opinion in this House on intellectual property rights."
"It is clearly a key issue for copyright and trademark holders."
"ACTA, I hope, is an important step in terms of enforcement among all active parties and builds on the TRIPS agreement of the mid-1990s."
"Personally, I think a distinction should be made between the digital world and the world of atoms; in a world of increased processing power, increased storage and increased bandwidth, you see a tendency towards a price of zero and many in the music industry, for example, have failed to react."
"I understand from speaking to legal experts, however, that it is very difficult to codify that in an agreement."
"When it comes to the production of generic medicines, I am glad that ACTA protects copyrights and trademarks while excluding patents from border measures, so you avoid the seizure of generic medicine in transit through the EU."
"But I do have a question since the Commission was not responsible for negotiating on behalf of the EU when it came to the criminal enforcement chapter which was dealt with by the Council on behalf of Member States."
"How, when we have this debate about concerns over the criminal sanctions, do we intend to reconcile the two different negotiations between the civil and the criminal chapter?"
"It is a question for you, Mr Commissioner."
"You can shrug, but it will be interesting to hear your perspective on this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this week, US Senators Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown have written to the US Patent and Trademark Office to demand a thorough check to ensure that the wording of the negotiated ACTA agreement can be reconciled with existing US legislation."
"Be assured that we in this House are fulfilling our duty by examining the agreement in the context of the laws of the European Union."
"My group favours adopting a thorough approach and taking as much time as necessary, even though you have once again offered very detailed answers to the questions regarding the acquis communautaire."
"This is because the questions that we were able to ask the Commission in the debriefing sessions which you recently offered us after the negotiations, and for which I would like to thank you, were not really answered to our complete satisfaction."
"Your chief negotiator often gave us the feeling that we were - if I might express myself in colloquial terms at this point - a bit like God-botherers who sought to question holy writ, rather than dealing with the concerns we voiced on behalf of the citizens of Europe."
"Nonetheless, some of our original criticism with regard to the aspects relating to the Internet has had some effect and some of the more harmful proposals have been dropped."
"(DE) Mr President, the ACTA negotiations seem to be more or less concluded."
"The wording of the latest version of the agreement already reads like legislative text as it applies in individual Member States."
"Thus, the ACTA agreement will leave the existing legal situation in Europe almost unchanged."
"The original aim of the agreement was to improve enforcement."
"However, I am unable to identify any specific solutions in this regard from the proposal."
"Prior to publication, it became known that the disputed points were to be dropped."
"However, this version does not seem to take adequate account of the various conflicting interests."
"For example, Article 2(2) of the agreement reads: 'Procedures adopted, maintained, or applied to implement this Chapter shall be fair, equitable and provide for the rights of all participants subject to procedures to be appropriately protected'."
"The chapter on temporary measures contains no explicit reference to the right to due legal process, neither is there a provision for verifying the need to destroy counterfeit products."
"Last but not least - we hear that the last points of the negotiation are to finalised by e-mail."
"However, these last points include the area of application of the agreement as a whole."
"Surely this should be defined before we start on the formulation of the content."
"Perhaps this would then also give rise to some practical solutions in the agreement itself."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the European Commission and, in particular, Commissioner De Gucht, for the tough negotiations it is carrying out with the United States, a task that aims to find a point of convergence on an agreement that unfortunately seems to be never ending."
"We are still far from a solution to the problems of intellectual property, which continue to be the subject of a dispute between two blocks that differ both economically and politically."
"Europe must continue to concentrate on two fundamental points."
"It must be compulsory for European geographic indications to be protected in both civil and customs terms, as these are today suffering damage that affects not only the agro-food industry, whose counterfeited products suffer unfair competition through the use of names that copy and evoke familiar European brands, but also damages industries operating in the design and fashion sectors."
"This damages businesses, intellectual property, research and - as always - the consumer."
"A second central point is the need for common rules controlling online sales: the sale of films, books, music, medicines and millions of other counterfeited goods continue to take place on the Internet, without any controls."
"The European Union must send a clear message to the rest of the world: the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement must be a bulwark against all counterfeiting."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, international agreements have to be submitted to the European Parliament for approval."
"As Members of Parliament, it is vital that we are able to exercise our right of veto as often as is necessary, but our work has now been made virtually impossible."
"Time and again, we have been forced to ask the Commission to clarify the state of play in the negotiations on ACTA."
"However, we are constantly being fobbed off with words."
"First, we were reassured with the argument that the negotiations are far from over and now you have told us that this is merely an enforcement agreement and that no changes will be made to EU acquis or the law of Member States."
"In that case, I would ask: what is then the added value of ACTA?"
"You have said that it will neither harmonise criminal sanctions nor impose any indirect obligation, in terms of the 'three strikes' policy."
"However, we are standing here, talking yet again about the content of this draft agreement and, specifically, about the points which I have mentioned."
"Yet, every day, I receive messages from concerned citizens and companies and, still, there is a general consensus among the groups in the European Parliament that this draft agreement undermines the fundamental rights of our citizens and passengers from third countries."
"I will therefore put this question to you in no uncertain terms: what will be the specific benefits of adopting ACTA?"
"Do, please, persuade us that this text from 2 October is a positive and necessary thing."
"I also have a very specific question for you, Commissioner: when will the negotiating parties meet again to discuss ACTA?"
"Which parties have failed to agree to it?"
"Why was that?"
"One question after another, Commissioner."
"Once again, we have been told that the finishing touches have not yet been added to the agreement."
"How can we agree to an agreement that is being negotiated in backrooms?"
"Mr President, yesterday, the Commission adopted a strategy to mainstream the legally binding EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"As liberals, we proposed this, so this is music to my ears."
"Today, the Commission posted information on ACTA after the end of the last negotiations three weeks ago."
"The site has a paragraph called 'positive aspects of ACTA', but there are also some questions that might be labelled otherwise."
"Firstly, do trade agreements or law enforcement treaties - which I think ACTA really is - also fall under the mainstreaming of fundamental rights?"
"Will the Commission do an assessment?"
"Secondly, is the Commission willing to go back to the negotiating table if fundamental rights are at risk through ACTA?"
"Will the Commission wait to finalise the negotiations to take the Parliament's resolution of early next year into real account?"
"As far as I know, no country has put its initials on a single page of ACTA."
"When it comes to the Internet, ACTA even breaks new ground, the statement reads."
"The preamble states that ACTA seeks 'to promote cooperation between service providers and rights holders'."
"Article 2.18.3 goes on: 'each party shall endeavour to promote cooperative efforts within the business community to effectively copyright infringements."
"This implies extra-judicial measures and challenges the division of power'."
"Article 2.18.4 states that the competent authority, not necessarily judicial, should have the power 'to order an online provider to disclose expeditiously to a rights holder information sufficient to identify a subscriber whose account was allegedly used for infringement'."
"Besides pointing to the word 'allegedly', I would like to stress that Internet service providers are concerned that they will have to start enforcing the law."
"So, some room needs to be made under the heading 'negative aspects of ACTA' to assess the fundamental rights aspect that ACTA still has in the current draft and that the Commission from now on is legally obliged to mainstream."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, since the text of the ACTA agreement has become available, we find that it gives rise to far more questions than answers."
"This is partly due to the very unclear and vague legal terminology used in places, which seems to rule nothing out and everything in."
"Let me just touch on one key issue here, which is the call for cooperation between service providers and rights holders in implementing rights."
"Are we to take this to mean that, for example, Warner Brothers would work together with ISPs almost like deputy sheriffs?"
"How would this work in detail?"
"Would it mean streaming the Internet in order to identify violations?"
"This confusion stems from the fact that, for example, the term 'private use or commercial use' is not adequately defined and a common definition has not been found."
"I believe this to be an extremely problematic issue because it entails the privatisation of legal rights."
"As has already been mentioned, yesterday, the Commission gave an undertaking that there will be an impact assessment in relation to civil rights in any new provisions."
"When can we expect this impact assessment in relation to the ACTA agreement?"
"What can we expect from this assessment and when will we actually be able to read it?"
"This is decisive in enabling us to evaluate this agreement."
"Mr President, we as a Union have been floundering in the dark in meeting the challenges that have been posed in this new Internet age."
"Of course, we are not alone and many of our partner nations are in the same position, but we have all got to come together and work towards harmonisation of anti-counterfeiting enforcement."
"The protection of copyright is imperative, but a balance has to be struck to ensure that freedom of expression and innovation are not inhibited."
"We are keen to ensure that the balance reached in the Gallo report is properly recognised in the agreement to encourage growth, competitiveness and innovation to flourish, whilst providing necessary protections for rights holders."
"There is no one-size-fits-all approach in the enforcement, or approach to enforcement, in the agreement."
"Flexibility for our Member States is recognised; we support that."
"ACTA, as the Commissioner said, is a good first step to tackling counterfeit groups and piracy on the Internet and wider afield."
"For the EU, we expect a detailed copyright proposal and a thorough impact assessment which the European Parliament will review, analyse and scrutinise on behalf of our citizens."
"(SV) ACTA, or the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement as it stands for, is, of course, highly controversial."
"It has been highly controversial here in the European Parliament, but also in Sweden, which I represent."
"I have been very critical, particularly towards much of what I have seen as secretiveness; the fact that texts have been kept secret, among other things."
"This has created a feeling and an atmosphere in which myths surrounding the agreement could thrive."
"The most stubborn of all seems to be the myth that, as a consequence of ACTA, customs will start to inspect ipods and computers."
"I heard this most recently here in plenary today."
"However, now that we have all of the texts and everything is on the table, I can see that it was wrong and just a myth."
"I believe that if Shakespeare had written a play about the debate surrounding ACTA, he would have named this one 'Much Ado about Nothing', too."
"The Commission has promised that ACTA will not change anything in EU legislation and, on reading this, I understand the same."
"The fact that there will be no changes to legislation means that there will be no changes to citizen's everyday lives and this will not change citizen's involvement with the Internet, for example."
"However, it does not mean that ACTA is not important or that it is unnecessary, as someone said here in this Chamber."
"On the contrary, ACTA will create a global gold standard for the protection of intellectual property."
"This is important and it is in the interests of both Sweden and Europe."
"It will reduce the number of conflicts and, if there is something that I hear when I meet Swedish companies, it is, above all, the need to protect patents and the intellectual property rights that they have."
"This is good, particularly outside Europe."
"I feel reassured and confident now that I have read the negotiation documents that we have received."
"I am certain that citizens will feel that way, too."
"This means that I feel quite confident ahead of the continued debating of this matter in the European Parliament."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, as initiator of the written declaration on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) along with my fellow Members, Mr Lambrinidis, Mrs Roithová and Mr Alvaro, I should first of all like to thank you for the efforts you have made to secure transparency and consensus, particularly in recent weeks."
"For the moment, my thanks will stop there, because this text remains highly ambiguous on key issues."
"Firstly, you say, Commissioner, that this text will not change the EU acquis, but what about the new criminal sanctions for the crime of aiding and abetting copyright infringements, which, however, you wish to distinguish from counterfeiting?"
"How can we not think of what is happening in France with the threat of the Hadopi law and potential sanctions against the neutrality of technical intermediaries."
"The fact that this text was negotiated by the Council places it outside the Commission's scope of negotiation and therefore, perhaps, of the EU acquis."
"Secondly, it would seem that the ACTA committee has the possibility of integrating amendments into texts."
"You will therefore understand our concern at the prospect of adopting a text that might be amended."
"Once again, Commissioner, it is difficult for us to present the future ACTA Secretariat with a blank cheque and the reservations we will formulate on the interpretation of the text when we vote on the resolution will dictate our position on the ratification of this text."
"Mr President, on 10 March this year, this House adopted, by an overwhelming majority, a resolution saying, among other things, that the agreement should not make it possible for any so-called three-strike procedures to be imposed."
"This is because we do not want Internet service providers (ISPs) to start acting as private police forces and be forced to take on that role."
"The Commission has repeatedly said in various oral statements that this is not the case."
"I welcome those statements."
"However, when you look at the text, it is already in the preamble, 'desiring to promote cooperation between service providers and rights holders with respect to relevant infringements in the digital environment'."
"Then, in Article 2.18.3, as Mrs Schaake quoted, 'shall endeavour to promote cooperative efforts within the business community to effectively address corporate infringements'."
"If this does not mean three strikes, what does it mean?"
"It is all very well to talk about cooperation between rights holders and ISPs but what are the ISPs supposed to do?"
"If they do not want to do it, what measures will be taken against the ISPs?"
"I am very concerned that the language in this agreement - as Mrs Castex was saying -is so ambiguous that it is not really clear what it means."
"I still have the basic concerns that have been with us all along, and I would very much like to see a proper evaluation of the fundamental rights aspects of this agreement."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, of course, the attempt to reach good international agreements is very praiseworthy and I freely admit that this is a far from easy task."
"Nonetheless, when considering such agreements, at some point we must stop and ask: who will benefit and who will suffer as a result?"
"I get the feeling that in fact, it benefits just a few people who want to make a fat profit and who have little interest in upholding human rights, freedom of information, etc. and that it actually harms far more people than it genuinely benefits."
"I am still not clear about the actual situation with regard to generics."
"Admittedly, there is not a lot that can be achieved through criminal penalties."
"However, we know that civil actions and the associated major compensation claims, etc. can inflict far more damage than criminal proceedings."
"Then the question of trademark protection versus origin markings arises."
"We have just had a discussion where it was stated that origin markings are gaining increasing importance and offer opportunities beyond the ambit of trademark protection."
"However, everything seems to have got hung up on the issue of trademark protection."
"The idea of using Internet providers as a de facto private police force, something that has already been mentioned by other Members of the House, is a concept that I utterly reject."
"Who is going to control the providers?"
"There is no duty to provide information and no data protection, as should really be the case with public bodies."
"These are all things that give me cause for concern."
"Furthermore, I do not know what these impact assessments will achieve in terms of human rights and, above all, what the Commission will do if this House forms the impression that this is a watered-down solution and refuses to endorse it."
"(NL) Mr President, I can well imagine that the main purpose of this agreement might be to prevent the counterfeiting of handbags and watches."
"However, an agreement which states that the business community must cooperate in order to combat copyright infringement, now that is where it seems to me that things start to get a bit more complicated."
"If I may return to the subject of handbags, I take it that a tanner might have to ask a manufacturer of zips and buckles to check the identity of the people that are buying those bags?"
"Are we, as authorities, then going to impose such a policing task on those kinds of companies?"
"Now, that would be an ill-advised development and you have not given us any clarification of this point in your proposal."
"I have heard you say, Mr De Gucht, that you fear that, if we drop patents from ACTA, we will have the pharmaceutical industry on our backs."
"I have a different fear, because ambiguities still exist as regards patents and border controls."
"That is not to say that something as embarrassing as the seizing of anti-HIV drugs in the port of Rotterdam will not happen again."
"Put our minds at ease, Mr De Gucht, and test ACTA against fundamental rights."
"Yesterday, your Commission published a strategy to that effect."
"Reassure us that people in developing countries have a right to healthcare."
"Reassure us that Internet users will not be pried on by commercial companies and that their freedom will not be limited."
"(SK) The ever-growing number of counterfeit and pirated products on the international market increases the possibility of a threat to the sustainable development of the world economy, and undoubtedly also brings financial losses to the original manufacturers as well as infringing on the intellectual property of authors and subjects involved in manufacturing and production."
"It also clearly presents a risk to consumers and is the cause of job losses in Europe."
"The idea of a multilateral agreement to combat piracy and counterfeiting may be an effective mechanism for curbing such activities."
"However, I join my colleagues in emphasising the need for transparency and better credibility in any such negotiations and agreements."
"I consider it equally essential that a balance be struck between the rights we are interested in protecting and the rights that are essential in society."
"The enforcement or protection of the rights of some must not encroach on the rights and justified interests of others."
"I refer, in particular, to the provisions of the agreement which intend to criminalise completely harmless ordinary users but will not penalise the big players."
"It seems absurd to me that during border controls, technical equipment containing audio and video recordings for personal use may be confiscated."
"In our legal tradition, copying for personal use without commercial purposes is common and not illegal."
"Commissioner, why should a student, for example, be unable to make a copy of a book he needs for school?"
"Once again, I stress that we need to give the green light to acceptable copyright protection."
"However, behind the current version of ACTA is the work of the lobbyists of US recording companies who, in their pursuit of profit, intend to terrorise and criminalise a large part of our society, and the citizens of the Member States of the European Union in particular."
"I consider the astronomical fines, inappropriate checks, negotiations on the agreement behind closed doors, and so on disproportionate."
"Therefore, I would like to ask the European Commission to resist the enormous pressure from the lobbyists and prepare a rational and well-balanced alternative to the current version of ACTA."
"(CS) Through our written statement, we were striving for transparency in negotiating ACTA, and an assurance about protection of personal data and the EU acquis."
"I am pleased that the draft agreements have finally been published and that most of the problems that we criticised have disappeared from the agreement."
"However, it would be a failure for the Union if, for example, protection for geographical indications were cut back; for example, if non-European countries were not required to protect Karlovy Vary waffles, or the aforementioned champagne, throughout their territory."
"It is not enough merely to control the borders."
"I ask the Commissioner for clarification on this."
"However, I also have doubts about the effectiveness of the agreement given that the biggest global counterfeiters from Asia are not parties to it, which, in addition, may cause trouble for entrepreneurs and consumers when implementing the agreement."
"Finally, I would ask the Commissioner or the Commission to present to us a detailed analysis of the impact of ACTA on the European Union."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, there have been several interventions claiming that the implementation of ACTA would lead to limiting civil liberties, and several pointed out the control of laptops, or of air passengers at borders, for example."
"The joint declaration of 16 April issued by all the ACTA parties is quite clear."
"There is no proposal to force ACTA participants to require border authorities to search travellers' baggage or their personal electronic devices for infringing materials."
"ACTA is about tackling large-scale, illegal activity and pursuing criminal organisations."
"It is not about limiting civil liberties or harassing consumers."
"ACTA will be in line with the current EU regime for enforcement of IPRs, which fully respect fundamental rights and freedoms and civil liberties, such as the protection of personal data."
"One example is the di minimis clause in the 2003 EU customs regulation that exempts travellers from checks if the infringing goods are not part of large-scale traffic."
"EU customs, frequently confronted with drug trafficking, weapons or people, have neither the time nor the legal basis to look for a couple of pirated songs on an iPod or laptop computer, and we have no intention of changing this."
"We will not change this, and we will ensure that ACTA parties can continue to apply such an exemption."
"However, we cannot impose the de minimis exemption as an absolute obligation, because some Member States acting under national rules have kept the authority to carry out certain controls of passengers."
"Reference has been made again to the three-strike law or the HADOPI law in France which makes this possible."
"However, this is a national rule and the European Union does not have the authority to make a national state change this."
"Several have also been asking for an impact assessment on fundamental rights, an impact study on privacy and an impact study on the acquis communautaire."
"I have made several statements in this plenary that there has been no infringement whatsoever of fundamental rights or the acquis communautaire in any way, and I must say that in the three debates that we have already had in this plenary, none of you has given an example of problems related to fundamental liberties."
"Nobody has pointed to an infringement of the acquis communautaire."
"Nobody has been able to give an example."
"If you give us examples, we will look into them."
"As for negotiating behind closed doors, Parliament has been asking for more transparency on the ACTA negotiations."
"It is the Commission that has made sure that this happens; that you have the text before you that was negotiated in Tokyo, and that you got it a couple of days after it was finalised."
"You have it also with the reserves that still exist; three on the part of the European Union, three on the part of the United States."
"You have the result of the negotiations."
"How can you say that this has happened behind closed doors?"
"The question has been put to the Ombudsman."
"Maybe you do not trust me."
"I am the Commission."
"Maybe you do not trust the Council."
"Maybe you do not trust your governments."
"I have detected from a lot of speeches here that your trust in national governments is not very deep, but I think you at least trust the Ombudsman."
"The Ombudsman has said very clearly that we can keep documents confidential, and what we have been doing is making a large additional step in the direction of transparency."
"You would expect that when you do that, you would be applauded."
"At least there would be some consideration for the fact, but some of you simply continue to say that we negotiate behind closed doors and that there is no transparency."
"So what is the use in making an effort to have more transparency if afterwards, you still continue to say that there is no transparency?"
"Maybe I would be better investing my time in something else."
"As regards the possibility of the European Commission agreeing on a final text: in the Lisbon Treaty, there are, in fact, very clear rules on how international agreements are negotiated, by whom and how they are concluded and ratified, including the important role of the European Parliament."
"There are also clear rules in the framework agreement as to how Parliament must be informed and heard during the negotiating process."
"I think we have respected these rules scrupulously."
"It is the Commission's prerogative, as a negotiator, to determine the point at which negotiations are technically finalised and at which the agreement can be initialled."
"The agreement is not yet initialled and you have the possibility tonight to make your remarks before we even do the initialling and before we even decide to initial the agreement as such."
"We have not yet made a decision in the Commission on what we are actually going to do, because we still have a couple of reserves that we want to settle with the United States before making up our minds."
"The initialling of the agreement is part of the Commission's prerogatives and it does not definitely bind the Union."
"The agreement will become definitive once the European Parliament has given its consent."
"So let us respect the treaty and let us respect the framework agreements."
"In the meantime, we will continue to inform and engage with you as stipulated in the framework agreement."
"By the way, according to the treaty, it is the Council which authorises the signature of the agreements, but Parliament always has the last word."
"It has to ratify this agreement and if consent is refused, there is simply no agreement at all."
"So be a little bit patient."
"There is no initialling yet."
"Once there is initialling, you have the translation, you have the check by the lawyer-linguists, and then it comes to the Council for signature and to Parliament for ratification."
"So no decision whatsoever has been taken at this moment in time, and you have another possibility tonight to make known all the comments that you have on your mind."
"Some have also been asking how the EU would benefit by entering into such an agreement if it will go no further than its current laws and if, furthermore, other countries like the US also claim that it will not change domestic law."
"This is not about substantive law."
"This agreement is about the enforcement of existing law, and that is why I have repeatedly stipulated that we are not going to change the acquis communautaire."
"The acquis communautaire is about substantive law and we are not changing that."
"An international treaty that would adopt standards similar to those of the EU, but also to those already in place in countries like the US or Japan, would still be a most valuable contribution to the current prevailing international standard as defined by the WTO TRIPS agreement."
"Our goal is to promote ACTA standards to key emerging partners, namely through our future trade agreements, but also in multilateral venues."
"That being said, several ACTA parties have taken the momentum created by the ACTA negotiations to revise their domestic legislation along the agreed lines."
"As far as I am aware, for instance, both Japan and Canada are in the process of reviewing their Internet enforcement regimes."
"Moreover, it is often overlooked that ACTA is not only about improved legal standards."
"It is also about cooperation between enforcement authorities, the adoption of best practices or the better coordination of technical assistance."
"Although the EU has had very successful cooperation with the US in these areas for the last four to five years, we believe that ACTA can also improve those important aspects of the fight against IPR infringements."
"We consider that the US enforcement system is generally effective and efficient in the protection of certain intellectual property rights."
"The Commission has stressed that ACTA is not a disguised means to circumvent their domestic legislative process and to devise their current laws and so has Parliament."
"It is understandable that US officials stress the same line."
"Let me add that the principle of cooperation between rightholders is already in Article 15 of the e-Commerce Directive since 2003, so this is not a new concept."
"It is in the e-Commerce Directive and we are simply referring to that."
"We are referring to the existing EU law."
"Let me further say that what is often overlooked in the debate on ACTA are the number of jobs of EU citizens that relate to intellectual property rights and we often discuss jobs on all sides of the House."
"Millions of jobs in Europe depend on respect for intellectual property rights."
"Counterfeiting is a serious attack on European industry and on the European economy and on European innovation, because we are an innovation-based economy."
"What we are really talking about is jobs."
"And I must say that I am a little bit surprised that in the three discussions that we have now had in this plenary, this has never in fact been mentioned."
"This reference to jobs has never been made."
"The references that are made are to fundamental rights and I am very sensitive to that, but without any confirmative example."
"The reference is made to controls at the borders where it is clear that ACTA adds nothing to what already exists."
"There is a reference to privacy and I see no reason why privacy would be under attack."
"There are references to a kind of nebulous liberty and liberties that you think are under attack, but you do not give any examples of that."
"On the other hand, what is very clear, and what is documented in all kinds of impact studies that have already been done by the way by the Commission, on all kinds of items, is that a lot of our jobs are linked to intellectual property rights and that is one of the reasons we attach such importance to that topic."
"I am a little bit surprised that this is very rarely mentioned by Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the next part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I wish to welcome the progress which has been made in the ACTA negotiations."
"This agreement is an absolute necessity for establishing common international standards on the enforcement of intellectual property legislation."
"However, I must point out that sanction measures against intellectual property infringements must comply with the principle of proportionality and balance between the gravity of the acts committed and the sanctions applied."
"In this case, I am referring, in particular, to intellectual property infringements in the digital media and Internet where a clear difference ought to be made in terms of treatment between large-scale piracy for commercial purposes and isolated, random cases of intellectual fraud."
"Furthermore, regardless of the seriousness of the offences committed, the agreement should focus particular attention on protecting freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and confidentiality."
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting opened at 9.00)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the night of 18 October the town of Paola, the birthplace of Saint Francis, was hit by a violent rainstorm affecting the whole of Calabria: huge damage was caused to public buildings, private homes, water and sewage networks, and electricity and telephone networks, not to mention landslips and mudslides."
"Many families have had to leave their homes, and schools have remained closed."
"Episodes such as this have been occurring in Calabria for a long time now, possibly due to the effects of climate change."
"A state of natural disaster will be declared shortly, and we hope that the European Solidarity Fund can be activated."
"I would like to express my solidarity - which I hope is shared by this House - with the entire population, including that of the neighbouring towns that have suffered damage."
"Of course, we are taking good note of the information you have provided us with."
"We would like to express our solidarity and our concern about the disaster that has hit Calabria and, naturally, all the members of this Parliament declare their support to those affected in that beautiful region of Italy and Europe."
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Implemented reforms and developments in the Republic of Moldova (debate)"
"The first item is the Commission statement on implemented reforms and developments in the Republic of Moldova."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, when looking at EU-Moldova relations, I believe it is uncontroversial that we have achieved a lot of progress in record time, but domestically the country still faces many challenges."
"The referendum of 5 September was meant to resolve the political deadlock by changing the rules for electing the President."
"It failed. That is regrettable."
"However, whether the referendum would comply with democratic standards was also an important question. Crucially, its effective compliance has been confirmed by the international observers."
"This is an encouraging sign."
"The elections of 28 November are equally important for the consolidation of democracy in the country."
"We will continue sending firm messages in that respect to all stakeholders."
"Thereafter, all political forces will have to work together, both to elect a President and to choose a government capable of taking the country through a critical reform path."
"At the same time, we will sustain our unwavering support to the structural reforms conducted by the Moldovan Government."
"Let me highlight a few important aspects."
"The European Union is not only by far the largest donor to Moldova, but in March also succeeded in mobilising over forty donors to support Moldova's reforms."
"They pledged an impressive EUR 1.9 billion for the years 2010-2013, including our own EUR 550 million commitment."
"Over the last months, we have provided timely responses to a number of the government's specific needs: providing high-level policy advice to ministers; supporting democratisation efforts in rule-of-law related areas; helping organise the electoral consultations; addressing emergency needs after last summer's floods; and improving possibilities for Moldovan wine exports."
"Alongside the Moldovan government, we have actively engaged with the population living in the Transnistrian region via small-scale projects, mostly in the social area."
"Next year, we will start implementing the Comprehensive Institution-Building programme under the Eastern Partnership."
"That programme will help Moldova prepare for, and implement, the Association Agreement that we are currently negotiating."
"The latest round of negotiations in Chisinau on 13 and 14 October demonstrated yet again that these negotiations are progressing at a very good speed."
"Our assistance has also taken the form of direct transfers to the Moldovan budget."
"Since the last quarter of 2009, EUR 37 million has been disbursed as sectoral budget support, with an additional EUR 15 million to come soon."
"Out of this, about EUR 8.5 million was directly allocated to help the poorest strata of the population."
"Now that President Buzek has signed the relevant legislative decision, we expect to disburse soon the EUR 40 million of the first tranche of macro-financial assistance."
"In the same spirit, we will carry on our busy schedule of political contacts and technical exchanges."
"In a few days, I will meet with Prime Minister Filat, in Luxembourg."
"In November, the EU-Moldova trade sub-committee will examine Moldova's response to the Commission's key recommendations in view of preparing negotiations on a deep and comprehensive free trade area."
"Additionally, we have engaged with Moldova in a dedicated Dialogue on Human Rights and in an energy dialogue, and are negotiating an aviation services agreement."
"We have actively followed up on the visa dialogue launched in June."
"Next Monday, drawing on the outcome of the fact-finding missions conducted in September by independent experts, the Foreign Affairs Council is expected to release conclusions that should address this issue."
"The purpose of this debate is for us to discuss the reforms carried out by the Republic of Moldova during the last year and the progress made on the path to European integration."
"This country has been on the European Union's agenda for a year because it has met its commitments."
"I would like to mention some of those commitments."
"A plan has been drawn up with priority measures to be carried out in essential areas of reform, along with another plan for justice reform."
"Implementation of both plans has started."
"Dialogue on human rights has been initiated."
"In addition, the parliament of the Republic of Moldova ratified the Statute of the International Criminal Court in September."
"Intensive negotiations are being conducted on the Association Agreement, with excellent results."
"Only a year has gone by, but those involved in starting the process guarantee that it will continue."
"The Republic of Moldova is the state which has made the furthest progress within the EU's Eastern Partnership."
"This is why I am asking the Council to assess this state individually on its own merits."
"Progress signifies political will, hard work and dedication, which need to be rewarded."
"We rewarded the Western Balkans for the measures they have taken."
"Let us go ahead and do the same for the Republic of Moldova too."
"In the dialogue on visas Moldova has made great progress in all four areas."
"This is why I am asking the Council at the next session on 25 October to invite the Commission to draw up an action plan so that citizens from the Republic of Moldova can travel without requiring visas."
"Direct contact between people is worth more than any declaration."
"In the case of the Transnistria region, a solution is vital for the political and economic stability of the Republic Moldova and this region."
"The EU must play a stronger role at a political level and we must be involved through joint projects making changes which people can see."
"Finally, the European integration process has helped build democracy and freedom at an unprecedented rate in European history."
"Let us look in Central and Eastern Europe at how the situation has changed in the last 20 years."
"Peace now reigns in the Western Balkans too and reforms are under way."
"Let us do what is necessary to achieve the same situation in the Republic of Moldova as well."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, the Republic of Moldova has a single option - between 'Transnistrialisation' and 'Europeanisation'. That is to say between an oligarchic past of a Soviet nature and a future of security, prosperity and social justice."
"Moldova's development has so far been negatively influenced by its internal political instability."
"The fundamental problem of the Republic of Moldova is not linked to the external challenges it faces, but to the internal division among political forces."
"That internal political instability has denied the ruling coalition the time to implement its pro-European options."
"Moldova now faces a turning point."
"The outcome of this early election should aim to lead the country towards a future of European modernisation."
"Therefore, we call on all political forces in Moldova that are proposing a future of European modernisation for the country to avoid any unnecessary protagonism or confrontation, and to concentrate on developing a broad vision with the aim of directing the country towards achieving its European goals."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, eighteen months ago this House was shocked by the brutality of the events in Chisinau."
"A few weeks later, we had the great pleasure of welcoming here in our gallery the leaders of the democratic political parties from that country, embarked on a new path."
"We shared the enthusiasm of Moldova's people for a new future."
"We have been pleased to note since then the progress that country has made."
"There is still much progress to be made - not least in bringing to justice the perpetrators of those brutal events - but, if Moldova returns to office the current coalition in the elections next month, there is a good chance that, despite the difficulties of the economic recession, the country can complete its transformation."
"The British writer, Francis Bacon, observed that hope makes a very good breakfast but a rather poor supper."
"Moldova's governing parties should be in no doubt that implementation of reforms must follow the legal acts which permit such reforms."
"Time is not on our side."
"There is much to be done very soon."
"My group commends Commissioner Füle and his services for the work they have done to assist Moldova."
"We welcome the formation of the Friends of Moldova and the superb meeting of European countries which took place to help Moldova to move forward."
"Every effort is being made on the European Union's side to help this desperately poor country move towards European standards."
"I hope that when the Council looks at the visa regime next week it will help us to find a way forward on the visa issue."
"As one of our founding fathers said, a country's European vocation is determined not by the European Union but by the European spirit of its people."
"We urge the people of Moldova to show that European spirit in the elections next month."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, we welcome the progress made by the Republic of Moldova and hope that the forthcoming electoral process can further consolidate the democratic institutions and ensure respect for the rule of law and of human rights in Moldova."
"We know that there is broad support for Moldova's future EU membership - not NATO membership - within Moldovan society."
"In spite of their different political platforms, all parties represented in the Moldovan Parliament declare that they are for European cooperation and integration as well."
"But, taking into account my own country of Latvia's experience of EU membership, I have tried to explain during my conversations with Moldovan politicians that EU membership cannot be an end in itself."
"It is very important to step up efforts to implement deep and consistent economic and judicial reforms, notably through the fight against corruption."
"Moldovan society is multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic; moreover, essential differences exist in relation to the assessment of historical events."
"It is therefore quite dangerous to create additional dividing lines within Moldovan society."
"In my opinion, a recent decree establishing 28 June as Soviet Occupation Day, which triggered a negative reaction on the part of a large number of Moldovan residents, did not consolidate society but had just the opposite effect."
"Moldovan society also varies according to the nationality held by its residents."
"The large proportion of residents having dual citizenship creates additional differences in respect of rights as well, and so we have to make every effort to abolish these differences and to provide a visa-free regime for all Moldovans."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, no one is disputing that Moldova has a long way to go before it achieves its ultimate goal of joining the European Union, which is a goal that my group, the ECR, supports."
"It remains one of Europe's poorest countries, despite being in the WTO, and, as such, is vulnerable to organised crime, human trafficking and corruption."
"Moldova remains hamstrung by the ongoing frozen conflict with the Russian-speaking and politically Russian- dominated breakaway region of Transnistria."
"However, since the Communists were ousted from power 15 months ago, Moldova has begun to make substantial progress."
"The parties in the Alliance for European Integration, the current ruling coalition, have shown an impressive capacity to work together to accelerate Moldova's integration with the European Union."
"For its part, the Union should maintain pressure on the Moldovan Government for further progress in economic reforms and, in particular, improving the rule of law and good governance."
"But we should also reward and engage more with Chisinau."
"The visa issue has been mentioned, but I would also like to raise the issue of Euronest, which offers opportunities for EU and Moldovan politicians alike to debate common interests."
"Sadly, Euronest - which was something which appeared in my report in the previous parliament - remains paralysed because of the dispute over Belarus representation, as our Parliament does not recognise its parliament, which was not democratically elected."
"I hope that one day all clearly European countries in the Eastern Partnership, namely Moldova, Ukraine and a future democratic Belarus, will become EU candidates."
"Mr President, this debate demonstrates Europe's commitment to the divided Republic of Moldova, and I am extremely pleased about that."
"In my country, the Netherlands, citizens have for many years been developing some inspiring social initiatives offering young people from Moldova genuine prospects."
"In this context I would also like to mention with pride the Orhei Foundation in Bunschoten-Spakenburg, a village which tackles such things with great vigour."
"I can look the people of this Foundation in the eye because we are also talking about this issue here, demonstrating commitment."
"Incidentally, Moldova is seeking an in-depth, comprehensive trade agreement with the European Union. Commissioner Füle also mentions this."
"Commissioner, what is the situation with regard to this, and has any genuine progress been made yet?"
"A broadening of the sales opportunities for Moldovan products, particularly agricultural products and wines from Chişinău, is vital, since Moldova's main traditional sales market, Russia, regularly closes and restricts its borders for political reasons."
"Commissioner, you have already mentioned this, but is there any way in which the European Union can offer comfort in response to this need on the part of Moldova?"
"Finally, a question about the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's 'Meseberg initiative'."
"Is Russia now genuinely committed to finding a solution to the Transnistria question in exchange for enhanced political dialogue between the EU and Russia?"
"I am hearing noises indicating that the Kremlin is not taking any action for the time being."
"Commissioner, I would in particular like to wish you much success and perseverance in your efforts to bring Moldova closer to Europe."
"Mr President, there is ample proof that Moldova's commitment to European values and standards is genuine and effective."
"Moldova is actually the best example of implementing pro-European policies among our Eastern neighbours."
"In actual fact, Moldova's euro-credentials make it fully compatible with Western Balkan states."
"The positive precedent set by Moldova should be acknowledged and encouraged."
"The deterioration of democratic institutions in neighbouring Ukraine increases the importance of Moldova for the EU's policies on its eastern flank."
"In this context, it is vital that the general elections on 28 November confirm Moldova's continued drive towards European integration."
"It is indeed high time for the EU to send a positive signal to Moldova and the Moldovans."
"Thousands of Moldovan families are divided by a visa barrier."
"The EU-Moldova visa dialogue presents us with a huge opportunity."
"This dialogue should enter an operational phase."
"Let us hope that the Foreign Affairs Council on 25 October will invite the Commission to draw up an action plan for visa liberalisation."
"A pro-European, integrated Moldova would have a beneficial effect on the EU's eastern frontier, where weak governance and unsolved conflicts are a continuous threat to European stability."
"(BG) The challenges Moldova is currently facing, which are also part of our overall objective, include strengthening the multi-ethnic state, its identity, the political settlement of the Transnistrian problem and Moldova's membership of the European Union as an autonomous, independent state."
"The visa liberalisation process is particularly important."
"As we have seen in similar cases for the countries of former Yugoslavia, it delivers good results."
"The tendency to use a fast-track procedure for issuing Bulgarian and Romanian passports simultaneously to Moldovan citizens is not a solution to this problem and entails certain risks."
"At the same time, the authorities in Chişinau must ensure that the benefit of the EUR 90 million in macro-financial assistance which the European Union is granting will be felt by all Moldovan citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin."
"This is especially important for the Bulgarian minority in Moldova as well, which lives in one of the poorest economic regions in the country."
"(RO) As a member of the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee Delegation, it has been a pleasure for me to follow Moldova's positive progress and I can confirm that the Republic of Moldova's commitment to the European path has been very clearly demonstrated during the last year."
"I would like to remind you at this point of the reforms made to the economy, justice system and public administration."
"At the same time, we must be realistic and acknowledge that the transition process in Moldova is not easy and many reforms are still to be implemented."
"I am pleased that progress is being made in the discussions aimed at visa liberalisation."
"However, I think that we need the Commission to establish a clear road map for achieving this objective and, why not, for getting rid of visas in the future altogether."
"The Republic of Moldova will have a crucial test to get through during the parliamentary elections on 28 November and I hope that the European path which the country has committed to will be approved by the population and continue."
"Macro-financial and political assistance from European institutions and some Member States has been of paramount importance."
"Given the positive results from our policy, I ask Europe's institutions - Parliament, the Council and the European Commission - to continue their actions in support of Moldova in order to give Moldova confidence and encourage it to continue along the path of reform and rapprochement with the European Union so that it can ultimately become integrated as a full member."
"(PL) Ten days ago, I had the opportunity to visit Moldova as part of a special delegation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs with, amongst others, fellow Members Mrs Macovei and Mr Watson."
"We were in Moldova at an extremely important moment for the country - several weeks after the unsuccessful constitutional referendum of 5 September and also several weeks before very important parliamentary elections, which, as you know, will be held on 28 November."
"Above all, what we saw was the very large support of the nation and Moldavian society for the process of European integration."
"Nearly three quarters of Moldavians support this process."
"We also saw the huge progress which has been made by the government of Prime Minister Filat on the road to European integration and the many reforms, including significant progress in the fight against corruption which had previously been eating away at the country."
"Of course, problems do exist: problems resulting from the economic crisis and problems resulting from the as yet unresolved situation in Transnistria."
"However, in order for the process of reforms to be continued after 28 November, a clear signal from the European Union is needed, so I am hoping that the forthcoming Council summit will manage to push through the visa liberalisation process."
"(RO) I too would like to thank all those who have made this debate possible."
"It is our duty to look towards the Republic of Moldova with a sense of great responsibility, especially now with the elections approaching."
"The government of the Alliance for European Integration has shown through the special effort it has made that it is ready to launch an extensive process of political, economic and institutional reforms, thereby leading the way in this area within the Eastern Partnership."
"This is taking place after eight years of Communist government when basic rights such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to fair justice were seriously violated."
"The reform process in the Republic of Moldova must continue predominantly in the area of justice and internal affairs."
"An effective battle must be waged against corruption, and freedom of justice guaranteed."
"At the same time, safe and humane detention must be ensured so that fundamental human rights are respected."
"The Republic of Moldova has been going through a political crisis for well over 18 months now, with the failure of the presidential election and the validation of the referendum."
"I believe that the forthcoming elections on 28 November are a huge gamble for Moldova's path towards Europe."
"Democracy is once again going through a difficult test."
"I wish to state with full responsibility that a failure for democracy in the Republic of Moldova at the forthcoming elections will also mark, to a small extent, a failure for the EU's policy in this country."
"We need to have in the immediate vicinity of the EU a partner which assumes the values we share."
"I wish to end by emphasising that the language spoken by the Republic of Moldova's citizens is now an official language of the European Union."
"This is also another reason why it should receive our support."
"(BG) I am pleased that the European Parliament is devoting its time to discussing the situation in Moldova, a country which is essentially European."
"In this respect, we must say that the ruling Coalition for European Integration actually contributed a great deal to the process of bringing Moldova closer to the European Union and it must be given great credit for this."
"At the same time, its citizens expect more results in the areas of the economy and social development."
"It is no coincidence that this is also turning into the key issue in the current campaign."
"Establishing relations with the European Union is not a one-off event."
"It is a long-term process and Moldova's path towards rapprochement must become an irreversible policy."
"Failure to amend the constitution led to this state of political instability, which is at risk of being repeated after the present elections."
"This is why I am making an appeal to the leading political forces, irrespective of differences and the election result, to do what is required to guarantee political stability in Moldova, which will give them the chance to act in the interest of their citizens and of their country's European future."
"(RO) Romanian imperialism is how Moldova's Communists describe the interest being shown and speeches being made by MPs in Romania regarding the situation in Chişinău, regardless of whether it is President Băsescu or MEPs."
"In other words, the Communists in Chişinău would like Bucharest to shut up."
"In my own view, I must say that I do not think that they are entitled to expect this."
"On the contrary, it is our duty to speak out."
"The main reason for this is that a large number of primarily European, Romanian and Bulgarian citizens, and other citizens too, live in the Republic of Moldova."
"I believe that, just like any other European citizen, those living in Moldova should also enjoy the rights which derive from their political status."
"Secondly, we must keep a very close eye on Chişinău because a coalition government there has been acting for well over a year in the name of European integration."
"It is not only about the name this coalition has."
"Certainly, if it had been called the Alliance for Russia, we would not have shown as much interest in it."
"It has been called the Alliance for European Integration, but it is not just the name that matters, but the very brave action of this government."
"Mrs Macovei and Commissioner Füle have explained what this brave action entails."
"I was in Chişinău and Tiraspol last week and I noticed that becoming European is also at stake in the election campaign which is due to start for the November elections."
"Moldova's citizens will actually decide not only between different political forces, but also between continuing and abandoning its path towards Europe."
"Let us not fool ourselves."
"I saw that even the head of the EU delegation in Chişinău is starting to fool himself."
"The Communists do not want integration."
"The Communists demonstrated a year and a few months ago what they want."
"The demonstrations in April provided very clear proof of where the interests of the Communists in Chişinău lie."
"This is why I hope that citizens will understand the message and attitudes of the parties, and that politicians themselves will also understand the wishes of the people expressed at the ballot box."
"(PL) Let us ask ourselves why we are devoting so much attention to such a small country which lies in the vicinity of the Black Sea but does not have access to it."
"Perhaps the reason we are talking about Moldova is because it is a small country where two worlds meet."
"One of these, which once symbolised the Soviet Union, is with great difficulty becoming a thing of the past."
"Moldova is a divided country."
"Part of it is under occupation and is being supported by external forces."
"I think this country deserves our support."
"It is a small country, which is home to very brave people who want to come closer to the European Union and to build a democracy."
"Commissioner, the situation with Moldova is reminiscent of the concept in physics in which it is not the force itself which is important, but the point at which it is applied."
"These millions of euro of which you spoke are not very impressive."
"It is only a small amount of money, but applied at the right point and at the right moment it can bring about the positive effect we want."
"I wish success to all those who want to build democracy in Moldova."
"I am not interested in party affiliation, but I would like Moldova to consolidate, to build a better future for itself and to become our partner in the near future."
"(SK) The progress Moldova has made so far indicates that this country could become an example of a success story of a participant in the Eastern Partnership of the European Union."
"The current pro-European government led by the Alliance for European Integration presented the citizens of Moldova with a clear and important political perspective for the future democratic progress of the country."
"However, it is also true that the internal political situation has been negatively affected by the long-lasting disagreement on constitutional reform."
"Following the unsuccessful referendum, the upcoming elections ought to overcome the impasse in the political negotiations between the parties."
"I believe that the European Union should explicitly recognise the important progress achieved by the current government in strengthening its relationship with the EU."
"On Monday 25 October, the Foreign Affairs Council is expected to issue its conclusions on Moldova."
"They should express support for the pro-European steps that have so far been taken by the current government, and most importantly, they could ask the Commission to work out an action plan as regards visa liberalisation."
"This is an important issue for the citizens of Moldova."
"Of course, the ultimate outcome will depend primarily on the election results."
"As far as the European Parliament is concerned, I believe our attitude towards Moldova should be more positive."
"We should demonstrate more clearly our support of the country's pro-European forces and show them that we care about Moldova becoming a future member of a united European family."
"We should convince them that such a future is also in their best interest."
"Mr President, Moldova has come a long way since the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact divided Europe into spheres of influence and Moldova became part of the USSR."
"Moldova today is an independent state."
"It is true that it has many problems."
"At the same time, it is a democratic country on the way to European integration, so today I would like to encourage all political classes in that country, all the democratic political forces and all the ethnic communities to avoid unnecessary confrontations and concentrate on developing a broad vision for the Republic of Moldova with the aim of directing the country towards achieving its European goals."
"Last but not least, there is Transnistria."
"Transnistria should be high on our agenda and I welcome the initiative by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and by the political leaders of some other countries to resolve this frozen conflict."
"Mr President, Moldova is the last piece of 'Latinity' outside the EU."
"History has played a big role in that."
"However, through the neighbourhood policy and Eastern Partnership, Moldova's prospects of first getting closer, and then being admitted, to the EU after fulfilling the required conditions are improving."
"The current coalition, although facing an election soon, has accelerated the pace of reforms, to which the EU has responded properly."
"Those in charge on both sides should be congratulated."
"Both the pace of internal reform and the EU response should continue to get beyond the point of no return sooner, rather than later."
"Moldova's chances depend, of course, on the solution to the Transnistrian conflict."
"In that respect, we are encouraged by the current discussions on this topic announced in Potsdam at the German-Russian summit and, supposedly, evoked at the recent trilateral summit in Deauville, capitalising on the apparent willingness of Russia to find a solution."
"Let us all keep faith and work together to bring this last piece of Latinity into the EU."
"(DE) Mr President, when we have considered the Balkans in the past, for example, when we focused on the problems of Kosovo or Bosnia, we have tended to overlook Moldova."
"The EU should long ago have taken on the role of mediator in the conflicts involving Moldova and its neighbours."
"It is regrettable that Moldova has now rejected the EU's offer of mediation in the Transnistrian conflict."
"It is no coincidence that Moldova is the poor relation in the European family."
"This is due to the country's chaotic, post-socialist economy."
"As we know, the prime industrial area in the east of Moldova has declared its independence with the support of Russia and, by doing so, has put the seal on the country's economic decline, because the economy is based solely on agriculture."
"When the citizens of Moldova go to the polls at the end of November to elect a new government, it will be important to ensure that the elections run smoothly, in order to prevent further unrest and an intensification of the conflict with Romania, for example."
"(PL) Commissioner, I had the opportunity to observe the re-elections in Moldova."
"When we talked to the representatives of the then opposition parties, we saw great desire for change."
"That change has taken place."
"The current prime minister, Mr Filat, speaking at the time as a representative of the opposition, clearly declared European aspirations."
"We spoke with great approval of the effects of his work when he was a guest here in the European Parliament."
"This has been confirmed, too, by the delegation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs which visited Moldova recently."
"The internal problems, in particular over Transnistria, and the breakup and disruption of the country, which are a symbol of the past and of division, are all very difficult issues."
"We must support the process which will allow the incorporation of Transnistria into Moldova."
"A number of problems exist there, including that of migration."
"Commissioner, every expression of support for Moldova, and here I agree with my fellow Member Mr ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, last weekend I travelled to Chişinău, in Moldova."
"I attended a convention, organised by the Minister for Culture, on Moldava's integration into Europe with particular reference to culture."
"I very much appreciated the great desire for growth, especially through a series of initiatives ranging from the construction of infrastructure and of road, electricity and every other kind of networks, to vocational training for all trades and refresher courses for other professions."
"The people of Moldova are very interested in joining Europe."
"The government is aiming in the near future for actual integration into the European Union and is working along these lines."
"It is fine for Europe to focus at the moment on ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the number of natural recipients of EU funding is currently just under half the total membership."
"As we extend membership to more and more and even poorer eastern states, the proportion of net recipients will increase to perhaps two-thirds."
"This will self-evidently be at the expense of current net contributors, but it will also be at the expense of current members that are net recipients."
"Easing visa restrictions, we are often told, has nothing to do with migration, by which they mean, of course, legal migration."
"It will have everything to do with illegal migration: the trafficking of people to work for less than the minimum wage and less than minimum working conditions."
"It will also deplete that country of people of working age who might bring the country out of poverty."
"Lastly, I would say that Moldova declared its independence in 1991 from the Soviet Union."
"Does it really wish to surrender its independence to the EU, however much it might receive in pieces of silver?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I very much appreciated this debate."
"I appreciate the timing of this debate and most of all I appreciate the overall clear unity of the message and support of this distinguished House."
"The Republic of Moldova is at a turning point in its history."
"The Commission has been active in helping the Moldovan Government achieve as much as it can of its ambitious reform programme over the last year."
"The reforms that we support reflect without any exception the broad range of objectives of the EU-Moldova action plan."
"The success of these reforms is crucial for the future of the Republic of Moldova."
"We have expressed our support of the vision of a modern and prosperous Moldova with a society reconciled and its territorial integrity restored on many occasions, and not just on 30 September when the so-called Group of Friends referred to by Mr Watson visited http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u"" ."
"There is no doubt that Europe's history has a lesson to offer here."
"The Republic of Moldova is on a positive trajectory."
"I am confident that the country will be able to reach the political compromise necessary to sustain the commitment to reforms."
"For our part, and as far as possible, we will all continue to stand by Moldova's citizens and provide the necessary external support to reforms."
"We will continue to support them to successfully pass sustainability tests through the forthcoming parliamentary elections."
"I too sincerely hope that after these elections we will see an inclusive political process in Moldova centred on a pro-European agenda, continuing with the transformation process to the benefit of Moldovan citizens and of Europe too."
"To conclude this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, Thursday 21 October 2010, at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I too welcome the progress which the European Union has made during the last year in relation to the Republic of Moldova."
"Allow me to congratulate my fellow Members who tabled this motion for a resolution."
"Romania has been committed, since the time of its accession, to championing the Republic of Moldova's cause within the EU."
"I believe that concrete proof of this initial commitment is demonstrated by the number of Romanian MEPs from various political groups who signed the resolution."
"The EUR 90 million granted to this country in macro-financial assistance was and still is the lifeline which Moldova and its citizens needed to make progress and, in particular, to meet the commitments it has made in the area of reforms, the rule of law and the fight against corruption."
"The Republic of Moldova has two major problems which have to be resolved."
"The first one is Transnistria, where European governments have to make a more specific and firmer contribution and negotiations need to be resumed."
"The second problem, which obviously depends on the democratic political forces in the Republic of Moldova which we need to encourage, is the way in which the elections will be conducted on 28 November."
"We must guarantee citizens both inside and outside de facto access to the right to vote for their central government."
"Thank you."
"Containers lost at sea and compensation (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on containers lost at sea and compensation by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism - B7-0469/2010)."
"author. - Mr President, as you said, I speak this morning on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on an issue that has been overlooked for so long, namely containers falling from ships at sea."
"It is amazing to me that, in this modern day and age, thousands of these containers go missing each year, with the great majority of them falling off the ships into our oceans."
"It is estimated that a staggering 10 000 containers are lost at sea each year."
"It would appear to us that shipping lines and insurers are quite happy to accept this figure and do nothing about it."
"In European waters, 2 000 containers a year are lost at sea, and this figure would appear to be rising year on year."
"These containers are a menace to navigation, they could pollute the seas with both toxic and non-toxic materials, and they leave local authorities with large clean-up costs."
"The Transport Committee is now demanding action to reduce this figure and is sending a signal to the maritime industry that we are not prepared to tolerate this state of affairs much longer."
"The MARIN Institute in the Netherlands found the main reasons for container stack collapses were faulty lashings, overweight containers and faulty stowage."
"In addition, crews on larger container ships have difficulty in assessing when severe loads are moving forward and/or aft due to weather conditions, which can amplify vertical acceleration in these areas beyond the vessel's actual design specifications."
"Moreover, the absence of a strict liability compensation convention for non-toxic substances leaves local government picking up the cost of the clean-up."
"Parliament is now demanding that shipping companies accept their responsibilities on this issue."
"We would like to see the Commission becoming more proactive in solving this unacceptable state of affairs."
"Today I am asking the Commission to study the results obtained by the Lashing@sea project and to come forward with proposals to improve container lashing procedures and equipment."
"Secondly, we would like to see action to ensure that all containers are correctly weighed in port and correctly stowed before a ship sets sail for sea, as well as fitting automated beacons to aid container location."
"Thirdly, we are asking the Commission to look at the compensation regime so that local and regional authorities are not left short-changed."
"Finally, I want to return to the obligations of the wider maritime industry to get their act together."
"I appreciate that containers will be lost in severe storms. What I cannot accept is that containers are lost due to shoddy workmanship, or to containers being overloaded or incorrectly stacked, or because of a laissez-faire attitude to this problem by the industry at large."
"Containers falling off ships are dangerous. Losing 20 000 of them a year is unacceptable."
"Lives are being put at risk, which is why we are demanding action."
"The maritime industry seems unwilling to act."
"Maybe we should."
"Mr President, I am grateful to Mr Simpson for raising this crucial issue which is of interest to many Members of this Parliament and also to the Commission."
"The Commission welcomes the results of the Lashing@Sea project."
"It is primarily the role of the International Maritime Organisation to tackle the issue of containers lost at sea, as this is regulated at an international level."
"The Commission will nevertheless work together with Member States to promote actions to adopt internationally agreed procedures within the structures of the International Maritime Organisation."
"On the second question of overweight and incorrectly stowed containers, there are no EU rules governing the weighing of containers before loading them on ships or procedures covering stowage or lashing."
"This matter is regulated at national level or through international agreements."
"The Commission does not plan at this stage to take a legislative initiative concerning this issue."
"However, this could change if international discussions are not successful and there are increased problems with the stability of ships, the strength of ships or losses of containers."
"Before presenting any new proposal, the Commission would need to fully assess the impact such a measure would have on shipping operators."
"Today the Commission does not have sufficient information concerning this specific matter."
"Concerning the third issue of tracking systems to locate containers at sea, this possibility could be further explored."
"However, equipping millions of containers with tracking devices would be costly and a proper assessment of the benefits must be carried out before taking a final decision to make such tracking systems mandatory."
"The Commission could also assess the feasibility of clarifying the provisions of Directive 2002/59/EC that established the Community vessel traffic monitoring system and which obliges the Member States to ensure that the master of a ship reports to responsible coastal stations any sight of containers drifting at sea."
"If the option to ensure the traceability of the containers is to be explored, the cost of such measures should be taken into account."
"However, such an option could be considered in the framework of the potential development of the traceability of the containers for logistics and security purposes."
"Finally, concerning compensation for the damage caused by lost containers; this can be addressed under Directive 2009/20/EC concerning maritime insurance, and Directive 2005/35/EC concerning maritime pollution and sanctions in the event of offences covers cases when oil-polluting substances have been dumped into the sea."
"Directive 2004/35/EC concerning environmental liability also establishes strict liability for operators who cause damage to the environment through the transportation by sea of dangerous goods or polluting goods."
"Such operators are obliged to remedy the damage caused to protected species and natural habitats."
"Additional measures to put in place a compensation regime for damages caused by lost containers would need to be closely assessed against the proportionality principle justifying EU action."
"The Commission believes that at this stage the work of the IMO to improve standards should be the priority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Simpson pointed out, several thousand containers are lost each year in European waters, and they pose a very significant risk on two counts: they pose a pollution risk, which has been widely discussed, but also, because a number of them do not sink but often float between two bodies of water in which they are difficult to locate, they pose a major risk to the safe passage of ships, whether they be cargo ships or, in particular, the smallest fishing or recreational vessels."
"The result, as we know, is serious accidents that endanger human lives."
"This is therefore an extremely serious problem, and the Commission seems to be saying that either it does not have the information to act, or it believes that, in view of the existing arrangements, certain measures must be applied."
"In reality, that is not the case: nothing whatsoever is being done about this situation."
"We therefore want real measures to be proposed."
"We want preventive measures, by which I mean measures relating to container loading and stowage methods and to the scope to build into containers - and this can be done in satisfactory economic conditions - a beacon that will enable lost containers to be located and, therefore, either avoided by vessels - thus saving human lives - or retrieved if they contain toxic substances."
"In the event that toxic or highly toxic substances are present, this beacon must also be able to emit an agreed signal to enable the environmental risk to be anticipated and contained."
"Lastly, this beacon must be of use in identifying the owners of containers, since there is a real issue of liability that has been raised in the oral question."
"Indeed, not knowing who the owners are and not being able, in fact, to identify and locate containers means that nothing can be established with regard to recovery and compensation for damage."
"We strongly urge the Commission not to just conclude that we do not have the resources or that the existing resources are sufficient, because that is not the case: there is an issue of environmental safety, but there are also lives at stake, and we must remember that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to second the comments and questions put forward by the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Simpson."
"The loss of containers - as well as their contents, of course, since we must not forget that we are also talking about that - is without doubt an underestimated and neglected problem."
"As has been said, this concerns as many as 2 000 containers a year in European waters alone, with all the consequences for the environment, consequences possibly for the crews, for other ships and for the coastal regions, which of course are fairly often left with the task of clearing up the debris."
"This is therefore an issue that we must tackle."
"There are various reasons for this problem: bad weather, speed, poor securing and stacking of containers, excessive weight, and so on."
"We should not stand back passively and wait for International Maritime Organization (IMO) measures."
"In particular, initiatives could be taken to register such incidents and raise awareness of this issue in European ports."
"In the context of the social dialogue - the European social dialogue in the port sector - the Commission could also broach the subject and propose solutions such as new procedures for loading containers or modified training."
"Mr Riquet has emphasised, and I too believe, that it is very wise to ensure that containers are traceable: not only in this context but also in the context of monitoring the entire logistics chain."
"Commissioner, I therefore expect some slightly more concrete initiatives over the coming months and years."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, the arrival of a container full of trainers on an island somewhere, which was received enthusiastically by the residents, has in the past made headline news."
"In another case, a contingent of rubber ducks floated ashore."
"These are, of course, the pleasant examples of ships' cargoes going missing, but the fact is that in many cases lost containers can cause serious damage."
"It has become clear that we must do something about this."
"The Dutch Government was concerned about this problem and set up an investigation to find out why it was happening."
"The investigation identified a number of causes."
"Although there are EU regulations which specify how cargoes should be secured and although all ships have the manual containing the regulations on board, only 46% of ships have their cargoes properly lashed down."
"This means that we do not need any new rules. You were right about that, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn."
"In many cases, the weight of the cargo has not been correctly balanced."
"Another reason is that many crews in the short sea shipping sector unlash cargoes before they have reached their destination to speed up the unloading process."
"Stacking errors can also be a cause of the problem, together with old or damaged equipment."
"All of this can, of course, have a major impact on the environment."
"Around 70% of items lost from ships at sea sink to the bottom, but this gives rise to the question of what damage they are causing on the sea bed."
"A total of 15% of the goods reach land."
"The remaining 15% float around in the ocean and obviously represent a major hazard for other ships, platforms and the environment."
"This means that when accidents happen at sea we must investigate the extent to which containers were involved."
"Then we need to speak to shipping companies and port operators to ensure that they comply with the regulations."
"In addition, regular inspections must be made."
"Two thousand containers really are too many and I think that carrying out feasibility studies would take too long."
"We must take immediate action, because the situation simply cannot go on as it is."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (SK) As I see it, the solution to the problem of compensation for damage caused by containers lost at sea lies in having well-organised relations between three parties: the owner of the transported goods, the shipping company and the insurance company."
"The operator, the shipping company and the crew in particular are responsible for the security of goods at sea."
"The crew is also responsible for preventing the containers from falling off or sliding from the vessel into the sea, that is, for compliance with the international regulations in force, and for ensuring the safe shipping of goods in international maritime transport."
"In my opinion, the first step we ought to consider while tackling this issue is ensuring compliance with the regulations on securing goods before putting to sea."
"I think this is the central issue in this matter."
"Only then should we try to find new, complementary regulations for the transportation of goods."
"Only after we know the actual starting position and the situation concerning compliance with the regulations should we seek amendments to regulations which are already established for international shipping and, as the case may be, for the European Union too."
"(GA) Mr President, my colleague Brian Simpson has raised very important questions, and I have to say that I am not at all happy with the response I received from the Commissioner."
"Is she willing or ready to do anything about it as regards the introduction of a law?"
"This is a hugely important issue and I commend my colleague, Brian Simpson, for raising it because if you look at the statistics things are actually getting worse."
"Approximately 50% of the world's shipping tonnage carries non-toxic substances as bulk goods."
"There has been a rapid increase in the worldwide container ship fleet - which has grown by 140% from 32.6 million to 78.3 million gross tonnes since 1984 - and the problem needs to be regulated."
"There is also a problem in relation to increased speed, because these container carriers travel at a much faster speed than bulk carriers."
"They are now travelling at speeds of 27 knots, which is a huge speed in terms of the possibility of crashes or impacts, collisions and so on. So there is a huge problem there as well."
"Then we have the problem in relation to the actual age of the fleets themselves."
"When you look at the age of the fleets carrying containers, the bulk of them are in the category of 19-24 years old, which means that there is a major problem from the point of view of actual structural defects."
"What we need is a legislative initiative."
"We cannot allow a laissez-faire attitude."
"What we also need is a strict liability convention, so that ships travelling though EU waters will automatically have to foot the bill for non-intentional toxic releases into the sea due to the loss of containers."
"What I am saying in essence is that we need action because the situation is getting progressively worse and, as Mr Simpson has pointed out, in the bulk of cases of accidents we are talking about human error in terms of the way containers are tied down, dealt with and so on, so we really need to take the shipping companies on."
"(ES) Mr President, exactly eight years ago this November, the Prestige, an oil tanker carrying 70 000 tonnes of crude oil, suffered an accident off the coast of Galicia causing a leak through which the tanker spilled 20 000 tonnes of oil."
"This initial leak, combined with the misjudged decisions of the Minister of Public Works at the time, Mr Álvarez-Cascos, resulted in an absolute disaster and the worst ecological, social and economic tragedy ever to affect the Galician coasts."
"One of the possible causes considered to explain the leak was precisely the presence of lost containers floating on the sea surface at the mercy of the waves and storms."
"These containers are potential projectiles that can be thrust against the hulls of all kinds of ships, including oil tankers like the Prestige but also passenger ships, ferries or cruise ships."
"The outcome of the Lashing@Sea project has revealed serious deficiencies and negligence in the different areas concerned, such as lack of training and instruction among loading personnel and stevedores in the ports and also among the ship crews, which are consistently undertrained and undermanned even though the ships they work on are genuine monsters of the seas."
"In addition, the best techniques to secure and trace the containers are, on the whole, insufficiently used, and they are frequently overloaded."
"Lastly, a cost and risk assessment of the new physical effects generated by these monsters of the seas needs to be carried out."
"These effects include, for example, the so-called 'parametric resonance effect', which can cause containers to drop from the rear of the ship at a faster rate."
"This is why we demand that the European Commission undertake immediate preventive measures, more training, instruction and refreshment courses for stevedores and crews."
"We also demand the implementation of technological safety measures: weight controls in ports, improved lashing equipment and stacking strategies, and adequate marking to locate the containers in case of loss, traceability being one of the services potentially provided by the Galileo project."
"(DE) Mr President, I am glad that the European Commission did not exist in the 15th century."
"If it had existed, Christopher Columbus and his companions would probably have sailed in the next container, which would promptly have sunk, and they would never have reached the continent of America."
"We know what the cause of this problem is."
"We know that something needs to be done about it."
"What does the Commission say?"
"It says that it is not possible to do anything."
"This is simply not acceptable."
"We know that inaccurate stowage is the cause, that the containers have faulty lashings, that they are overweight, that they fall into the water even when the weather is not stormy and that individual countries with their own regulations cannot change any of this."
"Who else should be bringing about change, if not the Commission, which is responsible for ensuring that things like this do not happen in European waters."
"It is not only the environmental damage that we are concerned about."
"Human lives are also being put at risk."
"What would happen if a small boat with a plastic hull were to ram one of these containers in mid-Atlantic?"
"It would sink."
"It would not just be the boat itself that would sink, but also the people on board."
"Spending a long period in the water in the middle of the North Atlantic wearing a life jacket is not much fun."
"This is something which we need to take into account."
"Therefore, I think it is wrong that nothing is happening."
"I believe that the European Commission must introduce regulations as quickly as possible in order to put an end to this situation."
"It is dangerous, it is wrong and something must be done."
"I am calling on the Commission to take urgent action, because it is responsible in this case."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the question on containers lost at sea, which we are discussing today, to be very important, since it raises an issue of extraordinary importance above all for the economy of EU coastal regions."
"Hence, I believe the European Commission must strive to create an insurance fund that can provide compensation for any damage caused by the leakage of what are at times hazardous substances from containers lost at sea."
"Furthermore, it is advisable to raise the maritime safety level through stricter legislation on the control of goods stowage operations and the prevention of the illegal stowage of harmful toxic goods on ships."
"This insurance fund is something that I have already requested on other similar occasions."
"author. - Mr President, in short, I am disappointed with the Commission's response to our oral question."
"I appreciate that a world agreement would be ideal and I appreciate that we need to involve the IMO, but the IMO has got to be one of the slowest international organisations the world has ever come across."
"It works at the pace of a tortoise, and we want action now."
"Commissioner, if I drop 2 000 heavy metal boxes into the sea, deliberately, with a load of materials in, then I would be prosecuted."
"Yet we allow this to happen every year in EU waters."
"I make a plea: you cannot play Pontius Pilot with this and wash your hands of the problem."
"It is a problem that is increasing."
"It is a serious problem and it is a problem that you have to address."
"It is not a problem you can hide behind, saying 'well, we need to assess this' and 'we need to assess that', or whatever."
"You have heard what the Members have said."
"Please now get on with trying to sort it out."
"Mr President, I am grateful to all Members who participated in this debate and I would like to emphasise that I fully understand the importance of the topic we are discussing and how important it is in the opinion of Members that the Commission press ahead with a policy that would resolve this particular matter."
"I believe that the debate, and all that everyone has contributed, has shown the importance of the affair."
"I also believe the debate showed the importance to be attached to the protection of the environment."
"Interestingly, the debate has gone from Mrs Meissner's rubber ducks and shoes all the way to Columbus, who folklore says paid a visit to my home port in the west of Ireland."
"I am very glad that he took that famous voyage!"
"However, I would like to emphasise again to all of the Members, but in particular to Mr Simpson who has taken such a keen interest in this area and who has put so much work into it, that we are very serious about this particular issue."
"We are aware of the large increase in the number of containers that are lost and, as I said earlier, Commissioner Kallas is looking at this problem."
"He believes it is not just linked to the lashing of containers but also to overweight containers."
"It is also due sometimes to the strength of the ship which was an issue that was raised, and the age of the ships - an issue raised by Mr Higgins."
"Safety and protection of the marine environment, as I said earlier, are very important priorities for the Commission."
"We cannot compromise on those issues and we, and Commissioner Kallas in particular, will certainly consider whether further action is necessary."
"I am sure he would be very happy to work closely with you and your committee, Mr Simpson, in coming to a conclusion on that."
"We already have quite a number of tools at our disposal to ensure safety, as well as the prevention of pollution, including from containers lost at sea."
"With regard to concrete action on the issue, I believe that action at an EU level does not seem necessary at this stage."
"However, I do take your point that the IMO as an organisation is moving very slowly and that the Commission needs to get involved to push for quicker solutions."
"I still think, and I know that Commissioner Kallas feels very strongly, that the adequate forum to discuss these issues is still the IMO, and I suppose a review of the recent results of the lashing@sea project could be encouraged there."
"That project also confirms the importance of having a global approach when we are developing procedures and standards so that we keep this level playing field that we talked about earlier between operators from Member States and indeed other states."
"Let me conclude by emphasising that these issues should first be discussed in the IMO."
"The Commission participates as an observer in the IMO and the Commission prepares positions together with the Member States."
"I can assure you that I will convey the results of the debate here today to Commissioner Kallas and the issue, I know, will be looked at by him and promoted in that context."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I would like to offer my congratulations on the decision to take up the subject of containers lost at sea."
"On 8 February this year, ferries sailing from Poland to Sweden were in immediate danger."
"The Finnish freight vessel the Linda was sailing from Rotterdam to St Petersburg, and while crossing lanes used by Polish and Swedish vessels it lost three containers containing 8.3 tonnes of substances classified as dangerous to the environment, 7 tonnes of products which are hazardous to marine life and 5.5 tonnes of flammable substances."
"Fortunately, this time it was possible to avert a tragedy."
"I agree that all containers should be weighed in port and correctly stowed before vessels head to sea."
"This is, however, a long-term plan."
"The plan for today is for the Commission to introduce a regulation which provides for particular supervision of containers with substances classified as hazardous."
"Therefore, I would like to ask the Commission a question: when may we expect the first action on this matter?"
"Integrated Maritime Policy (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Meissner, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on integrated maritime policy (IMP) - evaluation of progress made and new challenges -."
"Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, I wish that the Chamber were full to bursting, not on my account or because this is my first report, but because of the subject matter, which is unfamiliar to many people, but nevertheless highly important."
"Hardly anyone has heard of integrated maritime policy, but it is a decisive subject for us all, because it really is true that our future lies in the sea."
"A total of 70% of the earth's surface consists of water."
"Population levels are growing, not in Europe, but throughout the rest of the world and by 2050 they will have reached 9 billion. The earth is becoming too small and many experts have already discovered the significant potential of the oceans."
"Our objective must now be to keep the resources of the seas safe for future generations by means of the integrated maritime policy."
"So far only 10% of the oceans and their resources have been explored, but we already have 50 000 products which come from the sea."
"Efforts are now being made to produce energy from the sea and to extract raw materials for medicines, cosmetics and industry."
"While we are developing our overall maritime policy, it is important to ensure that the sea does not strike back, as it did in a sensational novel by bestselling author Frank Schätzing. We have the opportunity to turn the maritime economy into the largest area of growth in our economy as a whole."
"For this reason, people are talking today not only about green jobs, but also about blue jobs and blue growth."
"The coastline of the EU is 23 000 kilometres in length and one third of the population lives by the sea."
"Green shipping and offshore energy are areas where Europe has extensive expertise which can be developed further."
"For this reason, we need an integrated approach so that we can achieve all of these objectives with great care."
"Which individual areas are covered by integrated maritime policy?"
"The first of these areas is transport."
"Shipping can be described as the powerhouse of European transport, because 95% of global trade and 40% of internal European trade travels by sea, via ports with hinterland connections and logistics."
"Further growth is being forecast and therefore we must ensure in particular that we can reduce emissions by developing greener ships."
"The next area is shipbuilding."
"We have a great deal of expertise in this field, as I have already mentioned."
"We must make sure that we use this expertise productively to secure existing jobs and create new ones."
"Of course, maritime policy also includes fisheries and aquaculture."
"Fish are not just a source of food."
"In addition, aquaculture is the area of agriculture and fisheries which is showing the highest levels of growth."
"It is important for us to be aware of this."
"In the field of energy there is a great deal happening on and around the sea."
"We have oil and gas pipelines, oil platforms and offshore wind farms and there are already plans to fit tankers with sails so that they can cut their energy consumption by 20% by using wind energy."
"Wave power is an area with future potential and microalgae, which can be used as biomass, represent an almost unlimited source of energy."
"In the area of research there is a focus on using blue biotechnology to develop medicines."
"We already have painkillers and anti-malaria drugs and work is currently underway on cancer medicines."
"Protecting our coasts is an important issue which is also covered by integrated maritime policy."
"Our coasts are threatened by storm tides and we need to protect them, not only against the tides, but also against oil, piracy and smuggling."
"In addition, we must deal with the problem of asylum seekers in Italy."
"Finally our coasts are also, of course, very popular tourist destinations and we are working on developing a sustainable tourism concept for the coastline."
"You can see that there are many individual areas involved here, all of which are related to water."
"The objective of the integrated maritime policy is to develop these areas carefully and in harmony by working together."
"Many people are not aware of this, but it is hugely important."
"The European Union has already achieved a great deal in this respect, but it needs to do even more."
"For this reason, I have focused in this report not so much on the individual areas, but primarily on what has happened in the last few years since the 2007 Blue Paper was published, what still needs to be developed and what has to be continued."
"These are the areas which I will mention again briefly in my conclusion."
"Mr President and honourable Members, I would like to say firstly that my colleague Commissioner Damanaki is in Portugal on behalf of President Barroso today at an important conference on marine affairs and marine policy and she regrets that she cannot be here today."
"Let me say first, however, that this debate is proof that maritime policy matters."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, on this very fine report."
"The Commission very much welcomes this excellent report and its favourable view of our integrated maritime policy."
"This report is more than a mere stock-taking exercise."
"It also sets out an ambitious, inclusive and detailed vision for the future of maritime policy."
"Not for the first time in discussing integrated maritime policies, the Parliament has led by example."
"The report is the product of admirable, cross-committee cooperation which adds democratic legitimacy to our policy."
"Moreover, it opens up new horizons, not least with the welcome participation of national and regional parliaments and authorities, to help shape our integrated maritime policy to become a truly operational policy of relevance that will create more jobs and better quality jobs."
"The Commission is confident that the policy demands in this report will impact positively on future maritime policy for three important reasons."
"Firstly, in taking a forward-looking approach to the maritime dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy and ensuring sustainable growth in maritime sectors and coastal regions."
"Secondly, they will point the way towards emerging policy objectives where the Commission and Parliament should work together."
"These include Europe's approach to climate change mitigation in coastal regions and to sustainable coastal tourism, support for greener, safer and more competitive shipping through the common maritime space without borders, and further action on maritime safety and accident prevention."
"Thirdly, this report provides a coherent and constructive set of proposals for future actions."
"I very much look forward to hearing the views expressed during this debate."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. - (DE) Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Meissner for what is, in the truest sense of the word, integrated work, not only because it concerns the integrated maritime policy, but also because it includes all the specialist areas."
"As far as fisheries are concerned, I would like to say once again that fisheries and aquaculture, of course, make up a substantial part of the integrated maritime policy."
"It is important for me also to mention once more that we in the European Union produce around 2 million tonnes of fishery, fish and aquaculture products, but we consume 8 million tonnes."
"We are one of the largest export regions for fishery products in the world."
"Therefore, we are faced with particular challenges when it comes to protecting our resources."
"One decisive point in this respect which has already been mentioned is maritime spatial planning."
"It is important for us to identify where the priorities lie."
"Fishing grounds and protected areas definitely have a high priority, together with the shipping routes and, of course, in this context, maritime safety."
"Particular care must be taken in very busy shipping lanes."
"We have been talking a great deal about renewable energy."
"The offshore wind farms which are being built in large numbers to generate energy must also be included, from the perspective both of fisheries and of maritime safety."
"This represents a major challenge."
"There is one other subject which I would like to bring up in this context."
"We must promote research and development with regard to fishing methods."
"The EUR 50 million made available by the Commission will not be enough. I would like to ask you to take this message back with you, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn."
"The integrated maritime policy will, of course, not come to an end at Europe's borders."
"We need to work together with our neighbours."
"We only need to think about Iceland, the Faroe Islands and what has happened there in recent years, the Mediterranean region, Libya and Egypt which present a major challenge."
"Mr President, Commissioner, sustainable use of the maritime environment is vital to the sustainability and growth of the whole of Europe, especially countries whose economies are directly linked to the sea."
"Balanced growth in basic sectors, such as fisheries and aquaculture, energy, transport and tourism, can guarantee citizens' professional future and income."
"From a regional development point of view, making use of territorial cohesion as a new basis for further integration of the internal market is of vital importance."
"For the maritime sector, this means further promoting short sea shipping and ensuring better links between peripheral maritime regions and islands and between them and the mainland and economic centres."
"This is vital if we are to achieve social, economic and territorial cohesion."
"The innovative approach adopted under the integrated maritime policy is also important and has replaced the fragmented approach to maritime policies."
"Taking advantage of synergies has a double benefit for the citizens of the European Union: it improves the results obtained and saves money."
"Mr President, the integrated maritime policy is vital to the European Union."
"We need it in order to fully exploit one of Europe's basic advantages: its strong maritime tradition."
"The strategic objective of an integrated maritime policy is to strengthen Europe's leading position in maritime research and technological development, in sectors such as shipbuilding, the exploitation of maritime resources and the development of off-shore energy sources, through better coordination of policies relating to the sea."
"The integrated maritime policy must support European shipping, which is unrivalled in the world, so that it can play a leading role at international level."
"That is why we must safeguard the competitiveness of our shipping as a valuable asset; it is very important to Europe."
"That is why the international solutions adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, which must have a sovereign role, need to be applied at global level."
"Mrs Meissner's report quite rightly underlines and analyses the importance of maritime governance, of maritime surveillance and of maritime spatial planning."
"However, there is a sine qua non to all of this: compliance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"As such, paragraph 25 of the report, in which the European Parliament asks the coastal states of all the maritime basins, especially the Mediterranean, to resolve delimitation issues on the basis of the Law of the Sea Convention, is extremely important."
"The report highlights the huge importance of Exclusive Economic Zones to Europe."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Meissner on her excellent efforts and on the cooperation between us and to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts."
"At the same time, however, as an ardent advocate of the competitiveness of European shipping, I personally have serious reservations and grave concerns about the amendment which Mrs Meissner tabled a few days ago."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on her report and thank her for all her hard work."
"We share the approach taken by this report which puts the focus not on the sectoral structure of maritime policy in the individual Member States, but instead emphasises the importance of coordinating maritime policy within and across the Member States."
"If we look to the future, we will see the space available in our seas and oceans becoming more restricted."
"The oceans are transport routes, sources of raw materials and energy, suppliers of foodstuffs and water reservoirs."
"The economic exploitation of the oceans is growing and this brings an accompanying increase in the environmental impact on them."
"Conflicts of interest will arise and we will have to resolve them by means of effective coordination within and among countries."
"It is not possible to comment on every issue, but I would like to mention briefly the sulphur emission control areas."
"It was not my intention to make the limits less strict."
"When the Commission presents its study, we will be able to tell to what extent the limits will result in a shift from sea to road transport, in particular in the North Sea and the Baltic."
"Then we can discuss this issue further."
"However, the basic conditions for competition within the European Union between the North and the South must remain at the same level."
"This must also be one of the Commission's objectives."
"There is one point which we are not entirely happy about. We have been talking for a long time about the strategic importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe."
"We have also said that innovation is very important in this industry, because this is the only way that it can survive."
"We need a coordinated strategy for our policy on the shipbuilding industry."
"I believe that the call from the Member States to put funding aside for shipbuilding was also very important, but it has not been supported by the Liberals and the Conservatives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, how do you propose that we should support the shipbuilding industry in Europe?"
"Coming out with platitudes and good wishes for the workers in the European shipyards, who are concerned about their jobs, is simply not enough."
"We Social Democrats expect better measures and better proposals in this area."
"Mr President, a third of European citizens live in coastal regions."
"The EU is the world's largest maritime power."
"An integrated policy in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy will help us strengthen our leadership."
"However this requires a global, cross-sectoral policy that takes into account all civil society actors as well as the strategies and responsibilities of local and regional authorities in coastal areas."
"We must continue to view our coasts and seas as an opportunity."
"For this reason, we need to strengthen our sustainable fisheries policy, taking on board the difficulties of people who make their living from the sea, who, incidentally, are a highly responsible sector."
"We have to reinforce the safety policy so that fishing vessels operating under European agreements can be protected."
"This means fighting piracy and therefore strengthening Operation Atalanta."
"We have to show our full commitment to the strategically important shipbuilding industry, which is going through hard times due to competition from Southeast Asia and needs and expects solid support from Europe, which is currently amiss."
"We must develop motorways of the sea to reduce CO2 and further the development of renewable energies."
"Innovation, inter-institutional coordination, appropriate financial instruments and a clear definition of Europe's strategy in every sector involved will enable us to achieve economic, technical and sustainable development, as well as research to a degree that allows creating high-level jobs and protecting something we all care for and something we all want to keep alive: the sea."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, for drawing together this report and developing it alongside the other political groups."
"As 71% of the Earth's surface is covered with water, it really does make sense to try and develop an integrated maritime policy."
"Europe, of course, has 305 000 kilometres of coastline."
"That was the Commission's intent back in 2009 when it announced a more horizontal policy approach on areas such as maritime transport, the marine environment and regional and fisheries policies."
"Today we see the response of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to this fresh direction, in the shape of Mrs Meissner's report."
"We will be supporting this report."
"It is a useful step in the right direction towards caring for, and the sustainable use of, our maritime resource."
"However, we believe there is still much work to be done."
"We welcome the report's suggestions on maritime governance, on sea basin initiatives and strategies, on maritime spatial planning and surveillance, a maritime research framework and observation and data network, and a fund for maritime infrastructure."
"I am particularly pleased that the report now includes the integration of carbon emission reduction targets and support for renewable solar and wind energies on board vessels."
"When it comes to the votes later on today, I would particularly like to ask Members to support the rapporteur's amendment which seeks to include the option of including emission trading schemes in the EU and IMO rules."
"This was an issue over which the Committee on Transport was evenly split, with 20 votes each side, so it is perfectly right that Mrs Meissner has brought it here today for plenary to vote on."
"I would ask Members to show some '20-20 vision' and vote for the rapporteur's amendment, which recognises that these measures sit squarely alongside our wider strategic objectives around CO2 reduction and the Europe 2020 project."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I welcome the development of an integrated maritime policy that enshrines and enhances the principles of subsidiarity, competitiveness and the sustainable use of marine resources."
"I do not, however, support the resurrection of the concept of a European coastguard."
"This was rejected once before."
"I do not believe it is necessary. I believe it is far too expensive at a time of financial stringency."
"I also believe that a directive on maritime spatial planning would be an unnecessary luxury which would not, in my view, add value to the current process of cooperation between Member States."
"Can I also mention in this context the impact of offshore wind, wave and tidal energy projects, together with the designation of marine protected areas (MPAs), on inshore and artisanal fisheries?"
"We cannot simply draw lines on maps designating vast areas of inshore waters as MPAs or for renewable energy."
"Small-scale fishermen cannot be arbitrarily displaced without full consultation."
"The designation of such areas must be a bottom-up and not a top-down process, and it must involve stakeholder consultation."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGLGroup. - (CS) The Integrated Maritime Policy is not being discussed in the context of the European Union for the first time, but it is still very difficult to reconcile the protection of the environment, fisheries, transport, energy, industry, science and research and to embed the various aspects of development into a single plan."
"The Commission's report answers the question of how the action plan contained in the Blue Book from 2007 is to be implemented."
"It emerges from the report that 56 out of 65 proposed measures have been initiated or completed, and generally as legal acts by the Commission or Council."
"For inland regions, however, the priority is to connect maritime policy with a policy of better, rational use of the main European waterways; see point 40 of the report."
"Here, attention is traditionally focused on the Rhine, the Maas and the associated system of waterways in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, including the Rhine - Main - Danube link."
"Unfortunately, the central section of the Danube downstream of Vienna and the tributaries of the Elbe upstream of Magdeburg have been left in the shadows by these efforts."
"The use of these waterways for traffic is discussed far less often, and investment in improving navigability is of peripheral interest to the European Commission and Council."
"This is definitely a shame, because the great energy potential of these waterways remains unused, while unnecessary pressure is put on the expansion of terminals in port cities, which transfer cargo from ship to rail and road while river ports have idle capacity."
"Of course, in addition to connecting ship, rail and road traffic, it is necessary to fundamentally address issues of nature conservation and energy use in coastal regions."
"Here it is reasonable to provide additional questions to the ones that Mrs Meissner put in her report, on two other issues: the relationship of maritime and river transport, and connecting them."
"I welcome the dozens of measures contained in the report."
"I would emphasise the need for consistent application of the third maritime package."
"In point 21, I consider the work on ecological solutions to the cleaning of oil tankers and the disposal of old ships to be a key initiative to avoid pollution."
"The current status of this issue is pathetic."
"I agree with the report by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (DA) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Meissner for a well-thought-out and comprehensive report, to which there is scarcely anything to add."
"Like Mrs Meissner, I am a strong supporter of coherence between policy areas, interdisciplinary research programmes and new challenges, but what concerns me most of all are the problems relating to the pollution of our seas."
"We adopt so many reports in this House that they are, unfortunately, forgotten soon after they have been adopted."
"I would therefore like to remind the Commission of an additional protocol that Parliament adopted on 26 January this year, in other words nearly nine months ago."
"It concerned the establishment of cooperation between EU Member States for combating disasters in the North-East Atlantic."
"This is a subject that Mrs Meissner also mentions in paragraph 4 of her report."
"To this day, I have not received any feedback from the Commission on this subject, either with regard to whether any steps have been taken towards the establishment of such cooperation or preparedness amongst Member States, or whether the Commission itself perhaps intends to establish a state of preparedness for the EU."
"All of this is despite the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that we have only just finished dealing with and the threat posed by the far too old and rusty oil wells in the North Sea."
"So, I would now - once again - like to ask the Commission: What has happened with regard to the disaster preparedness for our seas?"
"Will we have to wait for something serious to happen first before Europe wakes up?"
"(DE) Mr President, as far as our oceans are concerned, time is running out."
"If we continue to destroy them at the current rate, we will ultimately destroy ourselves, because 70% of the world's oxygen is produced by marine flora."
"It is not enough to promote the protection of the environment within the EU, as we are always so keen to do, because it is a well-known fact that wind and waves are no respecters of borders."
"Therefore, I really do not understand why we are not putting clear regulations in place, when rich industrial nations are able to shift their environmental problems to the developing countries."
"I think we need specific regulations for ship breaking."
"Ships consisting of tonnes of waste polluted with asbestos are sent from Europe to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan to be broken up, where they contaminate whole stretches of coastline."
"However, this all comes back to us in the form of contaminated seafood, which ends up on our plates via the food chain."
"We have not even mentioned the workers in these countries who risk their lives as a result of inadequate safety precautions."
"A day, a ship, a death."
"This is how the shipbreakers in the Indian town of Alang describe their dangerous job."
"We also have no clear regulations for deep sea drilling."
"In this context, I would like to highlight the very positive move made by Mr Öttinger, who is attempting to put in place regulations governing the safety of drilling platforms."
"There are no regulations for busy shipping lanes, such as the Bosphorus, where compulsory pilotage has not yet been introduced."
"Large tankers pass through these straits every day."
"Another positive feature that I would like to mention is the fact that shipping companies are playing an active role in protecting the environment and marine animals."
"For example, an Italian shipping firm has installed a system which will prevent its ships from colliding with whales."
"It would be a very good idea for the EU to support positive measures of this kind taken by private companies."
"(FI) Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work, and especially for the proper way in which she views the International Maritime Organisation's decision on sulphur emissions."
"I hope that the Commission will actually take this decision into account, one that today is bound to be adopted unanimously in Parliament."
"The IMO's decision was a hasty one, with no assessment of environmental impact and no estimates of costs."
"The EU should not repeat the IMO's mistake."
"If different emissions limits are set for the north compared with the south, competition will be distorted and so will the rules within the EU."
"The emissions limits must be the same."
"I am absolutely certain that it will be contrary to EU competition law if this goes ahead."
"What will this mean for my country, for example?"
"It will mean that industry will face an additional bill of approximately EUR 1 billion a year."
"Finnish jobs are at risk, even though we are doing all we can here to increase the number of jobs in the EU."
"We speak of the Europe 2020 strategy, but we make other sorts of decisions that take these jobs away."
"Cargo for Finland is transferred to Russian ships, which then take the goods to Finland on trucks, because Russia is not going to ratify this decision by the IMO."
"This can hardly be what the EU wants."
"The Swedes have said that they will start to transport by truck what now goes by ship."
"We would therefore be making a bad decision for the environment and a bad decision for future European jobs."
"I hope that the Commission actually understands this decision, which is being taken unanimously in Parliament today."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur."
"When it comes to integrated maritime policy, we must go beyond the stage of good intentions and give fresh impetus to a strategy that will represent a route to growth and development in the European Union, making up for the huge amount of time lost in the prevention of environmental disasters, and in the fight against climate change and pollution."
"Only this morning Mr Pirillo reminded Parliament of yet another catastrophic event that occurred the other day in the town of Paola, in Calabria."
"The Commission must prove that it is making a real effort, that it is not just using its instruments of governance but actually implementing targeted legislative measures, and duly learning its lessons from past mistakes caused by an approach that was often too sectoral in nature."
"We are fully aware that this is a very complex process, but we are at a difficult and demanding juncture where no lapse in attention can be tolerated and where adequate investment and shared governance mechanisms are needed both at interinstitutional level and in international cooperation for the regional basins, among which the Mediterranean stands out because of the complexity of its jurisdiction."
"That is why it will be crucial to view the management of the Mediterranean basin as an asset shared by all the coastal States, on the basis of the res communis omnium, or common heritage, principle."
"Otherwise, the increasingly widespread practice of unilaterally declaring exclusive economic zones or the like in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as running counter to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, would undermine the idea of effective, shared governance."
"I would point out in this respect that, only a month ago, this interpretation on the part of Libya resulted in an actual armed assault on a European fishing boat, and it would be wrong to argue that this is just a matter between Italy and Libya."
"(SV) The Integrated Maritime Policy is a very welcome strategy, because our seas are interconnected and all sectors that exploit the seas have a combined effect on the marine environment."
"This means that it would be devastating and irresponsible to continue to take decisions relating to the marine environment without taking account of the cumulative effect on the marine environment of fishing, dredging, shipping, wind and wave power, tourism and other activities."
"The Marine Strategy Framework Directive forms the environmental pillar of the Integrated Maritime Policy and it states that all Member States shall have attained a good environmental status for our seas by 2020."
"If this is to be possible, the Member States must, as soon as possible, implement a form of maritime governance that is integrated in practice, with a single centre for decision making."
"I will give you an example of how wrong things can go when the various users of the sea are governed by different authorities and different laws."
"In the southern Kattegatt in Sweden, Sweden and Denmark have agreed to protect the spawning ground of the cod in a desperate attempt to protect the last remaining cod stocks."
"Recently, another authority in Sweden decided that the municipality of Falkenberg should be permitted to dump enormous quantities of dredging waste from ports into the sea, precisely in the spawning ground of the cod."
"The Member States now have a duty to attain a good environmental status for the seas by 2020."
"Only by collating the decisions affecting the seas and carrying out marine spatial planning will this be possible."
"Marine spatial planning will also allow us to see more clearly who has an interest in the seas, who wishes to exploit the seas and to be clear that the same rules must apply to everybody."
"Fishing operations must also carry out environmental impact assessments, and they must follow the best practice principle."
"They must also comply with the precautionary principle, exactly like gas pipelines on the sea floor or wind farms do."
"This would be a very big step in the right direction."
"(PL) The Report on Integrated Maritime Policy makes us think more carefully and requires that we give the matter greater attention."
"The short presentation of the report pursuant to Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, the reduced possibility to table amendments, which is against the rules, and the rejection of most amendments tabled by the European Commission do not fill us with optimism or hope that the Committee on Transport and Tourism will approach the subject of integrated maritime policy in a fully responsible way."
"Let us remember that the maritime industry in the European Union finds itself in a huge crisis."
"The industry is being destroyed by dumping and competition from the Far East and by the taking over of shipping companies by cheap operators."
"This is happening as a result of the lack of a European integrated maritime policy."
"We are facing a crisis in the shipbuilding industry."
"I will add that in my country the two largest shipyards have recently been closed, and that this took place under the influence of pressure from the European Commission and in the face of the ineffective action of the Polish Government."
"This has caused huge economic migration and has increased unemployment."
"Therefore, I appeal for appropriate attention to be given to integrated maritime policy and for a fully responsible approach to the subject."
"(PT) The large number of activities and sectoral policies on the marine environment - from fishing to maritime transport, and including tourism, energy, science and technology, among others - requires an integrated policy that promotes a beneficial interlinking of all these areas within a framework of sustainability of the marine environment, and of preservation of the related ecosystems."
"This is because specific local and regional features are of crucial importance within this relationship, and the effects of this integrated policy will be felt at this level too."
"Beyond simply being implemented, it must also be defined at this level, involving the coastal communities that work with the marine environment, who bring it to life and depend on it."
"We must also not forget the joint vision that is necessary or the collaboration and cooperation that are crucial in view of the fact that the oceans and seas are interlinked and interdependent."
"Any Union initiative in this area must safeguard the sovereignty and powers of each Member State with regard to the management of its territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zones, while at the same time contributing to promoting the resources that are present there as part of their endogenous potential and their comparative advantages."
"Amongst other things, such as the promotion of marine research and the development of the various aspects of maritime technology and engineering, such as shipbuilding, a comprehensive vision of an integrated maritime policy must cover the following: the promotion of maritime transport that is more environmentally sustainable and of port infrastructure as part of their public management; promotion of fishing ensuring the modernisation of the sector and its environmental sustainability and socioeconomic viability; adequate and independent funding that does not take resources away from the European Fisheries Fund; and finally, the role and special characteristics of the outermost regions."
"Mr President, before taking advice from any expert it is wise to examine their record to check that they are competent."
"The Integrated Maritime Policy report is partly the work of the Committee on Fisheries, so before buying into its grand schemes it is worthwhile taking a critical look at the European Union's record on the management of the seas."
"Inevitably, this means assessing the situation in the former sovereign UK waters, secretly betrayed to European bureaucracy control in 1973, since nearly 70% of so-called 'EU fishing stocks' are actually British fishing stocks."
"How have our fish and our fishermen fared under the common fisheries policy (CFP)?"
"The figures tell us far more than all the fine words in this report."
"88% of the EU's stocks are overfished, against a global average of about 27%."
"30% of our fish species are now officially outside safe biological limits, because there are too few adult fish left for normal reproduction."
"Under the CFP's obscene quota system, nearly a million tonnes of fish are discarded dead into the North Sea alone every year."
"Meanwhile, the industrial hoovering-up of species such as sand eels has led to crashing populations of bird species such as puffins."
"To Europe's south, the picture is just as bad."
"West African fishermen, whose lifestyle had been sustained for generations, are being forced to switch to people trafficking because EU-registered vessels have helped fish their waters to extinction."
"It is time for the EU to acknowledge that its record in maritime management is the worst in the entire world, a typical example of what is known as the tragedy of the commons - the phenomenon by which shared resources always get exploited ruthlessly, because anyone who exercises restraint is disadvantaged by the unscrupulous."
"It is time to restore control of the seas and fishing grounds to the sovereign nations, whose track record has shown them fit to exercise such stewardship."
"In the case of the two-thirds of EU waters that the EU has fished to extinction, that means the British nation and British fishermen."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, must be congratulated."
"We have had dissimilar, even conflictive positions, but she has found compromise solutions that allow us to stand together today on this important issue."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided that all the seas should be protected in a similar way, arguing that any other solution would bring about a situation of unfair competition."
"We accept the position of the majority in favour of a legal situation with uniform rules for the entire Union, although I will not spare Members the fact that such a solution also clearly implies a certain degree of unfairness."
"It is obvious that the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel are more polluted and, in my view, sulphur monitoring will have to be stricter."
"The measures to reduce transport time and handling costs in ports are certainly positive initiatives."
"Nonetheless, I will repeat this again and again: we still have work to do on this matter."
"Unless we liberalise our ports resolutely, they will not be able to expand the key role they will be required to play in the context of co-modality."
"The promotion of a CO2 reduction strategy aimed at altering the specific consequences of climate change is also to be welcomed."
"I think this is a good report that must be adopted."
"But we must not forget that this report is in the context of a serious disaster, namely that affecting the Gulf of Mexico."
"In this respect, the Commission is urged to judge whether it is necessary, within the framework of revision of the Regulation of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to strengthen the role of the Agency in carrying out preventive inspections and post-hydrocarbon-spill clean-up tasks."
"Commissioner, this, I believe, is a necessary reform and the necessary mandate must be used to support these tasks."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Meissner for her excellent work and the way in which she has managed to bring about broad consensus with her report."
"As coordinator of my group, I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our former colleague Mr Piecyk, who sadly died two years ago and who did some groundbreaking work in this Parliament to flesh out an integrated European maritime policy - something we can build upon today."
"Clearly this is a complex sector with many aspects and we will therefore have much to do to achieve our goal."
"To begin with, we must bring about a new dynamism in the sector by putting effective structures and appropriate measures in place; after all, this sector provides large numbers of jobs throughout Europe both directly and indirectly and, in particular, is essential for the development of our coastal and port areas."
"The structure has already been referred to, and that also includes European structures."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) must really be strengthened and given a greater role, and be given the appropriate competences and resources."
"The issue of the oil disaster and oil drilling has also been raised."
"As far as that is concerned, I believe that it should be clear that any subsequent amendment of the competences should strengthen EMSA's position."
"EMSA should also be playing a major role in promoting cooperation between national inspection services, coastal monitoring services and so on in the Member States."
"In addition, there are of course some major environmental challenges."
"Shipping creates more pollution than it needs to."
"There is, therefore, still much scope for improvement."
"We are talking about sulphur standards, which should be the same everywhere, and about a system of emissions trading - and I call upon the Commission to really keep up the pressure within the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in this regard."
"In addition, we need to have effective spatial planning, of course."
"My final point: I believe that it is also important to take steps on a social level to enhance the image of the profession among young people."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, integrated maritime policy is a forward-looking area."
"The oceans are being used increasingly intensively for transport, maritime economic activities, offshore energy and fishing, and the development of these areas must be coordinated."
"The space available is limited and, therefore, the various maritime sectors must take a responsible and thoughtful approach to working together."
"The use and the protection of the seas must not conflict with one another."
"These two areas are mutually dependent, because the oceans can only support us if they are healthy."
"I would like to highlight the positive cooperation between countries bordering on the Baltic who are working together to promote the dynamic development of the fisheries, the environment, the infrastructure and tourism in coastal regions."
"We must continue to focus on the fishing industry, which is in a weak position and is often regarded as being a low priority, but which, because it provides us with food, represents a vital link in the coastal economy."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on this positive report."
"(FR) Mr President, I believe that the report clearly demonstrates the challenges posed by the marine environment in terms of fisheries, aquaculture, transport, tourism, energy, mining and biological resources, and climate change research."
"There is considerable potential for development, and it should be safeguarded, protected and enhanced in a lasting way, because the future of the human race depends on it."
"The report also rightly notes that the European Union is the world's leading maritime power and that its outermost regions ensure that it has the world's largest exclusive economic zone."
"Therefore, in the light of such a finding, it is the European Union's responsibility to implement an ambitious policy, a major maritime policy."
"If the world's leading maritime power does not do so, who will?"
"It must be said, however, that the resolution does not go very far in this direction."
"One cannot claim to be the world's leading policymaker with only EUR 50 million."
"Lastly, although the outermost regions have a recognised strategic position due to their presence in every ocean, it would have been sensible to make them play a leading role in a major strategy for the oceans."
"Unfortunately, this was not taken up by the rapporteur, and I regret that."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, the oceans and seas represent 70% of the planet's surface, they were the birthplace of life, and throughout human history they have been a source of food through fishing, as well as a means of communication between peoples and cultures via maritime trade."
"That is where we find the origin of the concept of traditional maritime activities: fishing and transport."
"The sea is currently gaining a new role in the context of the global world, as a geostrategic and geopolitical stage that gives Europe a central role."
"Moreover, we are currently living in the so-called period of new uses for the oceans, such as the exploitation of its energy, mineral and genetic resources, which, as along with fishing and maritime transport, require a holistic perspective and concerted action; as a matter of fact, Mrs Meissner has sought to give an impression of this, for which I warmly congratulate her."
"It is essential for the European Union to plan the European maritime space and its uses, especially for coastal regions and even more so for the outermost regions."
"For the integrated maritime policy to be greater than the sum of its parts - and to focus on fishing here - it is vital that this activity be represented in the clusters of maritime activities, so that desires can be incorporated in a collaborative way and difficulties resulting from the overlapping of interests in the use of the maritime space can be overcome."
"In this area, in order to comply with the decisions reached at the 2002 Johannesburg Summit, it is imperative to protect the marine biogeographical regions that are most sensitive from a biological viewpoint and to promote sustainable fishing using increasingly selective methods."
"It is, therefore, important to guarantee the creation of cross-sectoral political instruments that bring together the different sectors of the various maritime activities, defending their respective requirements and specific features in terms of utilisation of the maritime sphere."
"Protecting the oceans is a moral obligation that we have for ourselves and for future generations."
"(EL) Commissioner, almost every civilisation in the history of Europe has been based on the sea."
"Today, the Treaty of Lisbon imposes new policies and tools to minimise conflicts, promote dynamic synergies and eliminate unfair competition, in order to protect the environment and create jobs."
"The integrated maritime policy requires a cross-sectoral, global strategy for the sustainable development of coastal and island areas and the seas."
"A basic tool for the rational delimitation of uses of the sea is cross-border maritime spatial planning."
"We must encourage the adoption of single, integrated maritime governance structures at regional level and the development of strategies for the Union's maritime macro-regions."
"We need to look into the prospect of creating a European coastguard for efficient integrated maritime surveillance."
"Finally, no-one can disagree that the shipping industry needs to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions."
"We need to exert coordinated pressure for global IMO regulations, given that a unilateral decision by Europe to create an ETS for shipping would, I fear, have disastrous consequences for European shipping by putting off a proper solution, namely international regulations, not forgetting that shipping is an international activity par excellence."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Meissner for her report on integrated maritime policy, and I agree with her on the need to strengthen maritime transport and the shipbuilding industry, to safeguard coastal regions and to promote innovation and research activities."
"Today, maritime transport plays a fundamental role in trade."
"As a result, we must encourage cooperation between small and large ports that face one another in the same sea basin and which can facilitate more fluid trade."
"Furthermore, in order to ensure intermodality, we must invest in port and dry port infrastructure, especially in ports that can be connected via European corridors."
"Lastly, I believe it is important not to overlook another issue, namely port security."
"All the measures relating to safety within all European ports must be harmonised so as to better protect maritime transport and prevent unfair competition from harming those ports which actually have to incur greater expense in order to guarantee a higher level of safety."
"(RO) The development of an integrated maritime policy is an absolute must, given the fragmented approach adopted in the past which led to inefficiency and conflicts in this area."
"Mrs Meissner's report reiterates the European Parliament's view about creating an integrated, coherent and common decision-making process with regard to the oceans, seas, coastal areas and maritime sectors."
"The integrated maritime policy facilitates a cross-sector approach to maritime governance, by helping identify and utilise areas of synergy between the European Union's policies which come under this area."
"The proposal for a regulation envisages a programme which will provide a stable framework for maintaining the assistance granted to the initiatives in this area and will result in a more coherent use of funds for the development of the seas and coastal areas."
"Unfortunately, the only viable and feasible funding solution in the current economic climate was the modest financial contribution from the EU."
"Nevertheless, I hope that this funding method will enable the objectives of the integrated maritime policy to be met both in the short and medium term."
"(PT) Mr President, the smart growth advocated in the Europe 2020 strategy can only be achieved if we intelligently mobilise the various types of potential inherent in European diversity."
"The European Union has the largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world, at 25 million square kilometres."
"We have 32 000 kilometres of coast, on which one third of our population lives; the coast generates 40% of our gross domestic product and 95% of our foreign trade."
"These last figures should alert the Commission and Council to act, in the sense that they cannot do without an integrated European maritime policy in achieving the smart growth that is essential to the success of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I would draw particular attention to the potential biogenetic and mineral wealth that our deep sea and seabeds contain, about which we currently know little;"
"I would draw attention to the need to increase our research and development efforts in these areas."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, we must preserve the world's oceans as an ecosystem."
"However, the oceans and the concept of globalisation are not mutually exclusive."
"Shipping routes are essential to our prosperity, because they are the arteries of world trade."
"There is a lot to be done in this context in order to ensure that we protect the environment and that our transport routes are secure."
"In future, we will also have to secure our supply of raw materials."
"Scientists are predicting that valuable raw materials can be found on the sea bed and in the sea itself."
"The important consideration is to extract them in an environmentally friendly way."
"The third aspect I would like to look at is the link between the oceans and inland waterways."
"I believe it is important to establish a connection with inland waterway transport."
"The development of the Danube plays a major role in this respect."
"As the longest river in the EU, in combination with the Rhine-Main-Danube canal, it can link the Black Sea with the North Sea."
"We should be creating a connection between integrated maritime policy and inland waterways."
"Mr President, it should not surprise anybody that the EU wants to integrate maritime policy, just as it intends to integrate everything else across Europe in every aspect of life and public policy."
"I enquired in 2007 of the UK Marine and Fisheries Agency how many fish were being caught in British waters."
"I was told 'we cannot identify UK waters."
"They are now identified as being part of EC waters'."
"So the UK no longer has its own territorial waters."
"Perhaps it is apt to be discussing this today because, as I am sure you will all be aware, it is the 205th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805 when Admiral Lord Nelson and many other brave men gave their lives and died so that Britain could remain a free and independent country."
"His dying words were 'Thank God, I have done my duty'."
"UKIP MEPs will do their duty this afternoon and vote against this."
"(DE) Mr President, we still know far too little about marine ecosystems and many areas of the deep sea in particular are just white patches on our maps."
"However, the seas and the oceans represent one of the major challenges of this century and not just because they provide us with food and protein."
"Their role in our climate system and, therefore, their contribution to the welfare of the human race should not be underestimated."
"The example of the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates that marine ecosystems can regenerate if the necessary environmental protection measures are put in place."
"In the protected areas of the reef, the fish population has increased by between 30% and 75% in only two years."
"Given the fact that more than 40% of the world's population lives less than 100 kilometres from the sea and could therefore be hit by a tsunami, I very much welcome the plan to implement a joint European disaster prevention strategy for our coastal areas."
"However, the establishment of differing emission limits within EU waters conflicts with the integrated maritime policy, which aims to take all factors into account."
"We need to be consistent in this area."
"(RO) The importance of the integrated maritime policy is unarguable in circumstances where the European Union is the number one global maritime power and 40% of the EU's GDP is produced around the seas and coastal areas."
"When implementing the objectives of these policies, particular consideration must be given to the specific regional features of the seas around Europe."
"Every maritime area is unique and requires individual attention in order to achieve a sustainable balance with its users."
"At the same time, we must ensure that this policy will enjoy appropriate funding in the outlook for the forthcoming programming period, thereby creating a new approach aimed at encouraging optimum development of all maritime activities in a sustainable manner, and which will cover all sea basins."
"This will allow us to enjoy much greater benefits, while easing the environmental impact."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteurs and members have spoken in depth about the content of the integrated maritime policy."
"I should like to focus on the issue of shipping emissions."
"It will, indeed, be no easy task, but we must include shipping emissions in plans to reduce overall emissions."
"In order to be effective, this is something which needs to be done as a matter of priority under an international IMO agreement."
"If no such agreement can be reached then, obviously, we shall seriously consider adopting regional measures at EU level."
"As Mr Danellis said, this will be no easy task and, if we are to have any chance of success, we need to follow the example of the aviation industry."
"These measures need to be applied on the basis of the port of call of merchant vessels and we must decide how to tax emissions."
"The ETS has proven to be fairly complicated and inefficient; we need to find a simple but effective solution; perhaps a carbon tax or other hybrid methods which are simple and effective."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to highlight once again the European Union's transport strategy."
"Our aim is to move goods from the roads to the sea and to provide efficient and environmentally friendly means of transport."
"However, in certain areas of shipping we must not set our environmental objectives as high as the sulphur emission control areas in the Baltic and the North Sea, otherwise the cost of transport will rise dramatically."
"Mr Itälä and Mr Fleckenstein have already referred to this."
"I would like to call on Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn to evaluate the study which is being drawn up very carefully."
"We do not want to move transport from the sea back to the roads and we want fair competition in northern Europe, in the European Union and in the Mediterranean area."
"That is one of the fundamental requirements."
"On the subject of maritime safety, I would also like to say that it should play a greater role in integrated maritime policy with regard to the very busy shipping lanes and straits."
"For example in the Kadet Trench and in the Bosphorus, as one of my fellow Members has mentioned, there should in future be compulsory pilotage."
"Where large tankers pass through and highly complex cargoes are being transported, compulsory pilotage would increase levels of maritime safety."
"(RO) Shipping and the shipbuilding industry contribute significantly to the economic prosperity of EU countries and provide valuable services to European and global industry, as well as consumers."
"I congratulate Mrs Meissner on her report."
"I wish to stress the importance of a maritime space without barriers."
"At the same time, we call on the Commission and Member States to evaluate and preserve small maritime ports, expand the short sea shipping network in order to minimise land transport distances, support research and innovation on cargo modes, cargo handling and logistical solutions with the aim of finding solutions which reduce transport time and handling costs, and to support port infrastructure development and ensure intermodality."
"With an emphasis on the Black Sea's geostrategic importance, the European Council should ask the European Commission to draw up a European Union Black Sea strategy."
"Unfortunately, too little attention has been devoted until now to the Black Sea, which is of geostrategic significance to the European Union."
"Mr President, the development of an integrated maritime policy is of vital importance to the Irish, the European and indeed the global economy."
"As an island-based economy, maritime transport is the cornerstone of Irish industry."
"Over 99%, and I repeat 99%, in volume terms of all Irish trade is transported by sea."
"It is estimated that the Irish marine industrial base is responsible for the employment of some 8 000 people generating over EUR 1.5 billion within the economy annually."
"The sector connects the Irish economy with the rest of Europe and the rest of the world."
"The sector is strategically vital to my country and to the recovery of the Irish economy."
"The rapidly evolving nature of the maritime sector requires a unified approach at European level, and the growth in maritime activities such as maritime transport, development, aquaculture and tourism - combined with new uses of the sea such as underwater technologies, offshore renewable energy and the blue biotech - is increasing pressure on an already limited maritime space."
"(ES) Mr President, the integrated maritime policy is a cross-cutting, regional and sectoral policy and the fisheries and aquaculture policy must be a part of it, in a way that does not make it subordinate to other policies."
"We must all address the environmental and economic problems affecting society as a whole and the fisheries sector in particular: new technologies, fishing gear, development of species, a maritime economy programme to create more and better jobs, quality supplies, international relations aimed at preventing piracy and favouring the governance of the sea, which is devoid of barriers, and not having any sustainability problems, as in the case of Iceland."
"This is what needs to be done if we intend to work towards an integrated maritime policy, and if we intend to work for the environment and sustainability."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, integrated maritime policy has a horizontal role: it incorporates various aspects, from the environment to marine and maritime research."
"Integrated maritime policy does not provide for monitoring of the boundaries of international territorial waters for illegal fishing or the crossing of those boundaries."
"I hope that serious consideration will be given to this aspect within the context of the funds earmarked for implementing this policy, and that those funds will help strengthen controls thanks to modern surveillance systems such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) services."
"The horizontal aspect that characterises integrated maritime transport will be guaranteed - I hope with the forthcoming funding package - by the EU budget and not by the fisheries resources, which are used for specific actions."
"I am very grateful to the rapporteur for this important text, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will grant our requests in full."
"Thank you very much, Mr Pirillo."
"I have not included your initial remarks in your speaking time, because what you have said is important."
"However, I can assure you that all the Vice-Presidents make a great effort in this respect."
"I would like to invite you to take part in a competition with me."
"We will pull the names of Members of this House out of a hat and see who is better at pronouncing them."
"Nevertheless, mistakes sometimes do happen in the heat of the moment and I would like to ask for your forbearance."
"(ES) Mr President, thank you for your generosity."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Meissner very warmly on her excellent work and also on her ability to integrate our colleagues' requests and amendments."
"I am particularly grateful for two specific amendments."
"The first is the one in which the Commission is urged to improve the working conditions of maritime workers and finally transpose into EU law the International Labour Organization (ILO) Maritime Labour Convention."
"The amendment also includes a proposal for a qualification and training programme for seafarers, which will specifically provide for the recruitment of young people and the inclusion of third countries."
"I am also grateful for the amendment in which we call on the Commission to help Member States in implementing a localisation and mapping programme for underwater shipwrecks and relics, which are part of Europe's historical and cultural heritage -I come from Spain, a country with a large amount of relics off its coasts."
"This programme will facilitate the understanding and study of this underwater heritage and help to prevent looting, thus enabling its proper preservation."
"I think these two aspects, in addition to Mrs Meissner's excellent proposals, will play an important part in creating to the new marine awareness that Europe needs."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I know that at the beginning of the debate Mrs Meissner expressed her disappointment at so few Members being here in the Chamber."
"I think she should be very pleased that 37 speakers contributed to the debate."
"Indeed, we had a very lively debate which has thrown up fresh ideas to encourage us to aim even higher in terms of the maritime policies that we pursue."
"We must manage the finances of the EU concerning maritime issues in the context of the European Commission's proposal for a regulation to finance the integrated maritime policy in 2011, 2012 and 2013."
"The purpose of the proposed funding, namely of EUR 50 million, is to continue the work undertaken since 2007 to remove policy barriers and to unleash synergies by bridging all policies that impact on the sea, such as transport, fisheries, customs and marine environmental protection."
"The Commission looks forward to working with Parliament on the timely entry into force of this regulation so that we can implement our future integrated maritime policy actions."
"Furthermore, maritime surveillance is an important new initiative, which is set to engineer a huge change in all future actions by maritime authorities at sea and aims to install a common information-sharing environment for the EU maritime domain."
"The communication from the Commission concerning this initiative came out only yesterday."
"It is the culmination of intensive work that has produced a six-step roadmap to achieve in a short time the integration in maritime surveillance which seemed extremely difficult to achieve just a few months ago."
"I turn now to a number of specific questions raised."
"On sulphur emissions, the Commission is fully aware of the concerns expressed by industry groups about the impacts that may occur due to the new marine fuel quality standards adopted by the IMO in 2008."
"That is why the Commission has called for - and subsequently hailed - the IMO agreement which is now estimated to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide by up to 90% and, most importantly, emissions of secondary particulate matter by up to 80%."
"The Commission will present a proposal to align EU legislation with the IMO decision within the next months."
"The proposal will be accompanied by a detailed report that will also include the outcome of our ex-post impact assessment relating to the IMO decision, as well as possible measures that the Commission could take to mitigate undesired impacts on the sector."
"Mr de Grandes Pascual raised the issue of sea basins."
"The EU is aware of different situations in sea basins and is developing appropriate strategies for each sea basin, tailored to specific needs."
"Finally, Ms Rosbach and others raised the issue of an anti-disaster scheme."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency is in charge of monitoring shipping safety."
"At present it does not have legal competence to regulate in the area of environmental disasters, but discussions are under way - within the context of the Commission extending or renewing the mandate of the European Maritime Safety Agency at present - as to whether more powers should be given to the Agency in coming years."
"Of course, Parliament will be centrally involved in this issue."
"Finally, in my capacity as the European Commissioner with responsibility for research, innovation and science, I was very glad to hear several Members here in the Chamber raising the issue of the relationship between maritime policy generally and, specifically, research into marine and maritime policy."
"Last week, the Belgian Presidency organised a very important conference in Ostend which dealt specifically with this issue and brought together scientists involved in this area."
"This is a very important pillar of our integrated maritime policies."
"I would like to thank Mrs Meissner again for her comprehensive and far-reaching report."
"I believe that we can now pursue the implementation of all future maritime initiatives with renewed vigour and confidence."
"Thank you and my apologies to the interpreters if I was speaking too quickly."
"Mr President, I think it is good that you have been counting, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn."
"I did not know how many speeches had been made, but 37 really is a lot."
"I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate today."
"Right at the beginning, I also forgot to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their work."
"We really have worked together very constructively and I enjoyed it very much."
"I have covered a lot of subjects in the report, because it is very important to me to have a convincing majority in this crucial area."
"Many of the speeches on different subjects have highlighted the fact that we need joint action on research, planning, implementation and control of maritime activities by means of joint governance, spatial planning and monitoring."
"This is what the report is all about."
"However, it is a very varied subject."
"I should now like to discuss a few of the speeches."
"Mr Fleckenstein raised the problem of the sulphur emissions."
"We have included it in the report because it was important to us that there is no distortion of competition, but we also need to make sure that shipping is more environmentally friendly."
"However, what you said about shipbuilding, Mr Fleckenstein, is not quite true."
"It is not the case that the Liberals and the Conservatives did not want to include this."
"It was simply a question of how we should implement it, of whether we should create a new fund at a European level for refitting old ships or whether we should put in place a strategy."
"That is the current wording."
"The subject of my amendment was also raised, which I introduced in order to include emissions trading in the report."
"In the committee it was rejected by a very small margin, but in my opinion we are all convinced that we must continue to follow this route."
"For this reason, I am hoping for support in these areas."
"Mr Kohlíček, you said that it was difficult to link all the areas together, but I know that this is possible."
"A group of stakeholders and business people from all the different maritime areas meets twice a year to share ideas."
"These are prominent players at a European level and they all very much value the opportunity to come together."
"My last point concerns the reference to the fact that there are so many different regions."
"I have included the position of islands in the report and it is not true that this has been omitted."
"The only area not covered by the strategies is the North Sea."
"I live closest to the North Sea and, therefore, I wanted to mention that when we talk about the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Danube, we should not forget the North Sea."
"Finally I would like to express my thanks, in particular for the remark that we should take moral responsibility for the sea and for future generations."
"This is why I have chosen the title 'We need a new awareness of the sea'."
"If we continue to work on this, we will be able to achieve a great deal."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order."
"I would like to thank the chair for bringing the debate to a close today a quarter of an hour before the vote, because this is a dignified way of ending the debate, which allows us to finish speaking calmly and gives the Members time to come in."
"Yesterday things did not work well at all and the planning was not how we would like it."
"Today everything is as it should be and I hope that the chair will take this into account in future and schedule sufficient spare time between the end of the debate and the start of voting."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"It is important for the EU to ensure that its coasts are protected."
"It is also necessary for the legislation in force to make oil exploration and extraction safer."
"The Lisbon-based European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) provides support and technical assistance for drawing up and applying Union legislation on maritime safety and protection, as well as on pollution caused by ships."
"In June of this year, I submitted a written suggestion to Commissioners Oettinger, Kallas and Georgieva to extend the mandate of the EMSA to create mechanisms for supervising safety on European oil platforms located in the North Sea, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and to make it responsible for preventing environmental disasters related to oil exploration."
"This suggestion enables an economy of scale at the level of financial, human and technical resources."
"I welcome the Commissioners' response, which demonstrated openness to reviewing the EMSA regulations, expanding its mandate as regards intervention in maritime pollution incidents."
"I call once again for the European Commission to expand the EMSA's mandate, so as to ensure that our coasts are protected."
"in writing. - (ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as is well known, the International Maritime Organisation has imposed, under MARPOL Annex VI, various requirements on the amount of sulphur in different regions."
"The Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel have been declared a sulphur emissions control area, and more stringent requirements have been established for these regions to reduce pollution significantly."
"In these regions, from 2015, marine fuels can be used if their sulphur content does not exceed 0.1%, while for other regions the sulphur content is required not to exceed 0.5% from 2020."
"This issue was also dealt with at the International Maritime Conference, which took place on 24 September in Tallinn in my home country."
"I believe that it will not be a solution if the European Union comes out with its own requirements, but they do not apply to third countries; that is, we will subject ourselves to unequal competition in the maritime sector."
"The situation must be resolved internationally, so that the requirements imposed would be real and would apply to all those sailing in the Baltic Sea, not only to vessels from EU Member States."
"In addition, the imposition of irrational standards involves moving the transportation of goods from the sea back on to the roads, which is much more dangerous and hostile to the environment."
"On this issue, I therefore support the standpoints of the Estonian and Finnish governments, as well as the European Community Shipowners' Association - the International Maritime Organisation's decision should be reviewed and should impose equal rules on all EU regions and vessels operating there."
"in writing. - In my capacity as rapporteur on EU Strategy for the Black Sea, I noticed with regret that matters related to the Black Sea are almost ignored in the Union's integrated maritime policy (IMP)."
"Though the Black Sea was included in the IMP concept in 2007, concrete EU action on this dimension seems to lag behind."
"I strongly urge the European Commission to redouble efforts to develop the Black Sea approach of this policy."
"IMP is an important tool for addressing opportunities and challenges in EU sea basins in a coherent manner which is aimed at comprehensive development of the coastal zones."
"I am deeply convinced that the Black Sea, as a sea partially within the EU, and its littoral States have an acute need for proper application of this tool."
"The international dimension of the IMP is a crucial aspect for successful implementation in the Black Sea region, which also encompasses seven non-EU countries."
"The European Parliament is currently preparing a report on establishing an EU Strategy for the Black Sea."
"I hope that the Commission will follow this initiative and will regard the future strategy as an important basis for strengthened IMP implementation in the Black Sea area."
"Sakharov Prize 2010 (announcement of the winner)"
"Colleagues, I have just come from the Conference of Presidents."
"It is a great privilege and honour for me to inform you about the very important results for all of us."
"We are fighting for human rights in our Parliament on behalf of 500 million citizens."
"Following a substantial debate today involving very wide and deep discussions, the Conference of Presidents decided to award the 2010 Sakharov Prize for the freedom of thought to Mr Guillermo Fariñas."
"(Applause)"
"Guillermo Fariñas is an independent journalist and political dissident."
"He was ready to sacrifice and risk his own health and life as a means of pressure to achieve change in Cuba."
"He used hunger strikes to protest and to challenge the lack of freedom of speech in Cuba, carrying the hopes of all those who care for freedom, human rights and democracy."
"I hope to present the award to him in person here in Strasbourg in December, which would be a tremendous moment for the European Parliament and for all Cuban prisoners of conscience."
"I sincerely hope that, together with Guillermo Fariñas, another Cuban laureate from 2005, the Ladies in White - Las Damas de Blanco - will also be able to collect the Sakharov Prize in person."
"Let me add that all the candidates were excellent from the point of view of our feelings on human rights and fighting for these all over the world."
"We can congratulate all of them, but we had to make a choice, and there was no other possibility."
"I would like to underline that we have a lot of winners all over the world and we support all of them."
"Let us say that once again."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Madam President, I wish to make a point of order."
"I believe that the conditions in which the Sakharov Prize has been decided this year are scandalous."
"As I see it, political choices are taking precedence over the actual defence of human rights."
"(Applause)"
"This will be the third time in the history of the Sakharov Prize that it has been awarded to a Cuban."
"I am the first to denounce the way in which human rights are threatened in Cuba."
"I have no hesitations on that score."
"I have always fought for the protection of human rights, without distinction."
"However, I think that awarding the Sakharov Prize to a Cuban for the third time in its 20-odd-year history is a lot, and we are sending out a political signal that devalues the Sakharov Prize."
"That is why I call for the decision on who should receive the Sakharov Prize to be taken not in the Conference of Presidents but by Parliament as a whole."
"(Applause)"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"

"Instrument for Stability ("

"Indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries ("
"Madam President, Parliament has already, on several occasions, expressed its support for the aims of the regulation."
"With a vote in favour today, the people of Europe will have the right to know the origin of what they buy."
"However, if we reject the regulation, as we are asked to do in Amendment 45, it would mean denying Europeans rights that are already enjoyed by the people of China, India and the United States."
"I am grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Susta and Mr Rinaldi, and to all those who worked to reach a compromise, and I hope that the democratic deficit that European consumers have endured up to now will finally cease to exist."
"- That is clearly rejected."
"It was very clear, colleagues."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 19:"
"Madam President, we call for the words 'or commercial' in the second paragraph of Amendment 19 to be deleted in order to make the text clearer and more applicable."
"(IT) Madam President, I call for a check on parts 2 and 3 of paragraph 43."
"No, it was clear and I am not going back now."
"7."
"Future of European standardisation ("
"8."
"Ukraine ("
"Madam President, if we cannot find a majority, then I want to ask the House to move the vote on the resolution to the next meeting in Strasbourg."
"We had a very open discussion yesterday and many of us expressed concerns about some of the developments in Ukraine."
"We will have a debate with the Foreign Minister next week."
"We will have an election observation mission."
"We will have the PCC meeting in Kiev and Odessa at the beginning of next month."
"So it would be fair if we have the vote on the resolution immediately after that visit, at the Brussels part-session."
"I hope Members can agree to that and support it."
"Thank you, Mr Swoboda."
"I will take another speaker in favour if there is a speaker in favour."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to support Mr Swoboda's proposal."
"I think it will be, on our part - on the European Parliament's part - a sensible thing for our assessment of the situation in Ukraine, which we discussed yesterday, to be moved to the next part-session of Parliament."
"This will be after important events have taken place in Ukraine and our perspective will then be significantly broader."
"We will have at our disposal the report of our fellow Members who are going to the elections in Ukraine, and it seems to me that Parliament will act wisely by moving the vote."
"Thank you, Mr Kamiński."
"I think I have a speaker against in Mr Gahler."
"Is that correct?"
"Madam President, I ask my colleagues to vote against the postponement."
"We must speak out before the elections, so it must be now."
"It is an issue about fair elections in a European country and that cannot be a partisan issue."
"Last time in 2004 we could only speak out after the falsified elections and we were united."
"This time there is ample evidence beforehand of security service interference and a massive practice of non-admittance or of fake local party lists to confuse voters."
"So let us be united again for the sake of democracy."
"I think the massive lobbying of the Ukrainian Embassies throughout Europe towards us to prevent this resolution is proof of how right we are to speak out now."
"I now put to the vote Mr Swoboda's proposition that the vote should be delayed."
"(IT) Madam President, please can you just clarify whether the request is to refer it to Brussels or to Strasbourg, because I have heard both versions?"
"It seems to be to Brussels: is everyone clear that the proposition is to refer it to Brussels?"
"On that basis, I put the proposition to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request to postpone the vote)"
"9."
"Implemented reforms and developments in the Republic of Moldova ("
"Madam President, the oral amendment is on amendment 1 to paragraph 3."
"It proposes the replacement of 'road map' with 'action plan' as this is the correct formulation."
"So this amendment will now read 'Calls on the Council to invite the Commission to quickly develop the action plan' and so on."
"Madam President, I wish to move an oral amendment which is simply a stylistic improvement to paragraph 11."
"This will ensure the dignity of our House, which should not 'call on' or 'ask' an illegitimate de facto authority to behave better."
"In making a reminder of the right of Moldovan citizens to vote, 'calls on' should be replaced by 'states that' and after 'Transnistria', 'have no right to prevent ...' should be inserted."
"Please support this oral amendment."
"We should not ask the authorities, but insist."
"10."
"Integrated Maritime Policy ("
"(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I concur with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs that in order to underline the need for a worldwide agreement on environmental measures within the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a minor amendment of the text is needed."
"Specifically, reference is made to the outcome of the 61st session of the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee a few weeks ago."
"The following words, which I will quote in English, should be added immediately after this: 'and maintaining its call for further substantial progress within the IMO'."
"Are there any objections?"
"It seems not to be the case so we will proceed with the vote on Amendment 1 by roll-call vote."
"11."
"Trade relations with Latin America ("
"Voting time"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(PL) Thank you very much, Madam President."
"In that case, I will start again."
"In recent years, the European Union economy has often suffered because of crises and financial instability both at local and global levels."
"In order to prevent similar dangerous situations in the future, pre-prepared support plans must exist, and there must be an appropriate reaction both before and after the problem."
"The Instrument for Stability fills this role very well."
"Financial and technical support should also include the promotion of human and economic development as well as consultations in the event of the violation of human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms."
"I also support the position of the rapporteur on improvement of the strategic planning sector."
"This is particularly important in the prevention of social conflicts and in the creation of the External Action Service."
"- Mr President, having voted for the Brantner report, I would like to use this opportunity to turn the Commission's and Council's attention to the need to reach a tripartite agreement on the modification of the stability instrument in the shortest possible time."
"The disputed issue relates to the delegated acts and Parliament's options to exercise its rightful scrutiny over the use of the EU's financial instruments."
"What we need is a rapid political solution based on balance between the EU's three institutions."
"I would also encourage the Commission to improve its reporting to the European Parliament on such issues as project design, implementation and review."
"While Parliament receives information from the Commission on exceptional assistance measures, the Commission's reporting on broader strategic and analytical terms is still falling short of Parliament's expectations."
"(PL) The instrument for development cooperation contributes directly to the spread of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in partner countries and regions."
"It provides support, not only for lasting social, economic and political development, but also for gradual integration of these countries with the world economy."
"As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to point out yet one more benefit arising from this cooperation, namely international cooperation in the management of natural resources, protection of the environment and care for biodiversity."
"I support, in particular, Amendment 5, which draws attention to the importance of the sugar sector to the economy."
"We should not forget that food security is of enormous importance to developing countries."
"- Mr President, I was delighted to vote in favour of this report."
"I would like to say that the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Gay Mitchell, could not be here today as last night he was in Ireland launching a book he had written."
"Of course, he was recognised as MEP of the year for his work in the whole development area."
"One point that I think we need to stress more is education."
"An Irish educationalist once said 'educate that you may be free', and I think we need to home in on this a bit more in the whole area of development and third countries."
"Finally, I just want to say jocosely that my suit was stolen from my office last night; do I qualify for development aid as a result of that?"
"(HU) I welcome the Commission's proposal to review the European standardisation system in order to correct its deficiencies and create a proper balance among the European, national and international dimensions."
"We need a system that contributes to European innovation and sustainable development, increases the competitiveness of the European Union, and strengthens its position in international trade."
"I would also like to add that although SMEs are fundamental parts of the European market, I believe that they do not participate in the standardisation system sufficiently, therefore they are not able to take full advantage of the benefits of standardisation."
"The improvement of their representation and participation in the system may be of fundamental importance in the future."
"The unifying nature of European standardisation improves the efficiency of the internal market, and, at the same time, emphasises the European Union's role as an economic and political partner on the world market."
"(ET) I would like to speak about Mrs Muscardini's report."
"I did not support it, having given careful consideration to all the issues contained therein."
"Why?"
"Because the rest of the world would interpret the European Union's imposition of such a measure at this time as a protectionist step."
"The monitoring of this measure would require much more time, and potentially also more staff, unpacking of items and other procedures."
"The obligatory marking requirement will be an incentive to start counterfeiting parts of anonymous goods."
"So instead of an actual labelling of the specific country, we may find fake 'made in Italy', 'made in France' labelling, and we do not want that."
"(LT) I voted for the motion for a resolution on Moldova."
"Moldova has come a long way since the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact divided Europe into zones of influence and Moldova remained in the Soviet sphere of influence."
"Today Moldova is an independent state, which admittedly has many problems, but which is following the road to European integration."
"Today once again I would like to call on the whole of Moldova's political class, its political elite, all of its democratic political forces and national minorities to reject counterproductive confrontation, and to develop a culture of consensus and political compromise."
"I think they should offer society an inclusive vision of the Republic of Moldova, whose objective is European Union Membership for the Republic of Moldova."
"In the resolution we also speak about Transnistria, the frozen conflict."
"Transnistria must be high on the EU agenda and all countries, including Russia, must respect Moldova's territorial integrity."
"Transnistria must be part of the Republic of Moldova."
"(LT) I voted for the resolution on integrated maritime policy (IMP), because the maritime sector is vitally important and I want to leave future generations clean and safe seas."
"The geostrategic importance of the seas has increased greatly."
"We must adapt the seas and their resources and coordinate actions, therefore the integrated maritime policy is important as all areas of maritime policy will be linked: maritime transport, fishing, aquaculture, energy, safety at sea, protection of the maritime environment and scientific research as well as tourism."
"In particular I would like to draw attention to the economic and social importance simply because the European Union has 320 000 km of sea coast and a third of our citizens - and the trend is rising - live on the coast."
"I believe that the seas should continue to be the driving force of economic growth."
"(SK) The European Union represents the biggest source of direct international investment in Latin America."
"Even though trade between these two regions has intensified, mutual trading between the EU and Latin America is less dynamic compared to trade relations with other regions of the world."
"The recently concluded agreement on free trade zone with Korea is an example of good will, while in the case of the Latin American trade group MERCOSUR, negotiations have been conducted since as early as 1999, having even been interrupted for five years."
"I personally support the process of strengthening and diversifying trade relations with Latin America, including the establishment of a firmer legal framework."
"This opens up a market of nearly 600 million consumers to the European Union entrepreneur."
"The fact that Latin America shares with Europe common values, language, history and culture is also of some significance for European Union traders."
"Mr President, I would like to commend the rapporteur on trade with Latin America for this eventually well-balanced and timely report."
"The deepening of trade relations with the Latin American countries is already under way, as the European Union has recently concluded a Free Trade Agreement with two Andean countries, Colombia and Peru."
"Recently, we finished the longest-standing dispute in the WTO with Latin American countries on trade in bananas."
"We will soon start negotiating a milestone Free Trade Agreement with all of the Mercosur countries with which we conduct more than EUR 62 billion of trade in goods. The EU's investment stock in the Mercosur region amounts to EUR 167 billion a year."
"These numbers are only set to grow in the coming years."
"The conclusion of such an agreement, along with the upcoming free trade negotiations with Japan and India, will undoubtedly be one of the most significant steps in implementing the EU's strategy of becoming the most important trade player in the world."
"Mr President, if any of our constituents felt a 'twitch in the force' yesterday afternoon, it was because of the extraordinary coincidence of timing that, at the very moment when the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was on his feet in the House of Commons announcing the most severe spending reductions that my country has known since the 1920s, we in this Chamber were voting through increases in the European budget which will cost the United Kingdom taxpayer GBP 880 million."
"That is not our share of the budget."
"That is our share of the increase."
"Since we announced yesterday 490 000 job losses in the public sector, it is perhaps worth quantifying that sum in terms of public sector appointments."
"It would have paid for 15 000 National Health Service doctors, for 30 000 nurses, for 35 000 police officers or for 50 000 army privates."
"It is not just Britain."
"All of our Member States are looking to make reductions in their national budgets and yet the European Union budget keeps expanding, soaking up their savings."
"If only the hunger of this Chamber for new powers were matched by its interest in exercising properly the powers it already has - above all to hold the executive to account and to keep spending under control."
"Our voters deserve better of us."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to respond briefly to what Mr Hannan has just said."
"It is, of course, essential for this Parliament to have a seat, but the seat is established by our treaties and it is here in Strasbourg."
"You are right to say that we need to save taxpayers' money and that we must work towards being based in one place."
"However, the refuge of parliamentarianism, Mr Hannan, is here in Strasbourg."
"This is where we as Members of Parliament and representatives of the people can work together."
"Excuse me, this cannot be continued."
"This is not an explanation of votes."
"Contributions are now welcome to the next report, the Estrella report."
"(PL) During yesterday's vote on the Estrela report, I endorsed fully-paid 20-week maternity leave, because we need a fair and adequate minimum standard concerning the length and payment of maternity leave throughout Europe."
"I abstained from voting on the question of paternity leave and adoption leave, because the European Commission has announced that there will be a separate directive on this matter, and out of concern for the transparency of Union law I do not want the directive on the protection of pregnant workers to include questions of paternity leave."
"I hope the European Commission will soon finish its social consultations and present satisfactory proposals on paternity leave and adoption leave and also on the self-employed, so that all young mothers in Europe will have the same entitlement."
"(LT) I doubt if anyone would argue that the bond between a child and its parents in the first months of life is especially important, thus the new European Union directive will ensure mothers' right and opportunity to take care of their children for longer without fear of losing income or their job."
"The situation varies across the different Member States."
"For instance in my country Lithuania maternity leave plus parental leave last up to two years, but other Member States have a minimum amount of maternity leave, therefore I believe that the threshold we set yesterday is a very important achievement."
"I also welcome the inclusion of both paternity leave and leave related to adoption."
"As said, Member States have competence over family policy, but here we are talking more of worker protection and certain incentives to enable parents to reconcile work and family life."
"(FI) Mr President, yesterday we did indeed vote on Mrs Estrela's important report on maternity leave, how long it should be, and the money paid while it lasts."
"After this vote the media called and asked me a number of times whether I had voted for or against."
"I said that I had voted for women."
"I voted for maternity leave to last 18 weeks and for women to receive 75% of their pay."
"I think that we have a good system in my country, Finland."
"If they adopted the system that we agreed on yesterday there, the position of women in the labour market would be substantially weaker, because employers would have to continue to agonise over whether they could take young women on, because the costs of maternity leave would increase significantly."
"Opportunities for women to find work would therefore decline."
"That is why I wanted to make this statement."
"(FI) Mr President, I am also from Finland, and I know that we have an excellent maternity leave system."
"I nevertheless voted in favour of maternity leave lasting 20 weeks."
"I was thinking about the issue from the perspective of the other Member States of the European Union."
"I believe that longer periods of maternity leave are important for children's development."
"Newborn children are Europe's real capital."
"Mothers, children and families are the trinity on which the future will be built."
"Obviously too, mothers should not have to suffer financially if they want to have children, and the femaledominated sectors should not either."
"Women must also have rights when it comes to pay."
"We should be idealistic, however."
"We should have faith."
"This was a moral decision in favour of women, in favour of new life, and in favour of a new Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, the Estrela report yesterday covered a very important topic."
"I would like to say at this point that it was rather difficult for me to vote in favour of it."
"As a young father, I was present at the birth of both my children and I have to say that I do not know why I would have needed a holiday then, because I did not give birth, my wife did."
"This is all about maternity leave and we have included fathers."
"It is difficult point."
"Nevertheless, it is important for young women to have the opportunity to have a child and then to return to their professional life."
"I believe that this will be possible under the new system."
"Although I would personally have preferred 18 weeks, I did eventually vote in favour of 20 weeks in the final vote."
"We must now ask ourselves whether this will bring more justice and more children in Europe."
"Family policy in Europe is an issue for the future."
"I hope that we are sending out a signal that we have taken action in this area."
"Now we just have to hope that the Member States take corresponding measures."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted in favour of this report amending the Regulation establishing an Instrument for Stability because I consider a broader revision of the EU's external financial assistance to be essential."
"The implementation of the Instrument for Stability reinforced the EU's potential to respond to crisis or emerging crisis situations."
"With this in mind I believe that the Commission - while respecting the undertakings that have been made, namely with regard to promoting stable conditions for human and economic development and promoting human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms as the main objectives of the European Union's external action - should, on the one hand, improve its strategic planning and increase disbursement of the funds available for the Peace-building Partnership and, on the other hand, present a plan for mobilising financial resources for any emergency external assistance facilities or mechanisms created outside the Instrument for Stability in order to avoid having to draw on the funds allocated for this Instrument."
"To this end, I believe that the Commission should increase the low levels of budget disbursement in the future, based on a strategic vision for better use of its instruments."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Brantner's report, since it is a text that first and foremost proposes bringing European legislation into line with an important Court of Justice ruling on small arms."
"A text that calls on the EU to pay greater attention to civil society within the context of stability funding for crisis situations outside the EU, even though I believe that the European institutions, especially the Commission, should be vigilant in ensuring something that does not always happen, namely that the recipients give an undertaking that they are politically 'trustworthy'."
"Furthermore, with this report Parliament is asking the Commission to involve it more than it has done previously in matters relating to the use of financial stability instruments."
"Our Parliament, which represents the European nations and citizens, must play a more active role in these matters, and the other European institutions must get used to the idea that a parliament must be informed of the spending decisions made by an executive: at stake is the effectiveness not only of individual actions, but of the democratic nature of the European political system as a whole."
"The European continent has been shaped by long and bloody conflicts, which have finally been stemmed by, among others, the institutions in which we work."
"We should therefore be the ones who, in the first instance, demonstrate the greatest sense of responsibility with regard to the use of force in international conflicts."
"Moreover, even when force proves necessary, the current state of our civilisation calls for surgical rather than wholesale methods."
"Believing as we do in this cultural model, we have to set an example to everyone else and show that it must not be greater economic strength that makes a difference in the resolution of conflicts, but a range of instruments that always put human life first, and which permit the use of violence only in extreme cases, especially to protect the lives and strategic interests of the European public."
"It is not a question of taking a stand a priori, but of adopting a consistent and rigorous approach in which military capacity is merely a deterrent and will never become a vehicle for radically changing the nature of the European Union or promoting a system of values other than the one upheld."
"The EU is the world's largest donor of foreign aid, being responsible for over half of public development assistance."
"Together, the Member States awarded EUR 49 billion in aid to the world's poorest countries: the equivalent of almost 0.4% of their gross income."
"These figures are a good demonstration of the importance of European development assistance and, naturally, of the significance of the Instrument for Stability."
"That is why I see the strengthening of this instrument and the Union's greater commitment to development cooperation as important."
"Nevertheless, I cannot fail to stress that, while I consider it absolutely crucial that the EU remains committed to its foreign development-cooperation and humanitarian-aid missions, I cannot understand how it is possible that aid for third countries can be released more quickly than that for Member States that are the victims of disasters as has, unfortunately, been the case with Madeira: several months after the tragedy, it has still not received any aid from the Solidarity Fund."
"The Instrument for Stability is very important for strengthening the EU's ability to respond to situations of crisis or emerging crisis."
"Since the EU is the world's main donor of external aid and responsible for more than half of public development aid, it needs instruments that allow it to deal with crises, taking into consideration the EU's horizontal and geographical objectives and priorities, while simultaneously complementing the Union's geographical policies, objectives and instruments."
"In terms of development, the EU's objectives should be the fight against poverty and its causes."
"in writing. - (ES) My vote against this legislative resolution is based on my outright rejection of the Instrument for Stability established several years ago without the support of my parliamentary group."
"From my point of view, this is yet another of the Commission's mechanisms designed to interfere freely in the internal affairs of third countries under the pretext of seeking the political stability of those countries that are considered unstable at the Commission's discretion."
"It wants the European institutions to be the ones to decide how, when and why to use this tool, freely and without the need to coordinate with the authorities of the country to be stabilised; this makes it a de facto mechanism designed for the covert defence of European interests."
"I therefore voted against the report."
"in writing. - Conflicts in Haiti, Kosovo, Iraq, and more recently in Afghanistan have shed light on the crucial role that small arms and light weapons play in terrorism and organized crime, and in igniting new rounds of bloodshed after formal cease-fire."
"It is important that the Community adopts a truly comprehensive approach to the problem of SALW proliferation by targeting all levels of the illicit SALW trade chain."
"Given that 70% of global SALW stockpile is in civilian hands, EU should recognize and support the indispensible efforts of civil society in monitoring SALW trade and production at the local level and in raising public awareness."
"In addition, the SALW issue reveals the multidimensional nature of 21st century conflicts in general, and thereby the need for a stronger focus in pre- and post-crisis capacity building."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that EU should strive to hone its ability to manage crisis in the most innovative, efficient and cost-effective manner."
"Only then would EU be able to lead the world as a foremost global civilian power."
"in writing. - With this vote, Parliament has followed AFET's position in welcoming the Commission's proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability, as part of a wider review of the external financial assistance of the EU."
"Among other things, AFET, and now Parliament as a whole, agrees that a revision of Article 3(2)(i) and Article 4(1)(a) of the original regulation are necessary in order to bring it into line with the ruling of the European Court of Justice of 20 May 2008, which found that measures against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons may be implemented by the Community under its development policy."
"The Presidency, on behalf of the Council and along with the Commission and Parliament, is invited to develop a 'Declaration on a European Consensus in support of EU Action on SALW', which takes into account the respective competences of all institutions."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) because I believe that Parliament has closely monitored the way in which the DCI's provisions have been implemented since it came into force in 2007."
"In its legislative proposal for the mid-term review of the DCI, the Commission only suggested a technical amendment to allow the costs relating to taxes, duties and other charges related to the financing of the actions covered by the DCI in beneficiary countries to be financed from the DCI budget."
"I believe that this amendment will make it possible for these costs to be financed in exceptional circumstances, thus creating greater flexibility in the implementation of programmes and projects."
"I abstained from voting on this specific report, despite the fact that I agree and support the proposed amendments, especially those which restore the controlling role of the European Parliament."
"I abstained in the final vote on the financing instrument for development cooperation, because the money has been used, directly or indirectly, to arm and train the police and the military in various areas of Africa."
"In my opinion, financing for development should not, under any circumstances, be used for military or politico-military purposes."
"in writing. - (RO) We are all aware that the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) does not provide for any exception to the principle of non-eligibility for Community financing."
"As a result, this allows a certain degree of flexibility on a case-by-case basis."
"The authorising officer can, if appropriate, decide to fund these costs to ensure the smooth running of the programmes and projects."
"However, this flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because tax exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical."
"In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult."
"This is why I support the proposal to submit a request to the Commission to table legislative proposals for alignment with the RPS procedure and to ensure that this instrument complies with the new comitology requirements."
"in writing. - (PT) I am voting overall in favour of the proposal presented in this report."
"The financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) improves the European Union's previous development cooperation framework by combining the various geographical and thematic instruments into a single instrument."
"In conjunction with the technical amendments related to the financing of the actions covered by the DCI, which aim at greater flexibility in the implementation of their projects and programmes, the mid-term review of this instrument provides an ideal occasion for adapting the DCI comitology procedure to the new comitology requirements."
"The amendment in question is merely technical and is aimed at allowing costs related to taxes, duties and other charges to be financed from Union aid in exceptional circumstances."
"These exceptional circumstances may be justified in individual cases, enabling increased flexibility in how projects and programmes are implemented."
"The unanimous support that it received in the relevant committee demonstrates the consensus behind the proposal."
"in writing. - I absolutely agree with and support the tabled amendments, especially the ones on the delegated acts and restoring the European Parliament's right of scrutiny."
"But I abstained on the final vote on the Instrument (DCI) itself as, directly or indirectly, the African Peace Facility was funded through this instrument, and this funding was used inter alia for police and army training missions."
"I am of the opinion that development funding must not be used for any military or civil-military purposes."
"The financing instrument for development cooperation is another very important argument for strengthening the EU's ability to respond to situations of crisis or emerging crisis."
"Since the EU is the world's main donor of external aid and responsible for more than half of public development aid, it needs instruments that allow it to deal with crises, taking into consideration the EU's horizontal and geographical objectives and priorities, while simultaneously complementing the Union's geographical policies, objectives and instruments."
"In terms of development, the EU's objectives should be the fight against poverty and its causes."
"There was a need to ensure that costs relating to taxes, duties and other charges relating to the financing of actions under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) could be financed from the DCI budget in exceptional circumstances."
"The overall objective of the DCI is to eradicate poverty within the context of sustainable development, with efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) included in this."
"This amendment will create greater flexibility in the implementation of geographical and thematic programmes."
"It will help partner countries to achieve the MDGs and to better integrate the global economy."
"As a whole, all five European Parliament reports on the financing instruments address the need to ensure greater control over the financing instruments for development cooperation, for the promotion of democracy and human rights and for cooperation with industrialised nations."
"In view of the excessive bureaucracy and not always rational use of the opportunities open to the EU, this type of resolution could serve as a catalyst and speed up the processes described in the reports."
"In the given situation, Members of the European Parliament become participants in the stabilisation and improvement process, by being given the opportunity to observe and control fund allocation processes."
"in writing. - Parliament has closely scrutinised the way the provisions of the DCI are implemented ever since it came into force in 2007."
"In the exercise of its right of scrutiny under the Comitology procedure, Parliament has raised a number of problems and objections regarding the way the Commission implemented the instrument, and the interpretation it gave to some of its core provisions."
"Parliament, however, did not find any major shortcomings in the provisions of the instrument as such."
"One of Parliament's major concerns, the propensity of the Commission to finance under the geographical programmes measures not eligible, under the internationally accepted criteria of the OECD/DAC, as Official Development Assistance (ODA), has recently been solved by the Commission when it proposed, at Parliament's request, the creation of a new legal basis for such measures under the Instrument for Cooperation with Industrialised Countries."
"I voted in favour of Mr Mitchell's report on establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation."
"Indeed, the adoption of the Mitchell report will enable non-governmental organisations operating in developing countries to benefit from tax concessions."
"By adopting these procedures the European Parliament will assume a more important role with regard to the strategic financing decisions that the European Commission will have to make, and the rules for implementing EU development policy will be more clearly defined."
"I voted in favour of the report on the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (ICI Regulation) which aims to support economic, financial and technical cooperation, as well as research and academic exchange falling within the Community's spheres of competence."
"I believe that the changes proposed by the Commission are substantial, since all the current references to partner countries (which, so far only covered the industrialised and other high-income countries and territories), including their qualitative assessment, must also begin to include the developing countries listed."
"This broader geographical coverage represents an opportunity, as programmes currently funded under the ICI Regulations can now be extended to other countries."
"However, this also presents a greater challenge."
"It is therefore important to make very clear to whom this financing can be given, for what and under what conditions."
"I am voting in favour of the set of proposals presented in this report."
"The EIDHR, as a financial instrument that aims to promote the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, as well as contributing to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in third countries, is an important channel for the Union's aid in terms of rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"The Commission's legislative proposal for a mid-term review of the EIDHR provides a suitable opportunity for reviewing the legal basis of this instrument, ensuring that henceforth it complies with the new requirements set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."
"In particular, these include the delegated acts procedure (Article 290 TFEU), which significantly strengthens Parliament's powers and grants it the right of veto, requiring the Commission to present an amended proposal for acts adopted under codecision."
"Like the resolution arising from the report drawn up by my colleague Mr Mitchell amending Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation, and Regulation (EC) No 1889/2006 on establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide, this resolution too recognises the need to make an eminently technical amendment to legislation along the same lines."
"I believe that the European Union should continue to play a central role in defending and promoting democracy and human rights, not just in its discourse but above all in its political practice; it is absolutely necessary, and even urgent, to do this in a way that is coordinated with the United States."
"With today's vote we have taken steps to align two important legislative instruments with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I refer specifically to the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) and the Regulation establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide (EIDHR)."
"Technical amendments have been tabled in order to allow the costs of taxes and charges relating to the financing of common actions in these fields to be financed from the budget for the two instruments."
"Until now, in fact, there have been no exceptions to the principle of non-eligibility of such costs."
"To conclude, I would emphasise that these amendments have a great practical impact, in that they will enable EIDHR and DCI projects to be implemented with greater flexibility than at present."
"The financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide is another very important argument for strengthening the EU's ability to respond to situations of crisis or emerging crisis."
"Since the EU is the world's main donor of external aid and responsible for more than half of public development aid, it needs instruments that allow it to deal with crises, taking into consideration the EU's horizontal and geographical objectives and priorities, while simultaneously complementing the Union's geographical policies, objectives and instruments."
"In terms of development, the EU's objectives should be the fight against poverty and its causes."
"In the specific case of this instrument, this legislative proposal is aimed solely at a technical amendment that will make this instrument more flexible when implementing programmes and projects."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted against this report because, although it seeks to give Parliament greater democratic control over the 'instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide', the instrument itself, whether or not it is controlled by Parliament, is a means for the EU to interfere in the internal affairs of third countries."
"Using this instrument, the Commission, applying its own criteria to decide what is meant by promoting democracy and human rights, and what constitutes the risk, abuse or repression of those rights, has the option of using its own discretion to finance and support associations, political parties, foundations and even specific individuals from third countries without communicating or coordinating with the government of the country in question."
"My vote against is based on my outright rejection of this instrument, which, four years after its adoption and as we said at the time, has become a tool for the covert defence of EU interests in third countries, disguising that defence under the discretionary mantle of human rights and democracy."
"in writing. - In its legislative proposal for the mid-term review of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), the Commission only proposes one technical amendment allowing costs related to taxes, duties and other charges related to the financing of actions under the DCI and EIDHR in beneficiary countries, to be financed from the budget of the instruments."
"So far, DCI and EIDHR have been the only financial instruments not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs."
"The amendment will allow for the financing of these costs in exceptional circumstances, thus creating greater flexibility in the implementation of programmes and projects."
"For EIDHR projects, this is particularly important, given the special circumstances in which they are carried out."
"Governments might indeed be reluctant to grant exemptions for projects they do not support."
"The proposed amendment by the Commission should therefore be welcomed."
"I voted in favour of the report on the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (ICI Regulation) which aims to support economic, financial and technical cooperation, as well as research and academic exchange falling within the Community's spheres of competence, because I believe that the changes proposed by the Commission are substantial, since all the current references to partner countries (which, so far only covered the industrialised and other high-income countries and territories), including their qualitative assessment, must also begin to include the listed developing countries."
"This broader geographical coverage represents an opportunity, as programmes currently funded under the ICI Regulations can now be extended to other countries."
"However, this also represents a greater challenge."
"It is therefore important to make very clear to whom this financing can be given, for what and under what conditions."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of Mr Scholz's report because I believe that trade policy plays a crucial role in creating wealth and consolidating political ties."
"The instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories encourages long-term political and economic ties, with the aim of consolidating the EU's profile and influence on the international stage."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Scholz for his excellent cooperation with the other political groups during the negotiation of this report's content."
"In this regard, I support the amendments which have been tabled as they explain the purposes for which this financing instrument can be used."
"On this point, the wording has been simplified and certain restrictions have been set on the framework of actions which can be financed."
"There are also some amendments aimed at creating a closer link between the issues covered in the programming and execution phase."
"I finally wish to emphasise how important it is to consolidate Parliament's role in terms of its involvement in programming, evaluation and reporting activities."
"Parliament must be more involved in drafting and revising the multiannual cooperation programmes, as well as be able to lodge objections against proposals of this kind."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution as I believe that it is in the interests of the Union to further deepen its relations with developing countries, in particular in areas such as economic, commercial, academic, business and scientific exchanges."
"The Union therefore needs a financial instrument that allows for the financing of such measures."
"On the other hand, extending the geographical scope of Regulation (EC) No 1934/2006 brings the developing countries concerned within the scope of two different external action financial instruments."
"Care should be taken to ensure that these two financial instruments are kept strictly separate from one other."
"Parliament has advocated the extension of the geographical scope of the financial instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries and other high-income countries and territories."
"This instrument allows us to establish economic, trade, university, scientific and diplomatic relations with major partners of the world economy such as India, China and Brazil."
"We have decided to give this instrument a wider geographical scope in order to allow new countries to benefit from it, countries which are developing ever more rapidly and which will soon be significant trading partners for the European economy, such as countries in Asia, Central Asia, Latin America and South Africa."
"I consider it essential for Europe to establish strong relations with certain regional and global players, by supporting them and establishing strong political and economic ties."
"I would particularly recall two countries with which Portugal has strong historical and emotional ties: Brazil and Angola, two important global players in South America and Africa, respectively, that the EU should increasingly view as partners."
"Given that the main general goal of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 is to eradicate poverty by achieving the Millennium Development Goals, cooperation is essentially limited to financing measures that have been designed to satisfy the applicable public development assistance (PDA) criteria."
"That often excludes other types of action that do not come under the umbrella of PDA but that are, even so, essential to the Union's foreign policy."
"It is precisely in order to regulate such practices - that include economic, trade, academic, business and science agreements and exchanges with developing countries - that the adoption of this regulation is being proposed."
"The financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries and territories is a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories."
"It aims to support economic, financial and technical cooperation, as well as academic and research exchanges."
"The aim of this regulation is to broaden the scope of this instrument substantially to include cooperation with developing countries, for which the overall financial framework should be increased."
"The geographical expansion proposed here is an opportunity to take the programmes to new countries and is also a major challenge, meaning that it is important to make it very clear to whom this financing can be given, for what and under what conditions."
"in writing. - (DE) The bilateral relationships between the industrialised nations and other high-income countries and territories, in particular in North America, East Asia, South-East Asia and the Gulf region, have been developed by the EU in recent years."
"The main objective of this is to enhance and strengthen the role of the EU in the world as a whole."
"Now the list of countries that come within the sphere of competence of the ICI regulation, which establishes a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories, will be significantly extended."
"This will result in a considerable increase in costs for the EU Member States."
"I have voted against the report, because it is likely to cause costs to skyrocket."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution as I believe that it is in the interests of the Union to further deepen its relations with developing countries, in particular in areas such as economic, commercial, academic, business and scientific exchanges."
"The Union therefore needs a financial instrument that allows for the financing of such measures."
"On the other hand, extending the geographical scope of Regulation (EC) No 1934/2006 brings the developing countries concerned within the scope of two different external action financial instruments."
"Care should be taken to ensure that these two financial instruments are kept strictly separate from one other."
"in writing. - The objective of Community financing under Council Regulation (EC) No 1934/2006 establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (hereinafter 'ICI Regulation') is to support economic, financial and technical cooperation, as well as research and academic exchange falling within Community's spheres of competence."
"As the Committee responsible for 'Union's ... external economic relations', including ""financial, economic and trade relations with third countries” (i.e. with both developing and non-developing countries), the Committee on International Trade (INTA) was also the lead Committee at the time of adoption of original ICI Regulation enabling INTA not only to analyze this Commission proposal in detail, but also to look at a broader historical and institutional context."
"The Commission's proposal for amending the ICI Regulation/2) is proposed in order to significantly extend the geographical scope of the ICI Regulation to include cooperation with developing countries (listed in the Annex of the proposal) and the overall financial framework would be significantly increased in relation thereto."
"Even though the changes proposed by the Commission may seem few in formal terms, they are substantial as all current references to partner countries (so far covering only industrialised and high-income countries and territories), including their qualitative assessment, would include also the listed developing countries."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament's resolution."
"However, I believe that the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, by drastically reducing the margin of heading 4 of the multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013, does not leave sufficient room for manoeuvre to face and to react appropriately to a potential upcoming crisis."
"By exercising its right of control as part of the comitology procedure, Parliament has highlighted a number of problems and raised a number of objections."
"They generally concern the way in which the Commission has implemented the instrument and interpreted some of the instrument's basic provisions."
"These objections form the basis for the amendments proposed by the European Parliament's specialist committees, which have been noted by the European Commission."
"They resolve the problem raised by the Commission's proposal to introduce an identical amendment for both Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 (DCI) and Regulation (EC) No 1889/2006 (EIDHR), which come under the remit of two different European Parliament committees - the Committee on Development for the DCI and the Committee on Foreign Affairs for the EIDHR - by splitting the proposal into two different legislative proposals which we are due to approve today."
"in writing. - (RO) I agree with the measures being proposed, which can be integrated at an earlier stage in the multiannual financial framework, as the problem to do with the trade in bananas is still going on."
"I am voting in favour of the proposals contained in this report in general."
"I believe that the role of the European Parliament is eminently political with regard to the Commission's proposal to create a programme of accompanying measures for Africa-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) banana-producing countries."
"I also believe that this programme can only legitimised by a paradigm shift from a purely commercial angle to the broader and more integrated one of development and the fight against poverty (goal number one of the Millennium Development Goals)."
"As EU-ACP preference agreements are incompatible with the agreements signed between the EU and the World Trade Organisation and since positive results have been obtained in the ACP banana-producing countries under previous preference agreements, we should support the adjustment, reorganisation and competitiveness of the banana exporting sector in these countries."
"In a broad sense, these accompanying measures for the banana sector should have a positive impact, not only for the producers, the first link in the production chain, but also with regard to the criteria for the fight against poverty."
"In this way, the whole chain may benefit from decent, acceptable living conditions and easier access to the markets."
"Economic, financial and technical cooperation, as well as exchanges at the academic and research level, between the Union and third countries constitute one of the priorities for European foreign policy: efforts in this area must be supported."
"The amendment of the regulation that the Commission is proposing enlarges the sphere of its application to a large number of developing countries."
"As the rapporteur makes very explicit in his explanatory statement, this change constitutes an opportunity, but it is also a larger challenge to the proper utilisation of this instrument, which could lose in consistency that which it gains in scope."
"This expansion requires additional financing and, at the same time, for resources to be made available in a way that is even more discriminating and rigorous, at the risk of dispersing funds that could be mobilised for cooperation projects that are effective and fruitful."
"The reasons justifying our abstention on this vote are the same as those justifying it in the vote on the report on the budgetary review to establish financial assistance for countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) that will be affected by the liberalisation of the banana trade between the EU and 11 Latin American countries."
"This liberalisation will mainly benefit the US multinationals that dominate the world market in the sector."
"As for the ACP countries, as several of their representatives have already stated, including some local producers, there is no chance that the sum of EUR 200 million that the EU is proposing to allocate to them will compensate them for all the effects resulting from these measures."
"We must therefore ask: what was the basis of the impact assessment carried out by the Commission following the signing of the Geneva Agreement?"
"Once again, the EU's proclaimed objectives in the field of development, particularly as regards poverty reduction, are subject to the commercial interests of its economic groups."
"Therefore, saying that the aim is 'improving the living standards and living conditions of people in banana growing areas and banana value chains, specifically small farmers and small entities' unfortunately has little meaning."
"I abstained on the report establishing a financing instrument for the restructuring of the banana sector in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States."
"Firstly, I regret that this financing instrument has a budget of EUR 190 million, when the ACP countries have estimated that they need a minimum of EUR 500 million to enable them to restructure the sector and become competitive."
"Secondly, I regret that this report attempts, under the guide of agricultural diversification (an objective that nonetheless receives little support from the EU in the Economic Partnership Agreements under negotiation with the ACP countries), to use a financing instrument to manage the rapid disappearance (in the space of three years) of the banana sector in the ACP countries, for the benefit of Latin American producers, who are already leaders in the global market with a share of more than 70% of the export market."
"I did not wish to vote against this report, either, because the ACP countries and Europe's banana-producing regions urgently need assistance to cope with the consequences that have already made themselves felt following the Geneva Agreements and other bilateral agreements that have brought the customs duties on Latin American bananas down from EUR 185 to EUR 74 a tonne."
"The financial instrument for development cooperation is yet another element that is extremely important in reinforcing the EU's ability to respond to situations of crisis or emerging crisis."
"As the EU is the world's largest donor of external aid, and as it is responsible for more than half of the public aid provided for development, it needs instruments that allow it to handle crisis situations, considering the EU's horizontal and geographic objectives and priorities, while simultaneously making these actions complementary to the Union's geographic policies and its objectives and instruments."
"When development is the issue, the EU's objectives must be to fight poverty and its causes."
"in writing. - (DE) It is important and right to support the poorest countries by providing them with targeted and sustainable development aid."
"We must help the local people to help themselves in order to reduce the flow of migrants to the EU from developing countries."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"I voted in favour of the resolution of the European Parliament, despite the fact that the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, by drastically reducing the margin under heading 4 in the 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework, does not leave sufficient room for manoeuvre to face and react appropriately to a potential future crisis."
"in writing. - The aim of the Commission proposal is to support the main banana-exporting countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) via banana accompanying measures (BAMs), which are intended to last four years (2010-2013)."
"Although measures for which funding was provided in the past (special framework of assistance, SFA) were designed to help the ACP countries adjust to changing trends in international competition, we are still faced with similar problems today, and 'the sustainability of ACP banana exports remains fragile'."
"We must therefore look at the issue from the point of view of development aid and combating poverty."
"Our job in the EP has been to check that the proposed measures seek to attain the main objective of the EU's development policy, which is to reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty."
"I voted for this report because European consumers are entitled to know the origin of the products which they purchase."
"In other words, they enjoy the same rights as citizens and consumers in other large countries."
"This regulation ensures that, finally, consumers in the European Union will enjoy the same rights as millions of other consumers around the world, albeit for a limited number of product categories."
"In cases where there are various conflicting interests, we have a duty to protect our consumers, regardless of the interests of large distributors or individual lobby groups."
"Our fellow citizens must be better informed about country of origin marking and must be able to make purchases in full knowledge of the facts."
"Europeans still do not know, in fact, whether they are buying goods that have genuinely been produced in Israel or which have come from Israeli colonies in Palestinian territories."
"The standardisation of origin marking practices in the Union, particularly for agricultural products that come from Israel and the Palestinian territories, is directed to this end."
"I support this report because I firmly believe that origin marking based on a clear and effective method is necessary information for European consumers, who have to be able to choose to buy a product knowing where it has come from."
"Origin marking, in fact, is indicative of many other equally fundamental factors relating to the country or countries in which the production stages are carried out."
"I believe that the European Union should take a step forward in guaranteeing greater protection for European consumers."
"By voting in favour of the report on country-of-origin markings on certain products from countries outside the EU, Parliament is responding to the expectations of consumers for improved transparency in products."
"The European consumer will henceforth enjoy, as do Chinese and American consumers, the right to know the provenance of products."
"This proposal for a regulation will allow European businesses to promote their know-how, traditional methods of production and the high quality of their work."
"Finally, it provides fair conditions of competition between European businesses and the trading partners of the European Union which, in their case, already enjoy this kind of legislation."
"European businesses manufacturing high-quality products of excellence will then benefit from an instrument to protect and promote them in order to support them in the face of tough competition from countries outside the European Union in certain sectors."
"I voted for the report on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries, because I consider it important to inform consumers accurately so that they can exercise freedom of choice."
"European consumers have the right to know where the products that they buy come from, so that they can make informed choices."
"If there is one area in which the EU's involvement has been useful, it is in protecting consumer rights, by imposing rules that defend their rights and guarantee consumers enough information to consciously exercise their freedom of choice."
"This has been one of the standards to which European consumers have become accustomed and to which European producers have adapted."
"Therefore, for the sake of transparency and of protecting consumers, but also of protecting European producers, it is essential for goods imported from third countries to be correctly identified as such, noting their origin."
"I would even go further: if Europe is so restrictive in the rules that it imposes on its producers, it should only allow products that comply with these same rules to be imported; the rules for livestock rearing are a good example of this."
"The alternative is to allow low-cost products that have been made without respecting Union law to enter the market and, therefore, enter into unfair competition with European products, the production and/or manufacture of which is far more expensive."
"Our vote in favour of indicating the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries is linked to the need to make clearer the route that products have taken prior to reaching EU countries."
"We must go further, given that this indication on its own will have a minimal impact unless accompanied by other measures."
"A break with the current World Trade Organisation guidelines is urgently needed to enable countries to prioritise the development of their own production and markets, by monitoring imported goods, imposing the same minimum quality and technical criteria demanded of companies within the EU, combating dumping, effectively regulating the capital markets, penalising the relocation of companies, taxing financial transactions, and putting a stop to tax havens."
"The establishment of more equitable and fairer economic relationships is needed."
"These relationships would serve peoples and countries; they would support development and cooperation based on equality between states, and the establishment of alliances and agreements with countries on all continents; and they would combat the profound social injustices and inequalities of hunger, disease and poverty."
"I welcome the approval by Parliament, by an overwhelming majority, of the introduction of a European marking system for goods imported from third countries."
"It has been voluntary until now, and will become mandatory from now on within the Union."
"Let us remember, in this respect, that the Union is not doing anything new in this domain."
"The United States, for example, brought in a requirement of this kind in 1930."
"Nowadays, it is, indeed, essential for consumers throughout Europe to be better informed about the origin of the goods that they wish to purchase."
"Only a system with clear rules is able to tell them about the social and environmental conditions of manufacturing, protect them from health risks and, finally, help them make informed decisions."
"It is a victory not only for consumers, but also for European exporting companies which are already subject to strict requirements."
"With this vote, the European Parliament has signed the defeat of a system of unfair competition, and has thereby ensured that those European businesses which have opted for high quality and employment are not unfairly penalised by more lax regulations applying to their competitors throughout the world."
"in writing. - (DE) Without a doubt, European consumers have a right to be informed about products imported into the EU from third countries."
"The highest possible level of transparency and maximum rights are needed in order for it to be possible to make objective purchasing decisions."
"I am in general in favour of a project that aims to inform EU citizens of the origin of the raw materials used, the stages of production, but also the production, social and working conditions prevalent in the country in question."
"Unfortunately, the Commission's proposal does nothing of the kind."
"The mandatory 'made-in' regulation contained in the current version says nothing about the actual origin of a product or about the conditions under which it was produced and processed."
"Even prominent European textile firms, despite voluntary self-regulation, are unable to guarantee that raw materials obtained from companies in third countries and used in their production have not been extracted using child labour."
"I understand product transparency for consumers to mean something different."
"This proposal does not go far enough and does not meet the information requirements of interested end users."
"For these reasons, I was unable to support the Commission's proposal."
"in writing. - (NL) The Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the European Parliament today backed the line of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on origin marking, with the exception of Amendment 37 on pharmaceutical products."
"We voted in favour of compulsory labelling of pharmaceutical products since we believe that consumers have the right to know where their medicines and so on come from."
"In addition, labelling is important as it enables counterfeit medicines to be traced more effectively."
"Fake medicines are the most commonly encountered of all the counterfeit products in the EU."
"The European Parliament, which has always stood up for diversity, in defence of the cultures and traditions of individual countries, regards the regulation on compulsory origin labelling as being a necessary instrument to increase clarity, placing European consumers on an equal footing with the consumers of our trading partners."
"It is also a way of developing trade relations and traditional economies more satisfactorily."
"I am convinced that this proposal fulfils the aim of informing consumers accurately so that they can exercise freedom of choice in the purchases they make."
"For many years we have clearly expressed our desire to place consumers, and consumer rights, at the heart of political and commercial decision making, in the belief that rules are necessary to make the global market fulfil more effectively its function, which is to boost development in the world and make it more homogeneous."
"We regret that the Council has not yet reached a common position."
"On the other hand, we have referred to the need to have clear legislation with definite rules that can at last protect our producers and our consumers, as happens in the rest of the world."
"Thanks to the pressure that the Italian Government has been rightly exerting for years, an extremely important proposal has finally arrived in Parliament that will be of great use to consumers, in particular: they will be better informed about the geographical origin of certain categories of products."
"At the same time, Europe is bringing its legislation into line with that of its most influential trade partners."
"The aim is to create a level playing field between European producers and producers from third countries (the United States, Japan and Canada), which, moreover, as stated just now, lead the way where these kinds of measures are concerned."
"It will now be much more difficult for imported goods to bear misleading or downright false indications of origin."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"The voting indicates that the designation 'made in' is essential for market transparency and for proper clarification for consumers on the origin of the products they consume."
"It is necessary to strengthen the Union's economy by improving the competitiveness of EU industry in the global economy."
"We will only attain fair competition if the rules are clear for producers, exporters and importers, while also taking common social and environmental parameters into account."
"This regulation, therefore, is an important step for EU consumers to finally have the same rights that millions of consumers all over the world have."
"Although this law is still not applicable to every product imported by the EU, we must continue to develop so that every imported product has its indication of origin."
"The introduction of a European marking system for manufactured goods imported from third countries must enable consumers to know exactly which country the goods they buy come from."
"They will thus be able to identify those goods by the social, environmental and safety standards commonly associated with that country."
"European consumers have a right, in fact, to know the origin of the goods they buy and hence to enjoy the same rights as the citizens of other countries."
"This regulation will also help create a level playing field with many trading partners of ours which already impose mandatory origin marking on imported goods."
"It is in fact essential to guarantee fair conditions of competition with the producers of the EU's main partners."
"I believe that these rules could also help increase the volume of exports from developing countries, since many European consumers are anxious to protect these countries' craft businesses and small businesses in the face of the multinationals."
"Lastly, due to the specific nature of pharmaceutical products, I share the view that they should not be included in the list."
"in writing. - (DE) Origin labelling is intended to provide consumers with information which will allow them to make informed purchasing decisions."
"Many countries label their products accurately."
"However, in the past items which were advertised as coming from one country frequently came from somewhere quite different."
"Labelling is an area where it is easy to deceive the consumer."
"In principle, more accurate labelling is a good thing, but this report is apparently not in a position to guarantee that label fraud can be totally prevented."
"The procedures are not sufficiently precise and leave room for interpretation."
"Therefore, I cannot vote in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because I believe that consumers must know the manufacturer of goods they have chosen."
"As stated in the document adopted, information guarantees safety, and consumer safety and informing consumers must be underlying principles."
"Very often European Union Member States are only a link in the chain - a product may be manufactured here from raw materials obtained in a third country, so it is difficult to say who the true manufacturer is."
"An indication of the country of origin is also necessary to make it possible to protect small manufacturers, who are often crushed by large companies imitating original articles."
"It is also necessary to ensure the entry into force of common marking rules for standards of environmental protection according to which goods are manufactured."
"I voted in favour with conviction and enthusiasm."
"Mrs Muscardini's report is fundamental for the European economy and European consumers and is a measure that the entire production and manufacturing sector has been waiting for for a long time - too long, in fact."
"These are not protectionist measures but, instead, provisions to safeguard the health and freedom of our consumers, as well as the EU's strategic production sectors."
"The regulation brings our legislation into line with that of our important trading partners, such as the United States, Canada, China and Australia."
"European citizens have the right to know the origin of the goods they buy in the same way as other consumers throughout the world."
"With this regulation, we have an opportunity to grant consumers this right, even though the scope of the regulation is limited to certain categories of goods."
"I voted in favour of the draft legislative resolution of the European Parliament on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries, as I believe that consumers have the right to know where products they purchase come from so that they have information with which to make their choice."
"This measure is even more necessary in today's globalised world, as foreign trade is increasingly breaking down borders."
"Therefore, it is important to make sure that the provenance of products is clearly identified, and not just products that circulate inside the EU."
"This may also be an important step for progressing with more detailed labelling of various products in order to not only guarantee consumers' rights more fully, but also to ensure reciprocity in production requirements imposed on EU and non-EU producers."
"in writing. - The legislative resolution passed with a surprisingly wide majority of 525 in favour, 49 against, and 44 abstentions."
"This was mainly due to the fact that, at the last minute, the rapporteur introduced an amendment limiting the time of the regulation to 5 years, subject to further approval."
"This was mainly in response to the pressure in Council against the entire exercise."
"Because of that amendment being carried by 393 to 216, Greens/EFA voted abstention on the final amended resolution."
"However, Greens/EFA voted in favour of the legislative resolution."
"In a big surprise, an EDF amendment asking to introduce semi-finished products in the requirement for origin-marking was carried by 328 to 219."
"On the negative side, some product groups were kicked out from the marking requirement, especially pharmaceuticals and glasses and lenses."
"We are in favour of this report because we cannot conceive of not safeguarding European entrepreneurs who choose to continue to produce in the EU, thereby guaranteeing jobs and wellbeing."
"The rules stipulating that the origin of a product must be indicated are completely in line with what the United States, Canada, Japan and India are already doing and with the full implementation of the rules on transparency and consumer protection, which are cited in many directives that have already been approved."
"For example, for the purposes of the decision that we are about to take, I would cite the different but interesting case of the unfair competition of gold products that arrive from Japan: a 3.5% customs duty is applied to them, and once they arrive in Europe and are simply finished off, they are sold under the European trademark."
"However, gold products exported from the EU to China have a 30% tax levied on them."
"The problem with this text is that only a few categories of goods are provided for in the current proposal for a regulation."
"Our group has tabled a series of amendments with a view to having other categories included immediately."
"We Italian Members are working on a text that would go a long way towards making origin marking mandatory."
"I voted in favour on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries."
"With this vote I wished to emphasise the European Parliament's commitment to promoting European industry, the competitiveness of which must today be safeguarded and supported."
"Furthermore, the right for European citizens to know the origin of the products they buy will be guaranteed."
"However, I do not believe that excluding specialised and recognised production sectors with a long history and tradition, such as the optical industry, is in keeping with EU policy."
"We have detailed legislation on the marking of goods produced in the European Union."
"We give our consumers, both within the EU and outside it, information on the place of origin of these products."
"I think we must introduce legislation as quickly as possible which will include an unconditional requirement for the same information to be given by third countries which market their goods in the EU."
"This practice is already followed in many of the large third countries which are our largest trading partners."
"In many large countries, such as the United States, Canada, Japan and Saudi Arabia, consumers are guaranteed protection by a legal requirement for the marking of goods brought into their territory."
"It is important that the consumers and producers of our main trading partners be subject to the same legislation as our consumers and producers."
"Then it will be possible to speak of fair rules of play."
"Commercial policy can harmonise closely with development policy."
"Product marking can contribute to a growth in exports from developing countries."
"European consumers are sensitive to the need for aid to less industrialised countries, and their knowledge of the origin of a particular product can enable them to contribute to the development of poorer countries."
"Marking makes choosing easier for consumers, who often associate the geographical origin of a particular product with its market value."
"European standards are a guarantee of respect for the environment and the health and safety of consumers, and this affects the competitiveness of our products."
"I voted for this report because, although national standards bodies provide the backbone of the European standardisation system, there are significant differences among them in terms of resources, technical expertise and stakeholder involvement."
"These inequalities create a significant imbalance in their participation in the European standardisation system."
"This report puts forward a number of proposals for improving the system within its current restrictions, based on its strong points."
"The own-initiative report that we have voted on today is a fine summary of the various political points of view and contains a number of proposals for improving the standardisation system."
"This is a very technical and complex subject matter, but standards play a part in our everyday lives."
"Most of the objects that we use every day conform to very precise standards."
"From an economic and political point of view, the association of European legislation and standardisation has proved decisive for the free movement of goods and has helped eliminate barriers to free trade within the European single market, through the harmonisation of technical standards."
"The current system works quite well, but it is in need of some improvements, especially where governance is concerned."
"I refer in particular to SMEs, which must be able to play an active part in the creation of standards without incurring excessive costs or suffering a lack of representation."
"During the first half of next year, the European Commission will present the proposal to revise the system."
"We will continue our work to improve the European technical standardisation process, for the sake of our markets, our businesses and European consumers."
"in writing. - (RO) I think that a strategic approach needs to be developed to European standardisation and a review carried out of the current system so that it remains successful and meets the needs of the next decade, thereby allowing Europe to maintain a leading role in the global standardisation system."
"The potential of the single market cannot be fully exploited without the support of a modern standardisation system."
"Thus, completion of the European Standardisation System, which needs to be empowered, has been fundamental to establishing the single market, namely through its ability to respond to the growing need for standards that are capable of ensuring product safety for consumers, ease of access, protection of the environment, or innovation."
"I believe that European standardisation is an important means of promoting innovation, research and development, thus contributing to the Union's ability to compete."
"European framework programmes that support innovation and research and development can be a valid input in the process of standardisation."
"I also believe that European standardisation contributes to creating a level playing field for all market actors, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and microenterprises, which are so important to the dynamics of the European economy."
"I further believe that the Union and the Member States should give greater consideration to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises when preparing standards, as their participation in the process of standardisation often does not match their weight and importance in the European economy."
"Therefore, my vote is globally in favour of the proposals in this report."
"When the Commission expresses its desire to review the European standardisation system, it is essential to acknowledge the contribution that it has made to protecting European consumers and the internal market."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that 'the review of the European standardisation system should build on the strengths of the existing system which constitute a solid base for improvement, refraining from any radical changes that would undermine its core values."
"In this spirit, he presents a number of proposals with the view to improving the system within its current boundaries, and looks forward to further suggestions'."
"This will be a discussion to be followed with interest."
"I gave my full support to the report on the future of European standardisation since I am aware of its importance in helping to create a level playing field for all market operators."
"Mr Kožušník's report is, in fact, intended to make a decisive contribution to the ongoing debate on the forthcoming review of the European standardisation system."
"We are aware today that the full potential of the single market cannot be released without the support of a modern standardisation process."
"It is precisely for this reason that we are today sending a message to the Commission that is not aimed at the complete overhaul of the system - it does not require radical changes - but that demonstrates our intention to see it maintain its numerous positive elements, with new ones alongside them, in order to strike the right balance between the European, national and international dimensions."
"The report also advocates all interested parties, and in particular representatives of SMEs and all those who represent the public interest, including consumers, being encouraged to actually participate in the standardisation process."
"To conclude, I believe that a first important step has been taken today to highlight the need for specific action to make European standardisation fulfil the economic needs of EU citizens."
"in writing. - I welcome this report and the Commission's intention to review the European standardisation system;"
"I hope they pave the way to a modern, integrated standardisation policy."
"The current system has successful elements but it also contains flaws: surely it cannot be right that the outdated, 13-year-old European Standard EN1384 (Helmets for Equestrian Activities) is still in use today despite concerns before its publication and 2 subsequent upgrade mandates from the Commission."
"Perhaps at last, with the adoption of this report, we can deliver a result for two-time petitioner, my constituent Peter Downes, whose son suffered fatal head injuries in a horse riding accident and has campaigned tirelessly ever since for an improvement in safety standards."
"The European standardisation system has been fundamental in achieving a single market."
"It has played a key role in responding to the growing need in European legislation and policy for standards that are capable of ensuring product safety, ease of access, innovation, interoperability, and environmental protection."
"In order to address the future needs of companies and consumers and to yield all its potential benefits in favour of public and social objectives, European standardisation must adapt to the challenges posed by globalisation, climate change, the emergence of new economic powers and technological evolution."
"It is therefore necessary to develop a strategic approach to European standardisation, and to review the current system so that it can continue to be successful and respond to the needs of the next decade, allowing Europe to maintain its leading role in the global standardisation system."
"in writing. - (DE) It is true that the national standards organisations form the basis for the European standards system, but there are significant differences between them with regard to resources, technical expertise and commitment to shareholders, which reflect the differences between the states."
"Therefore, the aim has been to harmonise and simplify the system."
"Although small and medium-sized businesses are often referred to on paper as the economic backbone of the EU, they are over-burdened with red tape."
"The processes described here do not take inequalities into account."
"Once again they favour large corporations and multinationals which can afford expensive and time-consuming bureaucratic approval procedures."
"For this reason, I have voted against the report."
"in writing. - (DE) The aim of the report is the complete harmonisation of the internal market."
"Although it is acknowledged that small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European economy, the measures provided for in the report will, however, create difficult conditions precisely for these small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I therefore voted against the report."
"I voted in favour of the Kožušník report."
"The report contains many sound proposals and guidelines for the European Commission and provides a fine summary of the various points of view."
"There is no need to radically change the current system, which works well, but some improvements could be made, especially where 'governance' is concerned."
"I believe that the standardisation system must remain private and voluntary and must be based on the principle of national-level management, but I also believe that the public interest must play a more active role in the process, through real, effective participation."
"Furthermore, it is essential to guarantee proper representation for SMEs, especially in national technical committees, where they do not face linguistic or cost-related obstacles."
"I voted in favour of the report on European standardisation, because it increases the environmental safety valves of the current system."
"However, I share concerns that, in its text, the Commission has attached little importance to innovation as a catalyst in improving European standardisation standards."
"It is paradoxical that research and innovation, which we so frequently cite as the driving force behind our economic growth and competitiveness, has only a minor role in what is a vital sector for promoting European trade."
"The standardisation process plays an important role in ensuring the quality of public or private products and services, as well as in respect for safety, environmental and social-responsibility standards."
"This report seeks to involve small and medium-sized enterprises and society's various players in the standardisation process."
"The report promotes the sharing of information about the new regulations and also encourages the dissemination of these processes on information websites that are clear, simple, easy to use and in all the official languages of the European Union."
"Nevertheless, I still have some reservations about how well all of society's players will be represented in the standardisation process and about the process of financing the European standardisation system."
"I am voting in favour."
"in writing. - The purpose of this report is to contribute to the ongoing debate on the review of the European standardisation system."
"The European Commission is currently working on a 'Standardisation Package', which will include a legislative proposal aimed at revising the existing legal framework on European standardisation and an umbrella Communication which will set the standardisation policy for the next decade."
"In preparation for its 'Standardisation Package', the Commission has asked key experts to make strategic recommendations."
"These experts have been brought together in the Expert Panel for the Review of the European Standardisation System (EXPRESS), which delivered its recommendations in February 2010 in the form of a report entitled 'Standardisation for a competitive and innovative Europe: a vision for 2020'."
"The Commission has also undertaken a public consultation on the review of the European standardisation system (held from 23 March to 21 May 2010) and commissioned an Impact Assessment Study (9 March 2010)."
"The forthcoming 'Standardisation Package' will also build on the White Paper of 3 July 2009 on Modernising ICT Standardisation in the EU - The Way Forward."
"I am in favour of the report since it aims to review the European standardisation system in order to strike the right balance between the European and national dimensions."
"The report lays down important guidelines for conforming to a standardisation system that supports innovation, stimulates the competitiveness of businesses and interoperability, guarantees product safety and environmental protection, and eliminates barriers to trade."
"Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge the role played by national standards bodies within the standardisation system as a whole, in order to guarantee greater harmonisation of regulatory matters with the EU's trade partners."
"in writing. - (LV) The European Union must continue an active dialogue with Ukraine concerning its accession to our Union, although we appreciate that it will not become a Member State in the next few years."
"It is in all our interests to see Ukraine as an economically developed and politically stable state, with its closest partners to be found in the West."
"We understand that it will not be easy to achieve this, for that country must stabilise its financial situation and carry out numerous reforms."
"However, this must be done and the EU should offer its support to this work."
"The constructive work on the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement must continue and work on the extended Free Trade Agreement must be given a kick start."
"Geographically, Ukraine is situated in a very important location, which is also important for gas supply to the EU."
"That is why it is necessary to support the modernisation of Ukraine's gas transit system, in order to reduce the risk of interruption to gas supplies to EU countries, as has happened recently."
"At the same time, we must not turn a blind eye to violations of democracy, which have become more serious since Viktor Yanukovych took office as President."
"It is our duty to point out these violations and take a strong stand on compliance with Western values in Ukraine, for our Union is founded on those values."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution because I welcome the progress which the European Union has made during the last year in relation to the Republic of Moldova."
"Romania has been committed, since the moment of its accession, to championing the Republic of Moldova's cause within the EU."
"I believe that concrete proof of this initial commitment is indicated by the number of Romanian MEPs from various political groups who signed the resolution."
"The EUR 90 million granted to this country in macro-financial assistance was and still is the lifeline which Moldova and its citizens needed to make progress and, in particular, to meet the commitments it has made in the area of reforms, the rule of law and the fight against corruption."
"The motion for a resolution on the reforms and progress in the Republic of Moldova provides a spur of encouragement at the right time to the political establishment and inhabitants on the other side of the River Prut, with the approaching ballot on 28 November."
"The European Parliament encourages the country's democratic forces and ethnic and cultural communities to avoid needless confrontation and cooperate to create a European future for this state, whose economy has been hit hard by the recession and which is facing a major gamble politically and in terms of democratic reforms."
"It is the EU's duty to help ensure that the parliamentary elections are conducted properly and to take firmer action so that the separatist authorities in Tiraspol are unable to prevent Moldovan citizens living in the Transnistria region from exercising their vote."
"Indeed, the Transnistria problem is of paramount importance to the stability of the Republic of Moldova and the whole region, with the EU having a major role to play in implementing a negotiated, lasting solution."
"Increasing macro-financial assistance for the Republic of Moldova, encouraging structural reforms and the fight against corruption, boosting the environment for investment, as well as moving as quickly as possible into the operational phase of the dialogue on visa liberalisation for Moldovan citizens: these are the key elements of the support being provided by Europe to a state whose place is in the European Union."
"During the last year, the Republic of Moldova has demonstrated genuine political will as part of the process of rapprochement with the European Union."
"However, the efforts to modernise this country must continue."
"Indeed, the European Union must play an active role in supporting this dynamic development."
"In this context, I voted for this motion for a resolution as I believe that it is important for the European Parliament and the European Union in general to send a message of confidence to the Republic of Moldova in the run-up to the parliamentary elections."
"Moldova has been undertaking a positive convergence with European standards of freedom, democracy and good governance and is demonstrating desire to continue this effort, which I must welcome."
"The upcoming elections will constitute an important test of the robustness of its institutions and its democratic culture."
"Despite the positive indications, it must be remembered that many unanswered questions remain that are threatening its stability and progress, the most important of which is that of Transnistria."
"I hope that the Union will be able to make a committed contribution to a lasting solution to this problem."
"In view of the results of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership launched in May 2009, which recognise the European aspirations of the Republic of Moldova and Moldova's importance as a country with deep historical, cultural and economic ties to the Member States of the European Union, I am pleased with the progress made in the past year by the Republic of Moldova and I trust that the electoral process can further consolidate the democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law and for human rights in Moldova."
"I hope that the Moldovan authorities will carry out the necessary reforms and fulfil their commitments to keep the Republic of Moldova on the path toward solid European integration."
"I must also highlight the start of negotiations on the association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova on 12 January 2010, and I underscore the good results the Commission is having with the Republic of Moldova in this process."
"Once again, the majority in Parliament is attempting to interfere in a country's internal affairs, openly siding with the forces in Moldova that are championing the interests of the EU's economic groups, and attacking the country's independence and sovereignty, as well as the will expressed by its people."
"The insults begin immediately, when the text says that it 'welcomes the progress made during the last year by the Republic of Moldova', demanding that the country's authorities 'pursue the reforms needed and fulfil their commitments to keep the Republic of Moldova on track for steady European integration'."
"What is not mentioned is that the government in Moldova is the result of a coalition formed following an outright coup that made use of a series of provocative and destabilising operations to overthrow the Communist Party government, which had won the elections."
"Nor is it mentioned that this same coalition, once in power, launched a worrying anticommunist and antidemocratic offensive in a clear move to discredit the Communist Party."
"The position of the majority in Parliament lays bare its profoundly anticommunist nature and its hypocrisy when it talks about the defence of democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"I voted for this joint resolution because, given that there are elections scheduled for 28 November 2010 and considering the sectarian attempts of the parties on the right to promote the banning of the names and symbols of their main rivals on the left, it is important to stress the need for the elections to go ahead and comply strictly with international standards, giving all political parties equal opportunities."
"I also think it is important to reiterate support for the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, and stress the role that the EU could and should play in helping to find a solution for the Transnistria problem."
"The vote in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by my colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is essentially due to the prompt request for the Transnistrian issue to be resolved, since this is a crucial factor in promoting political stability and economic prosperity in the Republic of Moldova and the region."
"The European Parliament strongly supports, as it ought, the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova and points out that a more robust EU role in finding a solution to the Transnistrian question is needed."
"In general, the resolution correctly analyses the steps the Republic of Moldova must take to come closer to achieving in a more decisive and credible way the objectives set for any potential Member State by the European Union."
"In recent years Moldova has been making efforts to increasingly align itself with European standards of freedom, democracy and good governance."
"The efforts indicated here have been consistent and have shown that Moldova is intent on staying on its path towards possible EU enlargement."
"Moldova will soon be holding elections, which will be a good test for measuring the degree of consolidation of its democratic culture, as well as its institutions."
"Despite all the positive items mentioned, there are still some questions that need to see some positive development, especially the issue of Transnistria, which may cause some type of instability."
"The EU must continue to make every effort so that the reforms being implemented in Moldova remain on track."
"I fully agree with the motion for a resolution on Moldova."
"However, the only thing that I found to be lacking in the resolution is a crystal-clear opinion on the Transnistria problem."
"Moldova will not be able to become a full member of the EU if it cannot peacefully resolve the Transnistria conflict."
"Division of the country into two parts is unacceptable."
"If the Moldovan Government wants integration with the European Union, it must begin a dialogue with the Transnistrian Government, in order to prove to the international community that it has legitimacy over the whole territory of Moldova."
"in writing. - (DE) The motion for a resolution on the reforms and developments in the Republic of Moldova makes close reference to the association agreement which is currently being negotiated between the EU and Moldova."
"It is intended to bring about a significant improvement in the joint institutional framework of the EU and the Republic of Moldova, to allow closer relationships to develop in all areas and to strengthen the political association and the economic integration, while introducing mutual rights and duties."
"Alongside some of the other reforms mentioned in the text, a great deal of attention is paid to visa liberalisation."
"We need to put a system in place as quickly as possible."
"If we look at the problems which the country is still trying to overcome, it is a reasonable assumption that they will result in massive immigration to the EU, which is why I have voted against the motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - (DE) The aim of the motion for a resolution is visa liberalisation for the Republic of Moldova."
"The consequences of this for the European Union would be an increase in migration and cross-border crime."
"Such simplifications leave the door wide open to abuse, and a short-stay visa is only too often followed by permanent residence."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"in writing. - (LT) Moldova is one of those neighbours that is succeeding in drawing closer to the European Union."
"The areas of justice and public administration are being reformed and the fight against corruption is being strengthened."
"The issue of liberalising the visa regime with the EU is moving forward."
"However, there remain many unsolved problems, among them the question of Transnistria."
"The country is floundering in the economic crisis."
"The citizens of Moldova are hoping for specific reforms that would improve their lives."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution because it calls on the European Commission to continue to aim for full visa liberalisation with this country in order to encourage people-to-people contacts, and to continue to support Moldova and help this country strive for the objectives of European integration."
"The parliamentary elections on 28 November will be a big test for Moldova."
"It is an opportunity to show that its citizens have the same values as EU residents."
"I call on the political forces within the country to guarantee political order and stability following the elections."
"in writing. - With this resolution, the EP welcomes the progress made during the last year by the Republic of Moldova and hopes that the electoral process can further consolidate the democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law and for human rights in Moldova; expects the Moldovan authorities to pursue the reforms needed and fulfil their commitments to keep the Republic of Moldova on track for steady European integration; welcomes the start of negotiations on the Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova on 12 January 2010 and takes note with satisfaction of the very good results the Commission is obtaining from the Republic of Moldova in this process; and calls on the Commission to present an evaluation of the visa facilitation agreement in place, to advance towards swift agreement on a formal road-map for visa liberalisation and to offer targeted support and assistance to the Moldovan authorities to meet the necessary benchmarks for full visa-free travel; calls on the Council to invite the Commission to proceed to develop the road-map for visa liberalisation, thus entering into the fully operational phase of the visa dialogue based on the Republic of Moldova's progress following exploratory talks on the four blocks of the visa dialogue."
"I voted in favour of the report on integrated maritime policy (IMP) - progress made and new challenges, because I believe that the EU needs concrete measures to mobilise the economy of the sea, providing incentives and promoting the economic potential of maritime clusters, in particular in Member States and regions with large Exclusive Economic Zones, such as the case of Portugal and the Azores."
"I believe that intelligent growth, as recommended in the Europe 2020 strategy, can only be achieved if the different capabilities inherent to European diversity are intelligently mobilised."
"I believe, therefore, that reinforcement of integrated maritime policy is very important for promoting economic growth and the creation of new sustainable jobs in maritime regions, for protecting marine ecosystems and, especially, for encouraging the exchange of best practices."
"It is important for the EU to ensure that its coasts are protected."
"It is also necessary that the legislation in force strengthen the safety of oil exploration and extraction."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency, located in Lisbon, provides support and technical assistance in developing and implementing Union legislation in matters of safety and maritime protection, as well as in the area of pollution caused by ships."
"In June of this year I presented a written suggestion to Commissioners Oettinger, Kallas and Georgieva to expand the powers of the European Maritime Agency to create mechanisms to supervise the safety of European oil platforms located in the North Sea, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and for it to be responsible for preventing environmental disasters related to oil exploration."
"This suggestion allows an economy of scale in financial, human and technical resources."
"I welcome the response of the Commissioners, which showed that they are open to reviewing the regulation of the European Maritime Agency, expanding its powers in the area of intervening in maritime pollution incidents."
"I again appeal to the European Commission to expand the powers of the European Maritime Safety Agency in order to ensure that our coasts are protected."
"At a time when a third of EU citizens live in coastal regions, a trend which is on the rise, I believe that the challenges posed by climate change must be a major concern of Europe's maritime policy."
"In addition, the prevention and fight against the consequences of natural disasters must be supported by concern for protecting the sea and adjacent zones against possible industrial accidents, such as the recent oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Consequently, I believe that we need to approach the management of the seas' potential from a green and economically sustainable perspective."
"in writing. - (RO) Counting the seven outermost regions which it has in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, along with the Overseas Territories, the European Union occupies the largest maritime area in the world."
"Furthermore, the EU has another asset - its well-established maritime tradition requiring a 'blue growth' strategy to be devised, which must be implemented in close collaboration with the EU 2020 Strategy."
"Such an economic strategy can continue to develop the potential of the various maritime sectors."
"Indeed, local and regional authorities, coastal area communities etc. can and must play an important role within this strategy."
"Similarly to other European policies, the integrated maritime policy can help achieve an important objective - creating a competitive, social and sustainable European Union with a high level of employment, which may make the maritime sector even more attractive to young people or other job-seekers."
"At the same time, Europe must devise measures supporting intervention in the case of disasters, like the one in the Gulf of Mexico, and must submit a coordinated European action plan to prevent emergency situations and tackle disasters caused by drilling rigs, at global level, especially where cross-border pollution occurs."
"I voted for the report on integrated maritime policy because I believe that greater consistency between the various political sectors should be advocated, enabling use of the potential of the sea and the maritime sector in a sustainable and efficient way, from an ecological and economic point of view."
"in writing. - (PT) 'The EU has 320 000 km of sea coast; a third of our citizens - and the trend is rising - live on the coast."
"Our economic activities at sea and on the coast produce 40% of EU GDP and all forecasts suggest that there is still a great deal of potential for growth."
"Some 40% of trade in goods within Europe and 95% of exports outside Europe are carried out by sea.'"
"The rapporteur has summed up the sea's importance to Europe in just one phrase."
"As a Portuguese, I know it well."
"It is also as a Portuguese - a people that has always returned to the sea and found prosperity and wealth there - I consider it crucial for Europe to have a maritime policy that enables it to make use of all the potential that the sea has as an economic and energy resource, as a creator of employment and wealth, and as an engine for competitiveness and innovation."
"I am particularly pleased to pick out the concern about environmental disasters on the sea - I recall the case of the Prestige, which took place very close to the northern coast of Portugal - and the need for stronger rules to prevent them on the European seas."
"The sea offers important trade routes, acts as a regulator of the climate, and represents a source of food, energy and resources."
"Well into the 21st century, the sea is taking on a new identity, as well as geostrategic and geopolitical importance without equal in the history of humanity; today more than ever, it puts Europe at the centre."
"Europe must profit from its centrality."
"Member States such as Portugal must take advantage of their relationship with the sea and the extent of their Exclusive Economic Zone; in the Portuguese case, it is one of the largest in the world."
"Almost 40% of the European Union's gross domestic product and 40% of its population are concentrated in coastal regions."
"It is estimated that the total turnover directly from maritime tourism in Europe was EUR 72 billion in 2004."
"Nearly 90% of Europe's foreign trade and almost 40% of internal trade passes through its ports."
"I therefore advocate an ambitious 'blue growth' strategy."
"To this end, the Commission should come up with an overarching, cross-sectoral strategy for sustainable growth in coastal regions and maritime sectors by 2012, based on a broad investigation of potentials and policy options and on broad stakeholder consultation."
"The report presents a general vision of an integrated maritime policy linked to the 'objectives of the EU's external policy'."
"We disagree with this approach as well as several other aspects of the report, such as its insistence on the creation of a 'European Coastguard Service', following a federalist stance that does not respect the sovereignty and powers of Member States with regard to the management of their territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zones."
"We reject the proposal to 'introduce economic market based instruments' such as emissions-trading schemes into the maritime sector: these mechanisms have already demonstrated their ineffectiveness at achieving the environmental goals that they claim to pursue, even without having been applied to the maritime sector."
"However, we acknowledge the positive aspects that it includes, such as: the proposal that 'improvements in working conditions at sea, to safety and the environmental performance of vessels' should be placed on the agenda of international forums and in international agreements; the proposal to implement the 'ILO Maritime Labour Convention in Community law'; the recognition given to maritime freight transport; the preservation of small and secondary ports; the expansion of the 'short sea shipping network'; and the importance given to improving links with the outermost regions."
"It also proposes making sea-related sciences a priority in the Eighth Framework Programme for Research."
"As a Member for a port town in Normandy, and member of the Intergroup for Seas and Coastal Affairs, I have followed the report on the integrated maritime policy (IMP) closely."
"On various occasions, I have emphasised the need for ensuring harmonious cohabitation between the different uses of the sea, one that promotes traditional activities (such as fishing, and I asked for it to be placed top of the list of maritime activities included in the report, as a symbolic gesture), and one that also facilitates the development of new activities."
"Thus I noted that the sector of renewable energies, including off-shore wind energy, should be supported in particular, because it is in line with European objectives around the diversification of sources of energy supply, and can, between now and 2020, mean a gain of 410 000 jobs in Europe, according to a study by the Commission."
"Finally, with the rapporteur, I amended the report to apprise the Commission of the need to fund the IMP."
"The initial exchanges within the Committee on 'policy challenges and budgetary resources for after 2013', of which I am a member, indeed raised doubts about the long-term funding of the regional cohesion policy, some of the programmes of which relate to the IMP."
"Integrated maritime policy is a major challenge for the European Union."
"The completion of this policy must allow for the enhancement of economic activities at sea and along the coasts, greater account to be taken of employment and also greater environmental protection as well as the development of research and innovation in the maritime sector."
"In this respect, I voted for this report, which constitutes a significant advance, insofar as it emphasises all these elements through adopting an intersectoral approach and not a fragmented one, as could have been the case previously."
"Integrated maritime policy is enormously important for the European Union economy, because it can significantly improve its competitiveness."
"When establishing a framework for this, it is necessary to include strengthening economic development, increasing the level of employment in the sector and also protection of the environment."
"An important element in the strategy should also be a consolidated approach to the question of strengthening the role of European states in the field of research on the maritime economy and the development of technology and maritime engineering as well as the development of maritime resources."
"We should also remember to strive for the elimination of such dangers as piracy, illegal fishing and pollution of the environment."
"Integrated maritime policy should, therefore, include not only consolidation of several areas of maritime activity and strategic maritime economy as well as maximum use of maritime potential, but should also call attention to improving the conditions of work at sea."
"The European Union promoted and adopted the Maritime Package in the previous parliamentary term."
"It was a package which covers all the basic areas of the maritime economy."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism realises that around 90% of Union exports and imports are made by sea."
"It is important to have an integrated maritime policy which includes transport, administration, environment protection, management of maritime resources and also maritime tourism."
"These are important reasons which justify support for this report."
"With this report we are expressing our support for the package on integrated maritime policy proposed in 2009 by the European Commission, because we believe it represents an ambitious cross-sectoral strategy for economic development, a high level of employment, and environmental protection in coastal regions and maritime sectors."
"We therefore invite the Member States to extend the mandate of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) on safety inspections and to regulate offshore oil extraction in Europe, following the recent natural disaster in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico."
"We support the approach that consists of coordination and cooperation with third countries in maritime surveillance matters, with the aim of creating a common information sharing environment and of integrating the various national coastguard services."
"Furthermore, the European Parliament intends to intensify efforts in research and development in the use and application of renewable energy sources; to improve the working conditions of seafarers (the Maritime Erasmus programme); and, lastly, to ensure better links between peripheral maritime regions."
"We therefore welcome the creation of the Atlas of the Seas and of the Maritime Forum, and we propose the creation of a European marine research institute, to make the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODNET) operational."
"An integrated maritime policy is essential if we are to make the best use of the immense wealth that the sea provides for us, as well as all of the economic potential that the sea has."
"We cannot forget that our economic activities related to the sea and the coast produce 40% of the EU's gross domestic product and, according to numerous studies, there is still huge development potential to explore."
"In fact, 40% of trade within Europe and 95% of exports outside Europe is carried out by sea."
"Despite these figures and the enormous potential that still remains to be explored, there is no integrated European maritime policy that would enable us to stop giving separate treatment to our policies on maritime transport, the maritime economy, new technologies, coastal regions, off-shore energy, fishing, surveillance and policing of the seas, tourism, protection of the marine environment and marine research."
"This motion for a resolution will help to change the current situation."
"Maritime policy must encompass not only obligatory regulations on oil exploration and transportation, but must also offer twofold compensation for losses resulting from accidents."
"We must also draw up additional safety regulations, efficient reaction regulations and disaster prevention measures."
"In order to attain this objective, a fund must be formed to which all operators active in the maritime environment should contribute."
"If all the nuances are taken into account, we shall be able to prohibit dangerous technologies applied in oil exploration and extraction."
"This will also act as an incentive to the development of new safe and efficient technologies."
"in writing. - (DE) If differing emission limits are to be introduced within EU waters, this will conflict with the integrated maritime policy, which, as announced, aims to take all factors into account."
"We must not forget underwater nuclear testing in this respect."
"In particular in environmentally sensitive regions, in addition to catch quotas, no-fishing zones and regulations for aquaculture, it will be important to consider solutions for sensitive coastal tourism, military exercises, shipping, oil and gas extraction, sand and gravel extraction and also measures to prevent environmental catastrophes, like the recent torrent of toxic sludge."
"If a European coastal safety authority were to take precedence over national coastal authorities or navies, this would not be compatible with national sovereignty rights and would increase existing tendencies towards centralisation."
"Overall, this strategy does not seem to have been very well thought out and, therefore, I have voted against it."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted for this document because I believe that an integrated maritime policy is necessary to ensure an appropriate level of environmental protection."
"One of the most important principles is the coordination of various policies and the need to ensure the implementation of the ecosystem approach, which is laid down in the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive."
"In particular I agree with the tools mentioned in the document for the coordination of surveillance and policing of the seas, protection of the marine environment and scientific research."
"As a representative of Lithuania, a country in the Baltic Sea region, I welcome the fact that this document draws attention to broader research aimed at determining and assessing the current condition of the seas."
"The Baltic Sea is one of the seas worst damaged by economic activity and one of the most polluted seas in the world."
"As the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrated, sensitive marine ecosystems can be damaged in an instant."
"Therefore I particularly support the call on Member States, anchored in the report, to take more action to plan a wide-ranging strategy to protect the marine environment."
"The Meissner report is a balanced text that incorporates a series of important factors and requests."
"Maritime activities are one of the most important sources of European income."
"To quote just a few figures, they generate 40% of EU GDP and, at the same time, account for 40% of trade in goods within Europe and 95% of exports outside Europe."
"The report focuses on a few key points: the establishment of appropriate maritime governance structures at national and regional levels; coordinated and cross-border maritime spatial planning; maritime surveillance to protect the Member States and the EU; the protection of the marine environment; the creation of a strategy for sustainable coastal and island tourism; and the promotion of the European shipbuilding industry, which is already a flagship sector, and of maritime transport, in order to meet the ambitious objective of 'green shipping'."
"For the reasons stated above, I felt compelled to vote in favour."
"We absolutely must ensure that the communication between and integration of the various sectors that come under maritime policy are a success for a whole host of reasons linked to efficiency, competitiveness, and respect for and protection of the marine environment."
"in writing. - The EP agrees with the Commission that our 'strong maritime tradition' is one of the strengths of Europe."
"It calls therefore on the European Commission and the Member States to further develop the potential offered by the different maritime sectors by drawing up an ambitious 'blue growth' strategy."
"It considers that integrated maritime policy (IMP) should contribute to achieving a competitive, social and sustainable Union."
"It takes the view in this regard that the development of IMP must harmoniously incorporate efforts to attain economic development, a high level of employment - particularly by making the sector more attractive for young people through training actions and the launch of a 'Maritime Erasmus' - and environmental protection."
"It states, therefore, that the IMP should be interconnected with the objectives and initiatives of the EU 2020 Strategy."
"Moreover, the EP asks the Commission, therefore, to come up with an overarching, cross-sectoral strategy for sustainable growth in coastal regions and maritime sectors by 2013, based on a broad investigation of potentials and policy options and on broad stakeholder consultation."
"While on the one hand there is clearly a need to integrate maritime policy within the European Union, given that its associated activities produce 40% of EU GDP, on the other it is right to regulate such activities taking non-EU competitors into account."
"Too often, the rules on fishing, tourism, transport and environmental protection in the sector have been developed separately and with no regard for the risks associated with unfair competition from third countries."
"For example, extending overly strict emissions targets to all the coastal regions in Europe may create distortions of competition."
"Other texts on the issues faced have been debated and approved by Parliament and will doubtless need to be coordinated in an integrated manner."
"One such issue is maritime surveillance, which is crucial for controlling illegal activities that are often carried out near the coasts of Europe and which range from the smuggling of counterfeit goods to the transport of banned substances and illegal fishing."
"The maritime and coastal economic activity of the European Union currently generates 40% of the Union's GDP, and forecasts point to a high probability of future growth."
"For this reason, maritime activity is, without doubt, a very important factor and is one of Europe's strengths."
"I think further development of the maritime economy is essential."
"Existing Union maritime policy was created separately in such areas as: maritime transport, maritime economy, new technologies, coastal areas, maritime energy, fisheries, surveillance and policing of the seas, tourism, protection of the marine environment and marine research."
"Often these separate activities are carried out in ways which conflict and which have a detrimental effect on maritime policy as a whole."
"It is obvious that an integrated maritime policy will contribute to further sustainable economic development of the European Union."
"This will make possible, among other things, ensuring greater cohesion between different policy areas, creation of better regulation and cross-sectoral instruments and use of maritime potential and the potential of the maritime sector in an economical and ecological fashion."
"What is more, in my opinion it is essential to make this sector more attractive to young people by running training and activities intended to encourage young people to work in this sector."
"The report on integrated maritime policy concerns an important sector of the European economy."
"Maritime activities in fact represent an important source of income for the EU, both in terms of GDP and in terms of trade in goods within and outside Europe."
"I believe that certain issues should be emphasised."
"Firstly, the report states that future strategies in this sector will be tailored to the specificities of sea basins, but I believe it is very important to take account of specific regional circumstances, too."
"The new maritime policy will also be focused on the development of safe ships and will offer great opportunities for the future of European shipbuilding."
"Our seas should continue to be a driving force behind growth, hence why I believe it is essential for the development of integrated maritime policy to ensure greater coherence between the rules governing the various maritime sectors and, at the same time, to safeguard the marine environment."
"Until now, policies in the fields of maritime transport, the maritime economy, new technologies, coastal regions, offshore energy, fishing, maritime surveillance, tourism, protection of the marine environment, and maritime research have developed separately from each other."
"A fragmented approach repeatedly leads to conflicting measures, conflicts and inconsistencies."
"An integrated approach is therefore desirable that includes, first, a framework for governance with all decision-making levels and, second, all sectors and cross-sectoral instruments."
"In the context of the coordinated planning of activities, I support the call on the Commission to draw up strategies for the sea-basins that are able to take account of the specific features of the regions and play to their strengths."
"That would be a good proposal for the outermost regions such as Madeira, as it would enable the region to make use of its sea-related activities and establish cooperation with the activities of the other regions in the sea-basin of which it is part."
"As a matter of fact, thanks to their territorial waters the outermost regions give the EU the world's largest Exclusive Economic Zone, immediately making maritime and sea-related activities very important in these regions."
"I was pleased to hear the result of today's vote."
"Striving for sustainable exploitation and an integrated approach to the management of oceans, seas and coastal areas should be a priority for the European Union."
"I am convinced that an integrated maritime policy will bring beneficial effects both in the short and in the long term."
"The removal of policy barriers and the creation of synergy between different activities which have a direct effect on the European maritime space are objectives which we must not forget."
"I think the European Parliament should require the introduction of a series of sectoral measures, particularly in the context of the detrimental social and economic consequences which often hit fishermen when action is taken to replenish fish stocks or protect ecosystems."
"I voted for this report because the European Union has strengthened its economic and trade relations with Latin America, becoming its second most important trading partner and the leading trading partner for Mercosur and Chile."
"The aim of closer integration of the European and Latin American economic spheres is to create a win-win situation for both sides."
"Closer cooperation is required between EU and Latin American countries so as to push jointly for the swiftest possible conclusion of a fair, ambitious and comprehensive WTO Doha Agreement, in accordance with the commitments made in the Madrid Declaration."
"I voted against my colleague's report, despite the fact that we are from the same group and despite the fact that he managed to include several positive points in his report."
"Unfortunately, however, the forces of the European right managed, through the amendments which they tabled, to alter the content and tenet which he was trying to give to his report."
"I could not vote in favour of the report when, apart from anything else, it deplores as 'protectionist' the measures taken by Argentina to deal with the financial crisis and, on that basis, indirectly asks the Commission to impose sanctions, calling on it to 'regularly address the issue of market access with countries in Latin America'."
"I could not overlook the supremacy of the 'rules of the market' and of European interventionism in the internal affairs of other countries, especially against measures that support cohesion and protect the citizens in those countries."
"Trade and relations between the EU and the countries of Latin America must be based on equality, solidarity and respect for workers' rights and the environment and must not allow the interests of the strongest states and companies to prevail."
"The European Union is founded on a system of values with regard to which the countries of Latin America have made significant progress in recent years."
"Such progress should definitely be rewarded with further EU trade policy incentives."
"If we add to this the linguistic and cultural links forged throughout history, we have an opportunity to contribute, as far as possible, to the economic and social development of those countries, however varied their situations."
"It is also useful for both parties to understand what core elements are at the root of political developments in those countries and to intervene so as to prevent any abuses that might harm the countries and ourselves."
"We can only welcome the strengthening of trade relations, provided that development policies are monitored so that they continue to act as an incentive for improvements."
"In spite of the economic and social progress made in recent years, with Brazil being the most impressive example, 1 in 3 inhabitants of Latin America suffers from poverty."
"Children and young people in Latin America are affected to a larger extent by this scourge, with more than half of them being deprived of sufficient material resources."
"This situation is likely to affect their educational and career path, with a long-term impact on the societies in which they live."
"At a time when the EU's trade policies must play a significant role in meeting the Millennium Development Goals, I believe that we must focus more on supporting the countries of Central and South America in their fight against poverty, in increasing purchasing power and establishing sustainable development."
"The amendment I tabled along with Mr Dess and 77 other MEPs demands full compliance by agricultural imports with European health, social, and consumer, environmental and animal protection standards."
"It is, after all, extraordinary to demand that European farmers conform to the highest production standards in the world, while at the same time increasing the quantity of agricultural products that can enter Europe without meeting those same standards."
"Consumers must be able to benefit from a single level of protection, no matter what they buy, and farmers must be rewarded for their tremendous efforts, not subjected to de facto unfair competition on the part of third countries."
"That is my idea of a balanced food and agriculture policy, anyway."
"This resolution sends a clear message to the Commission and to third countries, which is why I support it."
"The report on trade relations between the EU and Latin America adopted by Parliament could well make case law."
"The trade agreements with Latin America contain an extremely sensitive section on agriculture."
"That is why Parliament requested that 'only those agricultural imports that comply with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards and minimum social standards should be admitted to the European Union'."
"From now on it is up to the Commission to take account of this policy requirement of Parliament in future negotiations."
"Within these negotiations, Parliament sought for particular attention to be paid to the outermost regions, due to competition from the Latin American continent in certain products, in particular bananas."
"That is why Parliament asked for the strategic and traditional sectors of the Outermost Regions (OR) to be protected and receive adequate compensation in compliance with the commitments made by the EU to these regions in 2009."
"I voted for the report on the European Union's trade relations with Latin America, because these should be a priority for the EU."
"The EU is currently Latin America's second most important trading partner and the leading trading partner for Mercosur and Chile."
"European trade policy should play an important role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and fulfilling international commitments to human rights, food security and environmental sustainability."
"The Treaty of Lisbon defines the EU's trade policy as an integral part of the Union's general external action."
"In recent times there has been a decline in trade between the European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean region (LAC) by virtue of the growing participation of Asian countries in LAC external trade, despite the fact that the EU remains Latin America's second-largest trading partner."
"While the association agreements between the European Union and Mexico and Chile have caused a substantial increase in the trade volume, trade between Mexico and Europe is still modest when compared with Mexico's trade with the United States."
"I therefore highlight the need for both parties to develop a broader range of trade-related economic activities."
"The bulk (over 85%) of LAC imports from the EU today are industrial products."
"In turn, more than 40% of exports from the region to the EU are basic products."
"It is therefore necessary to mobilise resources and technical assistance to identify and finance programmes that provide production opportunities at local and regional levels, and sustainable access to global markets for excluded communities and for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We did not vote for this report because of its contradictions."
"Although it is true that it has some positive aspects relating to the new realities of Latin America, several of its paragraphs are unacceptable."
"Positive aspects that we would stress, for example, include the acknowledgement that all countries have the right to establish the mechanisms necessary to defend their food security and ensure the survival and development of small and medium-sized producers."
"However, at other points it says exactly the opposite when it 'deplores the protectionist measures taken during the financial crisis by some Latin American countries, especially Argentina; urges the Commission regularly to address the issue of market access with countries in Latin America'; or also when it claims to be 'deeply concerned about the restrictive measures recently adopted by the Argentinian authorities on foodstuffs imported from third countries, including the European Union'."
"The support for the liberalisation of international trade that stands out from some of its proposals is equally unacceptable, although there are other, different positions in other points later on."
"in writing. - (DE) The European Union maintains good economic relations with countries in Latin America at WTO level, but also at bilateral and multilateral levels."
"These trade and economic relations must continue to be developed in light of the sensitive economic sectors of the EU."
"I therefore expressly support the amendment to paragraph 30 that has been tabled, which calls for 'agricultural imports to be allowed into the EU only if they have been produced in a manner consistent with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards and minimum social standards'."
"Our European citizens must comply with high production standards and should not be put at a disadvantage as a result of unfair competition."
"In order to be able to ensure that costs are covered, it is necessary to have planning and income security."
"These things also need to be taken into consideration in connection with free trade agreements."
"With the exception of Amendment 32, for which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has requested a separate vote and which we shall vote against, the report as a whole should be approved because it provides a useful overview of the situation as regards our relationship with Latin America."
"The European Union-Latin America Summit, held on 18 May in Madrid, gave a strong boost to the development of relations between the two parties: relations that become stronger from one year to the next."
"Neither of the two parties can exclude a trade relationship with the other, even though, of course, that relationship has to produce concrete results and lead to an improvement in our populations' living conditions."
"in writing. - Despite agreeing with many elements of this report, I voted against in the final vote."
"The report explicitly supports the reopening of trade talks with the Mercosur countries."
"While I support calls to ensure that imports from third countries are produced in a manner consistent with EU standards, an EU-Mercosur Association Agreement will have negative consequences for agriculture in Europe, particularly our livestock sector."
"The Commission has failed to carry out an impact assessment of an agreement on agriculture in the EU since it relaunched talks with the trade bloc earlier this year."
"As the EU is Latin America's principal investor and second-largest trading partner, and as it also provides the most development aid, we believe that this information is sufficient to develop a clear and well-defined strategy regarding the trading relationship between the EU and Latin America."
"We support the definition of clear guidelines regarding the best way to collaborate to promote political stability, to fight climate change, to manage migratory flows and to prevent natural disasters."
"A good way of providing the aid that Latin America needs is by strengthening the trading relationship between the two blocs, which, upon completion, will be one of the largest in the world."
"It is necessary, however, not to forget the outermost regions of Europe that may be affected by the importing of certain agricultural products, particularly the Portuguese region of Madeira with respect to banana imports."
"We will have to find a balanced agreement that allows Latin American countries to develop, while simultaneously not damaging the various economic sectors of some Member States, mainly in the agricultural sector."
"in writing. - (DE) In the last few years, Latin America has become an emerging economic region."
"Trade agreements with South American states represent a very positive development."
"As the European Union has already carried out very important development work, it should now further strengthen its position as the region's second largest trading partner, just as Russia is already doing."
"However, the EU should also consider carefully which states it trades with, as the exploitation of workers is still the norm in many South American countries."
"I have voted against the report because it pays too little attention to the sometimes very poor working conditions in Latin America and offers too few proposals for improving them."
"in writing. - (DE) The rapporteur advocates the complete opening up of the trading markets between the EU and Latin America."
"Moreover, the problems relating to the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement are not adequately resolved in the report."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe it is important to send a message to the Commission that this Parliament is determined to establish even closer links with Latin America."
"South America, for a whole host of historical, social and economic reasons, has many things in common with Europe."
"Our trade relations have always been excellent, but they must be strengthened and supported, including in the light of the new requirements of both continents."
"We must not, in fact, forget the importance of some countries which may in the past have been regarded as developing countries, but which are now true global economic powers."
"In view of all these points, I believe that Europe must continue to play its role as a preferential trade partner, guide and special point of reference for all the countries in the region."
"I voted in favour of the Scholz report, because increased support for trade relations between the European Union and the countries of Latin America is the result of major democratic reforms in this particular region and improvements to the framework for protecting human rights."
"However, we must ensure that future trade relations between the two regions will not hamper this progress and that products imported into the EU meet European standards in terms of quality, consumer safety and environmental protection."
"I also share the view that the Commission should show greater concern when executing or extending trade agreements with countries which continue to infringe fundamental human rights."
"I voted in favour of the resolution of the European Parliament of 21 October 2010 on the European Union's trade relations with Latin America, as I believe that the free market stimulates the global economy and may be an important factor in the development of Latin American countries."
"I consider, however, that the mandate that the European Commission received to conduct the negotiating process should be reassessed, as it is too old and no longer adequate for the current circumstances in which the negotiations will take place."
"In this reassessment there would certainly be a chance to insist on the need to conduct studies, prior to entering into agreements, about their impact on the fabric of European production and specifically on agriculture."
"A strong stance should also be taken against continuing to allow agricultural products to serve as a 'transaction currency' for commercial advantages at other levels."
"in writing. - The reason we finally voted against the text was that the more specific proposals to shelter Latin America from speculative attacks and climate change phenomena, discourage aggressive export orientation, avoid environmental dumping and hedge the liberalisation of financial services, got diluted in the process of building compromises, as counterweights to stop even more grotesque Spanish wordings."
"The appeal to forget the unfortunate Doha Development Agenda (DDA) at the WTO and focus future work towards trade regulation on new challenges was inversed and transformed into a thousand-times-repeated call for a swift conclusion of a fair, ambitious and comprehensive DDA."
"The concept of food sovereignty was lost, too."
"Instead of calling a spade a spade, the report only 'stresses the importance of...', after the rejection of any concrete figures, benchmarks and deadlines."
"This leaves the report without added value, compared to existing documents."
"On specific demands, it falls behind them."
"This report has our support because it emphasises the strengthening of relations between the EU and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean."
"The European Union's specific task is to act as an economic and commercial player on the international stage, overcoming competition from its partners, the United States and China, which have a foothold in the Latin American market."
"Few sectors benefit from these trade relations."
"Eighty-five per cent of the imports into the countries of Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) are industrial products, whereas 40% of exports to the EU are commodities."
"In the medium to long term, trade relations should be intensified in accordance with clear and transparent rules."
"The European Union is, first and foremost, an advocate of respect for human rights."
"This is why I believe that we must focus very closely on respect for human rights in Colombia before liberalising trade with this country."
"On the other hand, on the subject of food imports from Latin America, we must ensure that these countries comply with the same standards in terms of quality and animal protection which our own producers also comply with."
"European common trade policy is an integral and important part of the Union's general external action."
"It could play a very positive role in wealth-creation goals, and in economic and political relationships between the people and countries of Europe and Latin America."
"I have no doubt that closer integration of the economic spheres could be a win-win situation for both parties, notably in terms of creating more and better jobs."
"However, I know the effects that the bilateral trade agreements signed between the European Union and the countries of Latin America could have on the economies of the outermost regions."
"In the region that I am from, Madeira, the consequences are particularly visible as regards banana production."
"I therefore argue that this productive sector and the other strategic and traditional sectors of the outermost regions should be preserved."
"To this end, and in accordance with the commitment made by the European Union to them, the outermost regions must be compensated adequately, with particular attention paid to their vulnerable economies."
"There is provision in this report for such safeguards for these regions, so I voted for it."
"God bless your children."
"With this blessing, I suspend the sitting."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 13.05 and resumed at 15.00)"
"(FR) I should just like to communicate some information I received a moment ago to the House."
"For some weeks now, a new and unprecedented phenomenon has been occurring around certain large occupied towns in Western Sahara, that is to say, more than 12 000 Saharawi men, women and children are, as we speak, deserting their towns and moving into tents in the vicinity of Laayoune, Smara and Boujdour."
"The movements, which are steadily increasing, appear to be a new way of protesting against the unbearable political and socioeconomic situation of the indigenous inhabitants of these territories."
"I am saying this today and right now because the problem posed by the many violent interventions by the Moroccan regime could worryingly become worse this weekend."
"That is why I call on Parliament to be ready to react depending on how the situation unfolds."
"I will take it into account."
"It was of course a point of order and the situation in Western Sahara and the situation in Morocco are not what we are supposed to be talking about this afternoon."
"I will, however, take note of what you said."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"1."
"Forced evictions in Zimbabwe"
"author. - Mr President, we are once again discussing the difficult situation in Zimbabwe."
"Today, there is high inflation reaching hundreds of million per cent and an unemployment rate that has denied over 90 million people in the country a livelihood."
"There are also very many human rights violations."
"Parliament asks what should be done."
"We have said many times that we do not accept human rights violations."
"We have been dictating to African countries, but nothing has happened."
"I think that when we give humanitarian aid to African countries in the future we must make it conditional on the observance of human rights."
"We have not been tough enough in some cases and in other cases we have only dictated what to do."
"Maybe we should have closer cooperation with all African countries and with the African Union and try and get them to understand the situation so that the European Union does not continue to give money if human rights violations continue."
"author. - Mr President, the first indent of our resolution says it all: 'Having regard to its numerous previous resolutions on Zimbabwe, most recently that of 8 July this year'."
"We were speaking then about human rights violations in the diamond fields of Zimbabwe, and we are speaking now about eviction around Harare."
"People are being evicted who were already evicted in 2005 in Operation Murambatsvina, which incidentally means 'clean out the trash'."
"The same people who were cleaned out as trash last time are being evicted now."
"Last time it was Mugabe's Government fighting its fight against the MDC."
"This time it is the Unity Government of Zanu and MDC."
"I must say that I am deeply disappointed that, within this Unity Government, this sort of human rights violation still continues."
"I do not think this will be our last resolution on Zimbabwe."
"I will be here next time and I will make the point again."
"Mr President, this urgent humanitarian resolution must be viewed against a backdrop of political disagreement between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, and this disagreement is the focus of the request for the European Union not to accept the new ambassadors unilaterally appointed by Mr Mugabe."
"However, this urgent humanitarian resolution can be linked to the elections and to the political gains that may be had in driving populations out of the townships in which they are staying."
"Let us cast our minds back to June 2005 and Operation Murambatsvina, mentioned just now: a township was exposed to the forceful and purely politically motivated intervention of Robert Mugabe's bulldozers, and 700 000 people lost their homes."
"The same thing is happening today: 20 000 of the poorest people in Zimbabwe, housed in the Hatcliffe Extension townships, not very far from Harare, are being threatened with eviction just because they cannot afford the exorbitant rents they are being charged; it is a rather extensive operation."
"Let us also remember that the humanitarian and economic situation is becoming ever worse for millions of Zimbabweans, that the AIDS prevalence rate in Zimbabwe is the fourth highest in the world, and that children are dying there all the time."
"There are so many reasons right now for this urgent resolution and for a strong appeal to the entire international community in order to ensure that this reconciliation - I will not say this pseudo-reconciliation within Zimbabwe's coalition government, but this reconciliation, anyway - is not destroyed today amid these aggressive preparations on the eve of the elections."
"Mr President, I tend to think that the human rights situation in Zimbabwe is unfortunately not what we would normally call an emergency in this Chamber."
"Human rights are in fact repeatedly violated in that country, as the numerous resolutions voted on in this Chamber show."
"In the most recent one, as has been said, we denounced the arrest, on 22 July, of Mr Farai Muguwu, the founder and director of the Centre for Research and Development, whose crime was to report the atrocities committed in the diamond fields by, among others, the military authorities."
"Today, we are addressing the issue of forced evictions."
"This issue is not new."
"Indeed, as Mrs De Keyser said, an operation of this kind was launched by the Zimbabwean authorities in 2005."
"It was called Operation 'Murambatsvina', which means to restore order."
"It was quite some programme, I am sure you would agree, and it clearly shows what the Zimbabwean authorities mean by the word order."
"Seven hundred thousand people were affected at that time."
"The international community unanimously denounced the methods used."
"What is the situation like today?"
"The majority of the people affected are still living in tents."
"Worse still, in August, armed police officers - I did indeed say police officers - came and set fire to the shelters of some 250 displaced persons who had set up home on the outskirts of Harare."
"Twenty thousand people - this point has also been made - are today threatened with the same fate because they have not paid their residence tax, which they really cannot afford."
"These men, women and children are in fact some of the country's poorest people."
"Are we going to let this go on without saying anything?"
"Are we going to remind the Zimbabwean authorities once again of their international commitments, as Baroness Ashton did during the recent EU-Zimbabwe summit in July?"
"We are well aware that there is friction between President Mugabe and the Prime Minister following the global political agreement signed on 15 September 2008 and the appointment, on 13 February, of the government of national unity."
"Recently, President Mugabe threatened to dissolve the government almost there and then because it had dared to remind him of his constitutional obligations."
"It is time to react in Zimbabwe and in many other countries throughout the world in order to stop the dialogue with dictators who hold on to power through the use of force and fraud, and whose sole aim is to pillage their country's resources for personal gain."
"author. - Mr President, time and time again this House has passed resolutions condemning the tragedy that is Zimbabwe."
"Time and time again, Mr Mugabe has ignored us and carried on as if we do not exist and our opinions do not matter."
"There is something we can do immediately to tell Mr Mugabe that our opinions do matter."
"That is, we should not accept the credentials of Mrs Margaret Muchada, who has been nominated unilaterally by Mr Mugabe, in direct violation of the Zimbabwean Constitution, as the Zimbabwean Ambassador to the EU."
"My colleague, Geoffrey Van Orden, has written to Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy about this matter."
"If we have any teeth, we should show Mr Mugabe, who he has ridden roughshod over us, that we do matter and require this lady, his Ambassador, to go back."
"The evictions in Zimbabwe represent an outrageous disregard for internationally recognised human rights."
"The forced evictions, without provision of compensation or alternative accommodation, are completely contrary to international law."
"The Government of Zimbabwe is committing egregious violations of the civil, political, economic and social rights guaranteed by the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights."
"Continuation of the evictions is exposing increasing numbers of new people to indignity and homelessness."
"We call on the Government of Zimbabwe to cease these practices and to stop the forced evictions."
"People who have already been evicted should be given legal protection, as should their property, the victims should be given compensation and redress, and first and foremost all people should be guaranteed shelter and access to food and water."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PL) We need only make a list of the newspaper headlines about Zimbabwe from the last five years to have a picture of what conditions are like in a country which has been ruled for three decades by President Robert Mugabe."
"Headlines such as: 'Zimbabwe - police beat up opposition' or 'Mugabe has destroyed Africa' are among the mildest expressions, and the authorities of the African regime find themselves under the constant pressure of international public opinion."
"Extreme poverty and lack of access to basic medical services, gigantic unemployment levels which reach 90% and the short average life span, which is today only 44 years, are the true face of Zimbabwe."
"In these circumstances it is difficult to understand why the government considers it a priority to evict 20 000 citizens from the suburbs of the capital Harare, forcing them to leave behind their humble belongings."
"I join the appeal of international organisations such as Amnesty International for the Government of Zimbabwe to cease the repression of its own citizens and concentrate on giving them real help in schools, hospitals and the labour market."
"Zimbabwe, which is a poor country, cannot afford to waste time and money by investing in other areas."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, at the EU-Africa Summit in Libya next November there should be talks on how Mugabe and his close supporters remain a continuing stumbling block in the process of political and economic reconstruction and reconciliation in Zimbabwe."
"They are plundering its economic resources for their own benefit and they are not granting their citizens fundamental rights."
"Around 20 000 people living in the outskirts of Harare have been threatened with forced eviction."
"The Government is demanding a renewal lease fee of up to USD 140, but in a country where per capita income is less than USD 100 this is effectively impossible and this demand is a de facto licence for abuse."
"In 2005, 70 000 people were evicted and these people still live in dire circumstances."
"In general, the humanitarian, political and economic situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate and millions of people continue to be at risk of starvation."
"The country has the world's fourth-highest rate of HIV and high child mortality."
"People do not have many chances to grow up in health and prosperity, and if they do they lack fundamental freedoms such as freedom of expression."
"Zimbabwe ranks 123rd in terms of freedom of the press."
"The return of independent dailies is a step forward for public access to information, but the situation is still very fragile."
"I want to draw specific attention to the situation of LGBTI people in Zimbabwe."
"People need unrestricted access to be granted relief, humanitarian access and aid so that the attempts by Zimbabwe to achieve the Millennium Development Goals can get under way."
"This is very necessary."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (FI) Mr President, the woeful situation in Zimbabwe, the dictatorship which has prevailed there for more than 30 years, is a disgrace both for the international community and for Zimbabwe itself."
"A dictatorship of the sort that oppresses its own people is completely unacceptable."
"Mugabe's cohorts there gorge themselves, live a life of luxury and are rolling in money, and at the same time others live in the streets or in hovels, from which they are now still being evicted."
"It has to be said that somewhere there is a limit to what the international community and the European Union can tolerate."
"This is an utterly shameful situation, and the international community should support a full boycott of the country."
"There should be no more money for it."
"It is time to expel this dictator, who oppresses his own people, once and for all."
"That is because every day this gang remains in power is a reflection of our powerlessness and of the fact that the international community does not have the muscle to keep this oppressor in check."
"Apart from anything else, he is also systematically persecuting various minorities: racial minorities, sexual minorities, and all other minorities, in their own land."
"This is simply intolerable, and I fully support the notion that this dictator should be ousted."
"For this reason, we must adopt the very tough EU stand that we now quite rightly intend to."
"(RO) Echoing what has been said by my fellow Members who have spoken so far, we are facing a very tough situation because the 20 000 inhabitants of Hatcliffe Extension are threatened with eviction."
"As you are aware, they belong to the most vulnerable section of the population in Zimbabwe, a country going through major political problems, on top of the extremely dire economic situation."
"Since its creation in February 2009, Zimbabwe's Unity Government has done very little to improve people's situation, especially of those evicted in 2005."
"I think that our response or reaction to this situation is very clear."
"The Government of Zimbabwe must take action in keeping with its international obligations."
"This means halting and/or preventing forced evictions."
"On the other hand, we definitely all want democracy to be restored in Zimbabwe."
"What we have there at the moment could not be further from this."
"(RO) As has already been stated in this House, Zimbabwe is one of the countries where hunger is reaching catastrophic proportions, according to the report from the International Food Policy Research Institute published last week."
"The rate of undernutrition among the population, the prevalence of underweight children and the infant mortality rate are the three indicators which dramatically highlight the chronic situation in terms of food shortages, affecting millions of people."
"At the same time, hundreds of thousands of the poorest people in Zimbabwe have been evicted from their homes as part of a barbaric eviction operation whose brutal name is translated as 'Drive Out Rubbish'."
"These people have not only lost their homes, but also their jobs, thereby increasing the unemployment rate to 90% of the country's population."
"This is happening while the dictator Mugabe declared that the people were extremely happy."
"This was the view cynically expressed by the man who will remain in history the creator of the cruellest, long-standing dictatorship in the world."
"I believe that it is absolutely imperative for us to request the regime in Zimbabwe to halt the forced evictions as a matter of urgency, put an end to the serious human rights violations and persecution of activists from civil society, and to refrain from any acts of violence, which are increasing at an alarming rate."
"(SK) Zimbabwe is a country whose powerful leaders have long held the people of their land in contempt, and they are making this abundantly clear"
"Of course, we may protest, arguing that helpless people cannot be treated like cattle, that they cannot be driven out of their homes with no rhyme or reason, and be left without any help."
"Forced evictions of the poor in Harare are but a tiny example of the rule of Robert Mugabe and his accomplices who are sitting on the mineral riches of their country like frogs on a spring, exploiting and enriching themselves with these resources while letting the people of their country die from hunger."
"I believe it may be naive to expect that we may achieve a change through persuasion and criticism."
"Our measures should be more vigorous; people like Mugabe only listen to financial consequences or brute force."
"I think we have some financial measures at our disposal."
"We need to reconsider the provision of financial and material aid to regimes that act like Mugabe's regime, and simply seek other ways, including sanctions which might force these dictators to respect fundamental, and I stress, fundamental human rights."
"(FI) Mr President, it is no wonder that our fellow Members here are so infuriated by Mugabe."
"He has made his country, Africa's fertile granary, a conveyor belt of bad news."
"The substitute accommodation that the government has provided has proven to be totally inadequate and has led to a worsening of living conditions, which were already wretched."
"One of the official reasons given for the entire operation was that they were trying to prevent the spread of disease, but the fact that there was no treatment available after the evictions casts doubt on the government's motives."
"Everyone knows about the situation in Zimbabwe."
"The corrupt nature of the government and the general mess in both the economy and in society are generally leading to a situation where the basics for existence are just not there."
"Because of this, we must expect Zimbabwe to give a clear indication of its ability and willingness to safeguard the standard of living of its nationals."
"Even if there are good reasons why a large number of people have to make way for major projects, a crucial starting point must also always be the welfare of the displaced population."
"This is something that Zimbabwe has unquestionably neglected, regardless of whether the reasons that they have given are acceptable or not."
"Mr President, the current situation in Zimbabwe is appalling and unacceptable."
"Nearly 700 people were victims of the 2005 Operation Murambatsvina forced evictions."
"Now 20 000 citizens face forced evictions from the Hatcliffe Extension near Harare."
"The government has imposed unaffordable lease renewal fees on the people who were evicted, and has failed to consult with citizens or to inform them of the upcoming regulations."
"Operation Garikai intended to assist those who were affected by the 2005 evictions is merely a continuation of the same human rights abuses."
"I join in insisting that Zimbabwe halt these evictions of citizens in the Harare region."
"I urge the government of Zimbabwe to immediately amend Operation Garikai to comply with all obligations under international and human rights law."
"I ask the Commission to raise this issue as a matter of urgency with the government of Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, I was not going to speak but unfortunately my colleague, Geoffrey Van Orden, cannot be with us this week."
"He has a long history of criticising the odious and brutal regime of President Robert Mugabe."
"I think, sadly, the only way we will see the end to the Zanu-PF Mugabe dictatorship is when he is actually taken out in a coffin."
"I had hoped that there would have been a chance of reconciliation and peace and a transition towards true democracy a few years ago when Morgan Tsvangirai became Prime Minister in a power-sharing brokered deal, but it would appear that Mugabe has been able to reassert his absolute grip on power and revert to the kind of behaviour for which he is only too well known - namely violence, eviction and repression."
"Ultimately it is the poor Zimbabweans who suffer in that now almost broken economy."
"If it were not for the lifeline extended to Zimbabwe as a result of governments like the People's Republic of China giving them handouts, and money coming from Libya and others, it would not survive."
"Recently I have to say I was disappointed by the visit of President Zuma, who came to this Parliament."
"He came here asking the European Union to lift their sanctions on Zimbabwe because of the refugees flowing into South Africa."
"I am afraid we must tell Mr Zuma that is just not possible."
"We have to send a strong signal of disapproval about the way in which Mugabe treats his own people."
"I would like to endorse the comments made by my colleague, Nirj Deva, before me that one gesture would be to refuse the accreditation of the newly-appointed Ambassador of Zimbabwe to the European Union."
"Mr President and honourable Members, I am extremely grateful to the Members who participated in this debate."
"The European Union is following this matter very closely, especially in view of the 2005 'Operation Clean-up' which had disastrous effects on the living conditions of 700 000 Zimbabweans."
"In 2005, the EU office for humanitarian aid ECHO provided EUR 3.25 million in support of food security and agricultural activities and the distribution of food rations to vulnerable persons."
"This current situation is not a repeat of the events that took place in Zimbabwe in 2005."
"The Commission takes note of this Parliament resolution and its recommendations."
"To date, we have not received a clear indication from our partners that would confirm a repeat of the 2005 events."
"We are closely monitoring the situation through our EU delegation office and through our local ECHO office."
"We are in constant contact with the International Office for Migration and local human rights organisations involved in this issue."
"This time, a lease renewal notice that is valid for five years has been sent to the population."
"Tenants unable to raise the necessary funds were asked to present their cases to the Ministry of Local Government and received support from a local NGO working with homeless people."
"Thanks to the support of a local human rights NGO, namely the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, their cases will be heard by the court this week."
"The EU is already supporting the work of this human rights NGO which represents the interests of the poorest who are unable to pay the requested fees and could thus lose their land."
"However, I can reassure you that the EU will continue to closely monitor the situation and mobilise assistance if and when necessary."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"2."
"Cambodia, in particular the case of Sam Rainsy"
"The next item is Cambodia, specifically the case of Sam Rainsy."
"author. - Mr President, Sam Rainsy is a colleague of ours, a member of the parliament in Cambodia."
"That mere fact has led to assassination attempts and a number of political and legal attacks by the ruling party, including a 12-year prison sentence."
"The ruling party apparently does not like the fact that Sam Rainsy denounces corruption and human rights abuses."
"I would like to remind this ruling party that the EU is the single largest donor institution to Cambodia and that this aid is conditional on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"In 2006 Sam Rainsy received the Prize for Freedom from Liberal International."
"He received this prize for the defence of freedoms we share across this Parliament."
"We therefore call on the Cambodian authorities to implement the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Cambodia."
"author. - Mr President, as has already been said, the European Union is the single largest donor institution to Cambodia and it is more than legitimate for us to call on the Cambodian authorities not only to engage in political and institutional reforms to build a democratic state, governed by the rule of law and founded on the respect of fundamental freedoms and rights, but also to demonstrate the will to combat effectively the endemic scourge of corruption, massive deforestation resulting in the displacement of people, land grabbing and the sex tourism industry, to refuse the current culture of impunity and to bring to justice all those involved in such activities."
"The guarantee of free and fair political expression without intimidation or harassment is also a necessity."
"More specifically, we should state that we are alarmed at the prosecution and sentencing to a total of 12 years in prison of the opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, on account of a gesture which it considers to be of a symbolic and clearly political nature. It is particularly alarming that, if upheld, this verdict would bar Sam Rainsy from standing in the 2013 parliamentary elections and have consequences far beyond Rainsy's case, as it is bound to affect the opposition as such."
"Mr President, this is an urgent resolution that is dominated by Sam Rainsy, an occasionally controversial figure, but that must not make us forget the true democratic issue hiding behind this case."
"So, Sam Rainsy, as has been said, is a liberal figure and opponent of the leader, Hun Sen. Mr Rainsy had already been sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, only to be granted a pardon in 2006."
"Indeed, he accused Hun Sen of being behind the 1997 grenade attack."
"Today, he has been convicted of the crime - a symbolic one, as has been said - of moving the markings of the disputed border between Vietnam and Cambodia and of distributing so-called fake maps."
"Twelve years in absentia is a lot, but it is in fact clear what this is all about."
"The sole aim is to prevent him from standing in the next elections, in 2013, and he is the leader of the country's second political opposition party."
"Thus, the political climate in Cambodia is tense, elections are approaching and vote-winning tactics are being employed, but there is also a drift towards authoritarianism, and I would like to mention, aside from the Rainsy case, that of NGO representatives who have been prosecuted: the politician Mu Sochua, found guilty of defaming the Prime Minister, the journalist Hang Chakra, imprisoned for having denounced the corruption within the Deputy Prime Minister Sok An's entourage, and so on."
"I would therefore just like to point out, as others have done, that we are donors, that we have a cooperation agreement that stipulates that fundamental freedoms must be respected."
"I also call for an emergency humanitarian plan for the people, the populations affected by the construction and textile crises."
"That is also important."
"author. - Mr President, although Cambodia is on paper a pluralist democracy, the respected NGO Human Rights Watch states that politicians and journalists critical of the government face violence and intimidation."
"In addition, the judiciary remains weak and subject to political influence."
"Furthermore the government continues to turn a blind eye to fraudulent confiscation of farmers' land, illegal logging and widespread plundering of the country's natural resources."
"Sam Rainsy, the Opposition leader currently exiled to France, has been jailed in absentia for ten years."
"His so-called crime was to seek to highlight the confiscation of peasant farmers' land by the government following border talks with neighbouring Vietnam, in the course of which he was charged with digging up the border posts."
"This resolution today serves as a timely reminder to the Cambodian Government that if it seeks closer ties with the EU it should guarantee and uphold basic freedoms and fundamental rights."
"Otherwise, Cambodia risks being bracketed with the pariah state Burma in the eyes of the international community."
"author. - Mr President, Mr Rainsy, an opposition leader, has been sentenced in absentia to 12 years in prison."
"His trial did not comply with international standards for a fair and impartial judiciary, and his conviction was politically motivated."
"Similar convictions of members of the opposition party are fairly common, and show that there is no impartial judiciary in Cambodia."
"These court decisions hinder basic human rights, including the freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial."
"I strongly oppose the conviction of Sam Rainsy and those like him who exercise their freedom of expression, and call on the Cambodian Government to stop its current path of tyranny."
"At international level, we must remind Cambodia to strive towards democracy and not use the selective enforcement of laws against individual rights."
"In particular, I call on the Commission to remind Cambodia not to use new NGO regulations to restrict the opposition and civil society."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (FI) Mr President, Sam Rainsy's treatment is just the tip of the iceberg with respect to the authoritarian control which the ruling party in Cambodia exercises to wield political power over a court in order to silence criticism of the government."
"This government, of course, has as its main objective the suppression of civil society and the promotion of a oneparty system."
"This is also reflected in Rainsy's sentence, an attempt to prevent him from standing in the elections in 2013."
"As has already been mentioned here, the EU is the single largest donor institution to Cambodia, and for that reason it is important that in this resolution we do not just content ourselves with condemning the numerous breaches of human rights in the country, the lack of any proper viable judicial system, and the politicisation of the armed forces."
"We must in no uncertain terms also remind them of the cooperation agreement that exists between the EU and Cambodia and of its Article 1, which calls for a respect for human rights."
"There must be consequences if civil freedoms continue to be flouted, and the EU must make a clear improvement to the human rights situation a condition of continued aid."
"The 12-year prison sentence handed down to Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy is actually a serious human rights violation and a blatant indication of the authoritarianism which dominates political life in Cambodia."
"Following his expulsion from the National Assembly and the withdrawal of his parliamentary immunity three times so far, along with numerous assassination attempts and the murder of dozens of his supporters, Sam Rainsy has now been convicted in absentia for his protests with strong political overtones."
"Basically, the ultimate aim of the sentence handed down in September is to prevent the leader of the opposition from being a candidate in the elections due to be held in more than two years' time, which compromises Cambodia's chances of achieving democracy once and for all."
"In addition to the requests submitted via this resolution to the Cambodian Government, asking for an end to political persecutions, I would also like to add a request to the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the authorities for them to resume the political and institutional reforms required to establish genuine democracy."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Cambodia is a very beautiful country with a great history, but there are dark sides to both the country and its history."
"The latest problems include people disappearing, people being imprisoned without trial, high levels of corruption, illegal land-grabbing and illegal logging."
"The thing which should most concern us as Members of the European Parliament is that the people who criticise and denounce these practices are dragged off the street, face sham trials and are then put in prison."
"Sam Rainsy, the opposition leader in Cambodia, has been subjected to serious persecution."
"He has already been elected, but was thrown out of the parliament in 1995."
"However, he managed to return."
"There were a number of attacks on him during election rallies, one of which left 80 people dead."
"I have had the privilege of visiting him in Cambodia."
"I found him to be a very peaceful person and a committed supporter of democracy and human rights."
"Now he has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for a symbolic act on the basis of flimsy arguments."
"Anyone who locks up the leader of the opposition party also locks up a large proportion of the people of the country who are represented by this person."
"Anyone who locks up the leader of the opposition party and prevents him from taking part in the next elections is blocking the democratic process and violating civil and human rights."
"I believe that we should not accept this and I call on the Commission to demand that, in particular, the terms of article 1 of the cooperation agreement with Cambodia are fulfilled."
"This refers to respect for human rights in Cambodia being a precondition for the provision of aid by the European Union."
"I have twice had the opportunity to visit Cambodia."
"The first time was two years ago, with the observation delegation of the European Parliament during the parliamentary elections, and the second time was six months ago."
"I must say that Cambodia is a country which has developed very rapidly in recent years - I am talking about economic development - as, indeed, have other countries in that part of the world."
"Unfortunately, the rapid economic development in Cambodia has not been accompanied by a process of democratisation."
"For there is no true democracy without strong media which keep checks on the ruling party, without a strong opposition or without a strong non-governmental organisation sector."
"The sentence imposed on Sam Rainsy, which is by no means the first, is another blow to the opposition."
"If this sentence is upheld, Sam Rainsy will not be able to stand in the next parliamentary elections, although he enjoys fairly high popularity in his country."
"The sentence is puzzling in that over 30 years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime, very many of the leaders of the regime in Cambodia still have not been tried."
"Questioning the Vietnamese-Cambodian border certainly does not help stabilisation in the region, nevertheless this matter should be resolved by political means and not by a judicial sentence."
"(RO) It is deplorable that Cambodian courts are still resorting to arrest as a means of intimidating political opponents and dissidents."
"The most common targets for this action are journalists, human rights activists and other critics speaking out in favour of freedom of speech."
"The charges brought against Sam Rainsy are obviously more of a political than criminal nature."
"He has been sentenced to 12 years in prison following a symbolic gesture of protest which he made against the way in which the border with Vietnam has been marked."
"However, the real reason for his conviction seems to be to remove the opposition from the parliamentary election contest to be held in 2013."
"I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Cambodian Government to abide by its commitments towards consolidating the state of democracy."
"Sam Rainsy, as the main opposition leader, must be allowed to resume his duties in the Cambodian Parliament as soon as possible."
"This would help stop the move towards the single-party system, which poses a threat to the respect for human rights."
"(FI) Mr President, the decision of the Cambodian court to sentence opposition leader Sam Rainsy to 10 years in prison in charges relating to the spread of disinformation and falsification of official documents, and other cases like it have led to justified concern in the West regarding the impartiality and independence of the country's legal system."
"There has been a systematic attempt there superficially to interpret the clauses in the law on the spread of false information and slander and libel in such a way that it tends to hamper the work of the opposition and NGOs."
"The clauses in question have actually been used to restrict freedom of opinion and expression."
"Although I acknowledge the significant development that Cambodia has gone through since the Pol Pot regime, I would regard it as vexing if the Cambodian Government were to decide to leave the process of building a democratic system halffinished, which, unfortunately, has been the case in a large number of countries."
"Cambodia has signed up to several international agreements, including its cooperation agreement with the European Union, to safeguard the fundamental rights of its people and the implementation of democratic principles within its territory."
"The European Union must in no uncertain terms call on the Cambodian Government to respect its commitments."
"(RO) As has already been mentioned, Sam Rainsy has been given two prison sentences."
"The 10-year sentence he has now received for allegedly spreading disinformation and falsifying public documents has been added to the earlier one for two years."
"As my fellow Members have also stated, this is an obvious attempt to block his participation in the future elections."
"There is an issue with the procedure followed in this whole story, which is that Sam Rainsy was convicted in absentia as part of proceedings which were held behind closed doors and which, according to reports, were highlighted by numerous irregularities."
"This is actually not an isolated case."
"Many more critics of the Cambodian Government have endured similar treatment involving criminal prosecutions."
"As has already been mentioned, I believe that, based on the Cooperation Agreement signed with the European Union, the Cambodian authorities have to abide by their clear commitments linked to human rights."
"(SK) In Cambodia, as in many other countries, the struggle for political power is descending into a real fight; a life-and-death struggle, as the saying goes."
"In such situations, power structures destroy, persecute and imprison their political opposition."
"This seems to be the case of Sam Rainsy whom the current leaders naturally intend to dispose of because he represents competition, and embodies for them the risk of future political change."
"As in other cases, we could certainly intervene and ask the Cambodian Government to stop abusing its political opponent and allow him room to join the others on equal terms in order to be able to compete in the political struggle."
"I think that as a result of our improved relations with Cambodia, we might be more successful in this matter than in the case of Harare."
"Therefore, I believe it would be worth our while putting the Cambodian Government under political pressure to make it reconsider the manner in which it is proceeding and its treatment of political opponents, and generate conditions for free and correct political competition."
"Mr President, firstly I want to thank the Members who participated in the debate."
"I would like to thank those MEPs who have submitted resolutions on Cambodia for this urgency debate."
"The situation there is indeed a matter of concern."
"We have had frank exchanges with our Cambodian interlocutors, most recently at the Joint Committee in Brussels on 8 October, about the state of the country's democratic institutions and, in particular, the treatment of the opposition in Parliament."
"The fact that the opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, has had to seek refuge in France is symptomatic of a deteriorating trend."
"The same can be said of the judiciary's involvement in politics and the prosecution of members of the opposition, including those who should be able to benefit from parliamentary immunity."
"There is a danger that the National Assembly will no longer be able to function as a forum for the free exchange of views."
"The media, too, are under pressure."
"There are some bright spots."
"Cambodia has accepted all the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Council in the Universal Periodic Review."
"We also note that a new penal code and an anti-corruption law have been enacted."
"Clearly we will need to follow how these are implemented in practice."
"We shall continue to remind Cambodia of the recommendations put forward by our Election Observation Missions in the past."
"Establishment of an effective Human Rights Committee is an important objective."
"We welcome the Government's intention to proceed with this and its initiative in setting up a joint forum with civil society organisations."
"Cambodia remains a very poor country."
"There is a lot that can be done to keep up the momentum of recent economic growth without, at the same time, increasing disparities in society."
"This should include reform of the rules on land ownership and an end to unsustainable practices in land and forest management, including the exploitation of natural resources."
"Sanctioning the government or reducing the level of our contacts would do nothing for the poorest and most vulnerable and would only embolden those who pay lip service to democracy."
"Therefore, I cannot agree that suspending our bilateral agreement would be helpful."
"There is no substitute for patient dialogue."
"If we are not seen as a major player in the country's development, we shall lose an opportunity to influence events."
"Yet there is much we can do in Cambodia at all levels, from the Prime Minister's office to civil society."
"We shall continue to encourage positive initiatives that Cambodia is taking in favour of human rights, development and gender equality, while continuing to make the case for a truly pluralistic parliamentary democracy, a freer press and a more independent judiciary."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - The human rights situation in Cambodia is an ever growing concern."
"We are faced with the problem of blatant human rights violations by the Authoritarian Government that is chewing away at the fabric of democracy."
"As Cambodia's largest donor the EU needs to take swift action in protecting the citizens of Cambodia and reassure them that the democratic process will not faultier."
"I would like to take this opportunity to address the Government of Cambodia and request their compliance with the U.N. Special Rapporteur's report in a swift and timely manner."
"The case of Sam Rainsy brings to light the injustices occurring in Cambodia, where Mr. Rainsy, as the leader of the opposition party and Parliament member, has been confronted with what can only be viewed as a deliberate effort to curtail any opposition to the established Authoritarian Government."
"The practises of charging and detaining any persons viewed as a threat to the Government must end."
"Furthermore, the citizens still have no guarantee of independence and impartiality from the judiciary."
"These issues must be confronted and addressed immediately by this Parliament to assure the citizens of Cambodia that this Parliament continues to support and defend their right to Democracy."
"3."
"North Caucasus, in particular the case of Oleg Orlov"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on North Caucasus, in particular the case of Oleg Orlov."
"author. - Mr President, I would like to say that this resolution on the situation in the North Caucasus, and in particular on the case of Oleg Orlov, is one of the most deserving resolutions this House has adopted for a long time."
"The tragedy reigning in the North Caucasus has only deepened in recent years with pervasive human rights violations still affecting the daily lives of the communities in Chechnya, in Ossetia, Dagestan, North Ossetia and Kabardino-Balkaria."
"The violence is far from over."
"Only last Tuesday, at least six people were killed in an attack on Chechnya's Parliament building in Grozny."
"At least 17 people were injured, most of them civilians."
"On 9 September, 17 people were killed and many others wounded in a bombing in Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia."
"The tragedies of the past are not accounted for either."
"The families of victims in Beslan still do not know what exactly happened to their children and loved ones, how they died or where their bodies are."
"Not only has the vicious circle of violence and impunity left these communities distraught and paralysed, the failure to tackle the situation has led the violence to spread beyond the borders of the North Caucasian republics."
"While Muscovites have felt the trauma of terrorism, Chechen refugees in Europe fear persecution, even murder."
"People disappear even in the capital city, Moscow, or in St Petersburg, as has happened during the past year."
"So there comes a point when this must stop."
"The winner of the 2009 Sakharov Prize, Mr Orlov, being placed under criminal charges could be the point at which Europe finally says enough is enough."
"The EU should seek now to cooperate with the Council of Europe on the excellent report produced by Dick Marty on legal remedies for human rights violations in the North Caucasus."
"author. - Mr President, today President Buzek announced the winner of this year's Sakharov Prize."
"This prize embodies freedom of thought, an essential European freedom and right we stand for on behalf of our citizens and across the world."
"In response to the Nobel Peace Prize award, President Buzek called firmly on China to release Liu Xiao Bo and said: 'Freedom is not a threat, but the threats to freedom can be many'."
"This also goes for the people who defend human rights in the Northern Caucasus."
"Last year's Sakharov Prize awardees Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, of Memorial, have not been able to pick up their award personally as their freedom is threatened."
"The EU invests tremendously in EU-Russia relations, and we are joined through the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"Russia has thus committed itself to protecting and promoting human rights and the rule of law, but what a long way we are from that situation."
"Intimidation of journalists and civil society activists prevails, disappearances of human rights defenders happen systematically and there is no freedom of expression, including on the Internet."
"The absence of the rule of law has led to 20 000 cases pending at the European Court of Human Rights from the Russian Federation."
"Russia has the right to fight terrorism in the Northern Caucasus, but if the rule of law is not upheld this has a counter-productive effect on stability."
"There really is no excuse for Russia not to comply with its own commitment to human rights."
"We look forward and will see to it that the representatives of Memorial have the freedom to come to this Parliament, thereby symbolising the freedoms and rights that all citizens in the Northern Caucasus enjoy."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, I am very concerned about the growing climate of fear that surrounds human rights defenders in Russia."
"We owe our support to Oleg Orlov, to whom we awarded the Saharov Prize last year."
"His sole crime is to have spoken about human rights in Russia."
"Fundamental rights are also being breached within the EU, but what has happened in Russia is something else entirely."
"We must struggle against all kinds of terrorism and radical extremism using all the legal means available to us, but also availing ourselves of the remedies offered by civil society."
"There is no longer any need for oppression in the North Caucasus: there needs to be dialogue instead."
"There must be no more crime, but more respect for the law and human rights."
"Justice is always carried out objectively and subjectively."
"In the North Caucasus this means that criminals should be convicted and the needs of the victims of crime taken into account."
"Adopting this statement is a clear and consistent show of support for Orlov, as it is too for all the others who struggle in the name of human rights."
"We must bear this case in mind when we discuss new relations between the EU and Russia."
"Russia must respect human rights to be able to play a genuine role in Europe and accept the European ethos: Europe is on the side of people, not against them."
"author. - (PL) In Communist times, when the Solidarity movement in Poland was fighting for human rights and democracy, a slogan was widely used which said: 'there is no freedom without Solidarity'."
"Today, in the context of what is happening in the North Caucasus, although not only there, but also in many other parts of Russia, it can be said that there is no stabilisation without the rule of law."
"It is very important to talk about these two phenomena together."
"We cannot talk about economic and political relations with Russia while ignoring human rights there."
"It is, in fact, a system of interconnected vessels, they are not two separate subjects."
"Elementary honesty demands that we not only talk about improving relations with Russia - with that great country - but also that we require of Moscow that it respect human rights, including in the case of someone who has been awarded the Sakharov Prize."
"This is a singular slap in the face for the European Parliament and the European Union."
"Mr President, I should like to take advantage of this speech to ask for us together to think about what purpose the Sakharov Prize serves."
"I should like to begin by thanking my colleagues, and Mrs Hautala in particular, for having responded to my request concerning the situation of Mr Orlov."
"Indeed, Mr Orlov is one of the three people in charge of Memorial, the association to which we awarded the Sakharov Prize last year."
"By handing over this prize, we rewarded the commitment of those who still dare to denounce the situation in Chechnya."
"It was symbolic because it came a few months after the murder of Natalia Estemirova, a murder that Mr Orlov strongly condemned."
"We knew that the Chechen President was suing Mr Orlov for his hatred, that he had pressed charges against him."
"In January 2010 Mr Orlov and Memorial were found guilty, and we did not say a thing."
"On 6 July Mr Orlov was charged once again, and he is now facing a three-year prison term."
"When we award the Sakharov Prize, we aim to raise the profile of the work of men and women who fight for democracy and human rights and, in awarding them the prize, we place them under our protection."
"However, what have we done for Mr Orlov and for all those who defend human rights in Russia and in Chechnya?"
"In what way have we developed the EU's dialogue to ensure that human rights are at last respected in the North Caucasus?"
"Can we tolerate, without saying anything, the fact that no legal action has been taken more than a year after Mrs Estemirova's murder?"
"Can we tolerate human rights defenders being kidnapped, mistreated and disappearing without any reaction by the courts?"
"I almost feel like saying, what purpose do we serve if, part-session after part-session, we denounce a number of human rights violations without it stopping the Commission from pursuing its supposedly constructive dialogues and from telling us that progress is being made, but just not in the fields of human rights and justice?"
"When will we stop renouncing these supposedly fundamental values for the benefit of the economic and political interests of certain Member States?"
"We might be more credible, ladies and gentlemen, if our sittings were not pushed back to last thing on Thursday afternoon, and if there were a few more of us here to follow these debates."
"Mr President, the North Caucasus was a victim of tsarist colonial policy and of attempts at genocide by the Stalinist regime."
"However, unfortunately it was also involved in two brutal wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union which went as far genocide against smaller ethnic groups, such as the Chechens."
"Today it is still a region where small, evil satellite regimes, like that of Mr Kadyrov, commit horrific violations of human rights."
"We condemn all forms of terrorism on all sides, but this regime has nothing to do with democracy and the rule of law."
"In order to resolve this situation, we need a three-pronged approach, involving close cooperation between the Council of Europe, together with the European Court of Human Rights, the European Parliament as the driving force behind the European Union and the human rights organisations in the region, which are attempting to protect it from the might of Russia."
"The human rights organisation Memorial plays a central role in this respect."
"Therefore, we are calling not only for Mr Oleg Orlov to be left in peace immediately, but also for him to be given support for his commendable work on behalf of human rights."
"We owe that to him and his fellow combatants, to the people of the North Caucasus and also to our murdered friend and comrade Natalia Estemirova, whom many of us knew personally and whose murder must finally be resolved."
"We are under an obligation to her to ensure that human rights and the rule of law are introduced into the North Caucasus."
"Some time ago, Oleg Orlov said the greatest problem for the North Caucasus was the rejection by those in power of the most important issue - that of human rights."
"The violations of human rights are destabilising the situation in the North Caucasus, are prolonging the conflict, are reducing the chances for its resolution and are, in fact, creating support for underground terrorist activity."
"Human rights organisations such as Memorial should be supported because they are essential for the creation of a stable and free society, as also they are needed for the establishment of a stability which is real and lasting."
"These organisations should be supported, therefore, and it is also necessary to condemn the reprehensible deeds which are being perpetrated in the North Caucasus, to speak out for the growing number of people who have disappeared and to remember the suffering of those who have been displaced."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (LV) Thank you, Mr President."
"I fully support the part of the resolution which addresses the need for human rights in North Caucasus to be observed."
"I am very familiar with the situation in the Caucasus, as I have been there more than once."
"At the same time, I should like to remark that the title of 'human rights defender' does not give Mr Orlov the right to accuse the President of the Republic of Chechnya of murder."
"If Mr Orlov believes that the Sakharov prize is a mandate for injudicious assertions, he is mistaken."
"The European Parliament does not have to act as Orlov's lawyer."
"Let Orlov prove his case in court."
"If not in a Russian court, then in the European Court."
"We do not have the right to take sides in this dispute."
"We must give the courts the opportunity to do their work."
"However, I should like to give Orlov some advice - think before you speak."
"Defamation is an offence. Thank you."
"It is a paradox that on the day when we have announced our decision to award the 2010 Sakharov Prize, we are talking about the persecution of one of the winners of last year's prize."
"As you know, Oleg Orlov, together with other members of the organisation Memorial, was awarded the prize last year for his uncompromising and courageous fight for the truth about Russian crimes committed in the Chechen Republic."
"We are talking, today, about the continued persecution to which Oleg Orlov is being subjected because he is courageously demanding explanations for all the circumstances of the death of Natalia Estemirova, who was the head of Memorial in Chechnya."
"It should be remembered that the steps taken on the part of 'President' Ramzan Kadyrov against Mr Orlov would not have been possible without the support of the Kremlin."
"Therefore, I appeal to all the authorities of the European Union, including the Commission and the Council, to put pressure on President Medvedev to curb this kind of persecution in Chechnya."
"(RO) Acts of violence or terrorism are almost an everyday occurrence in the republics in the North Caucasus."
"The attack carried out last week in the Chechen Parliament highlights that Islamist insurgency is jeopardising the entire region's stability."
"Fifteen years after the outbreak of the wars in Chechnya, there are still 80 000 displaced persons in the region."
"The situation for human rights activists is also alarming, with reports of numerous random abductions and convictions."
"The case of Oleg Orlov is one of a series of trials initiated without any sound legal basis."
"He could face three years in prison after he accused the president of Chechnya of involvement in the murder of Natalia Estemirova in 2009."
"I wish to point out that the investigations launched after this woman's death have not made any progress so far."
"For these reasons, I believe that the Federal authorities need to take additional measures to ensure that investigations are conducted properly, including when members of the organisation Memorial are involved."
"(FI) Mr President, the best known and most violent conflict in the North Caucasus region was that which began with the First Chechen War."
"It still continues, although it has spread, in particular to Dagestan and Ingushetia."
"Without adopting a position on to what extent it is about a war of liberation, a war against terrorism or something else, we cannot deny the fact that there are almost 100 000 internal refugees in the region and a very poor situation with respect to human rights."
"The human rights activists to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize last year are a force to be reckoned with in Memorial, which has a significant role in the North Caucasus."
"When he collected the prize last December, Oleg Orlov answered a question on the dangers of his work, saying that the biggest problem was that the threat came from representatives of the state."
"Few would doubt these words of his."
"Anna Politkovskaya was especially known as someone who spoke up for the human rights of Chechens."
"The Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned in London, had criticised Russian actions in Chechnya."
"Natalya Estemirova, who was murdered last year, revealed the fact that the security services had been involved in acts of violence and executions, in Chechnya too."
"The list of similar unsolved murders could go on."
"That is why it is vital that the European Union should continue to raise these issues."
"(PL) I would like to begin by correcting something which was said by a fellow Member."
"We were informed that representatives of Memorial were not able to come to Parliament to receive the Sakharov Prize last year."
"In fact, they were here."
"It is the 'Ladies in White' who cannot collect the prize, because they are not being allowed to leave Havana."
"The report prepared in June 2010 by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe publishes information about further cases of human rights violations in the North Caucasus."
"The Russian authorities maintain they are making efforts at stabilisation, but the impunity associated with human rights violations and the absence of the rule of law continue to be the main obstacles to real and lasting stability in the region."
"Civilians are still living under the threat of violence."
"Torture and ill-treatment are commonplace, as are forced disappearances, arbitrary murders and arbitrary arrests."
"Investigations into human rights violations are ineffective and defective."
"Their only result is often the failure to punish the perpetrators, which increases the mistrust of government institutions and the entire justice system."
"It is our duty to take all possible steps, not only to enable permanent monitoring of the situation in the North Caucasus, but also to take action intended to guarantee the rule of law and support for civil and democratic initiatives and to bring an end to the lawlessness in the region."
"(SK) I believe that the main problem in the North Caucasus is disregard for the most important thing of all, namely respect for individual human rights Such human rights violations destabilise the situation in the region, prolong and deepen conflict, decrease the chances for its resolution, and help generate the basis for reactionary terrorist groups."
"Ramzan Kadyrov, who has assumed power in Chechnya, does not contribute to stability."
"He has become the absolute ruler of this republic, defying the law or misinterpreting it so that he may act in contradiction of fundamental human rights."
"Moreover, abuses directed against certain individuals may neither be publicised nor discussed."
"Oleg Orlov, a member of the Memorial group, is a sorry example of the persecution of those who defend human rights."
"The situation seems to be tragically without a solution, and that is why it is the moral obligation of the European Parliament to painstakingly monitor events in the region, and regularly insist on respect for rights which the citizens and human rights organisations in the Russian Federation still cannot enjoy on a day-to-day basis despite official rhetoric."
"(RO) I too feel obliged to speak out in solidarity with Oleg Orlov and the Human Rights Centre Memorial, which he heads."
"They were awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought last year by the European Parliament."
"The conviction for slandering the Chechen President and the trial initiated against Oleg Orlov, who could now face years in prison, mark the horrible culmination of a depressing series of acts of persecution against human rights activists, including the most terrible one involving the abduction and murder of Natalia Estemirova, Memorial's coordinator in Chechnya."
"I feel obliged to protest against these brutal, repeated violations against human rights, justified by the need to combat terrorism, against the impunity of those guilty of serious crimes and abuses, as well as against the Russian authorities tolerating this situation, which is affecting the credibility of their commitment to democracy."
"(CS) I would like to think here about how it is possible that we are still only discussing the human rights of a relatively small group of people and are completely missing the main issue."
"The bottom line in the North Caucasus is the strong external interference of Wahhabis who are trained, who are armed and who are moving in with clear objectives."
"If you do not know where the Wahhabis come from and who finances them - well, it is the same sources that are being talked about with regard to other terrorist organisations."
"Unfortunately, in this resolution, the main issue - that is, why there are flagrant violations of human rights in various parts of the North Caucasus - is completely missing."
"Of course, it is necessary to respect human rights, but it is necessary to create the conditions for complying with them."
"If terrorist organisations are being financed from abroad - and this is certainly the case - then it is difficult for us to provide these conditions."
"Unfortunately, the resolution does not take account of that."
"Mr President, I give my full backing to this resolution, which is supported by my political group and calls for action in support of Sakharov awardee Oleg Orlov and what he stands for - namely opposition to the human rights violations that go on in the Northern Caucasus."
"Let me say in this respect that I do not see myself and my Group reflected in the words of Mr Mirsky, who spoke earlier and criticised Oleg Orlov, saying that he should not use his status as a human rights defender to speak up against Mr Kadyrov."
"Any self-respecting democrat knows that you do not need a title, you do not need to be a human rights defender, and you do not need to be a member of Memorial or a Sakharov awardee to have the democratic right to criticise any head of State or Government."
"I should also like to use this opportunity to endorse what our colleague Raül Romeva i Rueda said earlier."
"He called the attention of this Parliament - and also of the Commission and the Council and, in particular, Mrs Ashton - to the dangerous situation that is now developing in Western Sahara."
"I should like to request her to intervene so that the Moroccan authorities do not arrest the people of Western Sahara who are fighting against illegal occupation."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank you for raising the human rights situation in the North Caucasus."
"While the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya was officially declared over last year, violence and the climate of impunity continue there, but even more so in neighbouring Dagestan and also in Ingushetia."
"The armed attack that took place on Tuesday of this week on the Parliament in Grozny was the latest reminder that the situation remains volatile and dangerous."
"The High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy/Vice-President Ashton has deplored this attack and has stated that no circumstances can justify the use of terrorist violence and suicide attacks."
"I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims."
"In this case, the victims were a civilian and two policemen carrying out their duties."
"As terror attacks continue in the Northern Caucasus so too do regular attacks on human rights defenders and journalists, and the perpetrators of such attacks are rarely brought to justice."
"We pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives and to those who continue their work in such an environment."
"Many activists, lawyers and independent journalists across the Russian Federation are facing violence, harassment and intimidation."
"The libel cases against Oleg Orlov, the head of the Memorial Human Rights Centre and the chairwoman of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Lyudmilla Alekseeva, should be seen in this context of intimidation."
"Mr Orlov's statements, challenged by President Kadyrov, concerned the fact that the killer of Memorial activist Natalya Estimirova, although identified, has not been brought to justice."
"The European Commission is following Mr Orlov's ongoing second trial very closely."
"The EU calls on Russia to uphold the commitments it has entered into as a member of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"President Medvedev has spoken out against what he has termed the legal nihilism prevailing in Russia."
"The EU stands ready to support Russia's reform of its judicial system."
"Concrete activities have been prepared in close cooperation with the President's administration and the Council of Europe."
"The EU highly values the opportunity it has to discuss its concerns on human rights with the Russian authorities."
"We welcome the open attitude President Medvedev has taken in discussions with the EU concerning these issues."
"The regular EU-Russia human rights consultations at expert level offer an opportunity to broaden the scope of these discussions."
"- The debate is closed."
"The next item is the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and concern for the increasing number of murdered or disappeared citizens of the Caucasus region, particularly Natalia Estemirova."
"The increase in violence and disappearances of human rights activists and political opponents in the North Caucasus region since 2009 is worrying."
"These conflicts and human rights violations destabilise the region and hinder peace and prosperity."
"I urge the Russian authorities to heighten protection for human rights defenders, including those working for Memorial."
"The government should strive to convict those who carry out abductions and murders, rather than silencing those, like Oleg Orlov, who bring these issues to light."
"I condemn the actions taken by the authorities in investigating human rights organisations, as well as criminal charges currently being brought against Oleg Orlov for speaking out."
"I call on the Commission to emphasise these issues in its dialogue with Russia."
"There has been a lot of talk in the media, recently, about a new beginning in relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"The fruit of these activities is the joint German-Russian Nord Stream gas pipeline project and the offer to include Russia in the European security system proposed by Nicolas Sarkozy."
"It appears that in the euphoria of new economic agreements, EU decision makers have quickly forgotten the cases of Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova."
"For years, we have based the Union on the belief that if people may be said to be equal, then this equality extends to all people in every respect."
"Therefore, it must be our priority to fight unremittingly for respect for the principles of law and order, civil liberties and human dignity."
"It is essential that there be a firm reaction from the European Union to the repeated cases of human rights violations in Russia and the tragedy of the democratic opposition."
"The media are reporting that every 31st of the month, demonstrations organised by the 'Strategy-31' movement are held in Russian cities."
"Its members are protesting in defence of the freedom to gather, assemble and hold marches and pickets guaranteed under Article 31 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation."
"From the beginning of its activities, the movement has met with opposition from the authorities."
"Each time, the demonstrations are broken up by the Special Purpose Police Unit OMON, and the participants are subjected to harassment and beatings, they are transported to the countryside and abandoned deep inside forests or they are arrested and even held in prison without being given a formal reason."
"It is the duty of the Union to investigate these activities in detail and to give strong expression to its opposition."
"This is expected of us, not only by the citizens of Russia, but by the whole of European society."

"Mr President, Mr Landsbergis, who knows the North Caucasus better than almost anyone else, has left a few brief oral amendments which tighten up the text and which I would ask you to support."
"I am presenting them on his behalf."
"In paragraph 3, we want to insert the word 'real' after 'recognises Russia's right to fight' and before 'terrorism' in order to make that clearer, because terrorism is often used as a pretext."
"In paragraph 5, we would like to insert the word 'lasting', so that this reads 'stresses that the lasting impunity in Chechnya'."
"In paragraph 15, we want to add the word 'intimidating', so that the text reads 'expresses its rejection of the intimidating search of human rights organisations'."
"These changes are simply intended to make the language of the report more precise and I would ask this House to accept them."

"Statements by the President"
"I would like to make several statements at the beginning of this part-session."
"On 6 November 2010 in Moscow, unknown assailants inflicted a savage beating on the journalist Oleg Kashin."
"This brutal assault, which was not motivated by robbery, deserves the most severe condemnation."
"We note and welcome the swift reaction of President Medvedev in this situation and his personal commitment to finding the perpetrators, and we hope this will be effective."
"Secondly, on 31 October, and for the first time in two years, an opposition demonstration was held in Triumph Square in Moscow without the police intervening."
"We take this as a promising signal from the Russian authorities, in the hope that the appeals of the European Parliament made over the years for further democratisation of public life in Russia have not gone unheeded."
"Thirdly, 10 days ago in Baghdad, an attack was made on Christians who were at prayer in their church."
"Some people were killed, and others were injured."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I reiterate my call for respect for freedom of religion and for an end to the religiously motivated violence which is being witnessed in this part of the world."
"Fourthly, on 10 December, a ceremony will be held in Stockholm to award this year's Nobel Prizes."
"We consider unacceptable the attempts made by the Chinese authorities to put pressure on Member States of the European Union not to participate in the ceremony."
"The European Parliament strives unremittingly for the fundamental and inalienable rights of every person throughout the world to be respected, and we do not, of course, make exceptions for China."
"At the ceremony in December, the head of the European Union delegation in Norway will represent the European Union and, therefore, the European Parliament too."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, the Veneto region of Italy has been hit by serious natural disasters, in particular, the provinces of Vicenza, Padova and Verona."
"These catastrophic floods have affected around 500 000 people in various ways and have caused hundreds of millions of euro of damage."
"This tragedy has brought all productive sectors, small and medium-sized enterprises, and various other sectors, to their knees."
"I should like to appeal to my fellow Members and the European institutions to do everything possible to support these people and find solutions to respond to this disaster, within the limits of the rules set out by the European Union Solidarity Fund and the Structural Funds."
"I should also like to note that Italy also has another reason to weep today, although for a completely different reason: the collapse of Pompeii."
"I only wished to note it here in order to emphasise the significance and importance of an event of this type and the need for Europe to keep an eye on these things as well."
"Thank you for making this point."
"Please also use the one-minute speeches for this."
"This is also a subject which can be raised in a one-minute speech."
"Thank you, Mr Berlinguer, for raising this matter."

"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Wednesday:"
"The debate on 'Strengthening the OSCE: a role for the EU' will be based on a statement by the Council on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"The Gauzès report on alternative investment fund managers and the statement by the Commission on the Single Market Act will be taken, in this order, after the debate on the EU external strategy on passenger name records and before the oral question on innovation partnerships."
"Mrs Griesbeck's two recommendations on the agreement between the European Union and Georgia have been withdrawn from the agenda."
"Thursday:"
"Mrs Lichtenberger's report on the request for waiver of the immunity of Krzysztof Lisek has been entered on Thursday's voting list."
"The vote on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament on closure of the accounts of the European Police College for the financial year 2008 has been postponed to the next part-session."
"The vote on the motions for resolutions on Ukraine has been postponed to the November II part-session in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, our group opposes the postponement of the vote on the closure of the CEPOL accounts, because this institution has had discharge refused due to irregularities."
"We think that decisions need to be made urgently, so we cannot postpone the vote."
"Mr President, I am not going to speak for very long."
"The EU has a very long and undistinguished record as far as its accounting procedures are concerned."
"I understand that the Court of Auditors has declined to sign off the budget for the 14th time running."
"The entity which is being discussed now has a similar - and, if possible, even less distinguished - record."
"It is important that this matter be addressed by the European Parliament forthwith if the European Parliament is to have any credibility at all in these matters."
"(FR) Mr President, may I remind you that it was I who was the rapporteur for the report on the discharge of the European Police College (CEPOL)."
"I can tell you that in the Committee on Budgetary Control, with the shadow rapporteurs, we planned a hearing on 30 November concerning this discharge and closure of the accounts in order to hear not only the Director of CEPOL but also the Chair of its Governing Board, and that the Committee on Budgetary Control has not yet finished with the enquiry into the discharge for 2008."
"Some corrections have been made to the accounts for 2008 with the new Director of CEPOL."
"I would be really saddened, however, if Parliament did not complete this enquiry and I propose that, above all, you do not close the accounts, Mr President and ladies and gentlemen."
"It really would be a serious mistake for us to close the accounts during this part-session."
"(DE) Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to request that the vote be held."
"It has already been deferred once, before the elections."
"We should not now defer it until after the EU-Ukraine summit."
"In this resolution, we call on the summit and also on the Commission and the Council to push ahead quickly with the negotiations with Ukraine in respect of the free trade agreement, visa facilitation and the matter of the association agreement."
"However, we would also like discussion to take place regarding the fact that the opposition was disadvantaged in the regional and local elections, that it was not able to stand everywhere and, moreover, that there is increasingly little separation of the executive and the judiciary."
"It is important to make clear our positive approach to Ukraine."
"It is a European country that must have a European perspective."
"We do not want it to descend into an authoritarian regime that makes it impossible to achieve this goal."
"We should pass a resolution ahead of the summit, since otherwise it may be misinterpreted as meaning that the European Parliament does not oppose such negative positions."
"We have seen nearly all the electoral observer organisations conclude that the elections were problematic."
"We are practically the last to take a position on this."
"We should not bring about the loss of our own credibility."
"Mr President, this is very much about Parliament being before or after: before the summit meeting or after the summit meeting."
"It is very much about trying to exert influence or to limit ourselves to making a comment afterwards."
"It is fair to say that in Ukraine, some things are developing in the right direction but there are a lot of things that are moving on the wrong track and, if they continue, they will move Ukraine further from European cooperation."
"When we raise worries and concerns, we are not trying to raise obstacles, we are trying to get rid of them, and that is why we want the resolution to be adopted now."
"We know that in Ukrainian society and in the Ukrainian Government, there is a keen interest in listening to what the European Parliament has to say on these matters."
"If we speak out, they will listen and be aware."
"If we do not speak out, they will note that as well."
"That is why we favour a decision on the resolution at this part-session."
"(DE) Mr President, I am somewhat surprised, because there was an agreement between all the parties that a very carefully prepared resolution would be passed during the November II session in Strasbourg."
"Of course, everyone has a right to change their mind."
"I simply feel firstly that it would be sensible to wait for the report by the electoral observers, so that once this has been clearly presented, we can then base our statements on that."
"Secondly, there is no question that in our view, there were problems with these elections; in some cases, serious problems."
"We are not the ex officio defenders, but, ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), please do not be the ex officio defenders of the opposition."
"If you were to be as critical of the opposition as we are of the government, then we would be able to find a common denominator."
"I advocate that we observe matters in Ukraine objectively, not through party political spectacles."
"I recommend that we make our decision in November."
"However, if a majority here today decide that we should vote today, then I would request and urge the PPE Group to join us in attempting to find a common critical way forward on all the critical issues, not just against the government."
"Upcoming EU-US summit and Transatlantic Economic Council - EU-US Data Protection Agreement (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"Council and Commission statements on the upcoming EU-US summit and the meeting of the Transatlantic Economic Council and"
"Council and Commission statements on the EU-US data protection agreement."
"Mr President, Mrs Reding, Commissioner, honourable Members, as you know, the debate on the cooperation between the United States and the EU has been ongoing for some time now and, notably, we received a Commission proposal on 28 May 2010 requesting approval for the opening of negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and the United States on the protection of personal data, a subject that has been discussed several times before, including in this House."
"At the same time, the Commission has been acting on the work of the EU-US High-Level Contact Group on Data Protection and Data Sharing, which drew up a report in 2008 that was also made available to the European Parliament."
"The data protection discussed in that report is, of course, a fundamental subject as far as Europe is concerned."
"It is a fundamental freedom which is enshrined in Article 16 of the treaty, and to which the Presidency attaches particular importance."
"Therefore, the Presidency supports all initiatives aimed at improving data protection in transatlantic relations and at ensuring an adequate level of such protection."
"This agreement should take account of the data protection principles laid down in various documents: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the 1995 Data Protection Directive and the 2008 Framework Decision."
"I said we need to achieve an adequate level of data protection, and this must be interpreted as not always being an equivalent or identical one."
"There must be a high, adequate level of protection of the rights of the individual, but the way in which these rights are guaranteed may differ from country to country."
"Each system has specific characteristics, including with regard to data protection, and this must not pose a fundamental problem."
"What is important, however, is that we can guarantee that the civil rights contained in the future agreement are enforceable, and are enforceable in favour of everyone concerned."
"How will the United States and the European Union guarantee that these rights are enforceable in specific terms?"
"Each party will have to decide this for itself."
"We take the view that, in the same way that a European directive can be transposed differently by different Member States, an international agreement can also be transposed in different ways."
"Yet what matters to everyone at all events is the end result: having rights that are enforceable in favour of the parties concerned on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean."
"Since the Council shares Parliament's concern on this point, it will make a request, in its decision authorising the opening of negotiations, for the Commission to submit a report to the Council in the course of those negotiations, focusing, in particular, on the specific question as to how the specific enforceability of rights laid down in the agreement will be guaranteed."
"Sectoral agreements have already been concluded in the past, with specific data protection arrangements that were different for each sector; and, at present, the differing provisions of these agreements form a kind of inextricable tangle that really hampers the task of the police officers responsible for applying the data protection provisions."
"The negotiations on these specific agreements are under great time pressure."
"This was true of the Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreements and of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP); you are familiar with the discussions."
"Thus, when it comes to the forthcoming comprehensive data protection agreement in which the data protection principles are to be enshrined, we must try to avoid the need to repeatedly negotiate new sectoral agreements."
"On the other hand, we must also be realistic and understand that a single comprehensive agreement with the United States in the field of data protection will never be able to eliminate all possible future problems."
"We should bear in mind, therefore, that it is still possible to conclude additional specific agreements afterwards."
"Thus, there will have to be what is known as an 'umbrella agreement', which lays down fundamental rights but does not, in itself, form a basis for data transfer."
"Data must be transferred on the basis of other existing or future specific agreements."
"By way of conclusion, therefore, Mr President, I should like to emphasise that the Presidency is striving to have the negotiating mandate for this comprehensive agreement dealt with at the same time as the three mandates for the PNR agreements with Australia, Canada and the United States, and that we should very much like to discuss the matter at the Council meeting on 2 and 3 December next. Thank you for your attention."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Baroness Ashton could not be with us today so I will cover both the EU-US summit and the Transatlantic Economic Council - often called the TEC."
"As you know, the summit will take place in Lisbon on 20 November; it needs to demonstrate the added value of the EU-US partnership and its continued relevance in the 21st century."
"Let me take this opportunity to welcome the active contribution of the European Parliament to EU-US relations and inform Members about our objectives for the summit."
"The EU and the US are still suffering from the aftermath of the economic crisis."
"Therefore, the economy and jobs will be at the heart of the summit's discussions."
"We will start by reviewing relevant results of the G20 summit and will discuss our respective contributions to sustainable and balanced global recovery."
"We also want the summit to underline the need to conclude an ambitious, comprehensive and balanced agreement in the WTO on the Doha Development Agenda."
"We will state our joint intent to resist protectionism at home and abroad."
"We will focus on expanding the economic benefits of the transatlantic economy."
"As regards the Transatlantic Economic Council, I very much welcome your ideas as expressed in the resolution."
"I would like to underline three elements in particular: the importance of strengthening the strategic components of the Transatlantic Economic Council; the need for the TEC to support and foster cooperation on all matters affecting the regulatory environment for industries and consumers in the EU and the US; and the crucial role of legislators in becoming guardians and actors in the convergence of our approaches."
"Let me tell you some of my own views on EU-US relations and why I think the TEC is of importance."
"The EU and the US are the world's most integrated economies; we are each other's largest trade and investment partners; we share common values and responsibilities for tackling global challenges on a variety of issues, be it innovation or environmental challenges, energy security or access to raw materials."
"Even if our respective approaches to economic and regulatory issues remain different, consumer safety and data protection illustrate this."
"What comforts me is our proven ability to work together when times get tough."
"We pooled our efforts very effectively in fighting the economic and financial crisis; our joint pledge at the G20 and WTO has helped to fend off protectionist moves."
"Two years on, the EU and the US are now moving towards the next phase: the creation of smart and sustainable growth and jobs while facing serious challenges and increasing competition from emerging economies."
"The question is: how can reinforced cooperation with the US help us to get there?"
"In my view, both the EU and the US need to rethink and probably redefine the transatlantic partnership to adapt to the new situation."
"We need to ask ourselves today what the transatlantic market place should look like in 2020."
"Will the EU and the US be leaders in innovative technologies which have the capacity to transform society, such as electric cars and smart grids?"
"Will they succeed in jointly promoting open ICT services networks and transparent regulation?"
"Will our SMEs prosper and access new markets by protecting their intellectual property rights?"
"Will consumers benefit from information exchanges between the US and the EU on dangerous products?"
"How will we approach security threats and terrorism?"
"By unilateral activism or by relying on more effective and mutually agreed solutions to foster secure trade?"
"How should we approach economic challenges posed by emerging economies in areas including intellectual property rights, access to raw materials or subsidisation of domestic industries?"
"The relaunch of the TEC is an attempt to develop this strategic relationship."
"With my counterpart, the US Co-Chair of the TEC, Michael Froman, we have agreed to set new directions."
"We envisage the TEC as the main political platform where we can discuss economic issues, strategic issues - including third country issues - and regulatory issues."
"In advising the Commission and the US Administration, legislators, businesses and consumers have provided and should continue to provide crucial input and come up with possible transatlantic solutions to existing and potential problems."
"The next TEC meeting will take place on 17 December in Washington."
"It should focus on three main themes: innovation and emerging technologies; building the transatlantic market place and building the strategies for greening our economies."
"On energy policy: the EU-US Energy Council will meet on the eve of the summit; it will continue to work on framing joint responses to energy security."
"Our intention is that the summit should ask the Energy Council to intensify EU-US cooperation on the development and deployment of green energy technologies and promote exchanges between our researchers to allow them to participate freely in each other's energy research programmes."
"This work supports both our efforts on climate change and the creation of new jobs."
"We are aware of the deep concern amongst our citizens about the impact of the global climate change."
"At the summit, we will press the US on the need for the Cancún conference to deliver a significant step towards a comprehensive global framework for tackling climate change."
"On development: the EU and the US are the world's leading aid donors."
"As well as working on implementing millennium development goals on food security and helping the poorest countries adapt to climate change, we need to work closely on coordinating our efforts in the recipient countries so as to maximise the effectiveness and impact of our aid and avoid duplication of effort."
"On security: recognising that fundamental rights and the security of citizens are complementary and mutually reinforcing; we need to ensure that there is a good balance between the two in all of our work."
"I know that Viviane Reding will discuss this important issue, including the agreement on passenger name records, with you later today."
"The EU and the US must also work together in a more comprehensive way to tackle new threats to the global networks, such as cyber effects and cyber crime."
"Finally, in the foreign policy arena, we will stress our joint strategies and maximise our impact."
"We must support the Middle East peace process, with the aim of achieving a framework for agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority within a year."
"On Iran, the EU has delivered on tougher sanctions while, at the same time, being strongly committed to seeking engagement with Iran."
"So overall, the summit will cover a range of issues that lie at the heart of the transatlantic relationship."
"I look forward to the debates that will now ensue."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, on 26 May, the Commission recommended that the Council should authorise negotiations on the EU-US data protection agreement and submitted draft negotiation guidelines."
"This recommendation for a mandate is now being discussed in the Council."
"I know that the European Parliament shares my view: this is a unique opportunity, an opportunity to reach a high level of personal data protection, while bringing new dynamism to our transatlantic partnership."
"Sharing relevant information is an essential element of effective cooperation in the fight against crime, not only inside the EU, but also with the US."
"The EU-US security partnership is very important: it is indispensable and that is why we should allow it to function."
"In the past, personal data protection has been a recurrent issue."
"Each time exchange of data across the Atlantic for law enforcement purposes has been discussed, the question has come up again."
"We believe that an agreement can ease negotiations on specific future agreements involving the sharing of personal data."
"Such an agreement will also give us the opportunity to build on common ground and to find satisfactory solutions for future cooperation."
"Let me be very clear on this."
"We need a general agreement which provides a coherent and legally binding framework in order to protect personal data and to enforce the rights of individuals."
"We also know that there are currently many specific agreements on data sharing between the US and the Member States, and between the US and the EU."
"Each of these has its own ad hoc data protection rules."
"That means a patchwork of different safeguards and provisions for processing personal data."
"We thus have a solution which is far from satisfactory, and which is hardly justifiable since we are talking about a fundamental right - and the right to data protection is a fundamental right."
"With your support, I am determined to end this piecemeal approach and to negotiate an umbrella agreement that:"
"provides a coherent and harmonised set of data protection standards and includes essential principles such as the principle of proportionality, data minimisation, minimal retention periods and purpose limitation;"
"is applicable to all future and existing agreements dealing with information sharing for law enforcement purposes;"
"contains all the necessary data protection standards in line with the Union's data protection acquis and suggests enforceable rights for individuals, administrative and judicial redress or a non-discrimination clause;"
"ensures the effective application of data protection standards and their control by independent public authorities."
"I believe that citizens and businesses alike expect a single set of legally binding data protection standards, which will then be applied uniformly across the Union, as well as to transatlantic cooperation for law enforcement purposes."
"I also believe that we need to be ambitious."
"I am determined to pursue my objectives and I am confident that I can count on the support of the European Parliament in order to achieve a good agreement with the US, an agreement which will ensure a high level of data protection for all individuals and allow us to pursue the necessary and important cooperation with the United States to prevent terrorism and organised crime."
"Mr President, Mr De Clerck, Mrs Reding, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) supports the joint motion for a resolution and would like to thank those who have spoken here."
"We must understand - ahead of the EU-US summit and now, as the G20 summit takes place - that on many issues - not just economic issues, but also in matters concerning peace and environmental protection - only a joint response by Europe stands a chance of being realised on a global scale."
"For this reason, we would like to have closer cooperation here and, as the European Parliament, are also endeavouring to achieve this with the new majorities in the US Congress, which play a major role in this context."
"Mr De Gucht realises this in the case of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), Mrs Reding in the case of data protection, and we also saw in the case of SWIFT that parliaments play an important part when it comes to realising this."
"Together, the Europeans and Americans - who still account for 60% of the world's gross domestic product - have a chance to lay down such standards and give a positive response to the challenges of terrorism, matters relating to Iran and the Middle East, climate change and many other issues besides."
"We need to make the appropriate efforts here."
"I therefore hope that we can move forward on these general political matters and that progress will be made in the TEC, which has been revived by Mr De Gucht's efforts."
"I hope that the original objective can be realised there so that we can remove trade barriers to arrive at a transatlantic market, which could generate a lot of growth for us while avoiding unnecessary costs - and also, Mrs Reding, moving forward on matters relating to fundamental rights, data protection and similar issues."
"It is necessary to ensure data protection, but for a variety of reasons, we also need to have an exchange of data."
"It is therefore a very good thing that we are attempting to agree on common standards here despite our different legal approaches."
"If you will allow me to make a further comment, in this instance on matters relating to financial markets, it must of course be said that while legislation has been passed to ensure that the events of two years ago cannot be repeated, the Fed has now, for example, decided to place USD 600 million on the market without consultation, with the result that naturally, there are fears concerning inflation and other things and some turbulence in the global economy."
"It will not help us if exchange rates do not develop correctly relative to each other."
"Mr President, I would like to add my very warm thanks to the Council and Commission for their introductory remarks."
"I would particularly like to concentrate on what Mr De Gucht said, because it needs to be noted that the US has changed since 2 November."
"Not that cooperation with the US was perfect before, but it must be feared that it will now be more difficult."
"You mentioned protectionism, Mr De Gucht."
"I believe that we must act jointly to counter protectionism."
"It may provide a solution for one area or another in the short term, but overall, it is no solution because it results in competitive protectionism that is quite definitely not in our interests."
"You referred to energy matters."
"Today, the Commission published a paper on energy - Energy 2020."
"While I would criticise some aspects of this, the thinking behind it is along the right lines."
"However, I cannot imagine that the US will publish a similar paper with similar guidelines."
"This area will be very difficult, and all the more so since 2 November."
"You also mentioned electric cars and the matter of developing smart grids jointly with the US, and these are indeed things that we should attempt."
"At the same time, however, we need to tell the US that we also have other partners."
"We can also try to develop similar things with China, Brazil or other countries."
"We need to give the Americans the impression that we are not necessarily reliant on them."
"We would like to do it with them, but they are not our only partner - particularly when it comes to climate change."
"Let us bear in mind the behaviour of the US and President Obama's inability to act because laws had not yet been passed."
"Now, with the current majorities in Congress, the law is not even on the table - with the result that we must assume that things will be more difficult unless we succeed in taking some of these matters further with countries such as China, India or Brazil."
"We have to acknowledge this fact clearly."
"I will respond to Mr Brok's comments by saying that initially, there was a great difference, but now there is less difference."
"It is absolutely right and vital, from our point of view, too, that the US goes back to balancing its budget."
"I have nothing against that; on the contrary, it is a good thing if the US tries to create new jobs again - good for America, and good for us."
"However, it needs to be done in a coordinated way."
"The Americans therefore need to get used to accepting greater global cooperation in this area too, particularly cooperation with Europe."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the transatlantic relationship is Europe's most important."
"Not only do we still account for half of the global economy, but our democracies are the key drivers of the maintenance of human rights and the rule of law."
"However, we sometimes seem to either take each other for granted or let our family squabbles obscure our overriding common interests."
"That is why our joint resolution insists on the importance of a strategic partnership, one which stresses coordination and cooperation in meeting global challenges and regional issues and in which legislators are full and serious players."
"That strategic partnership must be rooted in economic and political freedom."
"I am pleased that MEPs are reiterating our insistence on the aim of a free transatlantic market by 2015."
"That means gearing up our ambitions for the removal of trade and regulatory barriers."
"A very large - and growing - part of the transatlantic relationship is about issues of justice, law enforcement and human rights."
"It used to be ad hoc, now it is really one of the core elements."
"The more we anchor our partnership in shared respect for our common values, the more strongly we can act to resonate those values in the wider world."
"In that context, the renewed justification by former President George Bush of water boarding - which is unequivocally torture - sums up everything that went wrong in the disastrous eight years of his Presidency and that made the West both less free and less secure."
"The emerging, widespread evidence of apparent mistreatment of Iraqi detainees by UK and US troops demands examination at the highest level, including at the forthcoming summit and in independent inquiries."
"I was very pleased to hear Vice-President Reding on the data protection agreement."
"It really is vital to have this 'umbrella agreement', as she called it, because at the moment, we are fire-fighting on each individual data sharing agreement."
"If we could just have a settlement, a framework in which individual data sharing requests can be examined, that would be extremely valuable because so much of our attention and squabbles have focused on that subject."
"It is a great prize worth a lot of effort."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the elections of 2 November represent a fairly major turning point in recent American history and one gets the impression that the country is now pausing for breath."
"In such a situation, it is all the more important to signal our reliable cooperation and to set clear priorities for our future work together."
"I am grateful to Mr De Gucht for bringing up the subject of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) at the start of his remarks and for what he said on this matter."
"We need to breathe new life into the TEC."
"So far, the TEC has done very little, but we can still hope."
"I also agree with and support the two aspects that you mentioned, Commissioner; both bilateral cooperation - with a view to the standardisation and regulation of low carbon technologies, for example - but also, above and beyond this, the strategic component."
"We hope that this is a step forward."
"It is regrettable that climate policy will not play a part in the one and a half hour summit in Portugal."
"Nevertheless, it is important that our representatives, President Barroso and President Van Rompuy, make it clear there that Europe will not allow itself to be held back or dragged down by this."
"The focus on development policy is a good thing, and from a European perspective, it would also be good if we could seek to achieve not just any cooperation, but qualified cooperation, by emphasising the Millennium Development Goals and climate policy."
"Finally, in view of the fact that the Presidency has now been weakened and that there are new isolationist tendencies in the US, it will be important for Europe to independently take the initiative internationally, such as in the Middle East in respect of the Palestinians, Syria or Lebanon."
"We should tell the Americans quite clearly that we are prepared to do this and that we want to shoulder this responsibility."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, no bilateral relationship is more important to us than that with the United States."
"We face an uncertain century ahead, which will be characterised by a fundamental shift in the global economic balance of power away from the liberal democracies of Europe and North America to states which do not all share, as yet, our commitments to the rule of law, democracy and human rights."
"As long as I hold my position in this House I will, of course, fight for unity between the North Atlantic democracies in promoting a common vision for the future."
"For example, in pursuing our shared goals for security, we should seek the maximum cooperation to avoid unnecessary difficulty."
"I therefore applaud the work that is being done on the data protection framework and the PNR agreements, but I would urge caution when considering the potentially serious consequences of retrospectively applying new legislation to existing legal judgments, both here and in the United States."
"We must also recognise that the EU does not have legal competence over national governments' own negotiations with third parties."
"I very much hope that on this, as on so many issues of common concern, we can find a practical and acceptable solution."
"Mr President, we believe that cooperation should not preclude independence."
"We believe that the European Union should learn self-respect."
"We believe that good cooperation presupposes respect for the other side's independence."
"We believe that dialogue and relations between the European Union and the United States should be conducted in a spirit of mutual understanding and independence."
"Of the very serious issues which I wanted to comment on, therefore, I would highlight the following as issues which are primarily our responsibility: the need to put real pressure on Israel to resolve the Palestinian question and on Turkey to resolve the Cyprus question, the urgent need to abolish the death penalty in the United States, the fact that President Obama has broken his promise to close the Guantánamo base, the need to defend - and I use the term advisedly - personal data and, finally, the massive issue of climate change."
"We must convince the United States to shoulder its real responsibilities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to refer back to a passage of Commissioner De Gucht's speech on international development cooperation."
"We know how important this is in order to reach the Millennium Objectives."
"Reducing inequalities between rich and poor countries does not only meet a moral requirement, but also contributes to resolving the motives for international conflict and disputes as well as improving quality of life in vast areas of the world."
"The recommendation made in the motion for a resolution to spend 0.7% of industrialised countries' GDP for this purpose by 2015 can therefore be supported, but further measures are essential if the aid is to become effective."
"Coordination between Europe and the United States on aid policy is needed to avoid overlapping interventions in the various geographical areas."
"Best practices for the implementation of the plans must be better defined, and they must respect the needs of the recipients, not the donors."
"Good governance in countries benefiting from the aid policy is essential to increase the effectiveness of the intervention and avoid the dispersion of precious resources through corruption, incapability and a lack of responsibility."
"The last point to note is coherence between the development cooperation policy and the commercial policy."
"For example, in agriculture and fishing, it makes no sense to fund economic development plans with one hand and close the door on products from developing countries with the other."
"The Doha agreement will be a significant step forward in this important sector."
"(DE) Mr President, the coming months will show what the effects will be of the weakening of President Obama in his own country as a result of the relatively poor showing of his party in the recent elections to Congress."
"I am thinking, for example, of whether protectionist tendencies will increase and influence trade and economic policy, or whether President Obama will turn his attention more towards foreign policy areas such as the Iran conflict, the Middle East or the conflict in Afghanistan."
"We shall see."
"For Europe, and for the EU in particular, this should only be of limited interest, because the EU needs to be able to define its own emphases and objectives, and its own interests."
"This is particularly true of the area of global politics, where the European Union's presence is rather dwarfed."
"One only has to think of the Middle East conflict, where we do not even have a place at the negotiating table."
"As everybody knows, on all the relevant issues - whether it is Iran, Afghanistan or the conflict in the Middle East - we tend to sail in the lee of the US, with no vision of our own."
"Yet in areas where greater cooperation with the US would be appropriate - such as in resolving the Cyprus problem, where the US could influence its ally Turkey - very little happens."
"Although President Obama appears to be more interested in the Pacific than in the Atlantic, from our perspective, we need to place greater focus on Eastern Europe and the Middle East."
"Greater cooperation or coordination with the US is undoubtedly also required in the Transatlantic Economic Council."
"There is no doubt that the West - in other words, Europe and the US - should maintain its position as the global leader in the areas of research, innovation and development."
"Finally, we should not forget that improved data protection as well as the maintenance and upholding of citizens' rights should also play an important part at the summit."
"Mr President, the world's centre of gravity is steadily shifting from the West towards the East, with the emergence of new global powers like China and India."
"In this new context, while the EU remains the first commercial power in the world and the US continues to be the first commercial partner of the EU, our cooperation is much more than that: it is a core element of the international system as it is based on common values, historic ties and strategic interests, which is not always the case for other strategic partners."
"From an alliance of necessity during the Cold War, the transatlantic partnership has evolved into an alliance of choice."
"The emergence of a multi-polar world dictates the need for a new definition of modalities for cooperation between the two sides on all existing bilateral and global issues."
"We reiterate the EU Council's conclusions of last September, asking for fresh impetus to be given to the transatlantic relationship and for renewed reflection on ways of creating a true partnership based on our respective strengths and specificities."
"The transatlantic partnership should concentrate on maximising the potential benefits of our economic relationship, with the reinforcement of the Transatlantic Economic Council."
"Unilateral actions, such as the quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, are as worrying as the depreciation of the renminbi."
"(EL) Mr President, the explosion of interest in the European Parliament on the part of the United States in the wake of the rejection of the initial Swift agreement has now died down somewhat."
"However, that does not mean that we are back to business as usual."
"On the contrary."
"The enhanced competence of the European Parliament in the field of the economy, energy, anti-terrorism and fundamental rights is not business as usual."
"The current feeling in the United States that the European Parliament counts, for which we need to congratulate Mr Kennard, the American Ambassador in Brussels, is not business as usual."
"The fact that we have vital and crucial negotiations before us on issues such as those raised by Mrs Reding, on which the European Parliament supports the Commission, as you requested Commissioner, is not business as usual."
"Nor is the fact that the European Parliament has opened a Liaison Office with the US Congress business as usual."
"It is perhaps a good thing that the initial hoo-hah has abated, because we can develop a really strong long-term relationship between the European Parliament and Congress with a clear head, using the new structures being set up."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr De Clerck, Mr De Gucht, Mrs Reding, we have heard enough already about how important transatlantic relations are;"
"I do not believe that anybody here is questioning that."
"The US is one of our most important trading partners and one of our main allies, and as a German, I am acutely aware that what the US has done for us is something that can never be repaid."
"Nonetheless, it also has to be said that you cannot negotiate eye-to-eye if you are constantly bowing."
"If we, as the European Union, want to have a decent relationship of respect with the US, then it is time we showed some backbone where our positions are concerned."
"Mrs Reding, you have once again made it clear that you are the right woman in the right post to do that."
"You mentioned fundamental principles of European data protection law, and I believe we can make no concessions on these in connection with an EU-US data protection agreement."
"We cannot have a race to the bottom here when we are making an agreement that is primarily aimed at protecting our citizens."
"Such protection - the protection of personal data and the safeguarding of privacy - is laid down in a multitude of ways in articles contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The aim of an EU-US data protection agreement must be to realise this; to uphold and not water down the measures that we have taken and implemented in the European Union."
"I am talking here about the rights that you mentioned in respect of access to data, data deletion and correction; about purpose limitation, about proportionality, about the principle of data avoidance and data minimisation."
"At the same time, when negotiating such an agreement, we must, of course, also make sure that this does not take place in a vacuum."
"It will have repercussions on the European Data Protection Directive that is shortly to be revised, on the data protection directive for electronic communications and on the forwarding of Passenger Name Data that is being negotiated by Mrs in 't Veld."
"All this must be seen in context."
"Mrs Reding, I believe that when your mandate is negotiated in the Council on 2 and 3 December, it can be assumed that this House will be behind you."
"I wish you good luck and every success."
"We are with you on this."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the planned agreement is in accordance with the longstanding desire of this esteemed House to finally create binding minimum standards and legal rights in respect of data protection with the US."
"The intention is to fill the gaps in legal protection and achieve a higher standard of data protection for the citizens of the European Union."
"Close cooperation with our US partners is necessary and right."
"However, it must not result in the constitutionally guaranteed rights of European citizens being undermined."
"The Commission's proposed negotiating mandate for such an agreement is good and points us in the right direction."
"As rapporteur for the European Parliament, it is a pleasure for me to take this opportunity to assure the Commission that the present draft has the broad support of all the groups in Parliament."
"From our perspective, it is now urgently necessary that the Council also accepts this proposal, so that the negotiations can commence as soon as possible."
"I have no doubt that it will not be easy to convince our partner across the Atlantic of our concerns in detail."
"I am convinced, however, that the United States was founded on the principles of freedom, democracy and fundamental rights and shares our respect for individual rights in relation to state authorities."
"It is therefore not an impossibility, nor a matter for conflict; rather, there is a realistic possibility of reinforcing our common ground on both sides of the Atlantic and creating a new basis for even closer cooperation."
"I should like to conclude, however, by mentioning one more aspect that is particularly important to us as Parliament: only when we succeed in creating a uniform framework within the EU will we gain the trust of our citizens in respect of transatlantic data protection."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance that the data protection agreement with the US represents a framework for all agreements made by the EU and by the Member States with the US."
"As such, I am looking forward to my work as rapporteur in connection with the data protection agreement with the United States and to cooperating closely with my fellow Members of this Parliament, with the Commission, the Council and also with the US Congress and US Government."
"Mr President, I was in the United States during the mid-term elections and saw something of the political earthquake that took place there."
"There are lessons for Europeans in this, both in our home countries and in the European Union."
"Citizens both in the United States and here want less government intrusion in their lives, control of the deficit and cuts in public expenditure, and for us that should mean a smaller EU budget."
"Turning to defence matters, the recent UK strategic defence and security review reminds us that Britain's pre-eminent defence and security relationship is with the United States."
"That should apply to all other European countries."
"I very much hope that NATO's new strategic concept will demonstrate a revitalised commitment to the alliance which binds the United States to Europe's security."
"We must not allow the distraction of EU defence ambitions to dilute or undermine this."
"We cannot afford duplication and distraction, particularly at a time when defence budgets are being slashed."
"The forthcoming NATO summit on 19 November presents a good opportunity for the 21 NATO allies that are also EU Member States to demonstrate their commitment to the new realities."
"(PT) It is time to urge the US to work towards the peaceful resolution of conflicts, to end military occupation and war, whether it be in Iraq, Afghanistan or the Middle East, to end the embargo on Cuba, to stop supporting the aggressive policies of Israel, which are responsible for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories, and to work towards nuclear disarmament."
"It needs to be made clear that the pretext of the fight against terrorism cannot continue to be used to undermine international law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Collaboration is essential in order to reduce poverty and to end tax havens and speculative capital transfers."
"This summit coincides with the NATO summit in Lisbon, which wishes to revise its strategy, and in which the US is seeking a commitment from its EU allies to a military escalation at a global level, with the aim of securing resource exploitation, market control and political dominance through the threat of military force, which increases the dangers and threats to people."
"We would therefore like to show our solidarity with the struggle of the peace movement, with the workers' struggle and with the many organisations which are building up the 'Yes to peace, no to NATO' campaign, including the demonstration which will take place in Lisbon on 20 November."
"(NL) Mr President, Turkey's strategic importance to transatlantic relations is obvious."
"In the light of this, I am very curious to hear the Council's opinion on the new 'Red Book' of the Turkish National Security Council."
"Logically, this new edition follows the strategy of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"My first question to the Council, with the forthcoming transatlantic summit in mind, is as follows: does the Council share the fear that current Turkish foreign policy is playing into the hands of revisionist actors in the region - principally the Islamic Republic of Iran - and is thus actually undermining stability in the Middle East?"
"My second question is whether, indeed, the Council intends to raise the subject of the Red Book at the transatlantic summit, in view of Turkey's position as being crucial to the EU as a candidate country and also crucial as a NATO partner?"
"Mr President, on the agenda of the TEC meeting in December will be removing trade barriers, which is a sacred aim among globalists that owes more to faith than to reason."
"Economic theory never tires of telling us that international trade makes the world as a whole richer."
"It is more reticent about telling us whether or not everybody in every country benefits."
"The problems that the developed world faces are not too many trade barriers, but too few."
"That is, too few barriers against products from emerging countries such as China, with its low wage rates, grossly undervalued currency and its artificially impoverished home market."
"This means that Chinese goods, which are already low priced because of low wages, become artificially lower still because of the low value of its currency."
"The impoverished home market means that there is negligible demand for consumer imports and even insufficient demand for Chinese goods, making China completely dependent on its export trade."
"Europe responds to this threat by saying it will become more competitive, perhaps by research and development."
"This might be a possibility if China respected international intellectual property rights."
"However, as soon as a novel improvement is developed in the West, China quite ruthlessly and without any shame copies the product and produces it at a fraction of the price."
"On the agenda of the EU-US summit will be increasing jobs on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Some hope of that if we continue to embrace globalism."
"(ES) Relations between the European Union and the United States are, as has already been said, based on principles, ideas, a shared history and a shared passion for freedom."
"These values could, however, end up being diluted in rhetoric and languishing if we do not move from words to actions."
"One of the most reliable pieces of work that has been done in this House on the state of transatlantic relations since the presidential elections is the report by my colleague, Mr Millán Mon."
"The report is included in the current joint motion for a resolution that we will vote on tomorrow, and contains a series of specific initiatives that are still perfectly valid for establishing a genuine partnership, on which we need to get to work, Commissioner."
"Here, there has been talk of the importance of economic and trade relations, and 15 EU Member States alone invest more in Texas than the 50 US States invest in Japan."
"We need to give new impetus to the summit mechanisms, create a Euro-American Assembly and, most importantly, create a coordination and consultation mechanism for global issues and the most crucial areas of the world - the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan - and relations with the emerging powers."
"Mr President, during President Obama's recent tour of the Middle East, we heard him say that they saw their most important partnership as being that between the United States and India."
"This reminded me of one of the fundamental aspects of Mr Millán Mon's report, in which he recalled President Obama saying in Berlin that Europe was the most important strategic ally of the United States."
"The upcoming EU-US summit will be a wonderful opportunity to clarify this point and to clearly define what the strategic partnership really is."
"We could start by asking the United States to support the European Union in its demands to have an institutional presence, for example, in the United Nations General Assembly, based on the new approaches introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mr President, not so long ago, this Parliament adopted a resolution which spoke about the new possibilities for developing transatlantic relations after the election of President Obama in the United States."
"The forthcoming European Union-United States summit will take place in a slightly different context."
"It does not mean, however, that the opportunities are not there."
"It is simply that the context is a little bit more complicated."
"I think, therefore, that we will face certain challenges in the preparation of this summit."
"I hope we can persuade our American allies to continue their multilateral approach in international relations and to show this multilateralism in a practical approach in their relations with the European Union."
"We have to insist on the development of the civilian dimension of the peace enforcement and peace keeping missions, as well as of the crisis management and post-crisis rehabilitation operation."
"It is also important to try and coordinate our policies on development aid in order to be more effective in this endeavour."
"On non-proliferation, we should not only keep our capacity to work together but also act in a smart way."
"Part of this process is the ratification of the new START Treaty, which is still pending in the United States Congress."
"We hope that the new realities of Congress will not hamper the possibilities for voting for this treaty."
"The US has announced and has already started the reworking of relations with Russia."
"I think this reworking is very important to us and it is also important, if we look forward, for a trilateral dialogue: Russia, the United States and the European Union on the most important global topics."
"Above all, I hope that during this summit, we can consolidate the European partnership instinct of the United States."
"We need a functional mechanism for permanent communication, consultation and coordination with our American allies."
"Mr President, to be a credible partner and to act as a global player, the EU needs to speak with one voice."
"President Obama and his administration have rightly made this known, and we need to be able to honestly criticise each other like that."
"This is necessary to ensure a credible transatlantic relationship characterised by complementarity and coordination."
"How can we work together on defending human rights, the rule of law and democracy in this world when Hillary Clinton gives a speech on a vision for global Internet freedom while the US is insisting on keeping the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) non-transparent, leading to tremendous concerns about Internet freedom?"
"This is contradictory and undermines our credibility."
"Why do we have to learn through leaked documents that torture was inflicted and condoned in Iraq?"
"We call for an independent inquiry."
"Why could the Commission not answer my question about requests made by the US Administration with regard to criminal measures against Wikileaks?"
"Does it consider the transatlantic relationship more important than questions from MEPs?"
"Why does the US push European companies to take sanctions beyond those taken by the EU regarding Iran?"
"The US should respect the EU's independence and its complementary role."
"Both the EU and the US have to work transparently, respect each other's independence and allow for democratic scrutiny of our actions."
"Is it not that which distinguishes us - the US and the EU - from others, most notably with regard to fundamental freedoms and human rights?"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the transatlantic dialogue, there are many things that unite us - I am talking about basic values, the fundamental rights of freedom and democracy - but there are also some things that divide us, namely, how these rights are applied and put in concrete terms when it comes to transatlantic relations."
"In particular, this contradiction repeatedly comes very clearly to the fore in respect of security issues."
"Data protection is a source of constant misunderstanding; we have long known that."
"Consequently, the framework agreement - if we succeed in bringing about a very good one - will be a great step forward."
"We need to find a solution here that also enables citizens on both sides of the Atlantic to assert their rights in respect of the other partner."
"A second important area in which our principles are similar but our approaches diverge considerably is the area of climate change."
"I would therefore very much like to see this on the agenda and being clearly discussed."
"We cannot allow the European Union to use the transatlantic dialogue to weaken its own promises and commitments."
"(PL) Mr President, one of the fundamental principles of cooperation in the European Union is the freedom of movement of people."
"In its capacity as an entity recognised by international law, the reformed Union strives for the equal treatment of all citizens, which includes the freedom to travel throughout the world."
"In anticipation of the forthcoming European Union-US summit, it needs to be reiterated that out of 27 Member States, four, including Poland, are still subject to a restrictive visa regime."
"During the summit, the matter of the equal treatment of EU Member States in the visa waiver programme should be made a priority."
"This will be the first test of the effectiveness of the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy."
"We will find out, too, if the talks with President Barack Obama are treated as the beginning of specific dialogue or if they prove to be a courtesy meeting on the occasion of the NATO summit which will be under way."
"Taking a strong line on the visa issue will show whether the US is treating the Union seriously as an entity recognised by international law."
"(EL) Mr President, we support the joint motion for a resolution by the political groups."
"We do, of course, need to debate the issues before the EU-US summit and before the G20 summit."
"The United States are our natural allies."
"However, an alliance means equality and there can therefore only be a true alliance where relations are set on an equal footing."
"We need to engage in closer, institutionalised cooperation, primarily in order to promote global democracy and human rights, a society of knowledge and science, global security and stability and data exchange, and this must be done on an equal and mutual footing, as Mrs Reding said."
"Within this framework, of course, global drug trafficking and the threat which it represents to international policy, security and stability, has been overlooked."
"We also need to cooperate on efforts towards crisis management and conflict resolution and the development of third countries."
"However, whereas Europe basically supports the development of third countries, the United States does not."
"If we want real balance, development and security issues need to be divided between the United States and Europe within the framework of international action in general."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to make three brief points, on behalf also of some of my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"These are critical points that I would ask the representatives of the Commission to bring up in their discussions."
"The first is that although it has already been passed, the travel promotion tax is an unacceptable unilateral decision by the US Government."
"We hope that you can persuade it to think again on this."
"Secondly, the exclusion of Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and Cyprus from the visa waiver programme is something that the European Parliament cannot endorse, and, in our opinion, it should not be allowed to continue."
"Thirdly, we welcome the joint efforts to elaborate international security standards and to develop smart security concepts, but unilateral stipulations such as compulsory container scanning are not a solution because they are one-sided and disproportionate."
"The costs are out of all proportion to the benefit and it is unreasonable to expect this of European ports and enterprises."
"(BG) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since President Obama has assumed office, relations between the European Union and the United States have entered a new era of stable cooperation."
"The summit in Cancún, which will be starting in a fortnight, will provide a fine opportunity for the US and Europe to adopt the same stance and lead the other countries towards a lasting, binding agreement on combating global climate change."
"Time is of the essence."
"Kyoto runs out in two years, but we need certainty and time to adapt."
"We must give a clear signal to developing countries by providing cooperation in the transfer of technology and suitable financial support."
"I am sure that, as the Chinese ambassador also emphasised during the meeting with us today, the US, the European Union and China will assume their responsibility when they sit down at the negotiating table and will lead the way in the efforts to achieve a new agreement guaranteeing the safety of future generations."
"(DE) Mr President, the United States and Europe are the West's companions in fate."
"Access to third country markets is a shared concern and is in the interests of both the EU and the US, particularly since the economic upturn following the financial crisis is likely to begin in emerging countries such as Brazil, India and China, where there remain considerable and discriminatory trade barriers as well as non-tariff barriers to trade."
"We are convinced that the Transatlantic Economic Council not only can, but indeed must, play an important part in promoting a joint approach by the Economic Union and the US to their trade relations with third countries."
"We urge this Transatlantic Economic Council to work towards a common approach and a common strategy for new free trade agreements by the US and the EU, although I realise that this will not be without its problems."
"Furthermore, such harmonisation between the US and the EU is urgently and rightly being demanded by industry in the context of the G8 and G20, as well as in WTO negotiations."
"Moreover - and I expect the US shares this desire - we would like to see the Doha Development Round being concluded as quickly as possible."
"However, it will be necessary not just for us to make new and substantive proposals, but also for the emerging economies to move towards us."
"Here, too, a common strategy by the US and the European Union would be beneficial to both sides."
"If I may address you directly, Commissioner De Gucht: when it comes to cooperation, it would be good if the Commission and Parliament could learn something from the way that Washington works together in the area of trade policy."
"(RO) I think that one of the items for discussion during the transatlantic dialogue at the forthcoming European Union-US bilateral summit must be the lifting of visa requirements for the four EU Member States whose citizens are still subject to this travel restriction; namely, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and Cyprus."
"I deplore the lack of flexibility on the US side in view of the consistent progress which has been made by these countries, especially since their accession to the European Union."
"I believe that this nit-picking over technical details concerning admission to the visa waiver programme must be opposed more firmly and effectively by the European Union's representatives."
"It is the European Union's duty to display, as a whole, a more active and clearer show of solidarity with all of the Member States' citizens."
"I would also like to stress the need for cooperation on development and humanitarian aid at a time when relations between the US and the European Union are of paramount importance in the current economic and geostrategic climate."
"(FR) Mr President, no one can seriously give an assurance, in this House, that the measures taken on both sides of the Atlantic will prevent a future financial crisis."
"This issue must, therefore, be put back on the agenda, and we must go further with regard to supervision, banks' equity capital, prohibition of certain financial products and the fight against tax havens."
"My second point is that everyone can see that we are completely interdependent in terms of finance, economy and currency."
"That is why any decision taken unilaterally, without consultation, is not going in the right direction."
"I am, of course, thinking about the European Development Fund's (EDF) action a few days ago."
"We have to move forward together in order to reform, for example, the international monetary system."
"We also have to take action together to make international institutions more balanced, more transparent and more democratic."
"If we want Europe's voice to be heard on the major issues, however, it really has to take the initiative and to speak with one voice."
"That is what we will demonstrate in a few hours, for example, at the G20 summit; at least, I very much hope so."
"(ES) Mr President, the Union's most important strategic relationship is the one it has with the United States."
"We must maintain a continuous dialogue on bilateral issues and also on global issues, and try to ensure the most coordinated action possible."
"In my view, this is the main message of tomorrow's resolution."
"I therefore regretted the fact that the planned summit in May was not held."
"Moreover, I found the argument given at the time that there was no agenda to be absurd."
"There is always an agenda between two partners that are so important and which are immersed in a global economic crisis, and when there are challenges such as terrorism, climate change, energy security or nuclear proliferation."
"Moreover, there are major regional conflicts, for example, the Middle East peace process, the Iranian nuclear challenge or the issue of Afghanistan, which, in my view, are worthy of coordinated action by the United States and the European Union."
"I hope that the forthcoming Lisbon summit will be a success."
"There are many issues to tackle, some of which I have already mentioned."
"Moreover, the world is changing."
"Asia is in the ascendancy; let us think about the importance of China or India, which President Obama has just visited."
"There is even talk of a post-Western world."
"In this context of a changing world order, we need close coordination between Europe and the United States."
"We have many interests, ideals and values in common."
"We will be stronger if we act in a coordinated way."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has also created new bodies to strengthen the Union's role in the world."
"We should therefore also improve our mechanisms for dialogue and coordination with the United States."
"The resolution adopted by Parliament in March last year contains many ideas as to how to strengthen those institutional mechanisms for dialogue between Brussels and Washington."
"My final comment is that I regret the fact that the representative of the Council only referred to an exchange of data; he did not come here to talk about the summit, about which we heard nothing."
"Unfortunately, the Commission did so only very briefly."
"Who really came here to talk about the summit?"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international terrorism is undoubtedly something that we must fight together; that is beyond dispute."
"However, we must fight it on the basis of our common values and the rule of law, not based on the very individual interpretations of the law currently being proclaimed by former US President George W. Bush in his book and on talk shows."
"I mention that also in view of the new majorities in the US Congress."
"The decisive thing for us is that we advance the level of data protection, that we respect our citizens' rights; for there is one thing that must also be made clear, which is that the song of freedom cannot be played on an instrument of violence."
"We cannot tell people in other countries what we expect of the rule of law if we do not jointly uphold the same standards and act accordingly."
"I am very pleased, however, that President Obama has brought a breath of fresh air into the US, even if his position may appear to have been weakened somewhat recently."
"One thing is clear, and that is that we will be on the side of those who defend this rule of law."
"(IT) (The speaker begins speaking with the microphone turned off) ... by which the new powerhouses of the world move, in my view, the transatlantic area still remains the most developed and efficient economic area on the planet."
"It is true that there is a widespread and - in many ways understandable - rush to a commercial agreement, for example, with countries like China."
"However, I believe we must not forget the fact that the existing relationship between Europe and the United States has, for a very long time, been the link that, more than any other, we must take care to hold dear and guard almost jealously."
"This consideration is a result of the histories of both Europe and the United States."
"Indeed, it is demonstrated by the common love of democracy, peace, rights and the market economy."
"Acceleration of the process of strengthening transatlantic economic integration is indeed indispensable in order to promote global development based on a combination of values whose stated aim is to reach an acceptable standard of living for all people of the world, following a fair and effective policy of multilateralism which contributes to the construction of a more democratic global structure, which is therefore more free."
"I therefore appeal to those managing the European Union's foreign policy at this time."
"Over the years, we have noted how the abilities of the US leadership - whoever the President was - have always had an enormous role in global transatlantic decisions."
"It is time for us, too, to take the situation in hand."
"We derive strength from the will of 500 million people and from a new and more solid institutional structure that must give us the ability to abandon the temptation to hide behind the American giant and instead take the destiny of our people into our own hands, perhaps asking our friends in the United States to state their position on a single seat for the European Union at the United Nations."
"(RO) I welcome the EU-US data protection agreement, which must be supported in order to strengthen cooperation in the areas of combating crime and terrorism."
"As the European Parliament has stated on frequent occasions, the lack of US data protection legislation which is compatible with European legislation raises serious question marks over the actual protection which Europeans will enjoy within the United States."
"In this context, I would like to ask the Commission and Council what guarantees will actually be given in practice concerning the rights of Europeans to lodge judicial and administrative appeals, as well as proportionality in terms of the various US authorities and agencies processing and accessing data and, last but not least, how supervision of the entire process by an independent authority will be guaranteed."
"(PT) The world is experiencing some very difficult times."
"In such difficult times, we should have no doubt as to who is our ally and who is our enemy."
"The United States is one of Europe's key allies."
"Terrorism is being fought on a global scale against entities who do not even have a face both inside and outside our common area, and this fight is aimed at safeguarding the values of civilisation, which we want to defend."
"Yet the pre-eminence of these values that we wish to defend also means that in Parliament, the Commission and the Council, we can and should demand clear rules on data protection, the protection of personal rights and the right to privacy."
"The prevention, investigation and prosecution of crimes cannot happen at the expense of the disregard for and violation of individual rights."
"Neither Europe nor the US would allow this to happen."
"Once again emphasising the critical importance of transatlantic relations and good cooperation at all levels between Europe and the US, we should therefore support negotiations for a future global agreement which sets out rules, safeguards rights and, on a reciprocal basis, does not demand any less from the US than what we are also prepared to concede to the US in the light of this common goal."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Transatlantic Economic Council on 15 December, and especially its discussion of innovation, the digital agenda and energy technologies."
"In the last couple of years, we have seen how difficult it is to harmonise existing legislation and even approaches on moderated industries and services."
"This is therefore a great opportunity to shape our legislation in these new fields where there is no legislation as yet."
"These new fields are precisely what we are talking about; new challenges, like ageing society or climate change, require further development in the legislation for the enabling technologies."
"Finally, Commissioner, it is high time to talk about energy security and think about the Transatlantic Energy Council for the future."
"I wish you good luck for your meeting on 15 December."
"Mr President, the EU-US agenda is as full as ever and both parties should use the opportunity to advance common positions on issues such as financial regulation, climate change, the deepening of trade ties, nuclear proliferation and the fight against terrorism."
"The economic recovery, however, has to be issue number one on the agenda."
"The transatlantic economic relationship is vital to global prosperity as the bilateral trade of our two economies represents almost USD 4.3 trillion."
"Our economic partnership is a key driver of global economic prosperity and represents the largest, most integrated and longest lasting economic relationship in the world."
"Together, our economies account for half of the global economy."
"Therefore, we need to devise common strategies on the further actions we are going to take to ensure stable recovery from the crisis, including regulating the financial markets, the stimulus packages, and strategies to curb currency manipulation of other major global economies."
"On the other hand, we should reconsider whether holding biannual EU-US summits is a good idea."
"President Obama's decision not to attend the previous summit in Madrid earlier this year exposed the excessive EU synergy."
"By insisting on frequent bilateral summits, we risk devaluing them to the extent that they will become irrelevant."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to come back to the anti-counterfeiting agreement which is currently being negotiated, in particular, with the United States."
"This agreement raises some questions also for the United States, particularly among the officials from the US Patents Office."
"Furthermore, 75 US law professors have recently sent a letter to President Obama."
"They consider that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which is a simple executive agreement, would be contrary to the US constitution."
"While the European Parliament, as you know, is about to adopt a resolution on the ACTA Agreement, and this is still causing considerable disquiet and is far from finding unanimous support among our fellow citizens, I think that it would be useful for us to have a very clear response from the US negotiators on two points."
"Can ACTA be ratified by the United States?"
"In their opinion, is ACTA a binding or a voluntary agreement?"
"Indeed, an anti-counterfeiting agreement that does not include China, India and Brazil, and which would not be implemented by the United States, would be seriously lacking in credibility. Thank you."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioners De Gucht and Reding for their intense but realistic approach to the EU-US summit."
"I think it is time to recognise that the US can accomplish none of its strategic goals without Europe."
"Similarly, the EU cannot play its intended role as a world player without close cooperation with America."
"The paradox is that globalisation and the rise of non-Western powers give the US and EU more, rather than fewer, reasons to intensify their cooperation."
"At the same time, we see that the transatlantic gap is expanding, not narrowing."
"Europe occupies a smaller role in current American plans and concerns."
"Therefore, it is crucial to recognise that time and opportunities for strengthening mutual partnership are limited."
"Probably during the next 10 years, the US and EU will have a chance to set an international agenda providing for a value-based and stable world, but only on condition that they act together."
"This has to start with completing the Transatlantic Free Trade Area, which the European Parliament has advocated for several years, overcoming internal divisions in Europe and opposing protectionism."
"Mr President, I would like to speak about the general framework agreement on data protection that Ms Reding has started to negotiate."
"Hardly a week goes by without us hearing about a new terrorist attack or attempted attack, and this is obviously harmful to the well-being of our citizens."
"We need an efficient tool to combat terrorism. This is one obvious area where we can cooperate with our friends across the Atlantic."
"There is clearly an urgent need for this framework agreement on data protection."
"Ms Reding, you have our support on this agreement."
"Of course, we want this agreement, not only to fight against terrorism but also because we have concerns about data protection."
"We would like you to protect the privacy of our citizens and to protect the principles of necessity and proportionality in particular."
"This is not a zero-sum game."
"We do not think that there is a choice between our security and our privacy; we think that we can actually secure both."
"I would like Ms Reding to go into these talks feeling strengthened by the support of the European Parliament and with peace of mind, knowing that we are behind her in securing a deal which is good for our citizens, a deal guaranteeing both our security and our privacy."
"(PL) Mr President, two years ago, when Barack Obama was elected to the office of President of the United States, it seemed that, after the difficult term of office of his predecessor, relations between Europe and America would be normalised."
"It seemed that the times when Washington acted unilaterally in the international arena were coming to an end."
"We all believed that, faced by an enormous crisis, the United States and the Union were going to work together to try to change the world in order to ensure economic security."
"We know, today, that this was a vain hope."
"After the Copenhagen climate summit, and after the way Mr Obama ignored the Spanish Presidency, the Americans have once again humiliated us and the rest of the world by making a unilateral decision to print money."
"Despite the numerous promises made to the representatives of European governments, they have made this decision without any kind of consultation."
"Acting in their own particular interests, they have decided on measures which will adversely affect the European economy."
"The upcoming EU-US summit should be used to express our disapproval and to appeal to be treated as partners."
"Cooperation is not only in our interest, but is also in Washington's interest, particularly in view of the new geopolitical order which is emerging."
"(SK) Relations between the European Union and the US are relations between two great powers, but despite that, I often cannot help thinking that pragmatism is over-ruled by a kind of narrow-minded egotism."
"However, there are some very important topics under discussion and we must resolve these important topics together with our US partner."
"The November summit will be the first meeting between the US and the EU since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force."
"In view of the fact that the European Union and the US represent half of the global economy, one very important topic will be the economy."
"In a time of major crisis, it is necessary to coordinate macro-economic policy, agree on the regulation of the financial sector, and attempt to shut down tax havens and the like."
"It is necessary to focus on concrete problems, and not to do one thing at the expense of the other, in other words, the two partners at the expense of the rest of the world, but to act in a way that is appropriate for two responsible, leading global powers."
"In addition to the November summit of the EU and the US, the December meeting of the Transatlantic Economic Council also provides a platform for responsible and pragmatic policies."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that I caught your eye because I particularly want to thank Commissioner De Gucht for what I thought was a very important reorientation of the Transatlantic Economic Council."
"I was in Washington in July on a mission as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I visited him afterwards to say that we needed to lift the sights of this Economic Council to look at the long range strategic technological issues that we are both working on, and particularly to work around the basis of standards which my committee has been doing a lot of work on over the last few months."
"What we should be doing is creating the common standards for future technologies, not creating new trade barriers by working independently."
"As he said in his statement, it will help us to harness common research programmes, common opportunities for business, and strengthen our competitiveness with our partners in the United States."
"I think that this element of your announcement today is very important."
"I am sorry that so few of my colleagues have talked about it - I know that Ms Herczog did - but I hope that we can work together to take this forward."
"I am disappointed that Elmar Brok has gone because I want to say to him that this new orientation means we will need new people to work in his transatlantic legislators' dialogue because we have new challenges to meet."
"(DE) Mr President, I refer to the data protection agreement and would like to point out that all existing agreements absolutely must comply with European data protection standards."
"This applies not just to the agreement on the forwarding of banking data, but also in the area of Passenger Name Data."
"The Commission cannot deviate from this position when negotiating the data protection agreement with the US."
"We cannot allow EU standards to be tailored to those of the US. We need uniform protection instead of the piecemeal approach that has existed to date, and each new individual agreement on data exchange must include principles such as purpose limitation, minimal retention periods and the right of EU citizens to effective legal remedies in respect of data processing."
"We must not, on any account, allow the EU to keep moving closer to the increasingly grotesque profiling systems of the US or to feed the US with the personal data of EU citizens."
"Notwithstanding this, an agreement without adequate guarantees would have no chance of standing up in the European Court of Justice."
"Mr President, as a member of the EU-US delegation, I take a special interest in the forthcoming summit and I am looking forward to going to the US as part of the delegation in December."
"It is fair to say that the US is our natural ally and, for that reason, I would dispute the statement made here this evening that the world is less secure as a result of American policy rather than more secure."
"If we want to point the finger, we should look at countries where there is no freedom, where there is no democracy, and where terrorists are harboured, before we point the finger at America."
"Having said that, it is important that we approach further meetings and summits with the US as equals because that is what they will respect;"
"We saw in Copenhagen in particular that we were regarded - as some thought - as weaklings."
"That cannot happen again, particularly in issues such as quantitative easing."
"We have to assert ourselves and have our voices heard."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission and the Council, ladies and gentlemen, relations between the European Union and the United States must be based on the maximum guarantee of security in order for our cooperation to succeed."
"We must eliminate all the problems here, within the European Union."
"Visa requirements for citizens of four countries that form part of the 27 Member States is a serious limitation of freedom."
"Last week, a delegation from Parliament put this problem to the Canadian authorities and it seems that they will take it upon themselves to deal with it."
"Trade with the United States is important, as it strengthens our euro and puts the European Union in a position to compete with the great Chinese, Japanese and Indian markets, and we also noted a careful attitude in Canada towards the US and Mexican markets."
"Interacting with the United States on climate change, for sustainable energy and for the global market, is a good start to the talks."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the data protection agreement."
"For me, there is no question that, following the conclusion of a data protection agreement, the existing agreements between the US and the EU will need to be checked and updated in accordance with this new framework agreement."
"That is the real purpose of the agreement that we are working towards here."
"As I see it, the risk of legal uncertainty comes if we did not do this."
"After all, our highest priority must be to protect our citizens."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first answer a number of specific questions which have been put, and start with climate change."
"The new majority in the US House of Representatives is likely to limit President Obama's room for manoeuvre even further."
"We need to make sure that the US does not back-track on its Copenhagen commitments and we must encourage them to contribute to a successful outcome of the COP 16 meeting in Cancún."
"In the meantime, we can advance on concrete issues, such as fast-start finance, reduce emissions from deforestation, and facilitate adaptation to climate change for poor and developing countries."
"These can proceed without US domestic legislation, as can biological research work on clean technologies."
"There was also a question on the US visa waiver programme and the fact that a number of EU Member States - Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland and Romania - are still not admitted to this programme."
"We attach much importance to their admission and we will continue working with our US counterparts on resolving this issue."
"In relation to the introduction of the ESTA fee for travellers under the visa waiver programme, the Commission has repeatedly voiced concern that these new requirements are inconsistent with the commitment of the US to facilitate transatlantic mobility and that they constitute an additional burden for European citizens travelling to the US."
"We need to make sure that work on security issues, such as PNR, goes hand in hand with facilitating transatlantic travel for legitimate travellers."
"Regarding the question on the Wikileaks documents, we are unable to comment on the information contained in the leaks at present."
"However, as a matter of principle, the EU is firmly committed to upholding the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment."
"This is all we can say at this moment in time."
"There was a question from Ms Quisthoudt on the possibility of a free trade agreement with the US."
"We are not considering this at this moment in time, Ms Quisthoudt, because, as regards the EU-US trade relationship, an earlier study conducted by DG Trade on non-tariff measures shows that non-tariff barriers remain the major obstacle in EU-US trade relations and concludes that the GDP of the EU and the US would increase by about EUR 160 billion and exports would grow by 2.1% and 6.1% respectively if half of the non-tariff measures and regulatory differences were removed."
"In fact, there are not that many tariffs any more between the US and the EU."
"That said, existing barriers are often very difficult to remove but this is precisely why, in the TEC, we are pushing for early and upstream cooperation, for example, before we adopt regulations in important areas, in particular, emerging markets and new technologies."
"Regarding the TEC and what its agenda might be, we are currently working with our US counterparts to fix the final agenda for the next TEC meeting, bearing in mind the input from advisers."
"The main themes we are looking at are innovation and emerging technologies, and strategies for greening our economies and building the transatlantic market place."
"Under these themes, we will have opportunities to discuss a wide range of issues including e-health, the interoperability of electronic health records, secure trade, mutual recognition of authorised trade standards and the overall approach to regulation, the Innovation Action Partnership and exchange of information on consumer product safety."
"We will also discuss joint responses to economic challenges."
"Furthermore, at the end of November, as was asked by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I will discuss standards."
"I believe the precise date is 29 November."
"The last question was on the 100% scanning of inbound container freight."
"We are concerned about the US requirements that, by July 2012, all US-bound maritime containers will have to be scanned before being placed on a vessel at a foreign port."
"We believe that this requirement will not bring proven security benefits and will be a barrier to smooth trade."
"For these reasons, the Commission does not envisage the implementation of 100% scanning in EU ports."
"The US Homeland Security Secretary, Janet Napolitano, has announced plans to push back the July 2012 deadline for 100% scanning by two additional years."
"The Commission is hopeful that this delay will lead the US Congress to review its policy and favour a risk-based approach to supply chain security."
"The main challenges for the EU over the next year suggest many synergies and opportunities for cooperation with the US: dealing with the economic crisis; governance, restoring growth and jobs by accelerating reforms, building an area of freedom, justice and security, and pulling our weight on the global stage."
"We have a number of important tasks ahead as we look to the forthcoming EU-US summit and beyond."
"One of them is building a more open and outward-looking EU-US relationship that would take into account the full scope of relations that both the EU and the US are building with emerging powers such as China, India, Russia and Brazil."
"On the economy, jobs and growth are at the heart of the discussion."
"We will compare notes on the G20 results, especially financial and banking reforms and the need to deliver a global trade deal, and look for EU-US added value there."
"At the same time, we need to focus more on delivering the full potential of the transatlantic market."
"My aim will be to refocus the TEC on a transatlantic agenda for jobs, growth and innovation."
"With the support of the EU-US Senate leaders, I will look to move forward on that at the forthcoming TEC meeting on 17 December."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, after the remarks of my colleague Karel De Gucht on the general agreement and relations with the United States, let me concentrate on the future umbrella agreement on data protection."
"It is very clear that we need to share data in order to fight terrorism and organised crime and, at the same time, we need to preserve the rights of citizens to data protection."
"Trying to achieve both in equilibrium will be the content of those negotiations."
"As I have already told you, on 26 May this year, the Commission put forward a proposal for a negotiation mandate."
"We are looking now to the Council to have this mandate agreed upon, hopefully at the beginning of December, so that we can start with real negotiations."
"I absolutely agree with what has been said in this House."
"We need to concentrate on legal security in an umbrella agreement instead of - and I quote a Member of this Parliament - 'fire-fighting on each individual data sharing agreement'."
"If we, the United States and Europe, manage to set common standards, then those common standards will sooner or later become world standards."
"We have to show that those standards are built on our values of justice and fundamental rights and of the right to reciprocity, both of which have to be very clearly put on the transatlantic agenda."
"The question of individuals' rights in such an agreement has also been raised."
"What the Commission has put on the table would mean the following for our European citizens and for the citizens in the United States: enforceable rights for individuals, such as the right to access personal data that has been collected about them and the right to rectify and erase this data, administrative and judicial redress, regardless of nationality or place of residence, and compensation for any damages suffered."
"The effective application of these rights would be ensured by the monitoring and controlling of these data protection standards by independent public authorities and, in this context, a non-discrimination clause should also be included to ensure that all personal data is protected regardless of a person's nationality or place of residence, bearing in mind, at all times, that we need to strike a balance between rights and security and also, at least in my view, not to allow any discrimination on racial grounds."
"In order not to allow this, the Commission will certainly need the help of Parliament."
"I have heard that you want to establish, or you have already established, specific new bilateral relations between Parliament and the United States Congress."
"I think that this will also be very important in order to raise understanding of such data protection agreements on both sides of the Atlantic, so here, you could be of much help in the course of the negotiations."
"Madam President, I can be very brief, as I, of course, concur with the words of Commission Vice-President Reding, namely, that it has been a good debate and that the next stage will be 2 and 3 December."
"The Council does indeed hope to be able to finalise the mandate then, so that the Commission will be able to start the debate in earnest at long last and the negotiations can really begin."
"This represents an opportunity to improve cooperation between the EU and the United States; an opportunity to strike a balance between security and privacy; an opportunity to unite fragmented subject matter; an opportunity, indeed, to translate an explicit request from the European Parliament into a solid framework agreement."
"I presume that today's debate has equipped the Council to endorse the Commission's negotiating mandate, assuming that the Commission also provides feedback at appropriate intervals and that the debate on the specific details, on the enforceable aspect of the rights, continues to develop in such a way that feedback is given."
"I hope, therefore, that the Commission will achieve good results in the short term - hopefully after the Council meeting on 2 and 3 December. Thank you for this debate."
"I have received four motions for resolutionstabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 11 November 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The EU and US form the largest trade partnership, accounting for half of the global economy."
"On the other hand, both partners must cooperate more closely to promote growth and employment in their own economies, especially as 30 million jobs have been wiped out worldwide in recent years by the economic crisis."
"In this respect, the Transatlantic Economic Council remains the most suitable mechanism for achieving the objective of establishing a unified transatlantic market by 2015."
"I believe that during the Lisbon summit, the priority topic of the visa regime applying to all Member States must be discussed."
"As freedom of movement is a highly valued right in the EU, the Commission must continue the political and technical dialogue on the progress made and on future courses of action."
"I should mention that the Romanian Government has recently approved a legislative framework for setting up a national visa information system, facilitating the exchange of data with other Member States regarding visa applications."
"This IT system will improve controls at Romania's borders and the EU's external borders."
"This is a necessary step with the prospect of accession to the Schengen area."
"The signing of an expanded agreement with the United States on data protection is essential and urgently needed; it will prevent these issues from being dealt with by the Member States on the basis of individual bilateral agreements."
"I am fully aware of the difficulties inherent to the signing of this agreement, since there are fairly different approaches to data protection on either side of the Atlantic."
"In the EU, the right to the protection of personal data is explicitly established in both Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In the United States, there is no general law on the protection of private life, nor is there explicit reference to a fundamental right to the protection of private life in the country's constitution."
"There is much to be done with respect to access to data and their rectification, to reciprocity, to legal protection, and to independent supervision."
"I therefore call on the Council to adopt the mandate for negotiating this agreement as quickly as possible, in order to move forward with the negotiations and obtain the progress that is so urgently needed, as well as the resulting transposition of these results into the respective bodies of legislation as quickly as possible."
"First of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the splendid job he has done."
"Being adopted on the eve of the review conference in Astana gives the report special emphasis, sending a message to the decision makers at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe."
"I note with pleasure that through my amendments, references related to the protection of national minorities, which is an organic part of the OSCE's overall security concept and its human dimension, have been incorporated into the report, and that the report managed to draw attention to the role of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities."
"The task and responsibility of the High Commissioner is particularly important in promoting the peaceful coexistence of national minorities and the prevention of potential minority and ethnic conflicts."
"Emphasising the role of the High Commissioner is also important in order to ensure that the parties concerned give due weight to the official's proposals and opinions in the absence of any means of enforcement."
"For years now, one significant yardstick by which to measure relations between the EU and the United States has been climate policy."
"It is with reference to this that images of the United States as a unilateral actor that goes it alone have been strengthened."
"It is time, however, that we reviewed this image."
"It is true that the United States distanced itself from the frontline of climate policy when it refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
"Nevertheless, time has shown that the whole agreement is ineffective and the wrong way to resolve the complex problem of climate change."
"By investing in robust partnerships in the area of technology and in the development of clean energy, agencies responsible for large volumes of emissions have chosen a path which is a lot more promising and which has opened up new horizons."
"It is now time the EU realised what is happening."
"The United States is not going to embark on any emissions trading scheme."
"Not long ago, Obama said that it was most important to do the right thing, which, of course, is useful, whatever we might think about climate change."
"These useful acts include investing in clean energy and improving energy selfsufficiency."
"Of emissions trading, Obama said that it was a means, not an end, and that there were other ways to 'skin the cat'."
"Is Europe now the bogeyman of climate policy, who does not appreciate the situation or learn from his mistakes?"
"We take jobs abroad and raise energy prices; we do everything the hard way instead of taking sensible action."
"We should prevent pollution, in the same way that we should also invest in clean energy and focus on energy selfsufficiency and afforestation."
"Emissions trading, in contrast, is not worth our support."
"It was marketed to us as a way to prepare for an international scheme, which never came."
"Why do we continue to use it to torment our citizens, by depriving them of work and a livelihood?"
"The forthcoming EU-US summit will certainly confirm the exceptional importance of these relations."
"The constant advance in globalisation means that both the EU and the US must pursue a policy of openness, and that the strategic importance of the transatlantic partnership must not be allowed to diminish."
"For this reason, it is important to approach such negotiations with maximum openness, which is an essential prerequisite for the operational character of the forthcoming meetings."
"The past few days have brought three subjects to the fore, which the Union's negotiators should focus their attention on: the different strategies with which the EU and the US approach the current global economic crisis; the different policy approaches for reacting to the unfavourable ecological situation of the planet and to climate change; and security issues."
"The unilateral decisions of the US Federal Reserve to buy USD 600 billion of US government bonds, decisions which were taken without consulting the EU, will weaken Europe's economic position."
"It is therefore essential that the EU clearly declares itself in favour of looking for global currencies other than the US dollar."
"It is important that the Union insists on its role as a pioneer of ecological technology and legislation, and accordingly puts pressure on both the US Government and Congress."
"I believe that it is necessary, at the forthcoming summit, to call on EU leaders to give Washington a clear indication of our support for the efforts of President Obama on global nuclear disarmament and on the ratification of the new START Treaty, which was signed by the Russian and US Presidents this year in Prague."
"Since President Barack Obama triumphed in the elections two years ago, the positions of the EU and the USA have converged significantly, in particular, as regards disarmament, combating climate change, and issues of defusing flashpoints of international conflicts."
"This is significant capital and this line must be pursued."
"Unfortunately, some things have yet to be implemented in order to achieve common transatlantic goals."
"A large part of US society is opposed to actions combating climate change."
"An ambitious bill on limiting greenhouse gas emissions is still stuck in the Senate."
"There is no movement forward on the issue of the abolition of the death penalty which is important to the EU."
"The EU-US summit will take place next month in Lisbon."
"I hope that the EU will be able to convince its partner, the USA, to continue to make progress towards the common goals mentioned."
"It is also important to increasingly include Russia in the transatlantic dialogue."
"As the exchange of data between the European Union and the United States is increasingly necessary and frequent in the context of the fight against terrorism and organised crime, a general and common legal framework must also be drawn up to protect personal data."
"This framework must provide for protection equivalent to that enjoyed by European citizens within the Union."
"The Commission's negotiating mandate is therefore heading in the right direction."
"With regard to the sphere of application, this legal framework must also apply to existing bilateral agreements."
"I hope that the Council adopts the mandate as presented and that Parliament is kept fully and promptly informed of all developments in the negotiations, bearing in mind that Parliament will have the final word on the future agreement."
"The upcoming summit between the European Union and the United States will be the first summit after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, one of the aims of which was to enable Europe to concentrate more on relations with third countries."
"The forthcoming summit will provide us with an opportunity to outline a framework for transatlantic cooperation over the next few years."
"In view of their global position and common values such as the rule of law, democracy and human rights, the European Union and the United States have a key role to play in tackling the challenges of the 21st century."
"We need constructive, strengthened cooperation in areas such as overcoming the economic and financial crisis, the fight against terrorism, global stability, peace in the Middle East, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, development aid and climate change."
"The next climate summit in Cancún is approaching."
"I hope that the United States will demonstrate a greater level of commitment when it comes to joint obligations in the fight against climate change."
"As a significant player in the international arena, we should set an example to other countries."
"The recent ecological catastrophe off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico made it clear that disasters know no boundaries, and their effects are felt worldwide, ultimately by our citizens too."
"It is self-evident that what is needed is cooperation at global level."
"Against the backdrop of last week's elections, it is worth noting that these elections may constitute a point of departure for new, closer relations between the European Parliament and Congress."
"More intensive dialogue will be advantageous to both sides."
"EU external strategy on Passenger Name Record (PNR) (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the European Union's external strategy on the Passenger Name Record (PNR)."
"Madam President, honourable Members, I believe that the importance and necessity of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data have become clear in recent years."
"We need only think of the attacks in New York, and also of the failed attack on the flight from Amsterdam Schiphol to Detroit."
"Of course, in the last few days, too, we have noticed that the threat levels have remained very high."
"We need only look at information coming in from several Member States, and also the increased threat levels in a number of countries, such as France and Spain."
"My home country, too, has increased the threat level for certain places, and a travel alert was also recently received from the United States."
"I believe that the Commission and the Presidency have worked very hard in the PNR field in the last few months."
"The current state of affairs is as follows. On 21 September, the Commission informed the Council about EU policy on the transfer of passenger data to third countries."
"It also presented three draft negotiating mandates for the conclusion of agreements with Canada, the United States and Australia, all three with identical content."
"Therefore, the Council held discussions immediately, on 7 October, regarding these drafts - the method and timing of the three mandates - and decided that all three mandates should indeed have identical content, that the Council would adopt them at the same time, that they would start at the same time, and that the negotiations with the United States, Canada and Australia should start by December of this year at the latest."
"Looking at the content of the mandates and of the PNR agreement, the Council is aware that the most important thing with regard to the three agreements is ensuring a sufficiently high level of data protection."
"In my opinion, our foreign partners, too, must obtain a guarantee that their personal data enjoy sufficient protection."
"Indeed, we have always required this when concluding agreements with other countries."
"The European Union has always focused on this, including in its previous agreements with countries."
"Indeed, I should like to point out that one of those previous agreements - the one with Australia - was once described as the most data protection-friendly agreement of the year."
"Therefore, I believe that the European Parliament is right to impose stringent data protection requirements."
"The Council will therefore ensure that the data protection requirements continue to be respected, and will certainly also ensure, in particular, that the principle of proportionality will always be respected, in order to prevent any infringement of the right to protection of privacy."
"Therefore, in the text of the negotiating mandates, the Council has also placed a strong emphasis on the importance of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"In addition, these mandates lay down retention times and duration of access to PNR data that are proportional and limited."
"This requirement has been highlighted even further by taking into account the various ways in which PNR data can be used."
"Back data can be used only reactively, current data can be used in real time, and risk profiles, in particular, will be drawn up for proactive use."
"With regard to the risk models, we are aware that the European Parliament is very concerned about such 'profiling'."
"Therefore, the Commission will clarify in great detail in its proposal what exactly is meant by 'profiling'."
"In addition, the Presidency will ensure that risk assessments can never result in stigmatisation of persons of a certain ethnic origin."
"I should like to add two comments in my brief introduction: 1) PNR data may indeed only be used by the airlines and thus, not by the Member States' authorities themselves, and, of course, their use by the airlines is subject to permission from the European Union."
"2) The Presidency, too, is aware of the importance Parliament attaches to the general agreement between the EU and the United States in the field of data protection."
"I would refer in this connection to the debate you have just held in this House with my colleague, the Minister for Justice."
"In this brief introduction, I should like to make it clear that, whilst these PNR data are a real priority of the Council's, the Council also really wants to take the utmost account of Parliament's justified concerns with regard to striking the good balance between privacy and security that is always needed."
"I do think that recent events and threats keep forcing us to face the facts."
"Madam President, I shall, of course, be at Parliament's disposal at any time - not only today but also in the next few weeks - to continue the debate on PNR data and on the mandates."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, on 21 September, the Commission issued a package of proposals on the exchange of passenger name records data with third countries and that consisted of a communication on EU external PNR strategy with some principles, as you requested in your resolution from May earlier this year."
"There were also three recommendations on negotiating directives for new PNR agreements with Canada, Australia and the US."
"I would like to thank the authors of the May resolution for the excellent team work we have had and the very constructive cooperation on this file and your constructive way of finding solutions to move forward within the new institutional framework."
"The objective of the communication is to establish for the first time a set of criteria and principles that would guide us in our external relations concerning PNR."
"We can use that as a method for communicating with third countries, but also define our own policy with that."
"The communication will, of course, seek to achieve coherence with the EU PNR that will be presented at a later stage."
"The directive has not been adopted, that is, the mandate has not been adopted by the Council yet, but the mandates, of course, follow the structure of the general communication."
"The issue of profiling was raised by the Belgian Presidency as well."
"Risk assessment is an issue that I know comes up very often in the discussions and that is why I have chosen to raise it immediately."
"The concept of profiling is not, in itself, defined in any legal instrument, but that does not mean that we do not have laws on it."
"The data protection instruments address it, but call it 'Prohibition of Automated Processing': that means that EU data protection legislation prevents any individual from being subject to a decision which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or significantly affects him or her, and which is based solely on the automated processing of data."
"It is not prohibited to process data in an automated matter, but decisions which legally affect individuals must not be taken in an automated manner."
"The PNR communication highlights these principles and lays down efficient and effective measures to safeguard the interest of data subjects."
"In particular, any automated decision should be verified by a human being and allow the data subject to explain his or her point of view."
"This means that the final decision taken towards a person can never be taken in a fully automated manner."
"In this way, the communication seeks to ensure that the processing of data does not go beyond what is legitimate and that the processes comply with fundamental rights, including our current data protection rules."
"You have also requested the Commission to clarify the state of play on bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding relating to the visa waiver programme."
"I will try to enlighten you a little bit on this."
"In August 2007, the US passed the implementing recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act and a section of this covers the modernisation of the visa waiver programme."
"The terms and conditions of this law affect all EU members, independent of whether they are in the visa waiver programme or not."
"On the EU side, this act led to a twin-track approach agreed by the Council in March 2008."
"The EU track concerns the negotiations between the EU and the US regarding conditions for access to the US and, indeed, to the visa waiver programme."
"That falls under EU competences - repatriation of own nationals, enhanced travel document security and airport security."
"This resulted in an EU-US agreement confirming that the EU satisfies these conditions."
"We also had the bilateral track: bilateral negotiations between the EU and between the US and Member States to satisfy US conditions for access to the visa waiver programme which fall under the Member States' competence as opposed to EU competence."
"That is, cooperation with the US on serious crime, counter-terrorism initiatives and information sharing in these areas."
"Under this bilateral track, a number of Member States initially signed a memorandum of understanding with the US."
"This memorandum was not intended to be, in itself, a legal base for any exchange of data."
"They confirmed a willingness of the parties to negotiate agreements on passenger information, screening information on known or suspected terrorists, information to combat terrorism and serious crime, and information, migration and border security matters."
"According to the information that the Commission has just gathered from the Member States, eight Member States have signed such a memorandum of understanding with the US."
"After the signature of these memoranda, the US and some Member States have negotiated two types of agreements."
"First, agreements on enhancing cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime: that concerns cooperation on matching of fingerprints and DNA samples."
"Fourteen Member States have identical agreements with the US."
"Secondly, agreements on the exchange of screening information concerning known or suspected terrorists: these concern exchange of specific information about individuals who are suspected or known terrorists, namely, their full name, their date of birth, passport and citizenship."
"Ten Member States have such agreements."
"But let me add that none of these bilateral agreements cover PNR data."
"The exchange of PNR data only takes place under the EU-US agreement."
"Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the abolition of the former pillar structure, all conditions for the US visa waiver programme now fall under EU competence."
"The Commission is right now evaluating whether the twin-track approach agreed in 2008 should be updated following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I will, of course, keep you fully informed about this."
"The Parliament resolution also refers to the EU-US cooperation on one-stop aviation security."
"This is the responsibility of Vice-President Kallas who is Transport Commissioner."
"He has been pursuing negotiations with the US transportation security administration to exempt US-originating passengers at EU airports from rescreening."
"This should improve efficiency at EU airports without compromising security."
"Vice-President Kallas has kept the Committee on Transport and Tourism of this House informed about these issues."
"It is important to underline that this issue is very much distinct from PNR."
"The one-stop cooperation aviation security is not about transfer of personal data and it does not concern information processing with respect to the pursuit of suspected criminals or terrorists, so as such, we will not raise it in the PNR negotiations."
"To conclude - and I am sorry to be a bit long but I think this needed to be clarified - I would like to note that the Council will, as the President-in-Office from the Belgian Presidency said, adopt the negotiating mandates very soon."
"I am committed as always to keeping you informed about the progress in all the negotiation stages."
"It has already been decided that we will conduct negotiations in parallel with all three countries, but they will not necessarily be completed at the same time."
"I know that this is of particular interest to your House and I therefore remain at your disposal to discuss this now and with the relevant committees and with the other Members whenever you wish to do so."
"Madam President, tomorrow's vote on Passenger Name Records would not have been necessary had we here in Parliament been taken more seriously and kept better informed by the Commission and the Council on the subject of the forwarding of data by the EU and its Member States to third countries since the SWIFT decision."
"If interinstitutional relations continue in this way, there is a risk that we will end up in the same psychological situation with the US in respect of PNR as was the case with SWIFT."
"Nobody wants that, and I also think it would be very dangerous."
"Nonetheless, we must still make the effort to resolve this."
"When it comes down to it, what I feel is missing here is a clear concept of what exchange of data is required in order to prevent terror; we can then adopt a position on the basis of this."
"First SWIFT, then PNR; then came the memorandum of understanding with national databases being accessed; then a framework agreement with the US; then the amendment of our own data protection amending act; now we want to install this programme for one-stop security - it all seems rather piecemeal to me."
"Moreover, we need to clarify or find out once and for all what data the US actually needs to prevent terror, as well as how we can assist with this and bring it about."
"What we have seen so far is a kind of salami tactics, and that is damaging."
"I know that there has been a break as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it is even more damaging for us if the Council and Commission do not keep us informed of these processes."
"I am therefore asking the representatives of the Council and the Commission for five things."
"Firstly, please develop a sensible concept that sets out comprehensively and conclusively what the exchange of data for the purposes of fighting terrorism involves."
"I also ask you to bring about coherence in the EU on matters relating to the forwarding of data and not to divide these into national and European matters."
"I also ask that the competence for decisions on these matters be set at a general European level and for the opportunity to take into account that we may prefer to conclude PNR agreements with Canada and Australia."
"Finally, I request that the process be speeded up, because the terrorists are constantly revealing where our security is lacking - just as recently in the case of freight transport."
"Madam President, in a globalised world, terrorism and crime are, unfortunately, also globally organised, and therefore we know that we need to cooperate internationally and need to exchange data."
"I am very pleased to hear that both the Commission and the Council consider that citizens' rights and data protection are both matters to be accorded very high priority."
"However, that does not mean that Parliament can rest on its laurels, since issues such as retention periods, data volumes and purpose limitation, as well as controls and whether protective clauses can really be implemented in the area of data protection, will remain critical points."
"In this sensitive area, what we need is not blind checks, but more trust."
"The terms on which data is exchanged must therefore also be set at a particularly high level, since it is not just a matter of specific agreements with Australia and the US; a number of other countries such as Korea and India also already want to have PNR agreements with us."
"For this reason, too, it is very important that we build in particularly high security standards at this point."
"The same applies to the forwarding of data to third countries."
"Here again, we must examine very carefully the terms that we want to incorporate."
"At the same time, when discussing PNR data, we also need to look beyond this."
"What is the point of keeping the volume of data as low as possible when negotiating on PNR if the US, as a countermove, announces that it wishes not only to levy an entry fee, but also to collect additional data from passengers?"
"We also have a problem within the European Union."
"What is the point of agreeing the highest possible standards and attempting to limit data volumes if, at the same time, bilateral agreements are being concluded without us having any knowledge of their content and security standards?"
"Mrs Malmström has said that this is not about PNR data, but rather that all data that is collected should apparently serve the purpose of fighting terrorism and combating crime."
"I would therefore like to end by making one more request: what we need is not just good provisions on the individual measures, but also at last to take an overall view of all the measures, all the data that is transferred by the EU and the Member States."
"We need to be quite clear about this: we will never achieve one hundred percent security, however many measures we take and however much data we collect."
"That is a fact that we have to face up to."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the Minister for their introductions."
"I very much welcome the very cooperative attitude of the Commission and the Council."
"We have had examples in the past where the cooperation was less intimate."
"I think that this example shows that, if the three main institutions can reach an agreement, we can speak with a single voice on behalf of 500 million citizens - and that is a very powerful voice."
"The resolution has been tabled jointly by six political groups, meaning that this Parliament is sending a very strong political signal."
"I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups for their very good cooperation."
"There is one point which the Commissioner and the Minister did not address in their presentations: the issue of proportionality and necessity."
"Both the Council and the Commission still claim that the massive - not ad hoc - collection and storage of PNR data is necessary and proportional in view of the fight against terrorism."
"I am willing to believe them, but this claim has to be substantiated: we need proof of necessity, proof of proportionality."
"Why?"
"The proportionality test is not a political test; it is a legal test."
"European data protection laws require the collection and storage of data to be proportional and necessary."
"This is not something that we can agree on politically; it is something that has to be proven in court."
"If somebody goes to court and the court rules that these agreements are not watertight, then we look like idiots."
"The European Parliament cannot be asked to endorse something which is open to legal challenge."
"That is a key issue."
"There are some other things which need clarification."
"I am pleased to hear that the Commission is looking into the profiling issue, but I think that we need some further discussion on that."
"Some of the Member States are proposing a sunset clause."
"I would, of course, wholeheartedly endorse that;"
"I hope that the Council decides to introduce that."
"Finally, the European Commission refers to good relations with third countries, but these agreements cannot be seen as instruments of international diplomacy."
"They are instruments of international cooperation in law enforcement and protecting civil liberties and the rule of law."
"We need to get it right now, because we are not only negotiating with the US, Canada and Australia, but also setting a model and example for agreements with other countries."
"Madam President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, we, as Parliament, will tomorrow adopt a joint resolution which once again emphasises our concerns regarding the exchange of passenger name record data."
"Why will we do so?"
"We will do so because we have been raising points of criticism for several years, but we have the feeling that insufficient attention has been paid to them in the current negotiations, and because it is important to us that this criticism is taken into account from the outset so that this agreement will at least have a chance of ultimately receiving approval here in Parliament."
"There are three principal points of criticism, and Mr Voss has also already mentioned some of them."
"First of all, it is important and necessary to understand that we want a common European approach and not different data exchange measures with different provisions on data protection."
"It is therefore important to make it clear that a uniform solution should be found to this with the contracting parties at European level."
"The second point - and this is even more important - is that all of this is above board and in accordance with the legal basis in the treaties."
"As Parliament, we have made it clear many times that we reject the use of passenger name record data for profiling purposes, and long storage times are incompatible with constitutional law."
"For us, that means that the proactive and reactive use of passenger name record data is actually out of the question as a matter of principle."
"This must be made clear in the mandate and also in the negotiations in order for it to be possible, ultimately, for Parliament to grant its approval."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, PNR is, as has been acknowledged, an important tool for national security."
"It is a key component in the battle to keep us safe, not just in the air, but on the ground."
"However, PNR must only be a tool to combat terrorism."
"It must not become a free licence for the retention of data by governments or their agencies."
"Therefore, we must deeply consider who we allow access to this data and why; not just to which country but which agencies."
"What benefits will there be to us from their access to it?"
"How will it be protected by them and, importantly, how can we be assured that it remains so?"
"We must also be certain that all arrangements with third countries are mutual so that we too can benefit."
"PNR is an important weapon in ensuring we protect ourselves against such terrorism, but it is not the only weapon: pragmatism and proportionality should be key to every decision we make in this House; the subject of passenger name records is no different."
"When discussing this Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement, we all remember what happened in the case of SWIFT; it has already cropped up several times in this debate."
"The case of SWIFT was a telling one."
"We may disagree about SWIFT itself, and we certainly voted differently in this Chamber, but we are all agreed on one thing: we have learned a great deal about what to do and what not to do."
"About what to do: we learned that Parliament must speak very firmly in defending the privacy interests of 500 million citizens."
"This time, moreover, the fact that we have six political groups participating in writing a resolution means that we intend to use the voice of Parliament in a clearer and more united way."
"Yet we also know a lot about what not to do."
"At this stage of the negotiations on PNR, we can still use what we have learnt."
"This is clearly that the Council should prepare its mandate, which we will read very carefully; the Commission should conduct the negotiations, as it is the negotiator; and Parliament should have the final say."
"However, at the same time, what we have learnt is much more than that."
"It is obvious that Parliament should be kept informed at all stages, but at this juncture, I appeal directly to the Commission: the Commission could also accept Parliament's ideas during the course of this process."
"I recall that with SWIFT, for instance, it was Parliament's idea to have a supervisor in Washington."
"In the course of this process, Parliament is bound to have many ideas that should be included in the negotiations without, of course, trampling on the prerogatives of the Commission, but the fact is that Parliament will have the final word, de facto and de jure, on this negotiation, and it will certainly use it."
"There is also one thing that I believe we should not forget in this process, which we have, at times, forgotten, namely, that these data are personal data."
"This means that we are dealing with loaned data belonging to members of the public, as we say in our resolution when talking about the concept of informational self-determination."
"This means that at all moments in this process and during the use of such data in the future, they will have to have direct access to what is being done with their data."
"At present, personal data on our citizens is being transferred to the United States on the basis of various agreements."
"Of these, it is particularly the bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding concluded between certain Member States and the US that are giving rise to serious concerns over breaches of the data protection rights of European citizens."
"It is therefore a good thing that the European Commission has turned to the European Council with a request to begin talks between the EU and the US on the creation of a new framework agreement on the transfer and processing of personal data for the purposes of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting crime, within the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"Commissioner, in the negotiations with our American friends, however, we must insist that the new framework agreement is balanced and correct with regard to the rights of EU citizens in the area of personal data protection."
"It would also be a good thing if the new framework agreement were to amend the current bilateral agreements, which are incorrect and which, in many cases, infringe the personal data protection rights of our citizens."
"(NL) Madam President, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is very much in favour of measures that could help in the fight against terrorism, and Islamic terrorism in particular."
"The PVV also attaches great importance to protecting the privacy of Dutch citizens and takes the view that, where these interests clash, they need to be carefully weighed up against each other."
"The United States can have some of our passenger data, but on three conditions."
"The first is that these data be used only in the fight against terrorism."
"The second is reciprocity."
"American airlines must also ensure that European authorities are sent these data, as happens the other way round."
"The data should be provided not to a European agency but rather to the authorities of the European Member State that is the aircraft's transit or final destination."
"The third condition is that the data transferred be non-discriminatory."
"The United States and, thus, also European countries, can request all data that has been provided voluntarily by passengers."
"I emphasise the word 'voluntarily'."
"Data on religion, ideology, address, telephone number, credit card number and data from a person's passport may be provided, but my party takes the view that data not provided voluntarily by passengers, such as data on sexuality, ethnic origin or disability, must not be provided."
"Madam President, I should also like to reiterate why these measures are necessary."
"Let us be clear that they are not necessary to combat Christian or Buddhist terrorism."
"Regrettably, these measures are necessary because of the threat to the free world posed by Islam."
"It is about time the Members of this House grasped this at long last."
"(ES) Madam President, freedom and security are essential elements for the implementation of any current democratic legal structure, in which freedom uses security as the most valued tool for protection."
"The transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries is an essential element of the transnational fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"It should be based on scrupulous compliance with EU rules on the protection of personal data, as laid down in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"For this reason, we must welcome the communication from the Commission on the global approach to transfers of PNR data to third countries and its recommendations that the Council authorises the opening of negotiations in this area with Australia, Canada and the United States, as both instruments take up Parliament's concerns regarding security, defending fundamental rights and protecting personal data."
"However, it should be pointed out that PNR data cannot be used for profiling, which is why the Commission sought to clarify - in my view, successfully - the differences between the expressions 'risk assessment' and the aforementioned profiling."
"Moreover, the Commissioner said that checking will be done by humans rather than being automated."
"Well, we will see what happens."
"Madam President, we need a single, general, legally binding agreement to protect personal data."
"This top-level agreement must be implemented through sectoral agreements in order to combat terror and organised crime."
"As regards the need, Madam President, it is obvious."
"As regards proportionality, it must, in all cases, be an inalienable requirement."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to join with those in Parliament who have supported the usefulness and timeliness of this recommendation by the Commission to the Council to negotiate to establish a framework agreement for data transfer and the protection of personal data between the United States and the European Union."
"I would also like to express my support for an accommodating approach, so that this framework agreement covers not only all future agreements on transfers of data between the European Union and the United States, but also bilateral agreements between the United States and each of the Member States in the context of judicial and police cooperation."
"Secondly, I would like to join those in Parliament who have expressed regret and rejection regarding the measures adopted by the United States authorities to introduce administrative fees under the Travel Promotion Act which therefore increase the costs of travel and, consequently, the movement of people, through the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation."
"In practice, this amounts to a tax and to reintroducing visas, on top of the exclusion of the visa waiver for Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and Cyprus, and therefore means a two-tier system and double standards in the treatment of the Member States."
"We therefore call on the Commission to make it a priority to express its rejection of these measures and to also consider the option of reciprocating."
"Thirdly, however, I would like to say that the importance of the Passenger Name Record and the legal agreement between the European Union and the United States lies precisely in the fact that they have to combine data protection with data exchange, and therefore guarantee the principles that are in Parliament's resolutions and which will be in the resolution that we adopt tomorrow: the need to strengthen the proportionality principle and the necessity principle, the minimisation of unnecessary data and, of course, purpose limitation."
"These principles ensure that there is a balance between freedom and security, because freedom is one of Parliament's commitments."
"Security is, however, now one of the European Union's objectives, as the Commissioner herself acknowledged."
"We therefore call on you to incorporate this commitment to strengthen the guarantee of privacy and fundamental human rights into future air security actions, into data protection for the Passenger Names Record, into the review of security checks, and into the current debate on the introduction of security scanners in airports."
"(NL) Madam President, we are well aware that we are always running behind society somewhat."
"Developments happen, and policy and legislation follow later."
"The fact that the format now includes civil rights requirements to be observed by a Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement is very sensible, but it does show that we keep running behind developments."
"The previous debate, regarding the framework agreement on data protection, was another illustration of this."
"My fear is not that this list, which looks good, now exists and is being used; my fear concerns the preservation of the various bilateral agreements between Member States and other countries."
"I have a question for Mrs Turtelboom of the Council, therefore, and that is whether she can guarantee that these are definitively at an end?"
"I wish to advise the negotiators to take the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms along in book form, place these fundamental rights beside them on the table when they are about to start negotiating, and make regular reference to them."
"(FR) Madam President, once again, we are being asked for an agreement concerning the protection of European citizens' data when it is transferred to the United States and which is also applicable in Canada and Australia."
"In this House, we are all very committed to the safety of our fellow citizens."
"The debate is not about that."
"Yes, our fellow citizens have a right to security, but they have a right to it in all areas, including legal certainty."
"We know that in the name of combating terrorism in particular, many safeguards to which all citizens are entitled have been jeopardised and that quantity has all too often taken precedence over quality."
"I would like to congratulate our rapporteur on the work she has done, which is along the right lines, particularly when she emphasises the issues of necessity and proportionality."
"I would willingly add to that the issue of reciprocity."
"When it comes to defending human rights, however, the United States is far from being a model, and we know that European citizens do not enjoy the same protection there as in Europe and that a number of them are regularly subjected to what I would call administrative harassment - and what is worse - on the grounds that they are suspected of being terrorists."
"What does this mean?"
"Worse still, what will happen to these guarantees when the data is transferred to third countries, especially with a view to prevention?"
"We know that 80% of this data has already reached the United States."
"The statements I have just heard are, regrettably, far from reassuring."
"(SK) The European strategy on the provision of personal data on travellers is an important step towards the harmonisation of legislation in this area."
"The existence of a number of parallel legislative initiatives shows the need for consistency."
"It must be said, however, that this strategy has a number of shortcomings, particularly in the area of personal data protection, as has been mentioned here several times."
"The Commission document recently published in September also criticised the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"I agree with the part of the criticism which relates to levels of necessity and authorisation concerning requests for a particular type of data."
"In my opinion, we need to place strict limits on the possibility of data being used to create profiles and estimate risk."
"Such data handling requires greater justification than is contained in the actual text and, at the time, we must better specify how to prevent data being misused."
"I would now like to mention a couple of examples from other agreements, including an agreement between the EU and the US concerning the provision of passenger data to the American Department of Homeland Security."
"The agreement includes a controversial comparison between this data and data from databases on immigrants."
"I do not know, but in my opinion, this condition does not correspond to the aim of the agreement, which is to combat terrorism and serious crime."
"It will therefore be essential for us to avoid such controversial errors when formulating these agreements in the future, and I hope that the Commission will manage that, as we definitely cannot consider the current document to be satisfactory, particularly in the area of personal data protection."
"(IT) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, listening to the significant contributions that have so far been offered by my fellow Members, there is no doubt that the need to reach a reasonably quick understanding on defining this framework agreement on the Passenger Name Record constitutes a strong stimulus from Parliament."
"Starting from the premise that there is currently no homogenous legislative framework in force - and this certainly contrasts strongly with the real and perceived need to fight terrorism with aggressive, robust measures, balancing privacy and security - one must consider that actions to guarantee security can be effectively realised through international cooperation."
"At the same time, as was seen some time ago in Parliament when we approved the SWIFT project, we definitely need to bear in mind the Council's negotiating mandate, but also the significant contributions that Parliament will also be able to offer in a context where the fight against illegal immigration can be assured through the framework agreement."
"(RO) At a time of great mobility, we cannot enjoy security without an efficient exchange of data."
"It is our duty to protect our citizens against terrorist attacks and organised crime."
"However, a balance needs to be found between security and privacy."
"I welcome the fact that the European Parliament's resolution emphasises that PNR data cannot be used for profiling."
"I believe that the partnership between the US, Canada and Australia, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other, can offer the ideal solution for combating terrorism and organised crime."
"I think that both sides need, first of all, to find common ground on understanding what is involved in achieving this objective."
"We must bear in mind that Europeans, by their very mentality, attach particular importance to respect for their privacy."
"The EU cannot give its consent to this until every detail pertaining to the security of the data being transferred between the parties involved is clarified."
"(RO) The strategy being proposed marks a step forward in terms of how to approach future agreements in this area."
"It is important that a balance is struck between protecting privacy and fundamental rights and the need to combat terrorism."
"If the strategy is applied in the way it is presented, it will provide firm, enforceable guarantees concerning respect for the rights which European citizens enjoy within the European Union."
"As Commissioner Malmström has assured us, profiling will not be possible through automatic processing of the data supplied."
"We hope that this is the case, because this was one of our concerns, as was also the data storage period."
"Although we are not talking about personal data, I basically believe that it is ultimately a matter of citizens' right to privacy."
"This is why a process for making administrative and legal appeals also needs to be provided for citizens affected by the misuse of this data input."
"Transfers of PNR data to third countries must be carried out on a case-by-case basis and only with the European Union's explicit consent."
"(DE) Madam President, the way that the Commission has put its global approach to transfers of passenger name record data to third countries up for discussion is to be welcomed, particularly before negotiations with third countries get under way."
"That shows that it has learnt from past methods."
"As has already been said many times with regard to ACTA and SWIFT, here, too, I have huge concerns with regard to data protection standards."
"However, in this case, it is essentially about the handling of data with which the authorities, for example, intend to identify possible accomplices of suspects."
"At first sight, this is something entirely beneficial, but on further consideration, it is a very serious assumption to place European citizens under general suspicion on the basis of meagre circumstantial evidence."
"Would we actually supply the names and data for this purpose?"
"Madam President, I am not, of course, in favour of the European Union assuming the right to conclude treaties at all."
"However, I will endeavour to look objectively at the principles governing treaties about PNR."
"The approach taken to weigh the two sometimes contradictory needs of privacy and security is essentially sound."
"People have a right to keep details of their lives confidential, but authorities have not only a right, but a duty, to safeguard the lives of their peoples."
"If only terrorists and serious criminals wore black hats and displayed sinister sneers, those two needs could be satisfied simultaneously."
"However, the Union does allow its own ideological inhibitions to get in the way of achieving the right balance."
"I can understand its reluctance to reveal unnecessarily information about people's origins or opinions."
"Where this has no connection or even correlation with terrorism, that inhibition is a healthy one."
"However, in an era in which a particular section of the population is disproportionately involved in terrorism - and that section might change - I see no objection against profiling of that population."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the terrorist threat is still there and we need to address it."
"We have lots of tools to do so, but changing and sharing of information is key to doing this."
"We have PNR agreements."
"I already have seen strong evidence that PNR is essential to identify and to prevent terrorist attacks."
"We will make sure that this evidence is provided to the European Parliament with concrete examples, both from the three countries we are discussing and from the subsequent EU PNR. This is essential to enable you to assess this properly and to discuss it with your voters."
"We should exchange PNR, but that should not be done without rules."
"We need to have the relevant information, to be able to join the dots and to have clear rules."
"We need to define the scope, the retention times, to have a high level of data protection and the possibility of redress for the individual."
"We need to have clear rules on third-country transfer and we need to be proportionate."
"All this is in the communication from the Commission and I am very happy to see that, although the details might vary, your communication is very much in line with this."
"These are the issues that will be subject to negotiations with our three partners; they will be difficult, yet ambitious on our part."
"My goal is to do this together with the Council and with the EU's other three institutions, so that the institutions can speak with one voice and be a clear partner in this."
"From the beginning, I have tried to involve Parliament and to engage in an open and transparent way with it, with its relevant committees, the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, the coordinators and so on, and will continue to do so."
"I undertake that, at all stages of the negotiations, once they have begun, I will keep you fully and immediately informed, to have an open discussion and to listen to your views."
"Although the Commission will lead the negotiations, I am willing to discuss with you and to inform you and have good cooperation with you on this."
"Mr President, at all events, I should like to start by saying that, as Minister for Home Affairs, I know that we have managed to prevent potential attacks all too often through the exchange and interpretation of information."
"This is precisely what makes this debate and the conclusion of a sound Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement so important, of course."
"I know that the Commission faces a very difficult task as soon as the mandates have been adopted by the Council; it will have to open the actual negotiations and strike a balance between what everyone here wants - that on which there is a broad consensus - namely, the protection of personal data, on the one hand, and, on the other, the clear tenor here in this assembly that says: we need these PNR data, we have a frequent need for information, precisely in order to protect us against terrorist attacks, for example."
"However, I am pleased that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are on the same wavelength and have the same balance at the back of their minds: a balance between data protection and security for which we all bear responsibility."
"I think we have now reached the point at which we can adopt the mandates."
"Afterwards, there comes the difficult job of the actual negotiations; we must ensure that we do not deviate too far from our mandate and that we continue to define that balance ourselves at all times."
"I should like to address a number of specific questions, such as the comment on the sunset clause."
"It is indeed important to point out that this mandate is valid for seven years, that it will be assessed after four years and that, if the agreement should be concluded and also adopted here, an extension will only be possible following a debate here in Parliament; which I think is logical."
"This is not a real sunset clause, but it does very strongly resemble one in terms of the deadline and of the assessment after four years."
"In addition, the Council's conclusions rightly state that we set very great store by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union - indeed, comments have been made on the subject - and we must continue to guarantee these."
"Of course, it is important to all of us - and this is also in the mandate - that an independent body be established to which individuals can make a complaint if they notice that their data have been used wrongfully or for other purposes."
"Finally - and this will be a very difficult point - the question of profiling, and of course we all want risk assessments."
"After all, risk assessments can be carried out on the basis of the data gathered to enable the right decisions to be made."
"On the other hand, of course, it is imperative to prevent the stigmatisation of certain ethnic groups, even though one group may have been advocating it here."
"I believe we want absolute freedom from ethnic stigmatisation."
"I believe that this, too, is one of the fundamental rights we all enjoy as European citizens, and particularly in my role as President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to make sure that we do not end up in such a situation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 11 November 2010, at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Parliament aims to strengthen the procedures for the transfer of passenger name record (PNR) data to third countries."
"Special attention should be paid to the protection of passengers' personal data."
"Law enforcement agencies can use the data provided by passengers to investigate crimes committed and assess risk."
"In the resolution, Parliament therefore emphasises that people's right to access information and their right to privacy must be safeguarded."
"Furthermore, Parliament wants the transfer of data to comply with European data protection standards. It is very important to introduce enforceable standards on the protection of personal data, which would guarantee the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms."
"Independent government institutions on both sides of the Atlantic must be responsible for the application of these standards."
"Parliament agrees with the Commission's recommendation to open negotiations for an agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on protection of personal data when transferred and processed for the purpose of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting criminal offences, including terrorism."
"To ensure effective cooperation between the institutions, the Commission should update the European Parliament at every stage of the negotiations on personal data protection."
"in writing. - (HU) Is the EU truly able to receive the intelligence data arriving from the United States?"
"The motion for a resolution on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) is welcome, since it seeks to promote an agreement between the United States and the European Union based on a balance between security and data protection."
"There is one point on which I feel it is inadequate."
"In agreement with Mrs Reding in her emphasis on a culture of reciprocity, I would like to raise the question: if we really consider it important that data exchange be reciprocal - that is, that we should not only give but also receive from the United States information relevant to the prevention of terrorism - then it is not enough simply to submit a wish list to the USA but, in practice, we need to create or name the EU body that is capable of receiving and processing the intelligence data received from the USA while, at the same time, ensuring uniform access to the information by the Member States."
"This problem has already come to the fore in relation to the SWIFT agreement enshrining the transfer of data on bank transactions, but it has not been resolved since that time."
"It would have been fortunate if the motion had emphatically drawn attention to this imminent task as well."
"In recent years, more and more fundamental rights have been curtailed in the name of combating terror."
"The rationality of this is often dubious."
"While passengers are searched almost down to their underwear and are not allowed to carry nail files or deodorant in their luggage, checks on freight are often left to the shippers themselves."
"If this changes in future, the balance between freedom and security must be preserved because, in the case of passenger checks, this has already been lost, and thus, as the hysteria surrounding terrorism subsides, the requirements are relaxed once again."
"Just as questionable is the issue of whether, in the case of travel to the US, the FBI needs to know someone's name, address, email address, credit card number and baggage number and be permitted to store this data for up to 15 years."
"In future, if someone arouses slight suspicion in the United Kingdom, for example - not on account of religious affiliation, where there is a proven terrorism connection - but is suspicious because they fly at short notice, possibly without luggage, and pay in cash, then, for the transfer of passenger name record data, and not only to the US, at the very least there should be a general right to complain and to take legal action and the data should not simply be stored in perpetuity."
"Of course, the data must only be stored for a specific purpose."
"If fundamental rights are infringed in order to provide a sense of security, the infringement must be as small as possible and the rights of those affected must be reinforced."
"The Commission has presented a range of proposals on the exchange of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data with third countries and on the opening of negotiations on the agreements with Australia, Canada and the US."
"The establishment of general principles on PNR is one of the tools for preventing transnational crime and terrorism."
"However, it raises concerns about the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights."
"The PNR database is provided by passengers during the reservation and check-in process, allowing the authorities in charge to investigate crimes committed in the past, prevent new crimes and carry out risk analyses."
"This security instrument is now used with third countries, leading to the need to establish the legal security of the data."
"These proposals focus especially on the modes of PNR data transfer, on standards for monitoring the correct implementation of the PNR agreement, and on its reciprocity."
"Parliament supports the Commission's recommendations and the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor, while stressing that passengers' privacy must not be violated and that these data should be used solely for their intended purposes."
"The joint motion for a resolution proves once again that the European Parliament, like all the EU institutions, represents a serious danger to grassroots freedoms and democratic rights."
"The resolution uses the pretext of terrorism and the 'need for anti-terrorist cooperation' between the EU and the United States to justify keeping general records on all passengers travelling from the EU to the United States, Canada and Australia."
"Empty talk about so-called personal data protection guarantees is the European Parliament's excuse for approving the execution of an agreement between the EU and the United States on passenger records, which it has hypocritically presented as unacceptable to date."
"In this joint motion for a resolution, the political spokesmen of capital, cheek by jowl with the opportunists, are insultingly deceiving the public with talk of an agreement that will, apparently, contain personal data protection guarantees."
"No agreement and no guarantee can safeguard the protection of personal data, when they are being handed over to and are at the mercy of the secret services and the repressive mechanisms of the United States and other countries."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against this unacceptable resolution and calls on the public to step up their fight against the EU and its anti-grassroots and repressive policy, which is striking at social, democratic and fundamental human rights."
"One of the greatest threats the world has faced in recent years is the asymmetric war against terrorism, along with the threats arising from the growth in international organised crime."
"It will be impossible to create an effective protective umbrella against this hazard unless Europe and the US cooperate to this end."
"Exchanging information is a key aspect of this cooperation, and this is why PNR is an absolutely essential element of joint security."
"It is important to bear in mind, however, that its effectiveness depends solely on the exchange of data with the US being entirely reciprocal."
"I hope, too, that adoption of the agreement will speed up ratification of the agreements between the US and the European Union on the visa waiver programme, which will make it possible for US visas to be abolished, inter alia for Polish citizens."
"Alternative investment fund managers (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Jean-Paul Gauzès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Alternative investment fund managers and amending Directives 2004/39/EC and 2009/.../EC - C7-0040/2009 -."
"Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, the text we are debating this evening, and which will be put to the vote in Parliament tomorrow, is the result of a long period of work."
"On 30 April 2009, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive on alternative investment fund managers."
"It aims to establish a safe, harmonised framework at European Union level to monitor and supervise the risks presented by managers for their investors, their counterparties, other actors in the financial markets and financial stability, while making it possible for managers, subject to observing strict requirements, to provide services and market their funds throughout the internal market."
"Mr President, may I just pause a moment, I wanted to know whether, given the length of our work, I had no time limit, because I see that the clock has not started."
"It does not bother me but, for honesty's sake, I wanted to draw it to your attention."
"Parliament received the text about 14 months ago."
"It has aroused obvious interest among Members of the European Parliament, as a record number of 1 690 amendments have been tabled."
"Professionals have been involved very extensively and the rapporteur has had nearly 200 discussions on this text, not counting the discussions with national authorities."
"Finalising the compromise text that is being debated today has been particularly hard work."
"Half a dozen informal trialogues took place under the Spanish Presidency during the first half of 2010 in order to facilitate the exchange of information on the progress of the work."
"No agreement was reached in the Council during this period."
"On 17 May 2010, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by a large majority, voted in favour of the report, which was the result of collective deliberation by Members of the European Parliament."
"Parliament introduced proportionality, differing rules for different categories of funds, regulation to protect the private equity of target companies and jobs and a passport system for funds and alternative investment fund managers based outside of the European Union."
"There then followed a dozen trialogues."
"A working party was also set up between the three institutions specifically to deal with the technical aspects of the proposal in a number of meetings with the Belgian Presidency and the Commission."
"On 26 October 2010, the trialogue, which was to become conclusive, was held, with the active participation of the President of ECOFIN, Mr Reynders, and of Commissioner Barnier, and an agreement was reached on a compromise text which the rapporteur felt could be put to the vote in Parliament."
"I shall not go into the detail of this lengthy technical document but will highlight the essential points."
"The directive will make it obligatory for alternative investment fund managers located in the European Union to be authorised or registered, and to comply with operational and organisational requirements, codes of conduct and transparency rules, and will make them subject to the power of the competent authorities of the Member States and of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to supervise and to impose sanctions."
"It will give them access to the Union's internal market by means of an intra-European passport to manage and market their products."
"Eventually, managers based outside of the European Union will be able to qualify for a passport provided they meet the same requirements as managers whose head office is in the European Union."
"The number of meetings and the intensity of exchanges and negotiations between the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, the Presidency at the time and the Commission have very significantly enriched the initial proposal in a number of areas."
"In this respect, I need to make it clear that the progress sought by Parliament was achieved gradually in the course of negotiations and not, of course, only in the last trialogue during which some adjustments were made, but at the political level, it was decisive."
"I would now like to emphasise the areas in which Parliament's intervention has been decisive."
"First of all, on two highly political issues, with regard to relations with third countries, the existence and implementation of a passport - well, now I really do not understand because normally I have four minutes - for managers residing outside of the European Union have been approved."
"Specific conditions for the granting of a passport have been laid down."
"With regard to private equity, Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that the directive includes provisions to avoid potential asset stripping of the target company and also specific rules concerning reporting obligations in relation to target companies, their employees or their representatives."
"Given the erratic behaviour of the clock, I shall not go back over some of the provisions that were achieved in accordance with Parliament's wishes."
"I shall simply say that Parliament would have liked to have gone further, but it was able to influence negotiations so as to give more recognition to the ESMA's role."
"The solutions that were upheld nonetheless constitute significant progress towards improving monitoring at European level."
"Parliament has been careful to strengthen the powers of the Council and of Parliament in the process of adopting acts delegated by the Commission."
"A majority in Parliament would have liked very strict control over passive marketing, or even its prohibition."
"The inclusion in a recital of the principle whereby professional investors have to carry out due diligence when they invest in funds located outside of the European Union constitutes a significant first step."
"That, Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, is what I wanted to say in opening the debate."
"In closing, I shall take this opportunity of two minutes to thank all those who have contributed to this success."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Gauzès, you can have as long as you like if you protect the interests of the City of London."
"Mr President, Mr Gauzès, ladies and gentlemen, it is again a pleasure for me to come before you once more as you debate an additional part of the reform package that we want to introduce in the financial sector."
"The report that has been submitted to you forms part of the supervision package which, as you know, had already been adopted unanimously in the Council."
"Once again, with regard to investment funds, we have gone forward with the same unanimity in the Council, and you adopted the supervision package by a very large majority."
"I hope that we will be able to see just as large a majority come out for the section on investment funds."
"For the first time, this directive introduces European regulation affecting managers of alternative investment funds, above all, hedge funds and private equity companies, which we have discussed many times."
"These companies, which benefit the European economy, have, until now, not been subject to any supervision or specific regulations at European level."
"The present proposal fully meets the wish of Commissioner Barnier - which is also my wish - to extend effective, appropriate regulation and supervision to all actors and financial activities which present significant risks."
"With this directive, Europe is taking one more step towards the full implementation of the decisions taken at the G20."
"On the eve of the G20 summit, this is a strong signal from Europe to the rest of the world."
"As I said, this text is fully integrated into the new European supervision framework, strengthening the role that ESMA will play in regulating alternative fund managers."
"Thanks to what I hope will be your vote in favour, the managers of these funds will be subject to consistent and largely new rules with a view to increasing transparency as regards supervisors, investors, companies and workers of the companies acquired by some of these funds."
"Private equity companies will have to give notification of their presence in the companies acquired and provide information to employees, in particular, concerning their future strategy for the business and the potential repercussions for jobs."
"The directive also aims to increase protection for investors."
"For example, the function of depositary will be strengthened considerably, and so will risk management."
"Leverage, the remuneration method and delegation will now be monitored."
"The directive also aims to enhance the internal market in this sector, in particular, by introducing an intra-European passport which will facilitate cross-border transactions, benefiting the economy as a whole."
"A passport for third countries will also be introduced in order to maintain a level playing field internationally, respecting the principle of 'same rights, same obligations'."
"I am pleased at the truly European character of this directive, which guarantees a high level of protection and transparency while continuing to encourage investment in Europe."
"The passport system, which is based on strict controls and gives European supervision authorities a central role, constitutes a reliable and effective regulatory basis for a sector whose anticipated role in the recovery of growth cannot be underestimated."
"Like the other elements of the reform programme for the financial sector, the directive also aims, on a more global level, to prevent, or at least limit, the scale of further financial crises."
"I want to make it clear that the agreement between Parliament and the Council, which I hope is as broad as possible, owes much to the determination of the European Parliament, and particularly that of its rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, and to the in-depth work that they have accomplished."
"Mr Gauzès, I want to thank you for your resolve, your commitment and your determination, without which the European Parliament's adoption of the directive probably would not have been possible."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank Ms Sharon Bowles, Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"We had many discussions in trialogue meetings and other fora about this directive, and also about other texts."
"It was useful as it proved that it is possible to have a codecision process on one condition, namely, that it is possible to start negotiations at the same time, with the Council on one side and Parliament on the other."
"Thank you very much for your ability to organise that in Parliament."
"It is not easy in the Council, and I am sure it is not always easy either with all the Members of Parliament."
"(FR) Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank the Swedish and Spanish Presidencies, as well as Commissioner Barnier, who has just joined us, and all of the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Goebbels, Mr Klinz, Mr Canfin, Mr Kamall and finally Mr Lehne, for the fruitful and clearly constructive exchanges that we have had on the amended report, which will be put to your vote."
"From now on, Mr President, there will be a reliable and harmonised framework at European Union level for controlling and supervising the risks that alternative investment fund managers pose to their investors and to financial stability."
"I am convinced that the will to achieve results which has inspired us will continue to stimulate negotiations on future texts."
"Every time I come to your House, Mr President, I thank you for the work that we have just accomplished, but I would like to thank you now already for the work that we are going to accomplish in the coming weeks."
"Mr Gauzès, I hope that we will be able to work together at this same pace towards an agreement on the subject of credit rating agencies."
"On behalf of my successors to the Presidency of the Council, and in view of recent negotiations, I am furthermore confident that we will make progress on this subject, but perhaps also on others in the future."
"The date has already been set."
"In any case, thank you for the work that has been done on this report."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the first thing I will do is ask you to excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, for joining you a few minutes late."
"The Belgian Presidency is so dynamic that, at the same time that this important debate is taking place here, the debate on this directive on alternative investment fund managers, we are having a debate in the Competitiveness Council on another important subject, the European patent, and so I have only just left the Council to come back here - I do not yet know in what condition, but I will do what I can."
"I cannot split myself in two."
"Mr Gauzès, whose convictions I know but whom I was not able to listen to, will certainly excuse me."
"I would like to thank and congratulate him, as well as all the coordinators and shadow rapporteurs, and of course, as Mr Reynders has just said, the Belgian Presidency and the whole team, for the very important and very tenacious work that has been accomplished over these last few weeks, and before it, by the other Presidencies."
"We have now been debating this subject for almost 15 or 18 months, and, with Parliament's vote, we are very close to putting this reasonable agreement into effect."
"Parliament is meeting today to debate it and will meet tomorrow to make a decision on it."
"This vote in plenary, ladies and gentlemen, will take place on the eve of the G20 summit in Seoul, and this represents a great opportunity to demonstrate our ability to act together, to implement common objectives and also to implement the decisions taken just after the crisis - and that crisis is not yet over with regard to its financial, economic, human and social consequences - decisions which were taken at the highest international level, at the G20."
"Following the agreement on the supervision package, which we also owe to the commitment of Parliament and the tenacity of the Belgian Presidency, the agreement on this directive on alternative investment fund managers needs to demonstrate this ability to learn the lessons of the crisis, to establish intelligent regulations and effective supervision where they need to be established, such that all financial actors are subject to these regulations and this supervision, which are both robust and effective."
"The Member States have agreed unanimously to this last proposal, as Mr Reynders has said."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to say what I think: this agreement would not have been possible without the contribution of Parliament, which has significantly improved the proposals that we are debating."
"Thanks to the determination of Mr Gauzès and the shadow rapporteurs, today, the report contains many new elements relating to the report adopted initially in May by the ECOFIN Council, and these contributions from Parliament improve the quality of this proposal for a directive in a very real sense."
"I would like to mention, one by one, some elements that we believe to be positive and of a high quality."
"The first element is the strengthening of the rules on private equity, which will increase the transparency of these activities in relation to employees of the companies targeted, and will introduce robust safeguards against asset stripping, as many of you wished, although I know that some of you think that this does not go far enough."
"The second element is a truly European solution for third countries."
"This solution, based on the 'same rights, same obligations' approach, has always been supported by the Commission, and it will eventually guarantee that all managers active in Europe will be made to respect European rules."
"The third element is the key role for ESMA envisaged in this provision, which will make the supervision of managers more consistent and will enhance the functioning of European and third-country passports."
"The fourth element is strong supplementary rules which will protect investors and the markets."
"In this regard, I would like to mention the limits on leverage, additional capital, professional insurance for managers and the rules on the role and responsibility of depositaries."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares your concern about the lack of rules concerning passive marketing."
"This lacuna could end up being a way of bypassing our rules, and that is why we have the same concern."
"However, the Member States are almost unanimously opposed to any rules in this area, and we are ready, in a spirit of compromise, to accept the current report, on condition that this matter is reviewed, and eventually within the context of the directive, and we will ensure that this happens."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would once again like to thank Parliament for its crucial cooperation and its contribution to this report, and I hope, like Mr Reynders, that we will be able to reach an agreement which is as broad as possible on this compromise, which, in our view, remains a dynamic compromise, and which enables us to maintain one of the commitments made at the G20: to learn the lessons of the financial crisis."
"Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner Barnier, we have already carried out a great deal of work - as Mr Gauzès said: 21 trialogues and numerous meetings between the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Above all, however, we have been working to convince others for years."
"Like a Tibetan prayer wheel, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has been trying very hard for years to make hedge funds, private equity funds and all of the other financial vehicles subject to European regulation."
"On 26 October, Austria's National Day, of all days, we were finally able to find a compromise with the Member States."
"We do not live in an ideal world and therefore, the compromise is not perfect either."
"However, this piece of European legislation is the most important element so far in terms of financial market regulation."
"There is now an alternative to the old neoliberal pre-crisis killer argument that 'there is no alternative' when it comes to bringing the financial market back into line and restructuring it."
"As far as I am concerned, the following two points are particularly important."
"Firstly, there are rules to prevent asset stripping to the effect that the reserves of companies that have been taken over may not be touched for two years."
"There are also rules regarding the liability of depositaries which prevent the creation of long, obscure chains of liability."
"These provisions represent minimum standards, which means that anyone who wants to can, and should, improve upon them."
"However, the regulation of alternative investment fund managers also provides a new opportunity to establish a new hedge fund culture."
"Small volume funds, in particular, have, hitherto, conducted extremely risky transactions, but must now change the way they do business."
"They now have the chance to establish themselves using a sustainable business model."
"In order to ensure that this directive works - it should be noted that I am under no illusions when I say this - the Commission must keep a strict, watchful eye on the implementation and functioning of the directive and, if necessary, present the revision earlier than scheduled."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Gauzès."
"We worked together in a thoroughly constructive manner."
"I would also like to thank Mr Bullmann and Mr Goebbels."
"In particular, I would like to mention the strong spirit, indeed the will, that prevailed, including on the part of the Commission and the Council in the end, to arrive at a really constructive solution."
"Mr President, with the directive on alternative investment fund managers, we are now laying yet another important foundation stone on the way to establishing a new, stable financial market architecture in Europe."
"Our call for comprehensive and more effective crisis prevention will only reveal its full effect when we extend it to the whole of the financial sector and hence, also to the alternative investment funds that were previously regulated at national level only."
"This is a very heterogeneous sector having various different types of funds, risk profiles and also investment strategies."
"The Commission's proposal for a directive was not easy to work with, but we have now found a common compromise that does not lump all funds and all fund managers together and that, at least in its approach, takes a differentiated view according to the systemic risk."
"We are today setting uniform standards throughout Europe for the approval of fund managers."
"In so doing, we will also give professional investors and custodians a share of the responsibility."
"With the additional regulations relating to private equity, we are preventing the asset stripping of portfolio companies."
"Admittedly, there is no justification in shaming the private equity industry per se, as it plays an important and also a constructive role - for example, in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"However, we will now prevent negative cases as a result of the fact that the substance of a company must be retained in the critical first years following the acquisition in particular."
"Parliament's greatest success is surely the introduction of the common European passport, not only for European fund managers, but also for fund managers outside the EU."
"The latter only receive access to the European market if a cooperation agreement is in place to ensure information exchange between the supervisory authorities."
"In future, the European Securities Markets Authority will also be able to intervene in serious cases, and that means that the new legislation will be something of a first for us."
"We cannot draw on past experience, particularly with regard to arrangements relating to third countries, but I think that we have made a good start towards providing an effective supervisory framework."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the outbreak of the crisis, the European summit and then the G20 launched an appeal to regulate all segments of the financial market in hedge funds."
"The Commission quickly made proposals, but lobbying of a rare intensity made some political decision makers reluctant to proceed with regulation."
"The United Kingdom stood up to protect hedge funds located in nearby or remote islands."
"France, the self-proclaimed champion of international regulation, has fallen back into its usual protectionism."
"In Parliament, it was, primarily, the liberals who tried to oppose this legislation."
"Mr Verhofstadt's group, which is normally so pro-European, suggested rejecting the Commission's proposal completely."
"Thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, and thanks to the coalition in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs consisting of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which was even supported by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, a substantial majority position was put together."
"Twenty-one trialogues later, and thanks to the personal commitment of Mr Reynders and Commissioner Barnier, Parliament's negotiators arrived at a proposal for a directive, which is a notable step forward, especially in the medium term."
"This is because we will have to wait until 2018 to have an internal market which imposes the same duties and obligations and also confers the same rights on all funds."
"The European regulation will be implemented from 2013."
"There will be an increase in the powers of the European regulator ESMA, to which the directive will grant no fewer than 72 intervention and supervision powers."
"It must be stressed that this directive is the first European legislative act to regulate hedge funds and private equity."
"It will ensure considerable protection for investors - not just professional investors, but also citizens investing their savings in financial products."
"There will be very specific rules on risk management and cash management."
"There will be more transparency and more information for investors on the strategies followed by managers."
"Leverage will be monitored, with managers having to announce in advance their own limits for employing debt leverage."
"The regulators will be able to intervene if too risky a strategy is employed."
"The gold plated remuneration and bonuses of managers will be limited and will not be able to be cashed in full immediately."
"The directive will impose more transparency on private equity funds."
"These funds will be welcome to finance the real economy."
"However, the directive will seriously limit the scope for vulture-like funds to divide up companies."
"There will be a period of two years in which the capital and some of the reserves of the company acquired will not be able to be distributed to new proprietors."
"In addition to this 'lock-in', the company's staff will be consulted, and the country in which the fund is registered will be informed about the business strategy of the buyers."
"In summary, the directive can be improved, Mr President, but the socialists and the democrats will give it their support, because it will bring a lot of light into the dark hole of international finance that alternative funds have represented up to now."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, after lengthy rounds of negotiations, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have finally agreed on a joint text for regulating alternative investment fund managers."
"I welcome this, and I have to correct Mr Goebbels: We wished to send the original proposal back because we believed that the alternative investment funds were so different - hedge funds, private equity funds and property funds - that they each need to be regulated separately."
"Nevertheless, we now have a text that we can fully accept and support."
"The all-embracing approach that we found disturbing at first has been amended in respect of key elements."
"As a result, we no longer have a problem with it."
"The goal of the directive was to create greater transparency for the supervisory bodies but, above all, for the investors, in order to be able to identify systemic risks in due time and at an early stage and so to be able to deal with them accordingly."
"Personally, I am in favour of rules that all fund managers operating in the EU have to abide by."
"At the same time, however, I do not like the idea of us turning Europe into a fortress or even a prison or of European institutions seeking to invest not being able to do so outside Europe."
"We were therefore initially unable to support the proposal as presented in committee."
"The compromise that has now been found solves this problem."
"It promises to keep the markets open."
"Another reason for our initial rejection was the regulations relating to the area of private equity, which would, in fact, have led to distortions of competition in this area."
"The requirements for private equity, as they were initially formulated, would have placed even listed companies under a definite disadvantage."
"The compromise that we now have before us eliminates this shortcoming and it prevents asset stripping, which is something that we expressly welcome."
"Overall, therefore, we are very pleased with the proposal."
"It creates clear framework conditions and rules for alternative investment fund managers."
"It will ensure greater transparency for identifying systemic risks."
"It will therefore ensure greater stability."
"It will strengthen the internal market because it introduces the EU passport, which, following a transitional period, will also be introduced for managers outside Europe."
"It will ensure clear, undistorted competition."
"Finally, it will establish a clear, new task for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)."
"To conclude, I would like to thank not only my fellow Members but, above all, the Belgian Presidency, which has brought this matter to a successful conclusion with its untiring efforts."
"Mr President, this regulation of alternative investment fund managers provides, firstly, a little more in the way of transparency and rules in this impenetrable jungle of hedge funds and alternative investment funds."
"Unfortunately, these rules remain incomplete."
"It is still possible to place unregulated products on the internal market by using passive distribution."
"Essentially, market access for these products is not restricted effectively."
"Europe has thus missed an opportunity to extend its rules worldwide and to achieve uniform regulation."
"Secondly, contrary to Parliament's wishes, there was, unfortunately, no effective balanced budget rule at European level for the funds."
"It is still left up to national rules to limit how far the funds can go into debt, and that also means that we are not learning the lessons from the crisis."
"As a result, there will be a national downhill race in respect of this regulation."
"What is crucial for us once again is the fact that the asset stripping of companies by private equity funds is not prevented effectively."
"Of course, there are private equity investments that make sense for companies."
"However, the rules that are now being laid down are, unfortunately, a long way from being adequate."
"The rights of workers to information, which they quite rightly expect, are not effective, either, and neither is the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises against this type of asset stripping."
"In this case, therefore, this is very difficult to justify to the electorate."
"Unfortunately, the responsibility for this does not lie with Parliament."
"It lies, in particular, with the intensive lobbying by the sector concerned, which has had particular success with the UK Government, the French Government and, sadly, I have to say, to a certain extent with the German Government."
"This lobby was also represented here in Parliament by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"We cannot support this proposal, because it would set a precedent for the failure of Parliament to implement effective rules."
"It is not possible for us to stand before our electorate with our heads held high and say that we have succeeded in regulating this netherworld effectively."
"We hope that we will make some progress in the revision of the directive."
"I would like to say a big thank you once again, particularly for the cooperation with my fellow Members in Parliament."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, may I start by praising the hard efforts of Commissioner Michel Barnier? Thank you very much for coming to London to meet with hedge funds and private equity managers and hear their concerns."
"I would also like to thank the Belgian Presidency for their work, as some of my previous colleagues have said, and also Mr Gauzès and the other shadow rapporteurs."
"I shall not thank any more people because I will run out of time, given that I have only got one minute."
"I think it is very important that we look at the issues and see how far we have come in eighteen months."
"I was one of the most critical people when it came to the original draft."
"Especially when it came to issues such as the scope, it seemed to be a one-size-fits-all directive, with the same rules for all sorts of funds - not just hedge funds and private equity but also investment trusts in the UK, which have existed for 150 years with no systemic risk."
"We are in a better place there."
"I am very happy with where we have come on third country access: we have managed to keep markets open and to allow EU investors to continue to invest in non-EU funds."
"We have a level of transparency that does not put private equity at a significant disadvantage compared to sovereign wealth funds, and we have come to a better place on depository liability, where we are not concentrating systemic risk."
"All in all, no one would say it is a perfect directive, but I think we have achieved a workable compromise."
"I hope that the majority of Parliament will support Mr Gauzès, the rapporteur, and the other shadow rapporteurs in the work we have done."
"Mr President, I would like to make two comments."
"The first is addressed to Mr Gauzès."
"I would like to thank him specifically for his excellent work and cooperation."
"However, I also found the cooperation with the other shadow rapporteurs to be exceptionally good and constructive."
"I wanted to say that right at the start before I come to my points of criticism."
"I can, in principle, accept and reinforce what Mr Giegold has just said."
"I could have supported the first compromise that we agreed on in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in May of this year."
"Indeed, I was able to go along with the decision."
"However, what has now been produced as a result of further negotiations is, also in the opinion of my group, no longer acceptable and we can no longer support it."
"As I see it, everyone is entitled to his own opinion on the matter, but in my view, the Council has played an unfortunate role here."
"I will express this a bit clearer than one or two others have done."
"In my view, the Council has missed an opportunity here."
"It gave in to a considerable extent to the financial market lobby and used everything in its power to prevent an effective regulation at European level."
"One morning, I received a call from a lobbyist, who said that if we really wanted to regulate private equities in this way, we would prevent development aid getting to Africa."
"A more absurd and obscure argument could not be found in this regard."
"These things have nothing to do with one another."
"Anyone who comes up with this sort of argument merely demonstrates the fact that he has no interest in meaningful and effective regulation."
"However, this is not the concern of Parliament."
"On behalf of Parliament - and I would like to emphasise this once again - Mr Gauzès and other fellow Members fought for an effective regulation."
"That was undermined by the Council."
"I want to say this once again; this is passive marketing."
"This is a point that Mr Giegold has already mentioned."
"It is like someone being prohibited from selling rotten eggs at the weekly market if he advertises them, but if he does not advertise the rotten eggs and just stands there and sells them, then it is evidently legitimate."
"However, it is no different to what has been laid down here in the section relating to passive marketing."
"It provides an opening."
"We have a European regulation - that has already been said and I think it is a good thing."
"However, when the door is wide open for it to be circumvented through loopholes, then the question arises as to how effective this European regulation really is."
"Private equities were originally regulated better. They are now relatively weakly regulated."
"A very important point - and here, too, I can only reinforce what Mr Giegold said - is the question of the information provided to the workforce."
"The original compromise stated that managers were obliged to inform their workforce of what they intended to do with the companies in which they had invested."
"What remains of this is the strained requirement for owners to inform their workforce and the works councils."
"You can imagine what will come of this - not very much."
"The Council has missed an opportunity here, and I hope that we will perhaps still be able to improve on it at a later date."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I am less grateful than the previous speakers."
"From the very beginning, the AIFM Directive targeted the City of London, an industry that was already sufficiently regulated by the British authorities."
"As usual, the EU misses the point: it is the banks' reckless lending that caused an almighty credit bubble and the financial crisis, not alternative investment funds."
"Will this regulation prevent a further crisis?"
"Absolutely not."
"But it will certainly succeed in driving managers away from London."
"Sadly, they will not go to Paris or Frankfurt, but instead further afield: to New York and Singapore."
"Are we in a position to afford such loss of business?"
"Of course not, but the EU does not care. This directive will significantly add to the cost of these funds and reduce returns, driving smaller funds out of business."
"Its capital requirements will make it difficult for private equity funds, and it is venture capital start-ups that will suffer the consequences."
"Funnily enough, the Commission claims it wants to encourage research, development and entrepreneurship, in order to restore growth to the European economy."
"Instead of encouraging venture capital, they are putting their trust in public funding which is too cumbersome and useless for this purpose."
"It is also incredible to see how the EU has designed this directive from its ivory tower, turning deaf ears to regulatory developments in the rest of the world and adopting a protectionist and arrogant method, whereby the European Securities and Markets Authority will have the last word on who does business in Europe and where European funds invest."
"But where is Mr Cameron in all this?"
"He has betrayed the City of London - the most important British industry."
"He has allowed yet another transfer of power to Brussels without giving the British people a referendum."
"On behalf of British alternative fund managers, I can only say thank you very much, Mr Cameron."
"Don't come to us to help reactivate the British economy!"
"(DE) Mr President, how I would like to stand before the electorate and say 'Yes, we have achieved great things."
"Yes, we have finally made a breakthrough where - in complete contrast to what the previous speaker said - in the opinion of the overwhelming majority of Europeans, we need clear rules'."
"Unfortunately, however, a major opportunity has been missed once again."
"If, Commissioner, even as you are presenting this, you are already saying that the directive needs to be revised sooner than planned, and if various speakers are now saying 'It is all to do with the Council, but we, the European Parliament, are on the right side', then I have to ask: Why do we not just say 'no' tomorrow?"
"Why are we allowing the European AIFM structure to continue to remain full of holes precisely because of this passive commercialisation?"
"Why do we not hold on to that much applauded saying of the German Federal Chancellor: 'No product, no actor, no institution must remain unregulated'?"
"Why is it that, precisely as a reaction to what will now go through on the nod tomorrow, here in this Parliament, we had to witness it being said for the first time from many different quarters - many Members from many different groups - that we need independent expertise, we need 'financewatch.org'?"
"We have been made helpless in the face of the lobbyists."
"Why do we not have the nerve to indicate what we believe we are able to succeed with by saying 'no'?"
"Why are we once again leaving precisely those who we should be representing in the lurch - in other words, with regard to private equity and the undermining of companies?"
"I find that extremely disgraceful, and it will do more harm than good to Europe and the European idea, of which I am a great supporter."
"Mr President, let me first of all congratulate Mr Gauzès for a responsible and listening leadership in this difficult process."
"I would like to reiterate, not least for the benefit of colleagues who are saying that they will vote against this report tomorrow - this might seem so obvious that it should not be said, but sometimes the obvious things need to be said - that private equity and dynamic financial markets are not only important for a competitive economy, they are crucial."
"We need them and they are good for a strong economy."
"That is why I think the report we are going to vote on tomorrow is worth our support."
"When we discuss private equity, we are talking about the opportunities for SMEs to grow and to develop."
"We have achieved a solution for private equity which will not give any disadvantage to private equity funds."
"It will provide us with openness for third countries and for investments in other parts of the world; that was not always the situation."
"We have, in that sense, bettered the legislation."
"I think it is important that we have reduced the scope, so that we are not dealing with what were industrial companies now that we have made an exemption for holding companies."
"Had we accepted the original proposal, it would have meant that normal industrial companies and structures in a number of our countries would have been seen as financial institutions."
"That would have created new problems, not only for investments, but also for industrial development."
"All in all, as always, things could have been better, but the important thing is that now we have the preconditions for dynamic, financial markets which are good for the European economy."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I listen to this debate, I have to admit that it reminds me very much of the debate on the Services Directive."
"I will tell you why."
"In that case, too, my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left declared that there was a regulation on the table in this House that was not perfect, not complete, and yet for years now, they have been grateful for the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament managed to push it through in this House."
"That is the truth about this regulation that we will vote on tomorrow."
"In fact, the improvement made on what the Council and Commission proposed can essentially be attributed to Mr Goebbels and Mrs Regner, who fought for improvements here against the opposition, with the support and excellent cooperation of Mr Gauzès, for which I would like to thank him."
"In my country, Germany, what we have agreed here for the private equity industry will bring about real improvements for workers and for small and medium-sized enterprises, which no longer need to be afraid of simply being eaten up by the black sheep of the equity industry that do not abide by any standards."
"These days, when we read and listen to the press telling us that the funds industry is moving its focus away from the Caribbean and towards Europe because it is important to long-term investors that there are good products in which to invest, that supports the work of this Parliament rather than running counter to it."
"However, before we talk too much about dynamism here, I have to say that my group has been calling for a regulation since 2002."
"Perhaps there has been evidence of dynamism, but only in the last few weeks."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner, as you have personally supplied this dynamism."
"Please tell your colleagues in the Council that, with this method of sluggishness, of 'yes, but' and the refusal to put through better regulations in Europe, we will not succeed in getting the next pieces of legislation on derivatives or short selling through."
"This situation has to change."
"That is an appeal from this Parliament."
"Mr President, there have been long and difficult discussions on this directive in committee, in trialogues and variously in Member States, with the media, with venture capitalists and with fund managers of all types."
"Interestingly, the Member States that were most concerned about hedge fund activity were also those that did not have any regulation of hedge fund managers nor conduct-of-business rules to stop the selling to retail investors of some products only appropriate for professional investors."
"Similarly, the Member States most worried about asset stripping and hidden takeovers were ones without lower disclosure thresholds on shareholding and without disclosure of contracts for difference."
"Now, wherever you are in the EU, there will be protection - and that is right."
"In the supervisory architecture, we have taken a big step towards a common rule book."
"The lesson of AIFM is that we must also take steps to early sharing of best practice."
"So I say to the City, to my own Member State, the UK: be vigilant when promoting the export to Europe of a full range of market regulation with which you already comply."
"The end-product may not be exactly the same and therefore you will have to adjust, and I am afraid that does entail some cost."
"But sharing this best practice, exporting ideas early, is the way to avoid the trauma of legislation at a late stage."
"That said, the end result that we have is an open and reasonably balanced one."
"It is not divergent from company law norms."
"It is not perfect, and it is certainly not as succinct as I would like but, given all the circumstances, I endorse it as a good result."
"I should like to thank personally Minister Reynders and Commissioner Barnier for their very important and active engagement in the trialogues."
"Mr President, the AIFM Directive was the very first piece of legislation that passed my desk after I was elected for the first time eighteen months ago, so to see it finally go through plenary this week, now that we have finally reached an agreement, is actually a relief."
"The putting in place of a passport regime for alternative investment funds, to operate across the entire EU alongside a single rule book governing their operations, should be another valuable piece in the creation of a true single market in financial services for Europe and should be welcomed by the industry in its current modified form."
"As a former UK regulated fund manager, I now hope that this will soon become the mark of high quality in regulation for investors worldwide, as UCITS has been in the past and continues to be across the globe."
"However, I hope that everyone who has been involved in this process has learnt some lessons along the way concerning the principles of better regulation."
"It is clear that this should not be held up as an example of better regulation and, given the extensive agenda of financial legislation over the coming months, I hope we can avoid a repetition of this inefficient process."
"(FR) Mr President, throughout the birthing pains of the directive on alternative investment fund managers, I have constantly argued in favour of equal treatment for all fund managers, irrespective of whether they come from the European Union."
"This may sound obvious, but in practice, there have been innumerable difficulties."
"The text presented today is satisfactory."
"I would like to thank the negotiators, particularly our rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, who, having been through such a difficult birthing process, surely ought to be entitled to some well-earned parental leave."
"I would like to stress that the treatment of third countries can be viewed in two different ways, depending on whether one is inside or outside the European Union."
"Largely as a result of the European Parliament's efforts, all funds that are sold in the European Union will effectively be subject to similar rules."
"Thus, we can now say that there is more or less a level playing field."
"Nevertheless, during the transitional period, non-EU entities will be able to apply national investment rules, whereas EU funds and managers will be subject to the directive, which tends to be stricter."
"The situation is different for markets outside the European Union: European funds and their managers will still be subject to the directive, but third-country funds will not."
"Consequently, it will be much harder to market European products in the rest of the world because they will be less flexible and more expensive."
"We need to be aware of this disparity, although it was inevitable in this particular instance."
"As for depositaries, given that we are imposing more restrictions on them too, specifically in the form of new responsibilities, the higher costs are bound to lead to far-reaching sectoral changes."
"Mr President, I am not saying this to express my opposition, but rather to emphasise that this new legislation is not the cure to all ills."
"It needs to be implemented but it will also create problems, and we need to recognise that."
"(CS) The emergence of hedge funds and private equity funds was the result of the strict regulation of the financial markets even before the outbreak of the financial crisis."
"Financial institutions therefore chose these instruments as ways of avoiding the regulations of the capital market."
"It is therefore not alternative investment funds which are the main reason for this, but the variety of regulations in existence, a situation which we are resolving with today's even stricter regulations."
"Capital has the ability to respond flexibly and is very mobile."
"Government intervention will not stop it, and if regulations are too tough, it will either force this segment of financial services to move outside the European Union or to find new, as yet unregulated forms."
"One can say with certainty that the material we are discussing is possibly a reaction to the past, but does not decrease the risk of future crises."
"However, I think that Mr Gauzès and his friends have done a good job."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, it seems obvious that I should thank the negotiators and, in particular, Mr Gauzès, together with the shadow rapporteurs, for the excellent work that has been achieved with regard to the directive on alternative investment fund managers, ensuring that the funds finally have a uniform set of rules within the entire European Union."
"These funds are responsible for the management of a significant volume of assets invested in Europe and can exert a notable influence on the markets."
"Their impact is largely beneficial, but their activities can also contribute to spreading risk throughout the financial system."
"The new common measures contribute to replacing the 27 different national systems of today and to strengthening the opportunities for the single market."
"Alternative funds therefore benefit from a European passport, independent of their place of registration."
"Furthermore, the single European system will prevent funds from profiting from legislation in states that offer more favourable regulatory regimes."
"In the past, this practice has entailed serious speculative risks for the entire European Union."
"I also agree with the introduction of rules relating to so-called 'asset-stripping' and to the ban on short selling - two points that were missing from the initial proposal from the European Commission."
"Finally, in order to avoid distortions of competition, it is essential that a fund from a third country operating within the European Union benefits from the passport and may carry on business if it respects the same conditions as EU funds."
"(RO) I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès."
"We would not have had this draft resolution tabled for debate today had it not been for the skill and tenacity of this gentleman and of those who cooperated with him, and for the Commission's and Council's involvement."
"I am going to vote for this report because of the benefit it will provide by making the activity of these funds transparent in terms of costs, investment policy and the risks which they also run."
"We are too well aware that without transparency, we cannot talk about the managers of these funds having responsibility."
"In addition, by introducing supervision and monitoring of these funds, we can be sure that this will plug one of the gaps which still exist in Europe's financial supervision structure, thereby responding directly to the justified demands of European citizens who have been hit very hard by this financial crisis which has been triggered worldwide."
"(PT) I would like to begin by congratulating the Commissioner, the representatives of the Council, the shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, Parliament's rapporteur."
"I am well aware of the effort that he put into this subject and the difficulties he underwent so that it would be possible to reach a consensus."
"Congratulations are therefore due to Mr Gauzès."
"Getting down to business, I would like to point out three major aspects in the solution that was presented: firstly, there is a concern to connect with the real situation, which can be seen in the tendency to allow things that are different to be treated in different ways."
"The funds have different sums, different characteristics and different associated risks."
"Secondly, there is the aspect of concern for financial stability, which can be seen in the definition given for levels of capital."
"Thirdly, there is the concern with combating protectionist tendencies, which is amply demonstrated by the agreement relating to third countries."
"In short, this is a more transparent solution that offers greater security for the market and greater protection for the consumer."
"This is a more European solution, and one that is better for the internal market."
"Better regulation will certainly mean that we will have a better market."
"(SK) I firmly believe that it is important to create a systematic framework for monitoring and supervising alternative investment funds."
"The regulation of these funds forms part of a broader regulation of the financial sector, aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial crisis."
"I support the submitted proposal, and I would like to emphasise that we do not thereby wish to restrict the entry of alternative investment funds from third countries into the countries of the European Union, but to set out unified conditions which must be met, not only by the alternative investment funds, but also by the third countries in which they are based."
"As publication of information and supervision are key elements in fulfilling the aims of the directive, it is important to introduce absolute transparency in respect of the supervisory bodies."
"I would like to end by congratulating Mr Gauzes for an excellent piece of work."
"(LT) Thank you, Mr President."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the representatives of the European Commission and the rapporteurs for a very important document."
"The financial and economic crisis has exposed shortcomings in the operation and monitoring of our financial system."
"Today, legislation is already being adopted in Europe establishing a strict system at EU level which will allow the activities of financial institutions to be monitored and assessed and appropriate recommendations and action to be taken if necessary."
"As for alternative funds, the supervision system should also apply to them."
"If we want to achieve greater and improved stability in the financial system, and increase the protection of investors, i.e. our citizens, then the activities of such funds must also be controlled and subject to supervision at EU level."
"The rules must be the same for everyone operating in this field and we must not leave gaps for uncontrolled activity."
"We must learn from previous mistakes and not repeat them."
"I believe that it is not just Europe that is learning from them, but all the countries of the world."
"(PT) We are talking about a very important matter, especially bearing in mind the problems that occurred in the financial sector with this type of alternative investment funds."
"However, the truth is that these solutions do not solve the fundamental issues."
"The regulations are clearly insufficient and significant factors for speculative risk remain, as will be seen in the future."
"It is not enough to talk about supervision and regulation."
"What was needed was a clear position, putting an end to financial derivatives and to hedge funds, while also ensuring effective public and political control over the whole financial sector, especially over financial transactions, including an end to tax havens at a global level."
"The European Union must lead by example."
"(GA) Madam President, like the other speakers I would like to congratulate Commissioner Barnier, the Belgian Presidency and Jean-Paul Gauzès on the good work they have done."
"Jean-Paul has given examples of that good work."
"He said that there had been 1 170 amendments, 200 interviews and half a dozen trialogue meetings."
"That certainly is hard work and hopefully it will pay off."
"After World War II the leaders - Schuman and others - said that this must never happen again."
"Now, 60 years on, we are saying the same arising out of the economic crisis and the failure of supervision and regulation."
"Thankfully, the new supervisory architecture will go a long way to ensuring that is the case, and today we will hopefully complete the picture through the AIMF."
"However, I have one question and that is: are they satisfied that the reciprocity of market access which has been spoken about will establish a level playing field for the European Union?"
"(RO) I would like to begin by thanking Mr Barnier and Mr Gauzès for the excellent results they achieved during the recent negotiations."
"One of the benefits of adopting this directive will be the monitoring of systemic risk."
"This will be carried out specifically based on cooperation between the national authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board."
"Another important form of cooperation will take place between the national agencies and the European Securities and Markets Authority."
"The latter will be able to make recommendations and be involved in monitoring national systems."
"I also think it is important to include additional provisions relating to the transparency of the operations carried out by fund managers."
"At the same time, I welcome the introduction of a simpler regulation scheme for SME administrators in order to boost access to alternative investment sources."
"(DE) Madam President, the hedge fund regulation is not a consequence of the crisis."
"It fills a legislative gap."
"It will take us a step further towards the Europeanisation of the internal market for financial products."
"What is it all about?"
"We will register and authorise all funds."
"We will establish a minimum capital requirement of EUR 125 000."
"The European Securities and Markets Authority will be the supervisory body."
"Our principle of transparency will be applied to the investment strategy, investment policy, payment methods and the delegations."
"The concept of the single market will be put into practice by means of the passport."
"There will be no EU passport for funds having more than 30% of investments outside the EU."
"The bonus regulation that we have introduced for bank managers will also be extended to hedge fund managers in order to ensure sustainability here and to minimise the risk."
"This is a good result."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I imagine that Mr Reynders will also be thanking you when his turn comes."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its incredibly constructive approach during these rather lengthy negotiations, as evidenced by the debate that we have just had."
"Mr Klinz spoke earlier about 'more transparency'."
"I have always believed that transparency is an essential feature of responsibility within the entire financial services sector."
"Which is why, in that very sector, we are now working together to create transparency, putting people under the spotlight who are probably unaccustomed to the glare."
"Unlike Mrs Andreasen, I do not think that this transparency will hamper the finance industry's competitiveness."
"I think it will have quite the opposite effect."
"Back on 13 January, I explained to you that Europe is attractive to the financial industry: that is where we have the competitive edge over other regions of the world."
"The financial sector has an interest in gradually, piece by piece - because, ladies and gentlemen, we have not yet finished - creating healthier, more transparent and more trustworthy foundations."
"In fact, in my view, those foundations will often be a little more ethical."
"As Mr Balz reminded us, this is the first time that we have introduced European rules for this key sector."
"These rules will play a vital role in achieving a range of ambitious objectives and making real progress - the word used by Mr Bullmann earlier to describe the work done by this Parliament in conjunction with the Council and Commission."
"Progress means improving the supervision of systemic risk; it means greater protection for investors, as Mrs Bowles pointed out."
"It means a great deal more transparency in the private equity industry."
"Mr Hökmark has stressed the importance of that industry."
"And lastly, it means creating a real single market for alternative investment funds for institutional investors."
"Mr Kamall has reiterated his concern, which I share, that there should be no discrimination."
"Instead of discrimination, we now have a set of simple requirements."
"I think that is the right solution."
"I would like to remind all those who hoped to go further, that this is a compromise, a dynamic compromise."
"We do not live in a perfect world, as Mrs Regner reminded us just now."
"That is true."
"We might have wanted to see a lot more progress than is found in the compromise text on which you will be voting, but it is a dynamic compromise and the review clauses mean that legislation will be able to evolve in the years to come."
"I can tell Mr Giegold and Mr Klute that there will be further discussions and that we will be returning in particular to the question of passive marketing and the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)."
"The latter was a point raised just now by Mr Karas, while Mr Goebbels rightly reminded us earlier of the importance of the ESMA."
"Mr Goebbels, you mentioned 72 specific powers, within 11 different categories."
"This means that the ESMA will have real powers, and we owe this largely to Parliament's efforts."
"So let me thank each and every one of you."
"Earlier, almost all of the speakers, from across all the groups, even those who are unlikely to vote in favour of this text, paid tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, for being so receptive, for his expertise and for the quality of the relationships he has built."
"I do not think that he will have time to take parental leave, because there is a lot more work to be done in the coming weeks."
"Nevertheless, I would like to express my thanks to the whole Commission team who worked with me and are here this evening, and I would also like to add my voice, both personally and on behalf of the European Commission, to the chorus of thanks and gratitude addressed to the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, in honour of his excellent work."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I am not going to repeat everything that Mr Barnier has just said - I had my say earlier - but I would like to thank everybody who has spoken in support of the proposed text, and also those who have made comments which show, all the same, that this text has real substance, which will enable us to make progress at European level in the regulation of all these alternative investment funds."
"This is the first truly European legislation on this subject, as I said earlier."
"I think that we need to recognise that strengthening ESMA's role is a step in the right direction."
"Several speakers have also mentioned passive marketing."
"We are taking a number of practical measures on this matter and on private equity funds, based on the need for ever more information and ever more transparency, including with regard to the staff in undertakings that are sometimes targeted by these funds' actions."
"To conclude, I would like to make two points."
"Firstly, I have heard from some who feel that we have not gone far enough and others who feel that we should not have gone down the regulatory route at all."
"This leads me to the very Belgian conclusion that we have probably reached a good compromise."
"If both sides are critical of the compromise, then the reasoning underpinning our actions is probably sound."
"To Mr Bullmann, I would just say that we have made some headway on the supervisory structure."
"We are now working on financial investments and will also be looking at investment funds and financial groups."
"Let me congratulate Mr Gauzès once again."
"I said to him earlier that we would try to make progress with regard to rating agencies also, and I can tell him that both the Belgian Presidency and the Commission are willing to try to speed up the discussions on derivatives."
"I have double checked and can confirm that the report is scheduled for adoption by the Parliamentary committee in March next year."
"If it proves possible to bring that date forward, we are willing to try to up the pace."
"Please do let us know if that seems feasible."
"I am delighted that we have reached an agreement on this kind of text."
"We will work towards adopting others in the coming weeks."
"Once again, my thanks."
"They are all the more sincere, Mr Gauzès, because we will go on working together over the next few days."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, earlier, I spoke about the technical details."
"Allow me to use my last two minutes to express some richly deserved thanks: thank you first of all to all the fellow Members who have spoken today."
"My especial thanks to those who have said that they will be supporting the text, but to those who will not be voting in favour, I do not believe that putting me in the same bracket as Mr Cameron is really an insult either."
"I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the groups: Mr Goebbels, Mr Bullmann, Mr Canfin, Mr Klute, and Mrs Regner, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I wanted to name them all in recognition of the incredible support that they gave me during the first phase of this process."
"We were able to work together productively, each putting forward his or her own points of view, and I would like to thank them for that."
"I am delighted that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists have joined us now that a compromise has been reached and hence, I am delighted that Mr Klinz and Mr Kamall have co-signed with me the amendment that replaces the initial report."
"Particular thanks go to Mr Barnier for his considerable involvement in this dossier: he knows how much I appreciate him."
"I know that he knows that Parliament is relying on him and will support him in putting in place these building blocks that are so dear both to him and to us."
"I know it is unusual, but I would also like to thank Ugo Bassi, with whom I have had a very fruitful working relationship during this time, and so the text is also the result of work done within the Commission."
"As for you, Minister, earlier I felt that you contributed something when, in your thanks, you asked whether we would continue to make progress."
"So let me begin by thanking you, because without you we would never have achieved anything on the Member States' side."
"These are genuine thanks, not simply a polite gesture - I believe that your personal commitment has been key to the progress made in the Council and to the fact that we have reached an agreement."
"You have also succeeded in ensuring that all the main groups can identify with parts of the text and in obtaining the majority that we both wanted for this directive."
"My thanks also for the contributions from our fellow Members on the left, without whose support the directive would not have the credibility that I am confident it will have tomorrow after a very broad vote."
"As you pointed out, this was vital for supervision, and vital for this directive too."
"I am also very grateful to your teams, Minister; please pass on my thanks."
"Some of the debates were pretty lively, but although I now live in Normandy, I come from the south, and sometimes my southern temperament wins out over the more balanced Norman approach."
"I also wanted to say, Minister, President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, that I really hope that we will complete our work on rating agencies before the end of the year."
"For our part, we have the committee vote on 22 November, the vote in Strasbourg in December, and then, if the Council is ready, we will be ready."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The financial crisis that the world has gone through has shown that international financial exchanges need to be subject to minimum rules."
"Having stated in September that it was determined to supervise the markets, the European Parliament has today, 11 November, sent another powerful message to the rest of the world."
"From now on, alternative investment funds (hedge funds) entering Europe will be more strictly monitored and regulated by Europe."
"What is more, they will have to be declared to the authorities and managed within the European Union."
"The non-regulation of these resources caused many bankruptcies, stock exchange crashes and social crises."
"France is about to take over the G20 Presidency for a year."
"Its main priority will be to reform the international financial system."
"With this vote, Europe is blazing a trail."
"This report about investment fund managers has triggered a huge amount of discussion both between the various groups in the European Parliament and between Parliament and the Council."
"I maintain the view, which was also expressed during the discussions prior to the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs, that the Commission's proposal is a serious mistake and conveys a glaring lack of understanding about the role of investment funds (private equity and hedge), as well as confusion between banks as the institutions guilty of triggering the financial crisis, these closed-ended investment funds and the open-ended investment funds (mutual funds)."
"Behind the well-meaning principles, which have unfortunately been adopted by fellow Members who do not understand what financial management and macro-economics mean, lie hidden regulations which not only have nothing to do with preventing a new crisis, but will actually do nothing more than increase the costs of operating an alternative investment fund in an unjustified and absurd manner, which will be reflected in lower capital, smaller returns and fewer investments."
"I frankly admit that I am completely astounded that this steamroller attitude is prevalent in the EU, which is reminiscent of the 1950s when institutions were destroyed in Eastern Europe on the back of grand slogans."
"The economic and financial crisis has highlighted to us that we need to exercise tighter control over economic operators."
"They have exposed themselves to excessive risks which have caused upheaval in the global financial system."
"According to the European Central Bank's analysis, the business handled by alternative investment fund administrators amounts to approximately EUR 700 billion in assets in the European Union, which plays a major role in the financing of the latter's economy."
"Consequently, I welcome the Commission's proposal on authorising and supervising these funds and on introducing a European passport in this area."
"Creating a European internal market for alternative fund administrators will help limit systemic risks and provide better protection for investors, in keeping with the new European economic supervisory structure."
"At the same time, the Commission will have to present an assessment of the results from this harmonisation process in good time, in order to ensure that this has not caused any distortion of the market."
"in writing. - I support this piece of legislation regulating hedge funds and private equity."
"While much more remains to be done in the field, this is an important step towards better regulation of the activities of alternative investment fund managers, which was met with opposition even after the 2008 financial crisis hit hard, most notably by Charlie McCreevy, the Internal Market commissioner in charge at the time."
"Once the new European supervisory authority becomes fully functional, fund managers will not be able to market their products in the European Union unless they hold a European passport certifying full compliance with this directive."
"Strict depositary liability will ensure that investors can always claim damages and will be informed of the reasons for potential delegation of liability."
"Critical new clauses, which we have insisted on and which were met with resistance in the Council, are the provisions combating asset stripping."
"Employees will be protected from predatory funds bent on short-term profiteering through the destruction of viable companies."
"Distributions to investors and capital reductions will be limited in the first two years after takeover, and employees will have access to information on the plans envisioned for their companies."
"Alternative funds, such as hedge funds or private equity funds, probably contributed through their actions to the ongoing global crisis, and the question of their regulation is currently being discussed not only in the EU, but also in the US."
"The present report relates to the Rasmussen and Lehne reports, both from 2008, and deals with the proposal for a directive on alternative investment fund managers."
"The report gives a summary analysis of the problem of alternative funds, including a description of the key points: regulating the activity of alternative fund managers, including the creation of a single European passport; the obligation of alternative fund managers to appoint an independent asset valuator for each alternative fund they manage; a requirement to enhance the transparency of alternative funds and market disciplines and the regulation of short selling."
"The directive also enables the Member States to allow managers to offer alternative funds to non-professional investors as well."
"On the other hand, there are objections to the proposed regulation, such as the Larosière report, the Turner Review and the reaction of the Alternative Investment Management Association."
"The adoption of this directive should not entail significant changes for alternative funds in the Czech Republic because of the high level of current Czech regulations in this area."
"Overall, I think that the report submitted by my fellow Member, Mr Gauzès, contains an accurate analysis of this issue, as well as relevant recommendations regarding alternative funds, and I therefore recommend approving it in its proposed form."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, for his excellent work on this complex, technical and controversial report."
"When it appeared, the Commission's proposal on alternative investment fund managers provoked passion, criticism and praise in various quarters."
"It was criticised heavily and for having been drafted in secret."
"I myself thought that its biggest weakness was that it mixed two product clusters - different in terms of their nature and therefore their risks - in the same directive."
"These were private equity funds and hedge funds."
"One focuses on a speedy return, while with the other, the investment matures over a longer period."
"The risks are associated specifically with the first."
"The debate on the directive by Parliament and the Council resulted in a compromise - not a perfect one, but an acceptable one all the same."
"The directive on alternative investment fund managers constitutes an important part of the new system for financial regulation and supervision."
"We nevertheless have to remember that financial supervision will need to improve even after this directive has been adopted."
"With tomorrow's vote, the EU will be putting into practice what was agreed at the G20 in London."
"Following on from the agreement on financial supervision, the European Parliament and the Belgian Presidency have shown that they are serious about reforming the financial system."
"The agreement reached is balanced in that it meets three concerns: containing systemic risk, protecting investors and guaranteeing a level playing field."
"Also important is that the EU does not close off its market to non-EU capital, which is a prerequisite to enable our European economy to breathe."
"The new harmonised rules will ensure transparency, legal certainty and a reinforced internal market."
"The European passport, in particular, will authorise managers to operate throughout the European Union without having to be registered separately in each Member State."
"I should also like to emphasise that I am pleased with the solution that has been found regarding private equity."
"The lighter regime applicable to the managers of small funds will promote the creation and financing of new companies - often SMEs - in innovative sectors."
"Therefore, we must support with conviction the political agreement that has come about following 14 months of negotiations."
"Single Market Act (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the Single Market Act."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to officially present to the Members of this House the Communication on the Single Market Act, which was adopted by the Commission on 27 October, and to debate it here with you."
"We actually began our discussions yesterday at the instigation of Mr Harbour and Mr Grech, in another place but with several hundred political, economic and social stakeholders active at European, national and regional level."
"This is an important document. It is important, ladies and gentlemen, because we believe that Europe is being called to account on many fronts."
"The outside world has questions about the reasons for the crises."
"We have experienced an incredibly harsh financial crisis over the past two years, and its many economic, social and human repercussions are still being felt in all our countries."
"There is the economic crisis, in general, and then there are other crises that we cannot afford to ignore, such as the food crisis, even though less is said about them."
"Approximately one billion people are in danger of dying from starvation or lack of water."
"Then there is the environmental crisis, which is probably the worst."
"We need to respond to these questions, but in addition to these external questions, there are internal questions, the most important of which is undoubtedly that being asked by the European citizens, who do not understand, who are often concerned, and sometimes angry, who remain unconvinced and have questions about this large single market that is the cornerstone and has been since the inception of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1950 - this large European market that we are patiently building together."
"The question being asked by our citizens, by small and medium-sized enterprises, is: what does this single market have to offer us?"
"What is Europe doing for us?"
"We need to give a positive answer to that question, which we do not always do."
"This is what Mario Monti concluded in the report commissioned by President Barroso, a report which you have debated on many occasions and which contains many useful findings."
"For example, Mario Monti states that the single market is increasingly necessary and yet becoming ever less popular."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are politicians, each with our own mandate, and when we hear conclusions of this ilk, we need to strive to ensure that what is necessary becomes popular and, in any case, that it gains support and is better understood."
"This is why, in view of all these crises and questions and in accordance with our mandate, we wanted to produce a practical follow-up to Mario Monti's findings, and indeed to the consistent findings that this Parliament, under the guidance of Mr Grech, whom I thank, has also come up with concerning the imperfect, incomplete, and occasionally disappointing, functioning of this large single market."
"Hence, the document that we are presenting to you today, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, is an original one."
"It is not something you can take or leave."
"It contains an action plan rather than a legislative proposal, an action plan that currently contains 50 proposals that we are putting forward for discussion, all of which are designed to improve the way the single market works in order to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises, growth and citizens."
"This market is a vehicle for promoting growth and social progress, not the other way around, as I have often said before."
"We have just been discussing the directive on hedge funds and private equity."
"Let me say that I have a very clear strategy which I intend to pursue doggedly for five years."
"As I told you on 13 January, we want to and we will ensure that financial services and the financial markets, which are vital, once again serve the real economy, not the other way round."
"In doing so, we will ensure that the real economy and the single market underpinning it serve growth and social progress."
"Our growth strategy, which is consistent with the 2020 strategy, is designed to make the single market work better."
"This market needs to be seen as the platform on which the European economy is built."
"We are convinced that if this platform can be made to work better than it does today - which is the aim of the action plan - then everything built on it - private and public initiatives, local, regional, national and European initiatives, the activities of associations and the whole range of other bodies within the market - will also work better."
"We want to respond to these questions and challenges by working with businesses to return to strong, sustainable and equitable growth."
"We are proposing a number of measures specifically focused on innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Single Market Act includes the major issue of the patent, which we are discussing right now - hence, the complications with my schedule, Madam President - in the Competition Council under the Belgian Presidency."
"More generally, we want to make the whole regulatory and tax environment more flexible for businesses and to facilitate access to the funding they need to support their investments."
"Lastly, in terms of boosting European competitiveness, we want to strengthen our external strategy in a spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit."
"In order to ensure that European citizens are at the heart of the single market, the Commission wants to demonstrate that the market does not constitute a barrier to the development of services of general interest and major infrastructure."
"We will produce a communication, which will undoubtedly be supported, enhanced and improved by Parliament's contributions: a communication on services of general interest and public services."
"We want to make it clear that the single market upholds the social rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that it can offer new development opportunities to socially innovative businesses that serve European workers and consumers alike."
"We now come to the third chapter of the Single Market Act."
"This comprehensive approach only makes sense when it is situated in the context of improved governance, through increased dialogue and partnership with our businesses and our fellow citizens, but also between the European institutions, the Member States, regional and local authorities, and through better social dialogue."
"In all our work together, we are convinced that meeting the challenge of competitiveness, the challenge of generating the growth that European citizens expect, requires the help of every single citizen and every single business."
"It requires the help of every single community."
"This is the aim, therefore, of the four months of European public debate that we want to launch together with you."
"Many commissioners, 13 of us, worked on the Single Market Act - for which I thank them - which has been approved by the Commission after lengthy in-house discussions."
"This issue is one of our top priorities, and we are debating these 50 proposals."
"We will listen carefully to what the various institutions and our various partners have to say, and at the end of our consultations, probably in February, we will finalise the list of commitments on which the relevant Commissioners will undertake to deliver proposals, within a maximum of two years."
"As a result, in 2012, when we come to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the single market, 20 years on from the commitments and proposals made by Jacques Delors, that anniversary will not be marked by nostalgia or melancholy - there is no place for nostalgia at present - but rather, it will be a proactive and dynamic occasion."
"This is why we are setting the ball rolling today, as we did yesterday."
"For four months, my colleagues and I will be on hand to coordinate the European public debate that has begun today in the European Parliament."
"We will be seeking to play a constructive and very attentive role in it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week, in the so-called Single Market Forum, we discussed the European Commission's proposal that is intended to lead to a highly competitive social market economy in Europe."
"All three concepts - competitiveness, social and market economy - are important to us in this regard, and we expressly welcome the fact that the Commissioner responsible for the internal market, Michel Barnier, has succeeded in reviving the horizontal, or as Mr Grech described it in his report, holistic approach that we wanted for the single market."
"We believe that this is a major step, but we also believe that further small steps are needed in order to really make the horizontal approach of this legislative project complete."
"This is where the European Parliament comes in."
"This involvement of the European Parliament will only succeed if we are put into a position to be able to overcome the technical, institutional and political differences that this sort of legislative project brings with it, because only then will we be able to fully exploit the legislative potential inherent in this proposal."
"That is what we want to do."
"I am certain that the public hearing involving citizens and interested stakeholders can help to get everyone involved in this legislative proposal and to give them a sense of being able to play their part in deciding what will ultimately come of this legislative proposal."
"Commissioner Barnier, Parliament will play its part in achieving this goal."
"We want to revise the programme of 50 proposals, we want to set priorities, we want to help to ensure that all European Parliament committees are involved and that we achieve the institutional consensus that such legislation requires."
"Ultimately, ladies and gentlemen, we must succeed in ensuring that everyone has his or her place in this single market and that we will all be able to benefit jointly from cooperation within this single market."
"We want to demonstrate this by 2012 - for the 20th anniversary of the single market - and we will work hard to achieve it."
"Madam President, thank you Commissioner Barnier for the work you have done."
"It was no easy task that you had and you have included something of what Professor Monti set out in his report and what Mr Grech drew up for the European Parliament."
"We can also see something of that in there, as well as the attempt to take the holistic approach, which has not succeeded in quite the way we imagined it would, but is nevertheless on the right track."
"It is also very important that you make it absolutely clear that you are attempting to make the social rights of citizens, which should, of course, be at the heart of the European Union's legislation, a reality."
"However, on behalf of my group, I have to say that we feel some things in this text are too vague, too simple or too insignificant, or are missing altogether, because one of the crucial demands that we had, and which you also agreed to, was for a social clause to be included in all important areas of European policy."
"We cannot find this social clause."
"A commitment to carrying out social impact assessments could satisfy us."
"However, a social clause is significantly more than what we find here in this text."
"We will endeavour to help you so that we make progress in the right direction, because this is very important to us."
"There is another point that I find quite problematic and that was also very important to our group."
"We are calling for collective redress."
"We want collective redress for citizens so that they are also genuinely able to assert their consumer protection rights."
"On behalf of the European Commission, you announced that more studies are to be carried out."
"Studies have been carried out in this area for three years."
"I think it is time for us to get on with it and for us to actually receive a legislative proposal from you, not merely another proposal for a study to be carried out, so that we can see how we can move forward from here."
"As you see, there are some things that we are satisfied with, but other things that we are not so happy about and we will work hard with you, the Council and our fellow Members from the other groups to ensure that we ultimately have a genuinely good text."
"Madam President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the largest single market in the world in terms of economic power has developed in the globalised era into a crucial location advantage for the European Union."
"That is why it is so important to oppose protectionist tendencies and to expand the single market further."
"In view of the excessively indebted national budgets, there is nothing left for Europe to do but to strengthen the economy by means of structural reforms."
"Since its establishment in 1992, the single market has already generated additional growth of 1.85%."
"Implementation of the measures that have been announced is intended to bring about further growth of 2 to 4%."
"We can divide the Commission's 50 proposals for single market initiatives into three categories: firstly, into the many specific proposals that will, in any case, enhance the single market for enterprises and citizens."
"These include the creation of a fully operational internal energy market which, for Europe as an economic and industrial centre, is particularly important."
"Then there is a European professional card and a European Skills Passport to facilitate mobility within the European Union, which will become more and more important in future in order to maintain Europe's competitiveness in a globalised world, and the strengthening of electronic commerce by means of better management of copyrights and new guidelines for the effective implementation of the Services Directive in order to create new jobs."
"Secondly, there are, however, also many proposals which are worded in too vague a manner for us to be able to assess them yet."
"Therefore, we still need to wait for the Commission's specific proposals."
"I include here the revision of the EU rules for public procurement, measures for services of general interest and also - Mrs Gebhardt - the deliberations on a European approach to collective redress."
"I do not know whether we ought to go down the same erroneous path as the United States."
"Thirdly, the communication also contains proposals which, in my view, are counterproductive in terms of strengthening the single market, because they burden enterprises with additional bureaucracy."
"We therefore need to discuss these proposals, and we are ready to do so."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, we are debating tonight what I believe might be the most important act for the EU in the years to come."
"It is within the context of reforming the single market that we have the real opportunity to transform Europe into a more social and sustainable Union, so the question is: does this communication manage to point towards a more green and socially just internal market?"
"I believe we are not quite there yet."
"Let me give you two examples; firstly proposal 29."
"Here I have to ask you, Mr Barnier, where is the guarantee for the right to strike?"
"Where is the guarantee that fundamental social rights will not be overthrown by the freedoms of the market?"
"I am aware that there are different positions within the Commission on this question and I would like to ask you very directly: is it true that among others, the Danish, Swedish, German and British Commissioners have fought against your proposal to introduce a social clause?"
"If this is so, Commissioner, you should know that you have the backing of this House, because achieving such guarantees would be true reconciliation."
"A second example of something that needs to be improved is proposal 19, the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base."
"We Greens have been asking for this for a long time and should therefore be happy."
"But the problem for us arises when we read the text."
"It says that the CCCTB should aim at removing fragmentation for business."
"Listen."
"I believe that the major problem with company taxes in Europe is not fragmentation, but unhealthy ongoing downward competition between Member States."
"This has been going on for 15 years now. No wonder that we have problems financing our welfare at this time."
"I believe the aim of a CCCTB should be to put an end to unhealthy competition in Europe."
"That is the real problem."
"Furthermore, I think we need to go beyond the proposal right now on greening the internal market, for example, by using green procurement."
"I believe we can achieve much more there. So, Mr Barnier, I believe we have work to do."
"I am looking forward to that and thank you for inviting us to join in this very broad discussion. We appreciate that."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I think it is important to reflect that the idea of having an ambitious programme to deal with the completion of the single market - or our moves towards completion, because I think that it is a job which will never ever be complete - was not in the EU 2020 strategy."
"Nor, indeed, was it in your programme when you came here for your hearing last year."
"I think it is a reflection of the political impetus behind the need to complete the single market and to raise its profile which was generated by President Barroso's decision to ask Mario Monti to look at it, and to ask our committee, under the leadership of Louis Grech, to look at it at the same time."
"We are really pleased that you have taken the initiative to move it forward."
"You got a flavour of some of the debates to come."
"I think we should reflect on this as an apt opportunity to deal with what Europe desperately needs: economic growth, jobs, a dynamic small enterprise sector, more innovation, more efficient public procurement - those are the things that our citizens will judge us by."
"If we get more of them back to work and more companies started, that is the biggest single social achievement that we will make with this act."
"Madam President, we believe that the new European Commission document on the single market is in keeping with the philosophy of the Lisbon strategy which, everyone admits, is a failure."
"The way we see it, competition should be subject to strict rules and, as the crisis has proven, to state intervention."
"Consumers must be protected from the speculation which allows markets to be controlled by the oligopoly and efficient public services must compensate for market shortcomings."
"The Commission proposal chooses to ignore the lack of fundamental social protection and to overlook the actual situation in many countries of Europe today."
"While the European Commission is prepared to endorse a series of measures in order to help companies, no progress is being made in the consumer protection sector, for which previous proposals for impact assessments to be carried out have been repeated."
"Thus, no progress has been made for consumers."
"So how can we convince the citizens that this directive concerns them?"
"What has changed compared with the past?"
"Protection for consumers and workers must be the key point in all EU legislative initiatives."
"Services of general economic interest, in particular, must not be subject to competition law, the law of the internal market or rules regulating subsidies or the liberalisation of public contracts."
"Universal access to quality public services must be the basic political criterion."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commissioner and I hope that he bears in mind the fact that the people of Europe are not at the service of the market, but that the market is at the service of the people - notwithstanding what those before me have said - and therefore, the market must respond to the needs of the people."
"I am speaking on behalf of one of the four motors of the European economy, Lombardy."
"Where we are, small and medium-sized enterprises account for several million jobs."
"I hope that the ambitious plan signed by Mr Barnier that we have read does not clash with the proposals of some of his fellow Commissioners."
"I am thinking of the abolition of duties on textile products arriving from Pakistan, which would cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, in Lombardy and across the rest of Europe."
"We are standing by to help publicise this but I do not know if four months are enough."
"I am thinking of the businesses in the Veneto which are underwater right now."
"I do not know if they will be able to be sufficiently involved from now until February in what is, in any case, an ambitious plan that I hope we, as the European Freedom and Democracy Group and Lega Nord, will be able to help improve, as well as help with."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the single market represents a fundamental strategic objective for Europe, to be pursued with renewed political determination."
"The targets reached over the years represent exceptional results, but today we must definitely look to the future."
"Europe is no longer the Europe of 1985."
"Indeed, the new realities being established absolutely require new responses."
"The current European and international context, characterised by the globalisation of trade, technological evolution and the emergence of new actors on the world scene, surely requires a serious re-launch of the single market, striking the right balance between the protection of all those parties involved: businesses, consumers and workers."
"The tabled document represents a good start, but it must now be promoted and publicised as much as possible."
"Among the many objectives that the document sets, I should like to emphasise the importance of three aspects in particular."
"First of all, I fully agree on the need to strengthen the regulatory framework through standardisation to be achieved via future revisions."
"Indeed, the full realisation of the European single market needs standardisation, which, over recent years, has been seen to be decisive for the free movement of goods and has contributed to the elimination of barriers to free trade."
"Coordination of national fiscal policies is just as important, with the identification of a taxable base."
"My work over the coming months will be to spread awareness of this important document as much as possible and to talk with all the parties affected so that a strategy capable of responding to the needs and expectations of businesses and our citizens is adopted."
"Madam President, the re-launching of the single market has to be politically supported, economically viable and socially acceptable to European citizens."
"No revival of the single market will be successful unless we convince citizens that the single market truly represents their interests."
"In this respect, I am highly appreciative of Commissioner Barnier's strong commitment to take into account citizens' concerns and aspirations."
"In fact, Commissioner Barnier went the extra mile to reconcile conflicting views and tensions and to incorporate different priorities of the various stakeholders."
"However, in its present form, the Single Market Act does not sufficiently address the social dimension which would ensure the right balance of an open economy, stimulating growth and job creation, but safeguarding in the process consumer protection and citizens' rights."
"We must not lose sight of the holistic vision of the single market, nor should we approach this act in a defeatist manner, and there I agree with Commissioner Barnier that we should counter 'single market fatigue', especially when that fatigue emanates from within the institutions."
"In my opinion, the single market is not getting the political support urgently needed to ensure that it does not become yesterday's business."
"More political leadership on the single market from the Presidents of the Commission and Council would go a long way towards achieving a viable single market to serve as a catalyst for economic recovery."
"We trust that Commissioner Barnier will acknowledge our concerns during the coming months of serious discussions."
"We must not lose this political momentum and this unique opportunity to revitalise the single market."
"I repeat that market integration is not an irreversible process and must not be taken for granted; a weak and fragile single market would lead to more disintegration than integration for the European project."
"(SV) Madam President, the EU's internal market is perhaps the most important instrument for giving Europe a new impetus."
"Those who are trying to make globalisation out to be a threat are quite wrong."
"Globalisation represents an opportunity for Europe."
"If we do not want Europe to be an isolated continent, we must continue to tear down barriers and borders."
"In this work, you have my full support and that of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"We must do more to tear down barriers."
"That is the joint responsibility of all of us."
"I would have liked to have seen you go further and for the work to have been closer to what Mr Monti presented the other day."
"He gave a very detailed analysis of what Europe could do."
"The Commission must become bolder, but so too must we in the European Parliament."
"We have to be clear-sighted."
"Europe can overcome the crisis, but not by standing still and remaining where we are today."
"(CS) Mr Harbour talked about ambition;"
"I would like to talk about courage."
"When Mr Monti drew up a wonderful report - at least that is what I called it - I asked him if he thought that politicians would have the courage to enforce his recommendations at European level as well as in the Member States."
"He answered very cleverly, because he is a clever politician: that is up to you - you are a politician."
"I would also like to talk about the courage to promote things which I think are important for Europe, because the internal market is one of the most important instruments for creating competitiveness, but also for preserving jobs, in the context of a global Europe."
"As such, I would simply like to appeal to the Commissioner to be courageous in dealing with the Member States, the national parliaments and ourselves, because this discussion will certainly not be easy."
"There are certainly issues here where we will see eye to eye on where we can agree, but there will be issues on which we will have very intense discussions."
"Mr President, 'the greatest danger that threatens us is protectionism', German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the Financial Times yesterday."
"In this context, the Commission's initiative comes at the right time, a time when we need to refocus on the real economy to get out of the crisis."
"The Single Market Act is an historic initiative."
"In my view, it should be given the same status that the Delors White Paper was given 20 years ago."
"I truly hope that it will attract the highest political attention in the Commission, in the Council and in the Member States."
"I am grateful to the Belgian Presidency which yesterday took up my pledge on behalf of the EPP to convene the Competitiveness Council at ministerial level and take up the Single Market Act."
"I also congratulate the Commissioner, Mr Barnier, on his vision of developing a citizen-centred market."
"This will require partnership and shared responsibility."
"You can count on us in the EPP, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, for that."
"It will require partnership on the part of all the EU institutions."
"The commitment of the business community is equally important, with self-regulation a key to success."
"The four months ahead must be used in the public debate to build political support and to develop with citizens and stakeholders the 50-proposal outline in the Single Market Act."
"It is time for action."
"Today, I would very much like to impress on us all a sense of urgency."
"Unemployed people cannot wait any longer for jobs, citizens for better choice and lower costs, business for better competition."
"As the rapporteur on a more efficient and fairer retail market, I wish to stress that retail is a pillar of the single market and of improving our citizens' lives."
"There are still national rules that impede free movement; unfair commercial practices and restrictions to market access still exist; there are toys that still have to be tested again when they have already been certified in another Member State."
"In this respect, I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for their commitment to transposition."
"The light at the end of the tunnel is not protectionism, it is free movement, and the new Single Market Act has the potential to equip Europe to play its global role."
"Mr President, last year's mission letter from President Barroso to Professor Monti asked him to take 'a fresh look at how the market and social dimensions of an integrated European economy can be mutually strengthened'."
"In his turn, in the report, Professor Monti launched a strong appeal for political consensus, saying that 'consensus building [...] will thus be a crucial component of a new strategy for the single market."
"The effort to generate consensus will have to show full awareness of the main concerns surrounding the single market today'."
"For us, achieving that consensus requires a new balance between the social and economic pillars of the internal market strategy."
"Now I know, Commissioner Barnier, that you indeed realise that and I commend you for your personal efforts to bring about that balanced consensus."
"But sadly, others in the College did not share that realisation and so, while there are good elements in this communication, as my colleagues have said, we do not think that at the moment, it forms the basis for that consensus."
"I hope our groups in this House can work together effectively to try to strike the correct balance and achieve that consensus and I hope that, at the end of the consultation period, the College of the Commission will take note of that and produce a balanced consensual package."
"I would dearly like, Commissioner, to see the track-changes text in relation to proposals 29 and 30; it would be intriguing, I think, to see who is responsible for the changes and the very special language used there."
"Some Members have referred to the social clause, proposal 29, and I think that proposal 30 is very important."
"I note there the reference to the need for 'a legislative proposal which is likely to include or be supplemented by a clarification of the exercise of fundamental rights in the context of the economic freedoms of the internal market'."
"One way of reading that, Commissioner, is that it is referring to what has come to be termed the Monti II regulation."
"I hope that this is the case because it would directly address our concern about the social clause."
"We will work with you in the coming months on this."
"Mr President, of the Commission's 50 targets in the Single Market Act communication, I counted 13 which concern my work in the Parliament's ECON committee, but all 50 concern my constituency and the people I was elected to represent."
"Fundamentally, many of these EU projects, if done well, will be hugely positive for all of my constituents in Wales."
"Specifically, SMEs are crucial to the Welsh economy and to Europe as a whole."
"Therefore, I welcome the proposals with regard both to accessing finance via the capital markets and to ensuring that the venture capital funds set up in any Member State can operate and invest freely in the companies in the EU."
"Mario Monti was clear in his recent work that the single market had stalled."
"We need to reenergise the process and, in that way, remind our constituents that the EU does not just bring regulation and red tape at a huge cost, but should, and can actually bring tangible benefits for businesses and trade as well as consumers and individuals."
"This is where the real added value of the EU lies."
"Mr President, the EPP Group has always been a strong supporter of the single market and I can affirm that we will do our utmost to see this initiative come to life, so that in 2012, we can celebrate the anniversary of the single market with pride, not with regret."
"I would like to repeat what Professor Monti said yesterday during the first Single Market Forum."
"He stated that the single market is not a flagship initiative because it is neither a flag nor a ship."
"It is a sea and the wind that enables any ship to sail."
"I am sure that Parliament, in its report on the Single Market Act, will seek the right balance between its social dimension and promotion of business and growth."
"The EPP Group will pay particular attention to the business environment for small and medium-sized enterprises and will contribute to developing precise ideas on the governance of the single market."
"I thank Commissioner Barnier for this very timely initiative and for his vision."
"He has all our support."
"(PL) The Single Market Act is good news for the internal market, and so also for businesses, consumers and citizens."
"I am pleased that the Commission has presented such an ambitious programme for completing construction of the common market."
"During yesterday's Internal Market Forum, at which the Commissioner made the first presentation of a programme of 50 proposals, a variety of opinions were expressed about the act."
"Among them, the prevailing opinion concerned the need for an holistic vision of building the common market to help finish this project, which was begun over 20 years ago."
"It is important to create a truly single, citizen-friendly market, where people will not experience problems with opening bank accounts, registering cars, having their qualifications recognised, transferring pension rights or ordering goods and services from other Member States using the Internet."
"For me, however, achieving free movement of services remains a priority, and this, in turn, requires further work on implementation of the Services Directive."
"I must, however, agree with the statement made yesterday by Professor Mario Monti."
"He said we have known for a long time about many of the initiatives contained in the Single Market Act, so they are neither new problems nor new solutions."
"Therefore, I appeal to the European Commission, the Member States and fellow Members of the European Parliament to speed up the process and implement legislation which is essential for citizens, consumers and businesses."
"(PT) I would like to begin by congratulating Commissioner Barnier on the presentation of this important document."
"As it diagnosed, the impact of the crisis that we are currently experiencing is making itself felt in all sectors of our society and economy, causing dismay and distrust of the single market among the public."
"However, this very single market is one of Europe's greatest weapons for combating the current crisis."
"We therefore warmly welcome this communication, which shows new ambition for single market policies, allowing us to restore confidence in our social market economy model."
"In the current situation, the European Union should pay particular attention to its 20 million small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Given this, one of the EU's priorities should be to create mechanisms that solve the problem of access to credit for these companies."
"We would also like to highlight the Commission's proposal to evaluate the Small Business Act by the end of 2010, so as to make life easier for these companies, especially by simplifying bureaucratic and tax matters, and placing greater emphasis on social responsibility."
"We hope that the 50 measures tabled here can contribute to further developing the internal market and taking full advantage of it, as it may prove a source of extra growth for the European economy."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when European citizens need, more than ever, a Europe showing solidarity and ambition, a social yet dynamic Europe, I would like to pay tribute here to Mr Barnier's approach."
"This approach, the Single Market Act, is a comprehensive, overall approach to the single market, a collective approach."
"You have been able, Mr Barnier, to bring around a discussion table a number of European Commissioners interested in this whole document and in an open approach, since you are coming here today to open the debate on the document, so that each and every one of us can enhance it with our own thoughts; a 'citizen' approach, since you wish to put the citizen back at the heart of the internal market, likewise businesses, and I think that this will actually be the major challenge in the months and years to come."
"What is more, this approach is policy based, and I think that Europe, above anything else, needs more policy, and this is certainly also one of our Parliament's responsibilities."
"Regarding the content, Mr Barnier, I would like to focus on the point about services of general interest."
"Like you, I think that we need legal certainty more than we need a legislative framework."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' opinion, which I am due to present, I talk about a road map for the organising authorities; you talk about a toolbox."
"We are already coming together, even though, on a semantic level, we will both have to take one step."
"I think we will need to work specifically on this toolbox, which will be a real challenge, and also on transparency for all those using and seeking to provide services of general interest."
"(FR) Mr President, Europe is at a turning point and has a duty to deal ambitiously and proactively with an economic and financial crisis which is, of course, greatly affecting European citizens."
"I would like to welcome Commissioner Barnier's initiative; he deserves to be congratulated for the method he has used and which he intends to roll out during the years to come."
"I also welcome the change in the Commission's approach regarding the internal market."
"One feels a sense of purpose, a will to work together for the success of this fine project that is the internal market."
"Concerning the content, I am glad to see that the external dimension of our internal market is at last being considered, both in terms of promoting our industries and in terms of defending our citizens."
"It is only by being strong internally that we will be able to influence matters externally."
"You see, I, like you, am a firm believer in the internal market, but not any old one, and that is why I will end with this quote by Jacques Delors, who said: 'I reject a Europe that would be just a market, a free-trade area, without a soul, without a conscience, without political will and without a social dimension.'"
"With this Single Market Act, we have this political will and this soul."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to welcome this Single Market Act, and particularly the inclusion of social and social economy concepts."
"I imagine that this was not without difficulties for those within the current Commission."
"Allow me nonetheless to cite three examples with regard to which I remain full of expectation but am, at this stage, left feeling rather unsatisfied."
"Firstly, and Mrs Gebhardt mentioned it: collective redress."
"We have been consulting for 20 years."
"Ever since Commissioner Van Miert's initiative, the Commission has been consulting."
"Obviously, I hope that one day we will see this issue resolved."
"Another example relates to passengers."
"You cite the eruption of the Icelandic volcano in order to amend at last the regulation on air passengers, but for 10 years, we have been calling for a comprehensive regulation on the rights of all passengers."
"When will we have it?"
"I think that in this respect, legitimate impatience is starting to show."
"Let us not even mention the issue of services of general interest."
"We are waiting for a framework directive."
"What are we going to get?"
"You say that there will be a communication and actions."
"Commissioner, I am relying on the pragmatic man that you are to turn this Single Market Act into something more than a catalogue of good intentions."
"(PL) I would like to share with you my experience from a meeting I had with a young journalist today about yesterday's hearing on the Single Market Act."
"The journalist was greatly impressed, and spoke with great surprise about the document."
"He said it is a sensational and revolutionary document and asked why it is not being spoken about more widely and why it is not at the centre of European debate."
"It is we, in fact, who must bring the 50 points of the document on the common market presented by the Commissioner to the centre of European debate in our Parliament, the other institutions, the Member States and the media."
"The document is very important and very specific."
"We all know that the most important issues are peace, democracy and human rights, but for every one of us, what is of more direct relevance is something which makes our everyday lives easier - the common market."
"It is being said that this is our flagship programme."
"However, as Professor Monti said, it is neither a flag nor a ship, but sea and wind."
"It is we who must help our citizens by making those winds and waters favourable to them."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few months after Professor Monti's report, which called for a necessary recovery of the citizen-oriented internal market, I welcome the Commission's response."
"What particularly stands out in my mind is the improved recognition of professional qualifications, aid for SMEs, the new legislation on public contracts and service concessions, and legal certainty for the social economy."
"I therefore welcome this ambition."
"However, I regret that, in the 50 proposals, there is no clear definition of priorities."
"I am worried about the piecemeal strategy of the various Directorates-General and Commissioners and call on Mr Barroso to become more involved in order to avoid contradictory proposals."
"Finally, I deplore the absence of any real commitment on services of general interest given that, for years, we have been asking for protective legislation, which is now possible under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For that reason, Mr Barnier, I am waiting to see the final texts before making my mind up and possibly supporting you in this major challenge for the future of Europe and of all its citizens."
"(ES) Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the communication that you have presented to us."
"I think it is a good initiative in order to continue working to improve the single European market."
"I consider it vital that the 50 proposals that you referred to in your speech be debated."
"I hope that in Parliament, I will be able to play an active role in helping to overcome barriers to e-commerce in Europe."
"Many of the current barriers to e-commerce have already been detected, and there are even specific proposals for overcoming them."
"We could say that we are reliant on political will to resolve those barriers."
"I think that this communication is a good start, and I therefore think we should support it by playing an active role."
"Mr President, thank you for your message."
"I am going to try, without claiming to respond in detail to each one of you."
"I am sure we will have the chance to meet up again."
"I will start my answer with what the first of your speakers, Mr Schwab, said when he pointed out the initial ambition that we should revive and remain faithful to, namely, the social market economy."
"He added, and I agree with him, that we appreciate each of these three words: social market economy."
"This is important, and naturally, the Treaty of Lisbon includes these three words and adds to them the ambition of very strong competitiveness."
"Honourable Members, it is, in fact, ambition that underpins this Single Market Act, a highly competitive social market economy, and to achieve that, our conviction, and my conviction in particular, is that - I repeat - achieving competitiveness and growth requires the help of every citizen, every business and every community."
"This will not just fall into our laps; even though we have laws to make and frameworks to create, it is up to citizens, businesses and communities to seize the chances and opportunities of this internal market."
"That is the ambition."
"Of course, I would say to Mr Schwab and to many others of you that, at the end of this debate, we will definitely have to decide on more important or more specific priorities than the ones that we ourselves have been able to establish, even though we have already identified 29 or 30 main priorities out of 50."
"I would add that there were still many more ideas in Mario Monti's report."
"However, I would also like to state my agreement with what Mr Creutzmann and Mrs Corazza Bildt said earlier on."
"Somewhat echoing the analysis I made earlier on in my speech, they said that we should look at what is happening in many of our countries because of the crisis, because of a lack of understanding, because of this question, 'What does the market offer us?', which is met with the response, 'Not a great deal'."
"This is creating a sense of fear and incomprehension and, behind all this, we are seeing a rise in populism and protectionism."
"Indeed, the first victim of protectionism would be the single market."
"That is why we must, through action, through dynamism, through initiatives, oppose these protectionist attempts and temptations."
"Mr Harbour indicated that this was a new commitment."
"Mr President, in my hearing on 13 January, I remember specifically saying that, for the five years that we were going to spend together, I would undertake to reconcile, along with some of my colleagues - because I am not the only Commissioner, there are probably 15 or 16 Commissioners who inherited a rather large proportion of the legislation - 1 500 texts which need to be applied and applied intelligently to the market."
"One thousand five hundred texts!"
"However, Mr Harbour, I did mention that I intended to work to reconcile citizens and businesses with this internal market, and you are right to stress the opportunity we can give ourselves with this debate and with the Commission's proposals on a comprehensive and holistic action plan, to repeat Mr Grech's encouraging words."
"Mr Harbour mentioned the growth of competitiveness."
"You will find in this Single Market Act many practical proposals that we will be working on in the legal and tax environment for businesses and, in particular, for small businesses, the review of the accounting directives in 2011, a common consolidated tax base for corporate tax - my colleague, Mr Šemeta, is working on that - new strategies for VAT, and the interconnection of business registers."
"Those are a number of practical proposals to simplify the regulatory, fiscal and financial environment of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In addition to that, there is the digital agenda, on which I am working with my colleague, Neelie Kroes, who is working with great determination."
"There is also the retail sector and many other ideas that Mrs Handzlik touched upon earlier."
"I would like to say something more specific about the issues relating to the social dimension, to which I am also committed."
"Mr Triantaphyllides and Mr Hughes mentioned them at the very start of your discussion, as did Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Turunen."
"Mrs Turunen, we have had debates on this subject and adopted positions that, I might add, are not necessarily the ones reported in the newspapers."
"In my opinion, such a debate within the College is normal, absolutely normal."
"In fact, the opposite would be abnormal."
"For there are 27 of us with different views, traditions and nationalities, and by working all together, we are united in these proposals."
"We are working to find the centre of gravity of the European general interest for proposals that will subsequently be debated by you here in Parliament and in the Council of Ministers, so that they can be supplemented or improved."
"We have therefore had debates, which is normal, in order to strike the right balance between the economic freedoms laid down by the treaty, freedom of movement and the legitimate freedoms and rights of the social partners, particularly with respect to collective actions."
"I think it is only right that employees, just like businesses, have a clear and reliable framework in which to work."
"This will therefore be the spirit in which the Commission's measures are coordinated."
"We will ensure, on the basis of the new strategy for implementing the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that the rights guaranteed by the Charter, including the right to bring collective actions, are taken into account."
"The Commission will implement to the letter the horizontal social clause laid down in Article 9 of the treaty by carrying out a prior in-depth analysis of the social impact of all these legislative proposals on the single market."
"In any case, I remain in favour of inserting, where necessary, a provision specifying how collective rights will be guaranteed in the context of the new legislation."
"In other words, this will involve assessing, for each individual case, the need for such a clause."
"This is a subject which we are going to debate with you over the next few months in order to, if possible, further improve the Commission's proposals."
"This will also be the case, Mrs Vergnaud and Mrs Auconie, for the quality framework which President Barroso has committed himself to regarding services of general interest."
"I would also like to tell Mr Grech that the proposals on consumers are yet to be completed; we are working on this with Mr Dalli."
"You are right, Mr Grech, to warn against the fragility of the internal market: nothing is set in stone."
"That is why we need this ownership, this support from citizens, to consolidate this internal market in a lasting way, because it is an opportunity; it should be an area of opportunity much more than an area of constraint."
"Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Tarabella, you touched on collective redress."
"We will not abandon this issue."
"It deserves to be genuinely explored, as a number of debates, here in Parliament and also in the Commission, have shown."
"My three colleagues Mr Dalli, Mrs Reding and Mr Almunia, are working on this, and they will draw conclusions from the consultation that we have just launched on the introduction of collective redress when the time is right, and as soon as possible."
"I would also like to say to Mrs Comi that I agree with her on the link that we must establish between the Single Market Act and Mr Tajani's communication on industrial policy."
"We are working on this together, particularly in the area of standardisation."
"Mr Salvini mentioned the regions and his own region in particular."
"However, I should like to express my firm belief that you should take the debate that we are starting here, as normal, to the regions."
"I am going to send this document in the 23 languages of the Union to every national elected representative, in every single one of your countries."
"We are going to send it to the regions, to the unions, and to the professional and business organisations, so that this debate is as decentralised as possible."
"Whilst listening to Mr Salvini, I also cast my mind back to a major commitment made by the then President Delors, at the very time when the single market was being created."
"It was a commitment to cohesion policy, of which I remain a long-term advocate, in order to prevent any regional disparities in this internal market."
"These things therefore go together."
"Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein mentioned this debate; she is attached to it, and particularly to the forum idea, which we owe to her."
"Every year, we will organise this forum on the internal market and update the top 20, that is to say, the twenty areas in which real progress has been made."
"I hope that we will not have the same ones again and again for five years, that they will change, and that we will be able to eliminate some and make progress, but in any event, we will organise this forum."
"I would also like to echo what Mr Abad said about the external dimension."
"Without a doubt, we have to be strong within and strong to set out to conquer other markets, to meet other needs in the rest of the world, without being naive, and with a desire for openness and reciprocity."
"My colleague, Mr De Gucht, also said some very powerful things yesterday, which I agree with, in relation to this requirement for reciprocity that we should have in our dealings with the European Union's major partner regions and countries."
"Finally, a word to echo what Mr Kožušník said earlier on, when he asked us to be brave."
"Yes, Mr Kožušník, I will lead this debate with all the strength I have, but I cannot lead it on my own, everywhere, in every single country."
"I will lead it tomorrow in your country, since we will be in Prague together, and I will lead it to the best of my abilities in all the countries."
"We cannot succeed on our own; this is about working together."
"The 13 Commissioners who will commit themselves in February to delivering these proposals, will also take part with us, as will all the others."
"Parliament, the regions, the economic and social partners, and national elected representatives must get involved in this debate."
"This document is not something you can take or leave, ladies and gentlemen."
"It can still be improved."
"We are of the mind that we can improve it, prioritise it and, above all, deliver it with you, because we urgently need to restore growth and competitiveness along with citizens and businesses."
"The debate is closed."
"1."
"There has been an impressive effort at bringing together 1 500 pieces of scattered legislation."
"2."
"The communication gives an overview of the 50 instruments to build the single market, which have, up to now, been used in an unfocused and fragmented way."
"This is the first time that we are aware of all the means at our disposal."
"3."
"Acquired experience should determine the future."
"Some measures have been very successful, while others are still halfway through or even at the very beginning."
"Others can be seen to have failed when they are compared with their objectives."
"More than ever, we can now use what in science is called a 'natural experiment'."
"4."
"We cannot complain of a lack of technological resources; e-commerce, e-procurement and everything regarding the Digital Agenda for Europe and the Digital Single Market are tools that are being increasingly used."
"The technology exists, and so does the need for it."
"Only the initiative is missing."
"5."
"This case is unique: the Europe 2020 strategy, with indicators and targets."
"It must be used well."
"The crisis is becoming more severe, and the strengthening of the internal market can help towards the solution."
"6."
"This is a very ambitious project."
"Is the Commission prepared to make the most of this momentum?"
"Is it prepared to acknowledge that this project should go ahead as it is, without straggling appendages?"
"The terms in which Commissioner Barnier launched this debate are illuminating and enlightening, from various points of view."
"At the end of the day, the market is, in fact, the principal reason and the ultimate goal for the process of European integration, as he made a point of reminding us."
"This vision, which was expressed here in such a forthright and clear way, is quite revealing of the capitalist nature of this process of integration, which the Treaty of Lisbon has institutionalised and strengthened."
"At a time when Europeans are really suffering the effects of the capitalist crisis, which the EU and its policies helped to create, the Commission comes here to present a continuation along the same path that brought us into this predicament as a solution to the crisis."
"The strengthening of the internal market, ensuring larger profits for the big economic and financial groups of the European powers, is at the root of the growing inequalities within the EU, between states and within each state."
"It is leading to the continued weakening of the most vulnerable economies, to the privatisation of key sectors of the economy, to the commodification of ever more areas of social life, and to the attack on public services."
"'Business as usual' is the prevailing watchword in the EU."
"'Cohesion' is increasingly becoming a mere slogan, without any practical meaning."
"The European Commission communication 'Towards a Single Market Act', drafted on the basis of Professor Monti's report, is an extremely important document which sets out the measures to be taken by the EU in the field of the internal market for the next dozen or so years."
"Among the initiatives presented by the Commission, I wish to draw particular attention to those related to the creation of a 'digital' internal market, since I believe that this is the future of the European economy."
"Without wishing to belittle the Commission's good intentions, I have the impression that it has concentrated more on the 'protection' of creativity than on removing barriers to the development of commercial services on the Internet."
"An example of this is the number of planned legal projects."
"The communication contains no fewer than 50 initiatives involving the internal market in its broadest sense, yet I failed to find any mention of a subject upon which I have been working for several years, and which is related to the creation of uniform conditions for access to media services in the common market."
"I am talking about the EU-wide promotion of subtitles for television programmes, which make it significantly easier for deaf people to access the media, as well as making it easier for people to learn foreign languages."
"I hope that the European Commission will turn its attention to this subject in the near future."
"The fact is, the Single Market Act is a revolution."
"It is this Commission's most tangible work programme."
"It is our third large project after the introduction of the euro and the enlargement of the EU."
"We need more dynamism, decisiveness, courage and European-mindedness in order to be able to implement the 50 proposals."
"The single market must become the domestic market of 500 million people, because it represents our potential for growth, employment and competitiveness."
"Many treasures are yet to be unearthed."
"The single market will also make the so-called net contributors, such as Austria and Germany, into large net receivers."
"Utilising the potential means freeing the single market from its chains, overcoming protectionism and nationalism and choosing to perceive the EU as a continent."
"Whether this will succeed is primarily up to us politicians."
"So, let us get on with the work!"
"We can all agree with the intention of the European Commission to achieve a competitive social market economy."
"The Commission's reports contain specific proposals on strengthening the single market."
"We trust that they will be implemented."
"According to Commissioner Barnier, we need to take advantage of single market opportunities that have not been exploited so far."
"Indeed, many achievements can be listed which have simplified our life within the EU."
"However, the changes taking place in the world demand further measures."
"The single market can be made even more unified."
"I value the notion that the markets must serve both the economy and the citizens of the EU at one and the same time."
"The rights of citizens and economic issues are dealt with in separate documents."
"Hopefully, the reason for this is to balance these two poles of the market."
"The EU's role as initiator and coordinator in strengthening the single market is indisputable."
"However, without the Member States' commitment to implementation, we will have to wait for a long time for a good social system, high education standards and competitive jobs."
"Although some question the importance of open consultation, I believe that all stakeholders should have an opportunity to express their opinion."
"Similarly, I believe that the initiative to debate matters concerning the single market in the framework of an annual forum is a positive one."
"The participants of this debate are logically the institutions, Member States, enterprises and citizens, in other words, all those involved in the single market."
"The forum will also help raise awareness of the single market being part of our everyday lives."
"I fully support the content and timescales of the Small Business Act."
"The single market is the most integrated form of the common market, since it is focused more on removing barriers - physical barriers (borders), technical barriers (standards) and fiscal barriers - between Member States."
"This is the key to integration and sustainable growth in Europe."
"The current economic crisis has once again underlined the importance of the single market when it comes to making a success of the European project."
"We also call for a renewed political will to resist the temptations of economic nationalism and to exploit everyone's full potential."
"The crisis has increased the risk of misuse of State aid that is designed to help the most important national firms."
"The solution to the problem of reviving the entire European economy instead entails (and this is the single market solution) removing the persistent obstacles to the free movement of goods, persons and services, and to equal treatment of economic operators and citizens throughout the EU."
"The Single Market Act is an initiative which I strongly welcome and support."
"However, I would like to mention a problem that I sense here, and not a marginal one."
"It is about the long-term communications strategy not only for this document, but for the single market in general."
"In point 48 of the report, the Commission states that it has enhanced consultation and dialogue with civil society, while particular attention will be given to ensuring that the views of consumers are taken into account."
"If the Commission does indeed stand for the views of ordinary consumers, it must do much more than before to promote this report in the media."
"For example, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the introduction of this fundamental document is unfortunately completely absent from the media."
"It seems that here, it is not a topic worthy of attention."
"The information campaign on the benefits of the single internal market should therefore not take place only at the level of the European institutions, but should be more decentralised at both national and regional levels."
"The focus should mainly be on the benefits offered by the single market and on the resolution of the everyday problems of consumers in the internal market, such as, for example, bank charges, comparison of the prices of goods, and so on. I would therefore call on the Commission to improve its communications strategy towards end users so that citizens will be better informed about the benefits of the single market."
"Innovation partnerships (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council by Judith A. Merkies, on behalf of the S&D Group, Paul Rübig, on behalf of the PPE Group, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Philippe Lamberts and Reinhard Bütikofer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Evžen Tošenovský, on behalf of the ECR Group, and Marisa Matias, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on innovation partnerships - B7-0560/2010)."
"Mr President, 90% of people think that innovation will give us a green, more competitive economy, and we agree."
"However, evidently, the urgency of the matter is not yet quite clear, as the European Council has decided not to discuss the Innovation Union until February and March of next year."
"Why is this?"
"Have the urgent, major societal challenges perhaps all been solved already?"
"Have the energy problem, the raw material problem and the ageing problem been solved already?"
"No, they have not, and that is why we need to deal with and discuss this innovation strategy as a matter of urgency."
"There are plenty of questions."
"What exactly are these Innovation Partnerships?"
"The Commission's innovation strategy is clear, but this question remains open."
"What is clear is that there should be no new - or at least completely new - instruments, but rather better ones."
"Long-term security is important, but we would ideally like a well-functioning instrument with a vision until 2020."
"What is important is that Innovation Partnerships be as tangible and clear as possible, have a real impact, be technologically neutral and close to the market, and have a clear deadline; and that there be involvement by all the important partners and also industry, the government, the research institutes and, above all, citizens, who are the driving force behind innovation and its success."
"It is very good that existing strengths are being built on by means of 'Active and Healthy Ageing' - actually, healthy living rather than healthy ageing - and it would seem that, in fact, healthy ageing begins at conception."
"All the partnerships must be characterised by an efficient and intelligent approach to natural resources, and must start with the most urgent problems: energy and the depletion of raw materials."
"More innovation is needed in this regard."
"This requires the full commitment of the Council and it requires enthusiasm; both are needed to make the innovation strategy work."
"Retreating behind the borders is not an option."
"Economics is really not just about the euro, the banking sector or the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is about jobs in Europe and a better position for Europe in the world, and how should this be carried out if not by means of innovation?"
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal in the 'Innovation Union' policy document, adopted on 6 October 2009, is an integral part of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The initiative aims to provide a robust, effective and sustainable response to the main problems in our society."
"Among the many actions proposed and the various objectives the Commission has set itself in the attempt to bring about a real Innovation Union, one of the most innovative elements is represented by the so-called 'Innovation Partnerships'."
"In order to reach the stated objectives, the right partnerships must be chosen."
"To this end, the Commission has identified a series of priority challenges that our society will have to confront in the coming years and decades."
"With regard to this new development, Parliament has chosen to express its position in the resolution for which I am the rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Following brief negotiations, all the rapporteurs of the various political groups signed a resolution, so there are no problems to note."
"I feel it important to emphasise how much our contribution was fundamental in ensuring that the two partnerships to be launched after the pilot initiative on healthy ageing will both address 'smart cities', so that a number of futuristic experiments can be held in various European cities in order to reach the 20/20/20 objectives and for the purpose of realising the non-energy raw materials strategy, since we need to provide a concrete response to the great and difficult problems that affect society in this field."
"Over the coming months, an internal workgroup at the Commission will decide on the details regarding governance, funding, selection criteria and the budget for the initiatives that will be launched through the first partnership."
"Mr President, what exactly does European innovation policy do?"
"What does European research policy do?"
"If we ask ourselves this question and if we were to ask the citizens on the street, we would just get a blank look."
"This is because it is not clear what added value European research and European innovation brings."
"For that reason, we welcome the fact that Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn's proposal begins by providing a definition of innovation."
"What is innovation?"
"Innovation involves making money, a product or a licence from knowledge."
"That is something new."
"I am pleased that the Commission is going down this path."
"However, we also now need 'man on the moon' or 'woman on the moon' projects which are understood by the man on the street, so that EU taxpayers understand what we are doing here with their money."
"In this regard, I see great potential in the issue of increasing the number of healthy life years by two."
"That would be a project that everyone out there would understand."
"I am therefore pleased that the first innovation partnership proposed is being devoted precisely to achieving this goal."
"Two additional healthy years of life - that will be understood by everyone and it is something we should do."
"In this regard, you have our support."
"However, I would like to point out, and Mrs Merkies has already mentioned this, too, that if we simply look at the instruments that already exist, there is the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs), the so-called Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) - these are all programmes that already exist."
"If we add yet another programme, then we will make the whole area difficult to get to grips with."
"This is something we must not do."
"The innovation partnerships are intended to make a real contribution to bringing order to this situation and combining everything in a single system."
"That is why we will only accept this if it is all made clearer for taxpayers."
"We must always know the answer to the question: what brings more European added value?"
"If that is the case, we will give it our full support."
"The Commission's initiative to create a pilot programme in the context of the Innovation Partnership on the subject of 'Active and Healthy Ageing' is certainly an interesting step by the Commission."
"For me, the fact that the Commission has chosen this pilot project shows how significant the problem of ageing is for the entire European Union."
"As a pilot project, this is a very difficult task, because the methods of providing security for older citizens are very different across the European Union."
"The reasons for this can be found in the different historical developments of individual countries, and the different ways in which they approach this issue."
"It will therefore be interesting for us to see how the Commission can find a truly innovative approach to resolving such a complex problem."
"I hope that the solution will not just remain in the form of a general description, but will be of real help in this area."
"Two further issues concerning Innovation Partnerships emerged from our discussions with colleagues: smart cities and raw materials."
"From the point of view of current perspectives and anticipated problems, there was a lot of justification for such an approach in the area of raw materials."
"Already today, and most likely in the coming years, the Member States will be under great pressure to ensure the supply of raw materials."
"This relates both to energy and to industrial production."
"There is a whole range of problems regarding raw materials, and many Parliamentary committees regularly deal with them."
"Ensuring continuity of supply and finding new sources of raw materials are fundamental conditions for economic growth and for preserving the competitiveness of European countries in the future."
"Of course, this has associated effects on many areas, including the social conditions of citizens living in individual European countries."
"Regulations adjusted in a sensible manner, with an emphasis on economising when it comes to the availability of raw materials, will certainly be very fundamental things in the future."
"We are here today to discuss what has been presented as one of the major priorities for the Commission, namely, innovation policy, which is starting to take shape at last through innovation partnerships and this pilot project on active and healthy ageing, to be discussed here today."
"There are, however, many aspects that remain to be determined, particularly when it comes to clarifying and defining future projects and setting priorities."
"Who will ultimately define the priorities, and on the basis of which criteria?"
"I think that we are due some answers."
"However, I would like to make some specific observations, particularly with regard to this first project on active and healthy ageing, which was the one presented to us."
"These notes, therefore, strike a positive note, as I think it is a positive thing to focus on a sector of the population that is especially vulnerable in a Europe that is increasingly ageing and increasingly disadvantaged."
"I would, however, like to add some more questions to these, as it seems contradictory to me that a project is being presented on this topic when, at the same time, we cannot support this innovation."
"How are we going to support it?"
"What will be the basis for it?"
"Is any innovation feasible in a situation like the one that we have experienced, where there is a persistent and systematic attack on the social state, a reduction in access to healthcare, systematic cuts in services, and continuous disinvestment in this area?"
"The title of the communication that was presented, the 'Innovation Union' for more jobs, better quality of life and a better society, is ambitious."
"I would even say that I would have no problem with subscribing to it personally, but we must admit that it goes against recent practice in the Member States, with their cuts and austerity measures."
"I believe that there can only be sustainable innovation if there are rigorous, sustainable and demanding public policies."
"Otherwise, it will just be a flash in the pan, with little to show for it and little for us to offer the public."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome the opportunity we have been given to have a debate with you on this Innovation Union flagship initiative, and particularly on this new concept of European Innovation Partnerships, which is certainly a key element of the communication that the Commission presented at the beginning of October."
"Of course, at this stage, the Council is still busy examining the issue, and conclusions are being prepared for our Competitiveness Council on 26 November."
"As you will remember, on 17 June, the European Council finalised the Europe 2020 strategy and one of the main targets defined in this context consists, I quote, 'in improving the conditions for research and development', in particular, with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels in this sector to 3% of GDP."
"On a personal level, I think it would have been difficult to imagine doing less than the 3% that is already part of the Lisbon strategy and that it is now a case of giving ourselves the means to meet this target."
"The Innovation Union flagship initiative presented by the Commission follows on from this headline target, and the Belgian Presidency has sought to address this major issue in a timely manner."
"Our Council had a first informal debate on the matter in July, then a formal debate on 12 October, and that debate enabled the Presidency to submit some draft Council conclusions, which are currently being examined and which, as I have already said, are on the agenda of our Competitiveness Council on 25 and 26 November."
"I would emphasise that the Presidency has ensured that the 'research' and 'industry' sectors are working closely together on this subject, and this is producing excellent results - indeed, we held a joint Council in July, which should result in joint conclusions at the end of November."
"Furthermore, the Commission's communication as well as the Competitiveness Council's work will provide material for preparing the debate on research and innovation, which is set to take place at the European Council before the end of the year."
"You will therefore understand that, while awaiting strategic impetus from our Heads of State or Government, as President of the Competitiveness Council, I must exercise some caution in what I say."
"Nevertheless, allow me to point out that the topic of innovation, or rather the knowledge triangle in a wider sense (education-research-innovation), is obviously not entirely new, either for the Council or for Parliament."
"In the Council, this topic regularly appears on the Competitiveness Council's agenda under the general heading of the European Research Area."
"I refer, in particular, to the 2020 Vision for the European Research Area of the December 2008 Council, and to the Council's more recent conclusions entitled 'Creating an innovative Europe', adopted in May under the Spanish Presidency."
"I will also mention, although this is not an exhaustive list, some major lines of action from the Council's point of view."
"First of all, the initiatives should concern all types of innovation in the public and private sectors."
"Secondly, we need to lay the foundations for more effective budget headings for research, development and innovation."
"Thirdly, public procurement has the potential, although this remains largely untapped, to support innovation in the form of innovative products, processes and services."
"Fourthly, non-technological innovations, including in terms of design, services and cultural creativity, are also important factors."
"Fifthly, making use of research efforts requires effective management and protection of intellectual property, as well as effective dissemination of scientific and technological innovations."
"Finally, research and development policies and programmes, and any associated instruments, should be simplified and rationalised, as has been pointed out again today."
"I am pleased to see a very broad convergence of views here with the position of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy as presented in Mrs Carvalho's report."
"Innovation partnerships should not result in additional complexity, but should instead be part of a simplification process."
"The regional dimension is also essential to innovation."
"In this respect, European innovation policy should ensure that those who innovate, including small and medium-sized enterprises, receive appropriate support at regional level too."
"The human factor is at the heart of research and innovation."
"Europe must become better able to retain its researchers and to attract talent from third countries."
"After these general considerations, I would now like to answer the four more specific questions that you have asked."
"With regard to the number of topics for innovation partnerships, although it has not yet reached a decision, our Council appears to be more or less agreed on the fact that we need to start with a pilot scheme."
"Indeed, the Commission has proposed launching this pilot scheme on ageing at the beginning of 2011."
"In addition, the Commission's communication mentions a series of other topics for which it would be prepared to submit proposals in 2011, and some of you have referred to a number of these topics."
"By definition, a pilot scheme can start on an experimental basis and without necessarily waiting for all the conditions to be predefined."
"The selection of topics for future partnerships is one of the main issues that we are discussing within the Council, and in this context, I would mention the initiative, launched by the Council in 2008, for the joint programming of research in Europe in response to major social challenges."
"At the time, criteria that will certainly also be useful in the context of the innovation partnerships had already been laid down: the scale of the challenge at European level, a real commitment from stakeholders, European added value, and the possibility of turning the results of research into benefits for European citizens and for European competitiveness."
"I therefore see a broad convergence between the Council's previous guidelines and the general conditions proposed by the Commission in its communication."
"Furthermore, in the discussions that we have had at this stage, my colleagues have often stressed the need for a bottom-up approach, particularly in order to identify topics, to promote simple and straightforward systems, to meet the need to work with the private sector, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, and to optimise existing financial instruments."
"I now come to the timetable and to the principles of governance that are likely to be the most important and most sensitive issues."
"The keywords will no doubt be 'added value', 'consistency', 'flexibility' and 'straightforwardness'."
"Nowhere should there be mention of a pre-established single model."
"Several initiatives have been taken to hone the concepts, including a seminar organised a few days ago, on 27 October, by the Belgian Presidency in cooperation with Finland and the Commission, and as for the timetable, the notion of urgency is well and truly present in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Consequently, this urgency is also present in the initiatives that derive from it."
"To this end, the Commission has made some ambitious proposals, but our resources are limited, and while remaining ambitious, we must ensure that we can get the process under control and learn lessons in good time."
"I will finish, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with this notion of better governance of partnerships at national level."
"This issue is one of many considerations pertaining to the governance of partnerships, for which there is no pre-established model, even less a single model."
"Objectively different situations from one Member State to the other need to be taken into account."
"All stakeholders from the various Member States also need to be involved: the stakeholders at European, national and regional levels, including the public sector and the private sector."
"Mr President, honourable Members, my conviction is that research and innovation are not an option for Europe, but a necessity if we want a long-term solution that protects our social model and the sustainability of our environment."
"I therefore welcome this Parliament's unfailing concern for these matters and, more particularly, the first speech in this debate on the plan for innovation."
"In my view, your contribution is all the more crucial since the current context is forcing Member States to make difficult choices where I believe it is essential to protect research and innovation as an investment for the future, and I can assure you that I will inform the Council of the content of this debate, and I will remain at your disposal."
"(DE) Mr President, I wanted to ask whether the Council's speaking time is longer later in the evening."
"I think it is rather impolite of the President-in-Office of the Council to speak for twice as long as Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy combined, even though we know that we still have other important points to discuss."
"He could perhaps be a little more concise."
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the huge opportunity afforded by innovation partnerships for the sorely needed economic and social development of the European Union, and to the serious risk which exists, in that incorrect use of this tool could increase the innovation and research divide between the Member States of the European Union still further."
"I refer in particular to the difficult economic conditions prevailing in various Member States of the EU, starting with my country, and I would make the same comment as my honourable friend, Mrs Matias."
"Numerous countries in southern Europe and elsewhere are in dire economic straits, with the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission demanding huge cuts across the board in all state spending, more or less wiping out public investment in research."
"Under such circumstances, there will obviously be massive cutbacks in technological development and innovation, given that they appear to be the last priority in national governments' rescue plans."
"The across-the-board cuts being imposed on these countries, coupled with the brain drain, with specialised workers emigrating, and the under-funding for universities and research centres, mean that the triangle of knowledge we referred to earlier is anything but an isosceles triangle."
"This is being exacerbated by actual circumstances, by the actual performance of European universities."
"For example, according to the Times Higher Education supplement published the other day, 82 of the 200 leading universities in the world are European universities, of which 80 are in the northern countries and just 2 universities are in the south, in Spain."
"I should like to ask the European Commission, the European Union and the European Parliament how they intend to address the emerging divide between the innovative north of Europe and the south of Europe."
"Mr President, it is true that the Commission launched its proposal for an Innovation Union at the same time as its industrial policy proposal, because in order to ensure intelligent and sustainable growth that generates employment and competitiveness, the European Union must certainly improve its capacity to innovate."
"Based on this conviction, our group has taken responsibility for both initiatives."
"As coordinator, I am convinced that, with everyone's cooperation, Parliament will help to find solutions to these new challenges: solutions that maintain a balance between economic, social and environmental issues in order to move towards a greener, more intelligent Europe with greater social cohesion."
"That contribution begins today with this resolution, which indicates, before the Council decides, which subjects should be tackled as a priority, such as innovation cooperation, and also emphasising the fact that its success will depend on our capacity to involve innovating businesses as well as universities and research centres."
"Mr President, Europe has to develop, and innovation is the best route to overcoming the current crisis."
"A significant factor for initiating constructive change is the announcement of an increase in the financing of investment in research and development by 3% of the Union's GDP."
"Besides flexible legal rules for starting businesses, tax incentives and simpler procedures for registering patents, it is financial factors in particular which are going to be the main drivers of development."
"Without external assistance, businesses would not themselves be able to finance expensive research which would take many years to complete."
"There is, however, a certain problem - the money provided from the European Union budget is often not enough on its own, and businesses are forced to invest huge amounts of their own resources."
"This being the case, businesses from Central and Eastern Europe are in a no-win situation."
"Without resources of their own, they cannot obtain money from the state budget, nor are they able to apply for EU money."
"This situation, which can be observed, too, in other areas, is causing an accumulation of resources in the wealthy regions of the European Union and is increasing disproportions in the area of research and development."
"The President of the European Commission has said that 'without solidarity, the European Union would not exist'."
"This, then, explains my question: how does the Commission plan to strengthen innovation in the Union's new Member States?"
"Can they count on greater financial resources, which will allow them to catch up with the Member States of the old Union more quickly?"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the Innovation Union, the European Commission is moving in the right direction."
"I was very pleased to read that the European Commission has agreed to the many demands made in the innovation report of September 2010 which was adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"We are in agreement that the European Union must utilise its potential for innovation much better in future, not least in order to keep pace with countries that are strong in terms of innovation like the United States and Japan, and also with emerging economies like China."
"However, the Innovation Union will only be a success if it is implemented jointly with the Member States and the regions."
"For this purpose, the Commission is planning to use, among other things, the Innovation Partnerships, which we are currently debating and which are the subject of our cross-group question."
"However, in this connection, I would like to warn against creating yet more duplicate structures."
"The idea of the Innovation Partnerships has not yet been completely clearly outlined."
"The statements by the Council have also not helped to provide definitive clarification."
"However, the idea of the Innovation Partnerships has certain similarities to instruments that already exist, such as the technology platforms of the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) within the framework of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology."
"I would like to point out that, in this regard, we absolutely must ensure that synergies are created and utilised and that we take a uniform approach."
"(PT) We welcome the Commission's efforts to put research and innovation at the top of the political agenda."
"We are looking at an integrated strategy to make the European innovation ecosystem more effective and productive in the service of a sustainable economy."
"European innovation partnerships have emerged as an instrument and the major challenges around which they are organised are sufficiently broad not to be controversial."
"However, it remains unclear how the subsidiary priorities will be defined, and also how the preponderance of each discipline within them will be determined."
"How much transparency can be expected in order for stakeholders to participate?"
"How will conflicting interests be arbitrated?"
"What role will the Commission, the Member States and the regions play?"
"How can accountability be ensured within a complex structure?"
"What financial dimension will these partnerships have?"
"Mr President, the Commission and the Council have to ensure excellence in implementation, which is not guaranteed given the mere months of pilot testing scheduled for the first partnership."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to celebrate the fact that there is innovation, attention to innovation, and also partnership, but I would also like to say that we do not know what this thing is that we are talking about."
"We are talking about an initiative, but no one has told us about its content, its formula or its model."
"I would suggest that, first of all, if we want to be efficient, as some fellow Members in this House have said, we review the results of what has happened with the Institutes for European Training and Information (IETIs), the partnerships and the platforms."
"Now that we have had experience with the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, we need to evaluate these things objectively, with external evaluation, looking at the results."
"In the cases of some IETIs, for example, we have seen that they have ended up being dominated by large companies, and once again, small businesses have been left out."
"I would suggest that there be policies and formulas for innovation to see how we can help small businesses to get involved, perhaps sometimes through intermediary bodies that help them to pay for the projects or to carry them out."
"We cannot, however, carry on this way, leaving small businesses out."
"Secondly, we need to consider the need for innovation in administration, in other words, innovation in the management of innovation. This is because the market guides innovation, and administration is not used to following the market, which works much faster."
"We therefore need to do much more capacity building, innovate in capacity building and innovate in administration for research, in order to manage research and help businesses to get to work on this very difficult and complex undertaking for the future."
"Of course, we also need to incorporate the banking system in terms of the risks involved, which should not only be undertaken by the European people."
"(RO) Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits."
"European research must find solutions to the major challenges facing society: an ageing population, climate change, energy supply and energy efficiency, the shortage of raw materials and the sustainability of economic and social development."
"To enable the European Union to develop its innovative capacity, which is vital to its competitiveness, we must develop and correlate innovation policy with the EU's industrial policy."
"It is only by developing production capacity and, by extension, creating jobs across the EU that we will be able to maintain and develop the EU's innovative capacity in the long term."
"At the same time, the impact of innovation on society is dependent on the extent to which the benefit of scientific achievements is spread."
"I believe that, to have a European Union of innovation, we need a new partnership which will support education and citizens' access to the benefits of scientific progress."
"Mr President, a lot has been said about innovation over the last years."
"It has become a symbol of a policy instrument that can fix all our problems, so there are huge expectations and we must deliver."
"However, the time has now come for us to be more pragmatic."
"Without doubt, innovation can play a fundamental role in reinvigorating growth in the European economy, but for this to happen, we need a concrete, strong and joint public-private effort."
"This effort should aim to improve framework conditions and access to funding and to refocus innovation policy."
"But what matters most now is time, and we must move quickly and decisively from ambition to action by identifying and eliminating factors that still hinder innovation in Europe but, first and foremost, by designing effective new policy instruments."
"European innovation partnerships can be such an instrument, and a potentially excellent one."
"We should act urgently to put the first European innovation partnerships into action, and our approach should be 'learning by doing' and using the good practice that exists in Europe."
"Today, innovation is usually born within a well functioning innovation system in which regions play a key role."
"This means that we can accelerate the move towards an innovation-based economy by fully exploiting the potential of current cohesion policy investment in innovation, which is EUR 85 billion, as well as its future post-2013 commitment to smart growth."
"Cohesion policy can make innovation work across all Member States and regions."
"(LT) Innovation policy and the realisation of technological achievements should become a decisive factor not only in implementing the EU 2020 strategy, but also for the future growth and competitiveness of the Union itself."
"The implementation of practically all European Union policy areas, such as increasing energy efficiency, establishing an economy that is less polluting, reducing the negative impact of climate change, and guaranteeing social welfare and job creation, is directly dependent on how effectively innovation policy is implemented."
"Europe needs an integrated innovation policy which will only be successful if effective coordinated cooperation can be ensured at regional, national and European level."
"I believe that the European Innovation Partnership is a major step towards a better coordinated innovation policy that would allow much better results to be achieved in the area of competitiveness, and would contribute to more rapid progress for the whole Community in the future."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time of squeezed public finances, investing in innovation could be Europe's keystone to get out of the crisis."
"In the past, Europe has had a leading role in innovation."
"In fact, many innovations that have changed the world were launched on our continent, such as the mobile telephone."
"Europe's great technological potential and human capital should be exploited to the full through strong coordination between the European Union and the Member States in order to avoid duplication and optimise investments."
"We need to adopt a more strategic and coordinated approach to innovation, for which the technological partnerships are a superb tool."
"I should like to ask the Council what actions it intends to take to make the partnerships more dynamic and how they can become launch pads for the real economy."
"(GA) Mr President, we are undoubtedly facing a great challenge at present and we urgently need to look at new ways of solving all those problems."
"A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of chairing the launch here of the GE Innovation Barometer, within which there was a survey of various stakeholders."
"Two key points emerged: 90% of respondents believe innovation is the main lever to a greater, more competitive and greener economy; 83% of respondents believe that public-private partnerships are essential to develop a more innovative Europe."
"Most people would agree with that, which is why we welcome this discussion."
"On this very day, I hosted a lunch involving Members of the Council, the Commission and MEPs on this very topic of Innovation Partnerships."
"As has been said, they are the key to the future if we want to meet our targets under the 2020 strategy - 3% of GDP and, above all, venture capital, which is vital also."
"(RO) I wish to welcome the Commission's proposal on launching the first European innovation partnership."
"To be able to get all Member States involved in innovation, the EU should take a more active role in directing the flow of investments required to combat the imbalances between Member States in terms of resources supporting infrastructure and management."
"I believe that particular attention must be focused on regional development projects."
"Innovation partnerships should focus on this objective as well."
"Attention must be paid to ensuring a high level of cohesion between EU Structural Funds, public finances in Member States and private contributions."
"(FI) Mr President, innovation has become today's buzzword, as it were: a kind of magic wand."
"We need to remember, however, that it does not provide instant relief for the situation as it is now."
"Getting new inventions to market takes ten years on average and the costs of inventing new products and seeing them through to their final stages have grown considerably."
"This means that we in Europe really need to invest in joint research and the internal market, and not expect results that are too easily come by."
"There will be innovations in time."
"If research is provided with adequate funding and researchers are left alone to get on with it, it will produce results, but it is not a magic wand."
"(PT) The challenge here is that this initiative, the 'Innovation Union', which the Commission says is a flagship initiative, must be more than this; it should not be a flimsy flag for voters to see, but should rather be integrated into a genuine policy of development and social progress, where innovation is an important instrument if it is properly supported, including financially and in essential public policies."
"From the start, the pilot project in the field of active and healthy ageing is a good example of what I mean."
"It will only have a significant effect if it is accompanied by public policies that guarantee access to good quality public healthcare accessible to everyone, decent pensions, social protection, and equipment and support services for the elderly to ensure they have a decent life."
"Without this, the project will be nothing more than a flash in the pan, amidst the neoliberal policies, dubbed austerity measures, which are hindering research and the quality of life for our people, particularly the elderly."
"The question is: what is the Commission going to do to ensure that this initiative is more than a mere flash in the pan?"
"(RO) With the aim of meeting the EU 2020 strategy objectives, a sustainable, intelligent, inclusive economy is achieved through encouraging the field of research and innovation."
"Initiatives in this area must be forthcoming from every level, including as part of cross-border cooperation with other EU regions."
"I wish to stress the importance of a bottom-up approach in innovation."
"It is difficult to turn the innovative solutions produced by educational institutions or companies into a reality due to the lack of information or financial constraints."
"Regional authorities can raise the profile of these 'sleeping innovators', as they have been called, and support them using assistance and partnership programmes, with the help of the cohesion policy."
"Partnerships can be aimed at improving the performance of innovation, strengthening relations between initiators and beneficiaries, as well as at promoting good practice in this area."
"During the visit made by the Committee on Regional Development to Romania last week, we were presented with research and innovation projects devised by educational institutions in the Western Region, which I represent."
"The success of these initiatives is achieved precisely through establishing viable partnerships."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament sincerely for its interest in this issue of innovation."
"Your support is absolutely vital in order to implement this plan for innovation urgently and without delay, so as to better meet internal challenges and to improve our external competitiveness."
"I think the Presidency has been working under strict time constraints, since the Commission's proposal was submitted on 6 October 2010 and we are now preparing our conclusions for the Council meeting of 26 November."
"Everyone is aware that research and innovation are critical, particularly if we are to emerge from the crisis."
"Regarding the choice of partnerships, I have stressed the importance of the first topic as a pilot project aimed at determining the feasibility of the model, and I think that this first pilot project is truly capable of generating public support in Europe, as was said earlier."
"As regards other possible areas, the Commission mentioned a dozen or so others, and the approach within the Council is really one of emphasising the need for an inclusive, bottom-up approach with very clear and very definite assurances from the Council that no duplication, layers of difficulty or additional programmes will be created."
"Certainly not."
"That would run counter to our goal of simplification."
"As far as the budget problem is concerned, we know that research budgets are under pressure; in my opinion, our common priorities should be the North-South gap, which was highlighted earlier, as well as excellence."
"These should be reflected in the synergies between European instruments, particularly between the framework programme and the Structural Funds."
"Finally, we in the Council are, of course, very mindful of the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises are in need of greater support."
"They did not have sufficient access to the previous framework programme and therefore we are doing all we can to simplify matters and provide easier access to financing and framework conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 11 November 2010."
"Strengthening the OSCE: a role for the EU (debate)"
"The next item is the Council statement on strengthening the OSCE and on the role of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of speaking before you on behalf of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton."
"As you know, in three weeks' time, the Heads of State or Government of the 56 participating States of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will convene at a summit in Astana."
"That date - 35 years after the Helsinki Final Act, 20 years after the Charter of Paris, and 11 years after the Istanbul summit - and the chosen location of Kazakhstan testify to the importance of the event."
"The OSCE is seeking a new impetus."
"Some have doubted the organisation's relevance."
"Disputes between participating States, its inability to overcome the last vestiges of the post-Cold War period, and the frozen conflicts have gradually paralysed it, undermining its credibility."
"The appeal launched in June 2008 by President Medvedev, calling for the European security architecture to be reviewed and based on a treaty, not only received a positive response, but also revitalised the dialogue within the OSCE and initiated the Corfu Process."
"The debates that are rooted in the OSCE, without excluding other relevant security forums, have helped restore confidence."
"The European Union and its Member States have played a central role in this regard, and that role has also been highlighted and supported by Mr Rouček's motion for a resolution."
"The review conference, the last phase of which will take place in Astana, has served as a basis on which to structure the next summit."
"Our representatives in Vienna are currently negotiating the final document, which they will submit to the various Heads of State or Government."
"This document will consist of three parts: firstly, a reaffirmation of the OSCE's principles, rules and commitments; secondly, the shared challenges we face, and our priorities; and finally, a vital aspect for the European Union: an action plan."
"The final document must be clear enough to be understood by all our fellow citizens."
"The European Union's aim, in which it is joined by other participating states, is to re-establish the OSCE as a security community encompassing the vast Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian region; a community that is united, with no dividing lines, whose citizens live in freedom and peace, where disputes are resolved peacefully and where the shared principles, standards and commitments that form the OSCE acquis are respected."
"This is the goal that the summit must set, the mandate it must deliver - and the Action Plan is the road map by which to achieve this."
"As this motion for a resolution highlights, in order to safeguard the global, cooperative concept of security that characterises the OSCE and also makes it unique, the Action Plan must strike a balance between the three dimensions."
"The EU will ensure that the Action Plan reflects the priorities outlined by the Foreign Affairs Ministers at their June 2010 meeting in all three dimensions."
"As regards the political-military dimension, encouraging progress has been made in the discussions regarding the Vienna Document on confidence and security building measures."
"Some progress can be attributed to the summit."
"As regards the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), it is imperative for its viability to be restored."
"Negotiations are well under way, and it is up to the Heads of State or Government to provide the impetus needed for them to continue."
"The OSCE's capabilities in all three dimensions must be strengthened so as to enable it to better fulfil its early warning, conflict prevention, crisis resolution and reconstruction role."
"The concrete proposals put forward by the Union and its partners are on the table."
"Creating a security community means resolving the problematic issue of the conflicts in Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh and Georgia, which are still threatening to flare up, as the events of 2008 demonstrated."
"The lack of progress is undermining confidence, and the summit must provide an opportunity to make a common political commitment to resolve these conflicts, intensify efforts in that direction, and consolidate that commitment with a road map."
"Once that issue has been resolved, the OSCE must look to the future and combine its efforts with the other relevant international organisations in order to counter new transnational threats."
"Those threats are familiar enough for me not to have to list them here, and the European Union also hopes that the issue of energy security will be addressed within the sphere of conflict resolution."
"Within the OSCE, fresh impetus must be given to the economic and environmental dimension; there must be a greater commitment to good governance and transparency; and the response to the security challenge posed by energy supply in the context of climate change must be more certain."
"Human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law are the bedrock of the values and principles on which the security community will be based."
"Restating their validity is not enough."
"It is vital to strengthen them and consolidate their implementation."
"The Heads of State or Government will be presented with possible ways forward in this area: more effective review and implementation of commitments, and better monitoring of recommendations by OSCE institutions."
"For the European Union, the human dimension is of particular importance: it is the basis of 'coexistence' for citizens and Member States alike."
"The Union's focus is on increasing the freedom of the press and on the importance of free and democratic elections in the OSCE area."
"The role of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights should be strengthened in this regard, and its autonomy preserved."
"The resources needed to strengthen the High Representative's work to promote freedom of the media must also be guaranteed."
"Mr President, we have information from the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and, on the other hand, we also have the resolution drafted by Mr Rouček, in which it says that the Corfu Process has brought new energy into the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which Mr Chastel, speaking on behalf of the High Representative, has also confirmed in his statement."
"I would like to say that the OSCE is, and can continue to be, a very important institution in terms of solving regional conflicts, addressing issues related to national minorities and supporting the process of democratisation in Member States."
"We should also maintain a balance across the OSCE's three dimensions - the political-military dimension, the economic and environmental dimension and the human dimension."
"The traditional understanding of security in terms of what is called 'hard power', which concerns ensuring security by the presence of military forces or stabilising forces, is just as important as security in economic, social, food or ecological terms."
"The OSCE should place greater emphasis on action in these areas."
"I would like, here, to stress the role being played in the field of democratisation by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, to which reference has, indeed, been made, for example, its role in observing elections and making recommendations in reports."
"The OSCE will play a greater role precisely when we strengthen it, for example, by giving greater support to the ODIHR."
"I would also like to stress that the positive role of the OSCE does not end with its work as a mediator, but is also to be seen where it directs its own activities."
"The OSCE also brings us closer to the states which hold the rotating chairmanship."
"I will mention, for example, the current chairmanship, which is held by Kazakhstan and which has led, among others, to a resolution of the crisis in Kyrgyzstan and also to mediation between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan."
"We do, however, realise there is a deficit regarding respect for human rights in Kazakhstan, something which is being reported, among others, by organisations which monitor human rights."
"The summit due to take place in Astana in December should adopt an action plan which will lead to the finalising of a charter for a security community in the OSCE area."
"Such a plan is also in the interests of the Member States of the European Union."
"I would like to express strong support, both for the position which has been presented, and for the resolution submitted by Mr Rouček."
"This year marks the 35th anniversary of the Helsinki conference's final act."
"The Helsinki Process has contributed to important historical changes in Europe."
"A continent which was formerly divided by the Second World War and the Cold War now lives in peace and cooperation."
"Citizens of most countries behind the former Iron Curtain fully enjoy their human, civil and democratic rights and freedoms."
"Despite this, however, not all the objectives of the Helsinki Process have been fully achieved."
"In many regions, there are still conflicts between neighbours and ethnic groups."
"Many countries have problems with the introduction of civil rights and democracy."
"Furthermore, all the Member States of the OSCE are exposed to new challenges and security threats, such as terrorism, organised crime, human trafficking, drug trafficking and energy, environmental and Internet security."
"Thirty-five years after Helsinki, and eleven years after the last summit in Istanbul, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe needs a new impetus, regeneration and reforms."
"An appropriate framework for discussing these reforms is provided by the Corfu Process and its culmination in the forthcoming December summit in Astana."
"In its resolution, which we will be voting on tomorrow, the European Parliament has put together a series of proposals and suggestions for this summit."
"We propose, for example, that a specific plan should be discussed and adopted at the summit concerning conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict reconstruction, as well as an action plan which would outline ways to approach the creation of a Charter for the Security Sector within the OSCE."
"The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as has already been said, is a unique and integral part of the Euro-Atlantic and Euro-Asian security structure with a broad membership base uniting countries from Vancouver to Vladivostok."
"The uniqueness of this organisation lies in the fact that it links the political and military, economic and environmental, and human rights dimensions of cooperation."
"The European Union and its common foreign and security policy, strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon, should expand cooperation between the two organisations, because only through such cooperation can common objectives be achieved."
"Mr President, the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe was historically significant, and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe today is a necessary and acknowledged organisation for cooperation."
"Nowadays, the OSCE is frequently the organisation permitted to enter regions in crisis, where others are not allowed in."
"The OSCE is therefore absolutely important, for example, in central Asia, whether it has to do with supporting the work of the police, drug prevention or improved border security."
"The OSCE's humanitarian basket, in particular, is unique."
"Within its scope, the organisation has developed models for human rights work, action to combat people smuggling, and capacity building in fragile states."
"The EU, for its part, has focused more and more on police operations and the use of paramilitary carabineers in them."
"The EU certainly has a very robust development aid policy."
"The OSCE has also been able to establish a recognised link between the environment and security in development policy."
"The EU needs to learn from this but, above all, the EU's own operations could learn from those of the OSCE."
"In general, the OSCE is there a lot earlier on, because it has more experience, skill and very experienced experts."
"It is just as strong as the Member States want it to be."
"Cooperation between the OSCE and the EU, mutual respect for one another and mutual recognition are all very important."
"Mr President, Mr Chastel once said that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is looking for a new dynamism."
"This Parliament would like to help it to find this dynamism."
"This motion for a resolution, which was drawn up under the guidance of the Vice-President, takes - and was indeed carried by a broad majority in Parliament - a very progressive position on the role of the OSCE."
"New momentum has been provided for the OSCE from various sides."
"For example, proposals put forward by the Vice-President of the United States have made a very positive contribution."
"However, we now need a clear definition of the goals of the Corfu Process."
"That is important for the forthcoming summit."
"All three dimensions of the OSCE should be enhanced, particularly the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights."
"However, we also want to take new measures."
"That is what is valuable about this motion for a resolution."
"For example, it raises the question of whether it should be possible for the European Union to take on OSCE-mandated missions in future within the framework of the common security and defence policy."
"For example, in the case of Kyrgyzstan, it would have been very beneficial if we had had this kind of option and had been able to do something like this there, together with our Russian partners for example."
"It has also been proposed, for example - and Mr Rouček has already mentioned this - that a goal be set for the Corfu Process to draw up a charter for a security community in the OSCE area."
"That is the right response to moves made by Russia, which considers it necessary to renew discussions on common security in the Euro-Atlantic area."
"I am certain that the OSCE will remain essential for the common Euro-Atlantic security architecture, and I hope that we will also play our part in helping to make it successful."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the OSCE plays an important and growing role in promoting peace and stability on our continent of Europe."
"The fact that America, Canada, Russia and many Central Asian countries are also full members gives the organisation great credibility and breadth - 'from Vancouver to Vladivostok', as the OSCE itself boasts."
"The OSCE is rapidly usurping the Council of Europe as the principal and most relevant forum for discussing democracy - with its ODIHR branch supporting election monitoring - human rights and the rule of law in Europe."
"The OSCE's field missions in countries like Georgia and Moldova are contributing significantly to stabilising societies traumatised by recent disputes and frozen conflicts."
"Kazakhstan's current chairmanship of the OSCE has helped to enhance the organisation's profile and refocus our attention on Central Asia and, in particular, on the issue of security and the fight against international terrorism."
"Undoubtedly, there are many possibilities for developing the EU's relationship with the OSCE."
"However, in fashioning this partnership, I hope the High Representative will give due weight to avoiding duplication of effort and thereby the wasting of taxpayers' money at a time of austerity."
"She should also consider coordinating the OSCE, the EU and particularly the CSDP and NATO within the partnership for peace."
"Lastly, I would suggest that perhaps the two organisations - the Council of Europe and the OSCE - consider amalgamation."
"That might save a lot of money."
"Mr President, my group welcomes the fact that, after several years, the European Parliament is now substantially engaging with the subject of the OSCE and in so doing, is essentially providing a positive response to the question of the relationship of the EU to the OSCE, to the goals, values and mechanisms agreed in Helsinki but, above all, to its current tasks."
"Your report, Mr Vice-President, makes it clear that the European Union and the OSCE are not secret competitors, but partners that can, and must, bring their individual skills and experience to bear in order to solve the complex problems in Europe."
"There are two aspects that I would like to highlight in particular with regard to Astana."
"In Europe, we need a renewed pan-European dialogue on the future of our continent from the point of view of security policy, this continent being larger than the EU and still characterised by major security policy imbalances."
"The Corfu Process brings the prospect of structured debate and should be arranged by the Member States in such a way as to ultimately achieve specific results in the area of disarmament and defence conversion."
"Just as the EU and OSCE need each other in this area, the issues of climate protection and energy supply also require enhanced structured cooperation."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Chastel, ladies and gentlemen, in my speech, I would like to emphasise the key role played by the election observation missions in strengthening our relations with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and also, more generally, in strengthening our external action."
"Guaranteeing respect for civil and political rights is one of the European Union's fundamental values."
"By extension, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process is central to the credibility of the Union's external action."
"Since the OSCE and the European Union both deploy observation missions, they have every interest in cooperating in this area."
"It therefore seems to me that the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) calls for the development of procedures that will allow for close cooperation between the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the EEAS department for election observation missions, thereby avoiding the risk of duplication and strengthening the EU's external action in the OSCE area."
"This cooperation should take place before, during and after the deployment of observers, because a high quality mission is one that is well prepared, operates effectively on the ground and is properly monitored."
"In saying that, I would like to reiterate the importance of the European Parliament in this matter: the fact that directly and democratically elected representatives of the European public are able to observe elections outside EU borders to ensure that they are being held properly is a considerable asset for the Union, and one that we must preserve at all costs."
"Finally, the Charter for European Security recognises the important role of the economic and environmental dimensions."
"Stability and security often depend on them."
"Therefore, it is crucial to highlight the expertise of the OSCE and the European Parliament more effectively in these areas; regular use and development of economic and environmental data are a further guarantee of the success of our shared missions."
"Strengthening election observation missions through greater cooperation between the EU and the OSCE, and by sending us MEPs to the areas in question, will lead to a strengthening of the Union's foreign policy."
"That is how we will really fulfil the objectives laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"(HU) Mr President, I wish to congratulate you on your initiative as we all know that the European Union is the most important and most influential organisation in Europe."
"At the same time, the OSCE and the Council of Europe have such great experience in many fields that if we were to add, for example, the weight of the European Union to the OSCE's experience in handling interethnic conflicts, humanitarian security could be strengthened powerfully in the European Union."
"Where does the OSCE bring an added value?"
"As I have just mentioned, in interethnic conflicts, as it has a High Commissioner on National Minorities, who mediates between the majority and the minority, and who has been involved in the resolution of numerous interethnic conflicts, whereas we know that the European Union has no minority protection system."
"The term 'minority' has only just been included in the preamble of the Treaty of Lisbon, and, as my fellow Members have mentioned frozen conflicts, it should be noted that 90% of these are interethnic conflicts."
"In other words, the Union must build on this experience."
"For instance, it needs to build on the OSCE's very numerous programmes for the Roma minority."
"I should like to recommend these to the Commission and suggest that the OSCE's experience in this field be taken into account when the Commission draws up the comprehensive framework document on Roma strategy."
"Likewise, the OSCE's Copenhagen Document of 1992, which stated a rule for minority autonomies that remains valid to this day, must be taken into account."
"Finally, a word about media freedom."
"Listening to the OSCE official, I notice that when media freedom is restricted, the OSCE official criticises EU Member States far more boldly than the representatives of the Commission."
"This is one of the reasons why I support the institutionalisation of the relations between the EU and the OSCE, as this will further strengthen the European Union, the peace of the EU and its humanitarian security. Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, I very much support what Mr Bütikofer said about the need to ensure balance between the three dimensions, or baskets, of the OSCE."
"I would like especially to mention that we have to defend the human dimension."
"I am very happy that the report takes into account the fact that the Presidency-in-office, Kazakhstan, must be asked to respect the fundamental values and human rights of the OSCE in advance of the Astana summit."
"We know that the situation there is far from satisfactory."
"There are many serious human rights violations, terrible prison conditions, etc."
"I am also very pleased to see that the report includes the notion that the European Parliament must become more active in the human dimension."
"It is indeed a remarkable achievement that civil society can fully participate, and we must support the parallel event that civil society will organise prior to the Astana summit."
"That summit should not become a mere PR exercise for Kazakhstan."
"(PL) I would like to say that we, as the European Union, should be strengthening cooperation with the OSCE, especially where our interests are involved, such as in Transnistria or in Georgia under the six-point Sarkozy plan."
"This cooperation should also be strengthened, as Mrs Hautala has said, on human rights issues."
"However, it should also be remembered that the European Union is a separate entity, and cooperation with the OSCE should not make us subject to decisions made by the OSCE, whose membership, as you know, is not restricted to European countries."
"Acceptance of full cooperation with the OSCE would be counterproductive for the European Union."
"The cooperation should be close, but we should, nevertheless, maintain the separate nature of these two entities."
"(HU) Since its foundation, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has considered warning and prevention of potential conflicts as its primary task."
"The High Commissioner on National Minorities and the High Commissioner's Office perform special tasks in the organisation's institutional system, aiming to prevent the development of strained majority-minority relations."
"This is what the British call early warning diplomacy."
"Although, within the territory of the European Union, the solution of disputed matters is, first and foremost, guaranteed by EU institutions, in certain cases, an important role devolves to the OSCE."
"One example of this is the Slovakian language law, when the High Commissioner on National Minorities tried to mediate between the parties."
"Sadly, in view of the outcome, this mediation cannot be described as successful."
"The law remains a source of tension as it is discriminatory and contrary to the spirit of numerous international agreements."
"The European Commission for Democracy through Law, better known as the Venice Commission, clearly established this."
"Perhaps we would be closer to a solution today in this matter if the extremely important institution of the OSCE had given early warning of the conflict and had worked more effectively to relieve the tension."
"Mr President, the OSCE, we are told, is about advancing political and media freedom and human rights."
"Mr Chastel, can I ask you then how you reconcile this with giving Kazakhstan the chairmanship of the OSCE this year and the prestige of a major summit in its capital, Astana, in December?"
"Are you aware that political rights in Kazakhstan are cynically repressed, media freedom is obstructed and human rights are routinely crushed?"
"Trade union and social activists are routinely thrown in jail on trumped-up charges."
"On a delegation visit to Kazakhstan in September, I received conclusive evidence of the most brutal treatment in prisons."
"Yet two weeks ago, Commission President Barroso rolled out the red carpet for the man responsible for those atrocities - President Nazarbayev - with not a single word of criticism."
"Why, Mr Chastel?"
"Is it about iron and steel deals?"
"The OSCE summit in Kazakhstan should be cancelled forthwith if you are serious about standing up with the brave fighters for human, democratic, political, workers' and social rights in Kazakhstan."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank you and all the speakers for the quality of this debate."
"I will, of course, pass on your suggestions to Baroness Ashton, particularly those concerning the rationalisation of resources, the use of her new service - the European External Action Service - and cooperation."
"Furthermore, I will not repeat what I said initially in this debate."
"Many have already raised a number of common issues."
"One point in particular was mentioned: the human rights situation in Kazakhstan."
"You are right to highlight this aspect, and several of you have done so this evening."
"This is a very important issue for the EU and we raise it in every single one of our meetings with the Kazakh leaders."
"The need to continue efforts in the areas of political rights, social rights and democratisation was mentioned - contrary to what you seem to be saying - during President Nazarbayev's last visit here."
"I would therefore simply like to conclude by saying that the Astana summit, under Kazakhstan's leadership, offers our highest officials an important opportunity to free Europe from the burdens of the past, to engage in building a security community stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok - as you pointed out, Mr Rouček - and to reflect on the new missions that we must carry out in the 21st century political and security environment."
"We are pleased that Parliament can lend its support to the priorities of the European Union and its representatives."
"We need that clear support in order to emphasise the importance of the dignity of the individual, of organising free and fair elections, of coordinating the efforts against transnational threats, and of achieving harmonious economic and social development within a sustainable environment."
"I hope the political will to write a new chapter in the rich history of the OSCE can materialise in Astana."
"Rest assured that the European Union will assume its responsibilities there."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 11 November 2010, at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, Europe must face up to a new dimension of problems such as terrorism, cyber threats and trafficking in human beings and drugs."
"In order to meet such challenges, we must develop an effective threat detection and conflict resolution system."
"The OSCE is the right place to conduct a wide-ranging debate on the subject of European security."
"It is one of the largest fora for exchanging ideas on international security, which, in the past, has proven that it is capable of taking effective action."
"At the same time, unfortunately, it has been the case recently that OSCE structures have not been commensurate with the needs of the modern world, an example of which is the unresolved conflict in the Caucasus and the inadequate reaction to the Georgian conflict of 2008."
"It is in our common interest to modernise these structures, so that in future, they become a tool for responding rapidly to threats that have arisen."
"The OSCE's capabilities in this field should be strengthened by modifying its old mechanisms of action and creating new ones."
"This is the only way in which the OSCE will be in a position to work effectively towards security in Europe and Eurasia."
"In the interest of security in Europe, we should continue the process we began in 2008 in Corfu."
"With our support, the OSCE can become a significant and effective force for law and order in Europe and Eurasia."
"I welcome the initiative to strengthen cooperation between the EU and the OSCE."
"I welcome the debate on the Rouček report with the prospect of the Astana summit in December, on which we have pinned our hopes of strengthening the OSCE."
"The EU must adopt a clear position with regard to an organisation which can play an important role in regional security and in promoting democratic values and human rights."
"In this context, I feel that two key questions need to be asked."
"The first one concerns strengthening the human aspect of the OSCE."
"Human rights and democracy are of fundamental importance in the post-Lisbon period, with the creation of the European External Action Service offering the chance to devise a comprehensive security concept."
"Secondly, I wish to emphasise that the Corfu Process must focus increased attention on settling unresolved conflicts, an area where the OSCE can provide real added value, compared with other regional organisations of this kind."
"I wish to highlight paragraph 8 of the Rouček report, which enjoyed broad consensus within the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Indeed, the need for a lasting solution to the conflict in Transnistria must be reiterated, with respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova."
"To achieve this, we need to resume quickly, and without any preconditions, the negotiations in the 5 + 2 format."
"Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement - C7-0162/2010 -."
"Commissioner, I would also like to send my regards to your excellent team."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the Union's external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement."
"The proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 that we are discussing today has three objectives: transferring Taiwan to the positive list, transferring other third countries or territories - Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau - to the positive list and the situation of the Northern Mariana Islands."
"The situation of the Northern Mariana Islands does not pose any problems, as its inhabitants are, as you are aware, US citizens."
"With regard to the requests to transfer the third countries that I listed, the Commission finds no justification for removing the visa requirement, and neither do we."
"In the case of Taiwan, this Asian island has experienced commendable democratic, social and economic development."
"Democratic institutions have been firmly established since 1996, when the first direct presidential elections were held."
"The President is the Head of the Government, and is elected by the people of Taiwan via universal suffrage for a four-year term."
"Legislative power currently lies with the Legislative Yuan, which has 113 members."
"Economically, Taiwan's income per head of population is one of the highest in the world at USD 30 100, in July 2010, unemployment stood at 5.2%, way below the European average, which was 10.1% in the same month."
"During the first quarter of 2010, economic growth hit 13.27%, whilst during the first half of 2010, the balance of trade surplus stood at USD 12.1 billion."
"Figures published by the International Monetary Fund in 2009 placed Taiwan's economy 25th in the world, with a gross national product of USD 379 billion."
"It should be pointed out that in 1950, Taiwan was poorer than Ghana, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Until 1960, it was more reliant on commodities exports than countries like Kenya, South Africa and Lebanon."
"Today, however, products manufactured in Taiwan account for more than 97% of the country's exports."
"All this has meant that Taiwan's net migration rate stands at just 0.15%."
"For this reason, it is very unlikely that we will have to deal with any illegal immigrants from Taiwan."
"According to data supplied by the Commission, in 2006-2008, only 45 illegal immigrants throughout the entire European Union were found to have come from Taiwan."
"As far as the security of travel documents is concerned, I would like to point out that Taiwanese electronic passports meet all the anti-counterfeiting standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"The situation of dispersed Taiwanese should be looked at closely, as even if they have passports issued by the authorities, they need prior authorisation to enter Taiwan."
"For this reason, it would seem logical for the European Union to maintain a similar approach regarding those people, as my report proposes."
"Currently, Taiwan does not require visas from the majority of the Member States, except for Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria."
"The Taiwanese authorities have nevertheless undertaken to ensure that a visa waiver is in place for nationals of those countries by 11 November, in other words, tomorrow."
"This is a formal commitment of which the Presidency of the Council, the European Commission and Parliament have been notified, along with the permanent representations of the countries concerned."
"For this reason, Mr President, and for other reasons which I shall mention in my second speech, it is worth us granting the visa exemption to Taiwan, as the United Kingdom and Ireland did last year."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Mr President, I welcome Mr Díaz de Mera's report."
"After decades of tension, the political climate between the present Taiwanese Government and the People's Republic of China is positive."
"There are direct flights between the two and an economic cooperation framework agreement is already in force."
"Relations between Taiwan and the European Union are also experiencing a positive trend: trade turnover and academic and business exchanges are high."
"Education, democratic governance and income in Taiwan are at the level of Japan and South Korea."
"Based on this and other positive trends, the AFET Committee supports Mr Díaz de Mera's report in favour of lifting the visa requirement for Taiwan."
"As the report says, we expect that, before the measures enter into force, Taiwan will lift the visa requirement for all 27 Member States as well."
"It should be recalled that visa regimes - and any consular or private law regimes - do not prejudice any position on the status of territories under public international law."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the proposal to transfer Taiwan to the positive visa list was adopted by the Commission on 5 July this year."
"Taiwan is, as we all know, a well-developed and stable democracy."
"It meets all the necessary technical requirements."
"The proposal is a result of a periodic review of the visa list and based on suggestions coming from Member States."
"The Commission assesses a variety of conditions: irregular migration, public policy, public security, reciprocity, regional coherence and the external relations of the European Union."
"We need to reinforce regional coherence in south-eastern Asia."
"Other similar developed third countries, such as Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea and Singapore, are already visa-free."
"In addition, a process has unarguably been set in motion regarding relations between Taiwan and mainland China, which is also proven by the establishment of direct flights and the conclusion of an economic cooperation framework agreement between them."
"As was said by the rapporteur and Mr Kovatchev, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and South Korea have already granted visa-free travel to Taiwanese citizens, and Canada is currently in the process of exempting Taiwan from the visa obligation."
"Any visa waiver granted to the citizens of Taiwan should, of course, be reciprocated."
"Taiwan has progressively eliminated visa requirements for nationals of a large majority of EU Member States, and has committed itself to granting a full visa regime for all EU citizens."
"Romanian, Bulgarian and Cypriot citizens will be free to travel to Taiwan without a visa as from 11 November - which is tomorrow, so you can book your tickets!"
"Furthermore, Taiwan will extend the allowed period for EU citizens to remain in Taiwan to 90 days on the entry into force of the EU visa waiver."
"The proposal also covers the deletion of the Northern Mariana Islands from the negative list, since the territory forms part of the US."
"Visa freedom and visa liberalisation is a great way of bringing people together, closer to each other: students, researchers, ordinary people, the business community, researchers and others."
"This is a very important decision that we are about to take."
"Procedurally, this is codecision - as you know - but I am glad to inform you that the Council members have already expressed their very broad support for this."
"As I understand, and thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera, and the shadow rapporteurs, there is also very strong support in this Parliament so I hope there will be a good vote tomorrow."
"There was only one amendment to the Commission proposal, proposed both in the Council and in the European Parliament, aiming to exclude the 60 000 so-called Overseas Taiwanese nationals."
"The rapporteur and Member States in the Council were of the view that these people need prior authorisation from Taiwan to enter their own country."
"Therefore, it would be a logical and reasonable step for the EU to exclude this category from the visa waiver."
"The Commission accepts this amendment."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent support and cooperation on this file."
"I am sure that the full reciprocal visa waiver will give a boost to the very good relations between the EU and Taiwan in various sectors, such as tourism and trade, and benefit all parties."
"Mr President, firstly, I, too, must take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur and all my fellow Members who worked on this report."
"They really did a magnificent job."
"The exemption from visa requirements for Taiwan nationals is, of course, a move in the right direction."
"Firstly, that we have overcome the legal obstacle, in terms of the fact that not all the Member States recognise Taiwan, is a positive result."
"Secondly, there is the fact that, on the basis of - one aspect of - mutual recognition, citizens of the Member States of the European Union will not be subject in future to visa requirements on entering Taiwan, in other words, this is like what we do for the 27 Member States and, thirdly, any negative impact on relations between the European Union and China has been avoided."
"At this point, I should like, if I may, to make a more general comment: we all recently witnessed terrorist action, with parcel bombs being sent from Greece to embassies in various cities in the European Union and from Yemen to various Member States."
"Of course, we all felt that our safety was being threatened everywhere in every way."
"So when our fellow citizens in Europe learn that the European Union is making it easier for citizens from third countries, such as Taiwan and other countries we recently approved, to enter the European Union, they logically wonder if that is putting their safety at greater risk."
"Therefore, our response to this needs to be that, whenever we take a decision like this, we have already assessed all these parameters."
"We know full well that we have the mechanisms to deal with any problem and to safeguard our fellow citizens."
"That is precisely why we have taken this decision."
"We have information exchange systems and the facilities to deal with any problems."
"I should like to conclude, therefore, by saying that we are fortunate to have taken this decision and that, under no circumstances, have we compromised the safety of our fellow citizens throughout Europe."
"I would, first of all, like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent job he has done."
"Taiwan can be considered a success story."
"I have just returned from a visit to this island which has already entered into several cooperation agreements with the European Union."
"The EU-27 is the largest investor in Taiwan's rapidly growing economy - this year, economic growth is projected to reach nearly nine per cent and unemployment is less than six per cent."
"Waiving the visa requirement for Taiwan will strengthen economic and political relations with the Union, increase investment and allow mobility for young people and students, in particular."
"As we have heard, China remains the biggest threat to Taiwan, but in recent years, its relations with China have warmed, especially in the economic field."
"Internationally, Taiwan is not generally recognised as a country."
"It has not even been recognised by the EU, although citizens of 24 EU Member States are today already able to travel to this island without a visa, and in the near future, Taiwan will waive visas for Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus, too."
"The Taiwanese Government has taken a series of important passport security measures, which we were able to see for ourselves whilst visiting the office that issues documents."
"The authorities have no problems with illegal immigration or illegal trade in human beings or goods."
"There is no organised crime in the cities and people are generally happy with their lives."
"During the last year, the European Union has waived visas for five countries of the Western Balkans."
"On Monday this week, ministers adopted an important decision for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"This is a very important message, especially for the countries knocking on the EU's door, that they have a clear European future."
"Freedom to travel is a fundamental human right and I firmly believe that is the only right course of action, as Taiwan does not pose a threat to the EU."
"I therefore call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to strongly support the visa waiver tomorrow and enable the people of Taiwan to travel freely."
"Mr President, today we have a list of the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing our external borders."
"There is another list containing those nationals who are exempt from that requirement."
"These lists must, of course, be reviewed regularly and amended depending on the situation in the respective countries."
"Earlier in the autumn, we abolished the visa requirement for the people of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"We will soon be voting on the abolition of the visa requirement for Taiwan, too - a country that has gone through a comprehensive process of democratisation."
"Institutional reforms, a dynamic civil society and greater respect for civil liberties and citizens' rights have resulted in increased stability, including political stability, in Taiwan."
"Moreover, we do not, of course, have a visa requirement for other countries in the region, so this is also an element in the establishment of greater regional consistency."
"Taiwan does not pose a threat to the EU in any way and the abolition of the visa requirement will benefit trade relations with the EU and will also promote closer cooperation with regard to culture and research - important areas for all of us."
"For many years, politicians from Taiwan have had problems travelling to Europe, even as private individuals, because in the countries of Europe, people were afraid to get on the wrong side of China or to end up in a political conflict."
"Things are different now, and I hope that the agreement we are about to conclude will facilitate and improve political relations between the politicians here in the EU and in Taiwan, and will also lead to Taiwan's deeper involvement in the international community, on various levels."
"However, we also stand to gain from an ideological point of view."
"Europe stands for openness, a welcoming spirit and inclusivity."
"Mutual trust involves keeping the doors between our countries open and this will be beneficial and lead to cooperation and, above all, to more pleasant relations between our countries."
"This is something that I welcome with all my heart ahead of this important vote that we are to hold very soon here in the European Parliament."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, Commissioner Malmström was, of course, herself a good friend of Taiwan in her MEP days."
"I am now the President of the Taiwanese Friendship Group in this Parliament."
"I am, of course, delighted on behalf of our group to welcome the fact that Taiwanese citizens will soon be able to enter the Schengen zone without needing a visa - also known in EU jargon terms as a visa liberalisation for Taiwan."
"My country, the UK, and Ireland - both of which are of course outside Schengen - gave Taiwanese citizens visa-free privileges a year and a half ago."
"I can safely say that our experience in Britain, particularly in terms of boosting tourism and bone fide business travel since then, fully indicates that this decision was a good one."
"Taiwan is a thriving, wealthy and modern democracy that shares our values of supporting human rights, peace, security and prosperity in the region."
"We can only benefit from facilitating closer business ties with Taiwan, whose economy is growing again and going from strength to strength, and is increasingly a springboard for European investments into China."
"Europe, of course, is also rapidly catching up with America as a destination of choice for Taiwanese university students and graduates wanting to do research."
"Again, the benefits of these exchanges are substantial in every possible sense."
"This is an important sign of our support and solidarity with Taiwan which, under President Ma's inspired leadership, has sought pragmatic solutions to the international isolation imposed on it by the People's Republic of China."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to express my sincere and earnest thanks to the rapporteur, whose skills and rigour have been put to good use in guaranteeing Member States that granting free passage to Taiwanese nationals and abolishing visas will not cause problems for the European Union."
"I am not so convinced about the latest work regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania."
"Now there is even talk of abolishing visas for Turkey."
"In those situations, I am not convinced that the Commission and Parliament have done their job well, namely: ensuring the safety of European citizens."
"Therefore, I applaud the report and the vote in the European Parliament - which will surely be positive - all the more."
"History is not impermanent."
"People of a certain age remember what it was that what was once called Nationalist China represented for decades: it was a banner of freedom."
"The West must not forget who defended the principles of liberty when they were under threat elsewhere."
"Still now, in terms of human rights, I think a basic distinction must be made."
"The Chinese of Taiwan are therefore also welcome in my home region of Padania."
"The presence of such important and skilled individuals in the region already provides ample illustration of the ability of Taiwanese people to integrate into our society."
"Unlike other countries, Taiwan also has the merit of not exporting socio-political messages against the principles of liberty, the protection of human rights and respect for ethnic and religious minorities to the European Union together with its goods."
"The citizens of Taiwan are therefore welcome in the European Union and in Padania."
"(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it can be stated that the visa system is an effective means for the successful prevention of illegal entry to or illegal stay in European Union Member States."
"When we decide which third country's citizens should be subject to visa requirements, the situation of each country must be examined individually, taking into account illegal immigration, public order and security issues, as well as the EU's external relations, regional consistency and, naturally, the principle of reciprocity."
"The assessment mechanism must work in such a way as to ensure that visa requirements are immediately reinstated for all countries which backtrack on the aforementioned criteria or which introduce visa requirements for the nationals of one or more Member States."
"Unfortunately, practice has shown that the consequences of the removal of visa restrictions in terms of immigration and security always have to be dealt with subsequently by the Member States themselves."
"In my view, this is a matter of security policy and not some kind of gift to be simply handed over to applicant countries."
"It is precisely for this reason that I believe that security guarantees should be requested from all countries before they are given the green light for their citizens to enter the territory of the European Union without a visa."
"(HU) I, too, would like to welcome the fact that the issue of the visa waiver for Taiwan has been placed on Parliament's agenda."
"I believe that we are paying off our debts."
"Partners of the European Union of similar importance have already been granted exemption from the visa requirement and now enjoy visa-free travel."
"Taiwan is the European Union's fourth most important trading partner in Asia and trade in the other direction is of almost equal importance for Taiwan and the European Union."
"We expect that lifting visa restrictions will further strengthen these relations which are already very intense."
"We know that relations are close not only where the economy and trade are concerned, but also in the fields of research, technological development, education and culture, and we can expect visa freedom to strengthen these areas as well."
"The condition we stated, that all 27 Member States of the European Union should enjoy visa exemption, will become a reality this year when visa requirements are lifted for Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania, and I believe this is of great importance."
"I, too, should like to emphasise that the changes that have occurred in Taiwan over the last 50 to 60 years are very important."
"Taiwan has built a democratic institutional system and has transformed itself from a poor country into an economically strong country, so there is no need to fear, as many have mentioned, that the visa waiver would mean any kind of migratory pressure."
"On the contrary, we should have positive expectations in this respect."
"Mr President, I fully support what has been said by our rapporteurs, Mr Díaz de Mera and Mr Kovatchev."
"Taiwan is a developed country with high technical and administrative standards."
"It certainly meets the highest standards of safety and security for control and customs procedures."
"I would therefore like to urge our colleagues to go ahead with the proposal to grant Taiwan its long overdue visa waiver status."
"Taiwan is also a member of the World Trade Organisation as a single customs territory."
"We should not stop here - we should encourage Taiwan's accession to other international organisations as well, such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation or the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"Taiwan is a country that deserves such recognition, as it is an important partner of the European Union in the East Asian region."
"Ties are set to grow, to the advantage of both parties."
"We need to look forward to the intensification of ties with Taiwan in the future."
"One of the possible developments that we should consider is the negotiation of a more comprehensive trade regime with Taiwan, especially now that it has signed the milestone Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement."
"If we move in this direction, the visa-free regime is an essential element in deepening relations between the EU and Taiwan."
"(RO) First of all, I want to congratulate Mr Díaz de Mera for the report he has compiled."
"I am sure that it will probably be voted for unanimously tomorrow."
"However, I would like to talk about how the Commission understands it is going to support the principle of reciprocity in the European Union's relation with third countries."
"Taiwan is going to enjoy a visa waiver for the whole of the European Union and lift the visa requirement as well for Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus."
"This is a positive move."
"On the other hand, the United States, which enjoys a complete visa waiver for the whole of the European Union, refuses to grant reciprocity for Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and Cyprus."
"In addition, an entrance fee has even been introduced for all EU citizens, which is actually a hidden visa."
"Based on the principle of reciprocity and solidarity among Member States, the Commission must shift from a passive stance of accepting a fait accompli to adopting an active role in this process of establishing full reciprocity regarding the visa waiver for all Member States."
"As long as the negotiation of visa treaties comes under the exclusive remit of the European Union and not Member States, the Commission must take every measure possible to resolve these situations."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that there is a consensus in the Chamber and that the report will, in fact, be adopted, probably tomorrow."
"The vote in favour may not be unanimous, but the report will be adopted by an overwhelming majority of votes and with the support of all the political groups."
"I do not want to repeat all the arguments which have been advanced by the rapporteur and the Commissioner."
"Taiwan does, indeed, meet all the conditions, both economic and political, for cooperation to be strengthened and for lifting of the visa requirement to be helpful in this."
"I think we are obliged to do this, because Taiwan has shown that a liberal democracy is possible everywhere, in every cultural setting, and that the transformation which has taken place there has been successful, and I think we should support it."
"Finally, there is another reason, apart from the economic ones."
"There is the reason to which Mr Borghezio has referred - the political reason - which I am not, now, going to explain, but we all understand, too, that it is an important reason and that on this matter, we should support our friends from Taiwan."
"(DE) Mr President, Taiwan is on the positive list."
"In other words, the people of Taiwan are permitted to travel to the European Union without a visa."
"I am pleased for these people."
"However, politics is a question of give and take."
"I would have liked Taiwan, in return, to immediately grant visa-free entry to all citizens of the European Union, too."
"As yet, however, that has not happened."
"Taiwan has merely declared its intention to implement this by the end of the year."
"I hope that this declaration of intent will also be followed by action."
"For the rest, I have confidence in our rapporteur, who has raised the prospect of this, and I will vote in favour of this motion as a whole."
"As I said, I hope that Taiwan will also resolve the problems and thereby also allow all EU citizens to travel to Taiwan without the need for a visa."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to once again thank the rapporteur and the plenary for their support for putting Taiwan on the positive list."
"I can reassure Members who still had some questions that the Commission's methodology for examining countries - including Taiwan - is always very thorough, making sure that all the criteria are fulfilled there before we make such a proposal."
"As always, this has been done very thoroughly."
"I would also like to confirm to the last speaker that the visa requirement will be lifted for the last, remaining countries tomorrow."
"From tomorrow, visa liberalisation will come into effect for the remaining countries, so that there is full reciprocity."
"I think that, after the vote tomorrow, we will be very strong and will also send a strong message."
"We can all rejoice and hope for even better relations between the people of Taiwan and the people of the European Union."
"Thank you very much for a very good debate."
"Mr President, noblesse oblige, so I would like to start by saying that I am infinitely grateful for the support that all fellow Members representing their political groups have given to the report that I have had the honour to present to the House."
"I would also like to thank you for supporting my work."
"It would not, however, be fair if I did not say that the person mainly responsible is Commissioner Malmström, whose support, energy and excellent team have made it possible to drive forward this action, which I would describe as an act of justice."
"There is nothing more to be said, Mr President, except to add that I would also like to congratulate the people of Taiwan, the Taiwanese authorities and, of course, the excellent team of diplomats that Taiwan has in the world, particularly in Brussels."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 11 November 2010, at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance (Rule 150)."
"(PT) The Committee on International Trade is currently assessing the global agreement on bananas reached within the World Trade Organisation."
"Soon, this House will be called on to decide in plenary on the lowering of customs duties on imports of bananas from Latin American countries."
"It should be made quite clear that none of the outermost regions, whether it be Madeira, where I come from, or one of the other eight outermost regions, particularly the Canary Islands, which are by far the worst affected, is against the conclusion of these types of agreements."
"What these regions want, pure and simple, is, on the one hand, that other countries are required to comply with the same hygiene and plant health conditions and respect for workers' rights as they themselves are required to in order to enter the market."
"That is basic justice."
"On the other hand, they want to be fully compensated for the damage caused to them."
"Failing that, they want those in charge to at least have the decency to tell them directly that they will have to change their way of life and look for other work, because it is obvious that they cannot survive in the conditions that lie ahead and will have to abandon their livelihoods."
"It is clear that in these agreements, there are winners and losers."
"Let us take care of the losers - the winners do not need our help."
"(LT) In Europe, there has been a rapid increase in the number of elderly people whose only source of livelihood is their pension."
"People who have worked hard and honestly all their lives, who have brought up children and paid taxes to the state, expect old age to be peaceful and dignified."
"Unfortunately, not all of these legitimate expectations are destined to come true."
"The people of Europe in particular have felt this during the economic crisis."
"While prices have increased, pensions have not, and concern has grown over the security of savings put aside for old age, and there has also been an increase in the number of grandparents who need to support children after they have lost their jobs."
"In some countries, like my country of Lithuania for example, the government is also hurting pensioners, as pensions and benefits have been cut."
"Currently, there is much debate about the Commission's new proposal to consider the possibility of raising the pension age."
"However, I am most concerned by the fact that no solutions are being offered on how to guarantee employment for elderly people."
"With the possibility of delaying retirement, millions of unemployed people under the pensionable age may land in the poverty trap."
"Not enough consideration has been given as to whether people's health will allow them to work longer."
"Furthermore, we must also take into account the fact that women take lower paid work more often than men, and that as a result of childbirth, motherhood and caring for children and disabled family members, they lose insurance guarantees, and ultimately receive smaller pensions."
"Therefore, once they have evaluated the rapid ageing of Europe's population, I call on the Commission and the Council to find other means of ensuring normal living conditions for current and future pensioners."
"(BG) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two events are marked in Bulgaria today, 10 November."
"Twenty-one years ago, the day after the Berlin Wall came down, the Communist regime fell to the sound of the slogans 'Glasnost, freedom, democracy'."
"It is no coincidence that the same date is also celebrated as Freedom of Speech Day in Bulgaria."
"Things have been building up which provide food for thought, both regarding totalitarianism, which I hope has left our country for good, and about another modern scourge - terrorism, which we are seeing ever more frequently."
"Does democracy have mechanisms to counter such attacks?"
"Can we fight terrorism without abandoning democratic principles or restricting human rights and media freedom?"
"The liberal answer is 'yes', but only if we commit regional and national networks to a European system supporting preventive measures, early warning and rapid reaction."
"(ES) Mr President, at the last plenary sitting, I warned that this could happen, and it has happened: the dismantling by force of a Saharan camp in El Aaiun, which has so far left 19 people dead, more than 700 injured and more than 150 missing."
"What are the European Commission and the European governments, led by the Spanish Government, saying?"
"They are calling for calm on both sides; they are saying that it is a very complicated issue, that we should not interfere, and that we must protect European interests in Morocco."
"My response is no, Baroness Ashton; no, Mrs Jiménez; no, Mr Kouchner: repression and murder are not complicated issues."
"They are very clear issues, and the response and position that we must adopt in reaction to them are: outright rejection, condemnation and demanding that the Moroccan regime takes responsibility for this."
"Until this happens, we must cut off bilateral trade and Morocco's privileges in relation to the European Union."
"No more haggling over human rights."
"(PL) Mr President, I am pleased that the Commissioner is still here, and I would like to take advantage of the opportunity because this matter also touches on Mrs Malmström's area of responsibility."
"I know this is being mentioned for the third time, but it is a very serious matter, so I would like to report that during the night of 5 to 6 November, a journalist working for the Russian newspaper Kommersant, Oleg Kashin, was badly beaten outside his home in Moscow - I am sure you know about this, Commissioner."
"He was taken to hospital with broken legs, a shattered jaw, severed fingers and a fractured skull."
"This is not the first case of this kind which has taken place in the countries across our eastern border."
"I read an interview, today, with one of Poland's most outstanding analysts of Russian affairs, and he says that in the last 10 years, 300 journalists have been killed in the Russian Federation."
"This is extremely disturbing, because the issue of freedom of speech and civil liberties is one of the most important things which constitute us as the European Union."
"Therefore, I would ask very strongly that in talks with our Russian friends, we should emphasise, at all times and in every place, that incidents of this kind must not occur, because they make our dialogue together difficult, if not impossible."
"(PT) I would like to draw your attention to the desperate situation in the Western Sahara."
"Thousands of Sahrawis have set up camps on the outskirts of some of the main cities in the territory as a form of protest against the conditions in which they are forced to live and the various forms of repression to which they are subjected, and to call for a referendum that enshrines their right to self-determination."
"The violent action of the Moroccan police and army this week, seeking to dismantle these camps, resulted in an unspecified number of arrests, hundreds injured and missing, and unfortunately also fatalities."
"Besides this action, there is also the demeaning way in which citizens of EU Member States were prevented from visiting the Western Sahara to show their solidarity."
"Those expelled by the Moroccan authorities included a Member of this Parliament, the President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, along with various journalists and members of non-governmental organisations."
"The silence or equivocal statements from the EU and some of its leaders with regard to this situation are shameful and regrettable."
"It is also a silence of complicity with a country that benefits from the advanced status conferred upon it by the EU."
"This silence and complicity are unacceptable, and we wish to strongly denounce them here."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wanted to call the attention of the President of the European Parliament to a judgment made several days ago."
"It is a matter that surely falls under the capacities of the Commissioner, to whom I extend my greetings."
"In my opinion, it is a very serious judgment, because it relativises the content of a very important European Union directive on terrorism."
"In fact, I believe that it is not possible to support an extensive attitude to protecting citizens who request the right of asylum and the right to be recognised as a refugee to those who belong to terrorist organisations."
"If this principle were to become accepted, as it did in this extremely serious decision of the European Court of Justice, we shall give many terrorists the chance to benefit from protection that they do not deserve."
"Too many people have died in Europe as a result of acts of terrorism to allow a situation of this type."
"I therefore urge the Commission to modify the directive so as to avoid extensive and indecent interpretations of the statement that the European Union rightly made in the fight against terrorism."
"Mr President, last month in Strasbourg, this parliament voted through a 5.9% increase in the EU budget."
"This included an extra EUR 2 million for entertainment to support the champagne lifestyle to which this place has become accustomed."
"I found the way in which colleagues applauded themselves to be offensive within the context of an economic crisis."
"Today, the victims of this crisis from my constituency in Britain's West Midlands are making a stand."
"Students and university lecturers have taken their concerns to the streets of London, and whilst I deplore the actions of a few, I applaud the many."
"Students will be hard hit by the austerity package: tuition fees in universities are set to triple, courses have been scrapped, places have been cut and infrastructure will be put under more and more pressure."
"Tomorrow's talent, which we rely on for our future, is being stifled and it is the younger generation that will suffer the most."
"Mr President, let me end with a warning: your arrogance will lead to many more people on the streets, and to many more people protesting against this failed social project."
"Enjoy your champagne, ladies and gentlemen."
"(RO) The Danube summit, which took place on 8 November in Bucharest, was attended by the 14 delegations from the countries participating in the Danube strategy, including the Republic of Moldova, presenting it with an opportunity to move even closer to the European Union."
"The meeting was held at an appropriate time, given that the strategy's instruments of incorporation will be approved by the end of the year and the actual strategy will be implemented in 2011."
"The main success was the commitment made by the European Commission, represented by President Barroso, to support a specific plan, with the provision of EUR 95 billion in funding."
"In addition, it will be possible to attract additional resources from the EIB and EBRD."
"I should remind you that, as a co-initiator of the idea of a European strategy for the Danube region in 2008, Romania has constantly supported the implementation of this initiative."
"Implementing it as soon as possible will help revitalise the social and economic situation of the counties in southern Romania which border the Danube."
"(ES) Mr President, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to express our deep concern regarding the wave of violence that has broken out in Morocco and the Sahara."
"We strongly advocate the prevalence of human rights and regret all the deaths that have taken place, both Moroccan and Saharan."
"The information on the situation is confused."
"Therefore, we welcome the fact that an investigation is going to be opened by Morocco and, of course, we advocate a policy of information transparency."
"The strategic importance of Morocco for Europe requires that the European Union as a body joins the international efforts to facilitate dialogue that several Member States are involved in, including Spain."
"We welcome the fact that, despite the seriousness of the events, dialogue between the parties has so far been maintained and fresh rounds of negotiations are planned."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this conflict is more than 30 years old, and must come to an end as soon as possible with a solution that is mutually acceptable to the parties in the context of the United Nations, which, along with the Moroccan Government, the Saharan people and their representatives, is the only body with the legitimacy to put forward such a solution."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Parliament has made a stand in defence of fundamental human rights, civil liberties and political freedoms on many occasions."
"Therefore, it was with great surprise that I noted the fact that at the previous part-session in Strasbourg, the European Parliament, unfortunately, did not adopt a position on the forthcoming local elections in Ukraine, despite the very serious indications and credible information from reliable sources that numerous improprieties were taking place, with harassment of the opposition and restrictions on the rights of journalists to communicate freely with society in Ukraine, which is governed by the Party of the Regions."
"I am even more surprised by the fact that this decision has once again been deferred and will not be voted on tomorrow."
"This situation is very disturbing and requires an explanation."
"Is it true that some representatives of the European Parliament are talking of the elections, which have now been held, with approval, when both the United States State Department and Mrs Ashton are pointing to numerous improprieties observed during the elections and to the violation of electoral law?"
"This matter needs to be explained."
"(SK) I am pleased that the European Commission, in its strategy for the years 2010 and 2011, yesterday confirmed that a policy of expansion is the best strategy for the Western Balkan region."
"It also confirmed that it would continue to fulfil its commitments to the region, on the understanding that the countries of the region would boost their efforts in the integration process."
"I would like to applaud some of the positive steps over the previous year, for example, the ending of the visa regime for most of the inhabitants of the region, the progress of Montenegro, which has been awarded with a proposal for candidate country status, and the progress in the talks between the European Union and Serbia, which has been recommended for an avis."
"However, challenges remain and they will have to be confronted."
"Among them are the commencement of dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo - which is expected to bring more stability to the region, and a solution as soon as possible to the issue of the name of Macedonia - a process that has already been in progress for a very long time, the question of agreeing on a vision or a new approach with regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the start of visa liberalisation with Kosovo."
"In all of these questions, it is necessary to have a clear strategy and vision that will make it possible for this region to draw closer to the European Union."
"This is not only in their interest, but in ours as well."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 30 years ago, Morocco denied for many years that there was a war with the Sahrawi people and today, it is still denying that there is disproportional repression of these same people."
"Yet, in the Western Sahara, there are dead and wounded people of a population that is only claiming the right to live in freedom in its own land."
"Morocco has largely closed its borders to anyone who could witness these events."
"No information and no members of parliament are allowed in."
"A member of the French parliament and our fellow Member, Mr Meyer, were denied access."
"Europe looks on passively."
"There is no news from the Commission on this matter, which makes us subordinate to United Nations mediation, which continues to fail just as it has done for the past 30 years."
"Baroness Ashton, who is responsible for foreign policy, has not taken a stand on the subject."
"We need to react by Parliament making a stand."
"We need to react against Morocco, curtailing all initiatives on commercial agreements, beginning with the renewal of the fishing agreements."
"(RO) The spotlight has been turned recently on vitally important elements regarding the European Union of innovation."
"I believe that the time has come for us to support measures which allow us to carry out, at European level, the actions described by the Commission's initiative."
"The development of partnerships is vital."
"However, we must not overlook the fact that, during the coming programming period, it is time to initiate the discussions at regional level so that partnerships can be established not only at local and regional level, but at national or transnational level as well."
"Similarly, we can say that the broad debate about the ways to achieve this development in the period ahead must feature on the agenda of every region."
"I consider the dialogue between all the relevant actors as being crucial to identifying the value added in every region and the types of innovative actions in order to utilise them."
"I call on local and regional authorities to get involved in creating partnerships so as to make programming as realistic and close as possible to the regions' needs and aspirations."
"(DE) Mr President, the G20 summit will begin tomorrow in Seoul."
"The topics that will be discussed at this summit include one that is of particular importance: the limitation of exports of rare earths by the People's Republic of China."
"China controls 95% of the extraction of rare earths, which are desperately needed by European industry."
"The sectors most affected are the knowledge-intensive sectors dealing with the development of new technologies."
"The fact that small and medium-sized European enterprises are being put at serious risk as a result of artificial supply bottlenecks is a serious problem."
"The European Economic Area is world renowned for its technological expertise."
"Putting up with interruptions in this area is not acceptable."
"I therefore call on the representatives of the European Union, together with the other states affected, such as the United States and Japan, to speak out against China's trade despotism at the G20 summit."
"A solution must be found to this as quickly as possible."
"(RO) The EU's population is ageing, with the proportion of working people among the total population falling."
"The economic crisis has helped increase the unemployment rate to 10%."
"In this situation, the EU and Member States must adopt measures to ensure the sustainability of their pension systems."
"Pension system reform must offer solutions for guaranteeing retired people minimum incomes providing a decent living."
"In spite of the rise in the population's life expectancy, the solution is not to raise the compulsory age of retirement."
"Elderly people who can and wish to remain active on the labour market can still make a contribution to the development of society without, however, feeling obliged to do so."
"At the same time, due to the economic crisis and the relocation of European industry to third countries, the number of jobs has fallen and people who are able to work, but cannot find a steady job, have problems achieving the minimum period for contributing to public pension systems."
"I wish to point out that raising the retirement age will result in a rise in youth unemployment."
"(SK) Food labelling is a topic which shows that citizens are following what Europe is doing, what it is debating and to what extent it affects them."
"I have a good report that citizens in Slovakia, in the week from 25 to 27 October, not only took an interest in the fact that we adopted the report of my colleague, Renate Sommer, at the first reading, but also created such a powerful synergetic effect that students of Nitra University, the agri-food industry and the media and the wider public got hugely involved in these debates, organising workshops and competitions, while young people got involved in a discussion which was, I must say, given a further boost through the participation of rapporteur Renate Sommer herself, while the three Slovak MEPs also took an active part in the process."
"I only want to show through this that the European Parliament and MEPs can also become involved in interesting topics which affect democracy directly, and that we cannot always criticise what we are talking about here, and that we do not solve problems that are unconnected with the real world."
"In this context, I would also like to applaud the activities of the Office of the European Parliament in Slovakia, which did a great job of organising the event."
"Mr President, I once again wish to draw attention to the case of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani."
"As you may know, she was due to be executed by stoning by the Iranian authorities in July for alleged adultery, but following a resolution here in Parliament, where many people wore 'Free Sakineh' t-shirts, and an international outcry, that sentence was commuted."
"It was commuted but not cancelled."
"Instead, it was changed to execution by hanging for alleged murder."
"This was due to take place on 3 November, but was again postponed, following international petitions for which there were 270 000 online signatures, and interventions from various authorities around the world, especially from the French President, Mr Sarkozy, who made a personal intervention."
"However, the Iranian authorities still intend to continue, and eventually to execute Sakineh."
"I call again on the European authorities to redouble their efforts so that she is freed and that she can gain asylum or freedom in her own country, and to ensure that the state-sponsored murder of women and other human rights violations are ended in Iran."
"That concludes the item."
"Demographic challenge and solidarity between generations (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Thomas Mann, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has sent out an important signal with regard to the issue of demographic change."
"Firstly, a combined package for young and old has been put together."
"It takes a new innovative approach based on justice between the generations."
"We are not thinking in terms of the generations existing alongside each other, but in terms of them coming together."
"In order to give the debate a stable foundation, the Member States should produce generational accounting."
"This will enable reliable models and forecasts of payment flows between the generations to be produced."
"For the statistical offices, it will be easy to calculate how high the tax revenue, social insurance contributions and pension payments are."
"The 'generation check' is intended, firstly, to introduce a statutory impact assessment of the desired effects and the undesired side-effects in connection with the burdening of the generations."
"It is intended to be compulsory in all of our Member States and at EU level."
"We are sending a clear signal to the European Commission and the Council with regard to pensions, too."
"We do not need a uniform European retirement age."
"Instead, the national pensionable ages should be observed."
"Older workers must not be forced to stop working against their will because of an arbitrarily concluded compulsory retirement age."
"The European Court of Justice also clearly rejected enforced retirement as of retirement age in its ruling in October."
"Pensioners are most definitely permitted to apply for vacant positions and must not be placed at a disadvantage on account of their age."
"For older citizens, we are calling for a European fifty-plus employment pact initiative."
"Three aims are to be achieved by 2020."
"Firstly, the percentage of workers over 50 in work is to increase to more than 55%."
"Secondly, early retirement and its financial incentives must be eliminated throughout Europe."
"Thirdly, funds will be made available in the Member States for people over 60 to enable them to remain on the labour market for longer."
"At the other end of the age scale are the young people."
"We are calling for a European Youth Guarantee."
"After a maximum period of four months' unemployment, all young people are to be offered a job, an apprenticeship or other training opportunities."
"The principle of 'supporting and challenging' needs to come into play here."
"However, support is not a one-way street."
"If the young people do not have sufficient qualifications, they are to have the opportunity to obtain them in order to become employable."
"I was very pleased to see that the European Commission has already taken up one of the initiatives called for in my report."
"A few weeks ago, it declared 2012 to be the European Year for Active Ageing."
"That is the right signal at the right time."
"The only fly in the ointment is the decision by a majority in committee to call for additional anti-discrimination regulations."
"Thus, new criteria are to be laid down for older people in connection with concluding insurance policies, booking holidays and hiring cars."
"That will only serve to increase bureaucracy and ensure high financial expenditure that does not do justice to the basic idea of protecting people in an effective manner against exclusion."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has therefore tabled an alternative motion for a resolution which does not contain this demand."
"Otherwise, however, we were in agreement in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"By means of the numerous joint motions and 22 compromises, we achieved a broad consensus."
"I would like to thank my colleagues and my fellow Members from other groups for their constructive cooperation."
"We can, and we will, bring young and old together."
"I hope that, with this report on justice between generations, we have, together, taken an important step forward."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Mann for outlining these very important proposals for us."
"I think the most important thing in terms of the elderly is that we need to change our attitude to retirement and also to work."
"There should ideally be gradual retirement and voluntary retirement rather than compulsory retirement."
"I had a person come to me two weeks ago who said he had retired."
"I asked if he was 65 and he said 'No, if I waited till next year, I would have to go."
"I am going now on my own terms'."
"If he could have gone on to 67 or 70 he would have done so."
"I think that is a very important point that we should take on board."
"Secondly, I think that young people in particular are disadvantaged, and youth in my country, in Ireland, are the most disadvantaged group ever because now they are landed with the big debt resulting from the banking crisis and, despite being highly educated, they have one choice only, to choose their ticket abroad if they want to work; there are no jobs for them at home."
"We need innovation in terms of the way we employ young people."
"I welcome particularly Mr Mann's suggestion that if they are out of work for a number of months, at least some work should be given to them."
"These are very positive proposals and I welcome them."
"(LT) I really want to congratulate the rapporteur, because I definitely agree with many of the provisions set out on addressing the demographic challenge and strengthening solidarity between generations."
"However, as far as elderly people are concerned, I cannot agree with the elimination of the provision on retirement before reaching the normal retirement age."
"Very often, elderly people are forced to take early retirement because of certain circumstances, and often not of their own will."
"However, given the consequences of the economic crisis, the opportunity to take early retirement is often the only chance of survival for elderly people who have been made redundant."
"Therefore, given the fact that national pension systems differ between the Member States, we must take into account the practice in all Member States and not follow the example of one or just a few countries."
"Mr President, can I thank Thomas Mann very much for his work and for the good cooperation in committee."
"I am pleased that so many of my amendments were adopted in committee."
"We have to face the fact that many older people are still treated badly in many Member States and, of course, the worst example of this is elder abuse."
"But there are other ways that older people are treated badly, including age discrimination in the workplace, and that is why I am pleased that in this report, we call for the proper implementation of the 2000 Employment Directive and for older people to be made aware of their rights."
"I am also pleased that my amendment calling for an end to the mandatory retirement age, while, of course, maintaining a fixed pension age set at Member State level, was accepted."
"It is wrong to force older people to stop working if they want to carry on and still have the ability to do that."
"We also need to keep up the pressure on the Council to unblock the horizontal directive on access to goods and services, covering, among other things, age discrimination."
"It is about time older people had the same rights as everyone else."
"May I ask you, please, to vote for the original report and not for the EPP amendment."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Mann, on his excellent report."
"I think that justice between generations is an important characteristic of a developed society."
"Essentially, this merely means that no generation must, or should, live at the expense of another."
"What is logical and self-evident in people's private lives and in the family is harder to represent in society."
"If the state accepts credit that it cannot repay, it is burdening the next generation."
"Anyone who over-exploits raw materials is harming the next generation."
"The saying that we have only borrowed the Earth from our grandchildren is perhaps the best way to bring this conflict home."
"For me, this means that we must examine every act, every regulation and every directive to ensure that they provide for justice between generations."
"In my opinion, this report is an important step in the right direction."
"(CS) The issue of intergenerational solidarity has many different aspects, a situation the rapporteur, Mr Mann, describes well in his document."
"One of the most important things is the question of security in old age and, in particular, the sustainable and stable financing of old age, guaranteeing a decent level of pensions in the long term."
"In this report, therefore, I think there are problems with point 99, in which the rapporteur states, among other things, that it is necessary to replace a continually funded pension system with a system based on capital funds."
"The current crisis also pointed out the dangers inherent in constricting the solvency of some private pension funds, which have been hit hard by a fall in interest rates and a decline in the value of investments."
"In 2008, for example, private pension funds lost more than 20% of their value."
"As a result of the decline in their solvency, they were also forced to sell their assets at a loss."
"Many of them are still languishing on the edge of solvency."
"Capital pension funds cannot be a response to demographic trends."
"They are mainly financial products with non-negligible risks."
"I therefore do not think that it is reasonable to expose such a fundamental social task as ensuring dignity in old age to such risks."
"(SK) Demographic changes gradually and fundamentally alter the structure of the population and the age pyramid."
"The average fertility rate in the European Union is 1.5 children, which is clearly among the lowest in the world."
"As a result of this, we can expect serious problems connected with the demographic ageing of European society."
"One of the causes of this, in my opinion, is that certain structures have seen very limited development, preventing many families from accepting additional members."
"Policies aimed at harmonising work and family life, as well as providing tax relief and other benefits, are an essential precondition for boosting the fertility rate."
"On the other hand, we must adopt legal measures for improving the integration of older people in active life, which must be accompanied by the active elimination of unfair, age-based discrimination in practice."
"I welcome and I fully support the so-called policy of active ageing, the aim of which is to allow people to stay healthy, even at an advanced age, to participate in social life, and to improve the quality not only of their own lives but also the life of society as a whole in a spirit of inter-generational solidarity."
"(RO) The current problem is that young and old people are encountering difficulties in finding a job."
"The task of achieving justice between the generations will therefore be one of the main social challenges facing European and national policy in the coming years."
"I believe that promoting the concept of flexicurity and the EU 2020 strategy objective of achieving an employment rate of 75% marks a major step in this direction."
"In my view, both the European Commission and Council should introduce a census of the generations as a means of providing information."
"It is also necessary to increase the Eurostat sustainable development indicators in absolutely every Member State."
"I would like to end by congratulating Mr Mann because he has successfully identified in his report several extremely attractive solutions. These include the European Youth Guarantee initiative and the Fifty-plus employment pact initiative."
"(RO) In the coming years, in addition to the impact of the crisis, there are numerous other major challenges to be faced."
"One of the biggest of these is demographic change and the subsequent depopulation of certain regions."
"Member States will have a vital role to play in providing conditions ensuring that the impact on citizens is kept to a minimum."
"They will need strong support based on their identified requirements, especially through the use of appropriate EU financing instruments such as the Structural Funds."
"To tackle these challenges which are to come, I believe that particular attention must be focused especially on young people by getting them involved in the life of society."
"We must invest in young people and offer them access to suitable education, followed by the opportunity to acquire a suitable job or encourage them to follow a career path as an entrepreneur."
"This will enable us to ensure social inclusion for young people and, I believe, to combat one of the principal factors causing the declining birth rate and the socio-economic disparities between the generations."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by thanking and congratulating Mr Mann for his very good report."
"It presents a very thorough and comprehensive analysis of the challenges that we are facing in this demographic field."
"The Commission is very pleased that the report highlights strategies to allow Member States and the European Union to prepare for population ageing and how we can cope with these consequences in a better way."
"In your report, you provide a wealth of practical solutions in this respect: the Senior Actions Programme, the European Youth Guarantee, the Fifty-plus employment pack initiative, the Age Management Initiative, the Intergenerational Tandem Initiative, etc."
"As you know, the Commission has already adopted two major initiatives in this area: our Green Paper on pensions, which will be followed next year by a White Paper outlining future activities, and our proposal - based on your proposal, Mr Mann - to designate 2012 as the European Year for Active Ageing."
"The Commission will soon be presenting its third European demography report, which will outline the latest population trends."
"It will also show how the economic crisis has affected the Member States in terms of their ability to prepare for population ageing."
"The next decade will be one of profound demographic change for the European Union."
"The large cohorts born during the baby boom are approaching retirement, while new cohorts arriving on the labour market are much smaller."
"The younger generations of Europeans are also much more likely to come from different migration backgrounds, for instance, and this transformation brings challenges for policy makers in the Member States."
"It will prove a big hurdle to achieving the Europe 2020 goals if we do not succeed in mobilising our underutilised demographic potential."
"This calls for an effort to promote active ageing, to improve the labour market situation of young people, to integrate migrants and their descendants better and also to promote labour migration and to facilitate the reconciliation of work and caring responsibilities."
"In all this gigantic work, we on the Commission side look forward to working actively with the European Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 11 November 2010, at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the history of humankind, the great changes within societies have been brought about by the performance of two variables: the demographic factor and the religious factor."
"In our era, these two factors are coming dangerously together."
"Whilst there has now long been talk of 'a clash of civilisations' and the importance for Europe to represent an example of civil coexistence amongst apparently opposing cultures, the progressive ageing of the European population and the declining birth rate mean we also have to reconsider the productivity factor."
"As long as our old people have to finance our young people who cannot find work and are increasingly few in number, there will only be two possible roads left open to us: let other, non-European, people drive our growth or surrender ourselves to the flywheel of international finance, which can make our capital productive."
"Only if the two generations each become a resource for the other and work together for a shared development plan can we finally begin to talk about a European growth process."
"I urge the rapporteur, you Mr President, and you, my fellow Members, to consider holding a hearing on a new European policy for economic development based on generational contribution, to maximise the contribution of young and old to the growth of the European Union."
"I would like to express my support for the concept of the Fifty-plus employment pact initiative, which would supplement the EU 2020 strategy objectives aimed at encouraging elderly people to be active on the labour market."
"In the coming decade, it is estimated that the labour force will shrink by 3 million just when the EU has one of the lowest birth rates in the world."
"The proportion of citizens on the labour market over the age of 55 is below the target level of 50% set by the Lisbon strategy."
"At a time when the age pyramid is increasingly dominated by the older generation, I believe that concrete measures are required to strike the balance between the need for social solidarity and the inefficiency of the social security systems facing the new economic and demographic challenges."
"I think that we need the experience acquired by elderly workers, which is not utilised enough at the moment due to discriminatory preconceptions which need to be combated more effectively."
"Last but not least, I would like to highlight that elderly women are still victims of multiple forms of discrimination, in terms of gender and age."
"Greater attention must be focused on the situation of elderly, single women who, for reasons including a longer life expectancy, account for an increasingly significant proportion of the population."
"Europe, which is affected by demographic change, is facing a real challenge in maintaining a balance between respect for social entitlements and services and the principle of 'society for all'."
"I think that it is beneficial to society as a whole to make use of the skills of people at the end of their career."
"This makes it necessary to encourage public authorities, private companies or NGOs which develop innovative programmes to get elderly people involved in various activities."
"The main instruments for establishing intergenerational solidarity remain social dialogue and debating the issue with the affected groups."
"Programmes can be devised for this, including within education systems, which will draw the attention of young people to such problems and facilitate dialogue with the elderly."
"On the other hand, it is beneficial to promote mixed-age work teams and encourage support for companies which take such initiatives because the varying distribution of generations increases competitiveness and helps achieve more harmonious economic growth."
"The social economy and financial support from the European Social Fund provide means for creating and developing specific programmes aimed at active ageing and boosting intergenerational solidarity."
"The report on demographic challenges deals with socio-economic problems arising from the fact that there is an increasingly ageing population and the associated high financial burden on future generations."
"Ensuring intergenerational justice is one of the main objectives of European social policy."
"The European population is ageing."
"The birth rate in EU countries remains low."
"In many countries, although immigration has mitigated the insufficient birth rate, we cannot consider that a success."
"A large percentage of children from immigrant families only obtain a low level of education, and subsequently struggle with unemployment."
"The bulk of immigrants create their own social networks without integrating into society."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the willingness of immigrants to adapt and the willingness of the host to accept them are a condition on migration."
"Another hidden problem is the social composition of births."
"Percentage wise, the majority, apart from immigrants, is made up of children from the socially vulnerable and weakest layers of society."
"Unfortunately, it has already become a rule today that people with qualifications and a responsible approach to life often have only one child, while the maladaptive and the socially vulnerable have four children on average."
"They therefore often solve their current financial problems through giving birth."
"For these reasons, as well as the methods requested by the rapporteur, I would welcome the support programme for increasing the birth rate of qualified people with a responsible approach to life, rather than the maladaptive, as is currently the case."
"(PT) Demographic change is one of the main challenges facing Europe."
"One hundred years ago, the European population made up 15% of the world population."
"In 2050, it is only expected to make up 5%."
"This serious situation is already having a negative effect on the economy, on social security systems, and on the very makeup of society."
"Therefore, measures to encourage an increase in the birth rate are urgently needed."
"According to the available studies, there is a significant discrepancy between the number of children that families want and the number that they actually have: 2.3 and 1.5, respectively."
"In order to respond to the challenge of an ageing society, Europe has to adopt policies that promote the employment of women of all age groups, and to make full use of the employment potential of women and immigrants."
"There are best practices, specifically in Portugal, as regards crèches and nursery schools, improving maternity, paternity and parental leave systems, as well as policies to balance family and working life."
"If the current demographic trend persists, in a few years, we will see a profound change in the population structure and the age pyramid."
"It is estimated that the number of young people aged between 0 and 14 years will go down from 100 million (1975 figure) to 66 million in 2050, and that the working age population will drop from the current 331 million to 268 million in 2050."
"In addition, the proportion of people aged over 80 will rise from 4.1% in 2005 to 11.4% in 2050."
"The ageing of the population is one of the biggest challenges that the EU is facing."
"The EU and the Member States have to act urgently and in a concerted manner, not least because today, we are already seeing a high unemployment rate amongst young people, and there are already difficulties in financing pension schemes."
"The promotion of the fundamental values of intergenerational justice and solidarity will therefore have to be worked in such a way that it links pension schemes, the budget, debt, healthcare and rehabilitation, promotion of the birth rate and protection for the family and anti-discrimination policies."
"This should be done by implementing smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The report by Mr Mann clearly reveals problems to which we ought to pay greater attention."
"Far-reaching changes to the structure of the European population are currently becoming apparent."
"Thus, the birth rate throughout the EU is currently 1.5 children per woman."
"This is something that we must pay due attention to in our policies."
"On the one hand, we need to highlight the importance of traineeships and jobs for young people."
"The call for a European Youth Guarantee, whereby young people, after a maximum period of four months' unemployment, are to be offered a job, an apprenticeship or other training opportunity, is an interesting proposal that we need to look at in more detail."
"On the other hand, reference must be made to the importance of 'active ageing' and justice between the generations."
"We need to bring about change in this area in the future, too."
"I support Mr Mann's report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, demographic changes, the falling number of working people and the declining birth rate mean that age is a new cause of division in the world."
"It seems essential to create an intergenerational initiative aimed at older people and to improve relations between them and the rest of society."
"Special attention should also be paid to improving the housing conditions and the health of elderly people, particularly in regions in which the population is falling by 20-30%."
"In Bulgaria, for example, the average retirement pension amounts to around EUR 100, so there is a need to ensure pensioners a better and more dignified life."
"I would like to call attention to the fact that it is important to create a catalogue of the most serious problems, which will allow specific solutions to be prepared."
"It is also important to find and make good use of an example of good practice in the regions which are managing well with the problem of the ageing of society and its effects, particularly in the context of the European Year of Active Ageing. Thank you."
"The demographic problem is a key challenge for Europe's states and regions, against the backdrop of a decreasing and ageing population, a situation faced by the majority of Member States."
"The demographic risks involved are a priority for EU-level social policies."
"At a time when the ageing of the population is continuing, the birth rate is getting lower and demographic disparities are prevalent, these policies must identify specific measures for countering the impact caused."
"During the last twenty years, the rural population has decreased considerably in the convergence regions, especially among young people."
"Young people have an important role to play in narrowing the disparities between urban and rural areas and balancing the demographic discrepancies, which is a significant objective of the cohesion policy."
"We must put into practice the benefits of the rural environment, from supporting investors to setting up broadband Internet."
"According to Eurostat, the average working age will increase by 7% by 2060."
"Member States need to devise a clear, coherent policy for creating intergenerational solidarity and involving the population in the labour market at much older ages than now."
"I would like to welcome Thomas Mann's report."
"The demographic problems facing the European Union are becoming increasingly apparent, with their impact affecting rural areas in particular."
"The statistics indicate that just 7% of European farmers are below the age of 35 while, at the same time, 4.5 million farmers are due to retire in the next 10 years."
"We are in danger of seeing a drop in the working population in rural areas, the effects of which will have an adverse impact in future on agricultural productivity."
"New instruments are required to tackle the demographic problems in rural areas."
"One of the fundamental issues is ensuring access to education in order to provide vocational training for young people in rural areas and attract them into the agricultural sector."
"Another important aspect would be for all Member States to implement measures regarding the early retirement of farmers, along with measures for setting up young farmers."
"Implementing both sets of measures would improve considerably the management of farm holdings through replenishing the generation of farm managers."
"Last but not least, another key aspect is the provision of support to entrepreneurs in accessing funds for agricultural projects, which must be considered as an incentive, especially for getting young people involved in agriculture."
"in writing. - Mr President, I would like to welcome the report of my colleague, Thomas Mann, that addresses several crucial issues that the European Union will be facing in the near future if not already now."
"Recent protests in France against raising the pension age signify a distinct schism between the expectations of European citizens and general demographic tendencies."
"The life expectancy in Europe has been steadily increasing, while the population is in decline."
"Both trends, when combined, will inevitably lead to an increase in the tax burden of future generations, unless pension systems are reformed comprehensively."
"The dissent that the pension reform caused in France can emotionally be understood, but when considering the demographic situation in Europe, it must be noted that the proposal of the French Government and the ultimate decision of the parliament is the only appropriate response in order to avoid destitute futures for both the working and retired people of France."
"The governments of the Member States of the European Union must engage in further dialogue with the citizens to create greater awareness of the demographic change and the socio-economic challenges that it brings about."
"Consensus building is vital to justify necessary, yet unpopular reforms."
"Europe's population is ageing year by year, despite significant immigration and a slightly increased birth rate, and, as a result, we have to face new problems and challenges."
"Reviewing the European demographic pyramid, it is clear that in future, we have to pay more attention to the labour market for elderly people, and I agree with the report that the ageing of the population also offers great opportunities to improve competitiveness and capacity for innovation, and thereby to increase economic growth and employment."
"It is certainly very important to increase employment among elderly people but, above all, we have to deal with the causes rather than the consequence, and perhaps we should give priority to raising the birth rate."
"Europe's experience with integrating immigrants has shown that the solution is not to encourage immigration, but the opposite."
"A large wave of integration into Europe has made indigenous people frightened that they will be a minority in their own country and that immigrants will not adopt the local language and culture."
"As a result, worryingly, many Europeans have started to support the far right, whose principles run counter to European values, as a reaction to this."
"Assessing Europe's ageing demographic situation, it is regrettable and contradictory that young people suffer from quite high unemployment, especially in Eastern Europe, and that we are not able to appreciate young people sufficiently."
"Ensuring intergenerational justice is certainly an essential issue to address in order to prevent conflicts relating to the sharing of burdens."
"Europe is ageing more quickly than the other continents."
"One worrying fact is that the ratio between the population over the age of 65 and the population of working age (aged between 15 and 64) is due to double by 2060 (from 25.4% to 53.5%)."
"The growth of this ratio in Romania is alarming as it is set to increase from 21.3% in 2008 to 65.3% in 2060."
"In view of the magnitude and speed with which the population is ageing, Member States need to bear in mind, as part of their employment policies, the gender factor, new ways of organising work in companies, as well as methods for facilitating flexible formulas progressively leading to retirement, improving working conditions and promoting anti-discriminatory practices with regard to recruitment and vocational training."
"At the same time, I urge Member States to:"
"promote a culture which provides for the management of ageing in companies and tailor its different aspects, particularly via the option of phased retirement, while taking into account how strenuous the job is and the working, health and safety conditions;"
"continue to retain the option of early retirement for certain groups of workers, according to their working conditions, and in special circumstances such as redundancy or restructuring."
"This is a very important report, which should be used by the European Commission when identifying its priorities and planning its work for 2012, which is to be declared the European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations."
"I have raised the question of active ageing many times in Parliament, and it should be a priority for the European Union and all Member States in the coming years."
"The demography cannot be changed."
"Faced by the ageing of European society, it is essential to achieve the professional activation of people of retirement age."
"We must not discard their experience or dismiss their desire to continue working."
"Therefore, I support the initiatives proposed by the rapporteur and, in particular, the European '50-plus pact' and the 'active ageing' initiative."
"Also of exceptional importance is the 'guaranteeing a decent pension' initiative."
"In keeping with the report, I appeal to the Council and the Member States to make swift arrangements to guarantee payment of appropriate pensions to all Europeans which will ensure them a dignified life and not just exceed the poverty level."
"We must work against all of the many forms of discrimination against older people."
"Many people wrongly think that older people have fewer needs."
"Difficulties for senior citizens in gaining access to loans and discrimination against them in the job market are commonplace."
"A common occurrence is the absurd situation in which a 40-year-old woman is considered too old for work, while at the same time, graduates are expected to have several years of professional experience."
"The way out of the demographic crisis is through the family, since it was the weakening of the role of the traditional family that got us into this crisis."
"Increasing the proportion of older employees and women in active employment is only a short-term solution."
"It gives us a little time, which we must use in order to motivate young people in particular to start a family and raise children."
"However, our short-term strategy must not come into direct conflict with what we want to achieve in the long term."
"In order for mothers of young children to be able to return to work, we must build enough pre-school facilities."
"However, we are forgetting that children pick up their key social habits in the first three years of life; that in crèches, children learn to assert themselves by screaming rather than respecting other people; that children will use the models of behaviour they pick up during this period throughout their lives."
"Parental care is not a luxury for a child, but a natural standard."
"Crèches and nurseries are, and always will be, a compromise."
"As with any compromise, it is the case that if the bearable limits are overstepped, the consequences will be worse than we can imagine today."
"Can we be sure that a generation of children which spends more time with strangers than with their own parents will one day be just as willing to take on responsibility for old, ailing and disabled people as we are today?"
"Implementation of the Research Framework Programmes (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Maria Da Graça Carvalho, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on simplifying the implementation of the Research Framework Programmes."
"Science, education and innovation are the pillars of economic growth and job creation."
"Europe needs to invest more in science, open up its scientific systems, promote the free movement of researchers, and increase and promote excellence."
"In fact, today we are seeing an increasingly multi-polar world in all sectors, including science."
"A few figures are enough to demonstrate this fact: for example, at a global level, 80% of researchers work outside Europe, and 69% of patents are registered outside Europe."
"Europe invests less in science and innovation than Japan, South Korea and the US, and this difference is essentially due to investment from the private sector."
"Our system of science and innovation has weaknesses that need to be overcome, from underfunding to fragmentation, a lack of conditions for developing innovation, and excessive bureaucracy."
"The European scientific system needs to be more efficient, starting with the simplification of the rules for funding."
"In this context, I had the honour of being appointed rapporteur for the simplification of the rules for participation in current and future European programmes for science and innovation."
"This report may play a vital role in Europe, and it comes at the right time, given that we are beginning the review of the Seventh Framework Programme and the preparations for the eighth programme."
"As the rapporteur, I decided to open up the debate on this subject and hold a public consultation."
"I sent out more than 8 000 invitations to a diverse range of bodies."
"There was an immense number of contributions, which shows the importance that our institutions and the public attach to this subject."
"The report proposes the simplification of financial monitoring and control and the strengthening of technical and scientific evaluation by means of peer review based on excellence."
"The goal of this report is higher risk tolerance, simplifying the bureaucratic monitoring mechanisms and creating greater confidence in the scientific and business community."
"However, the report marks only the beginning of a process that is not simple."
"The Commission will be responsible for implementing the recommendations, and it will need monitoring and political support from Parliament and the Council if it is to carry out this task successfully."
"In future, the simplification process may be extended to other European programmes, notably, the structural funds."
"Programmes which have simpler rules will also be more transparent and efficient."
"I would also like to thank my colleagues, the Belgian Presidency, the Commission and all those who contributed to the public consultation for their assistance."
"It is imperative to simplify access to funds for research and develop a culture of evaluation based on a partnership of trust between all those involved so as to strengthen research and innovation in Europe, thus making it an attractive place to live, work and be happy."
"(PT) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out, as the simplification of the implementation of the research framework programmes is necessary, and, as the rapporteur pointed out, this is only one of the many reforms that are needed to improve the financing of research in the EU so that it is more efficient and useful in promoting development and social progress."
"The report proposes extending the scope of the Commission's initial proposal, which we think is correct, especially in important aspects such as the financial regulation and the presentation of concrete proposals to simplify the calculation of average staff costs and to abolish time-recording mechanisms, including timesheets."
"In the same way, it is also important for the Commission to allow the reimbursement of costs incurred after the submission of a proposal, provided it is successful, with the aim of facilitating the participation of industry partners and, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises."
"If science, innovation and education are to be pillars of economic growth and job creation, it is vital to bear in mind the proposals contained in this report and to focus more on science and research."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Carvalho, who has done a tremendous job, as well as the European Commission."
"I would also ask you, Commissioner, to convey my thanks to Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, who has understood this process of simplification and communication."
"We must simplify the future, but also settle the past."
"The Commission's auditors should never have applied rules that were stricter than those already approved, and that is why we must settle the past, Commissioner."
"We narrowly escaped disaster with research institutes that were suspicious of the European Union."
"Today, with wisdom and respect for good management, and using tolerable risks of error, but also taking into account independent re-audits, and if that fails - as I proposed, and as was accepted - bringing in an independent mediator, we must regain the confidence of all our research institutes, with proper monitoring and European funding, of course."
"Then, on the basis of a relationship of trust between Member States and the European Union, we will begin negotiating the next financial perspective in order to better establish the focal point of our research and make it more European."
"(PT) First of all, I would like to begin by offering my congratulations to Mrs Carvalho for the excellent report that she presented to us here today, and also for the way in which she conducted this process in such a democratic manner, both inside and outside Parliament."
"I think that this should be recognised, and so I would like to offer her my thanks."
"The Seventh Framework Programme is the largest and furthest-reaching programme that we have at a global level in terms of research, and the Commission's proposed simplification is very welcome in that respect."
"However, the proposal which Parliament is presenting here greatly enhances the Commission's proposal."
"It does so by recognising that simplification is not enough, by making the clear and crucial distinction between research and innovation, by appreciating the different areas of research, by enhancing its clarity, transparency, participation and democracy, by ensuring equal opportunities in access to available funding, by opting for a model that is less focused on bureaucracy and bureaucratic control and more oriented towards excellence in research, by recognising the importance of the different scientific fields and by advocating that partners are chosen and alliances forged with partners under equal circumstances."
"Mr President, I would therefore like to conclude by saying that the implementation of this proposal would result in a clear improvement in working conditions for all researchers in Europe, as well as greater prestige and further improvements for research in Europe."
"This is why we need to work together."
"Mr President, an awful lot of the undoubtedly good work done by the European Union is ruined by stories of too much complication, and particularly of people trying to get funding and not being able to access it, despite going to huge efforts such as taking on people full-time for a number of months to make an application, and then not being successful."
"I have heard a number of stories in this regard."
"The same applies to applications for funding under cultural and educational programmes."
"If we can do one thing, it is to meet the target in 2020 of reducing red tape by 25%."
"In fact, that target should be raised to a 50% reduction if we can because, as has been said, in application and in auditing, a lot of the good work we have done has been obliterated by stories of difficulties that arose owing to over-complication."
"Simplification is the way forward."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Carvalho for this very comprehensive report."
"She draws attention to major concerns within the field of European research: the question of the complexity of the rules for the beneficiaries and the very heavy administrative burden."
"In April this year, the Commission adopted a communication on this subject, presenting a long list of short- and long-term options for simplification."
"This triggered a very important interinstitutional debate."
"The Commission is very grateful that Parliament has dealt with this matter with such priority."
"The Commission is also very grateful that the report supports the majority of the proposals, and even contains some of Parliament's own, which are very interesting."
"Similar support was given by the Council and, on the basis of this very broad interinstitutional consensus, we should now turn to action."
"We are fully committed to achieving simplification and adhering to the simplification principles as stated in your report: simplicity, transparency, legal certainty, consistency, excellence and, as Mr Audy said, a more trust-based approach towards our research institutions is, of course, an important guideline for managing the activities."
"Some of the proposals in your report and in the Council conclusions can be implemented within the current framework."
"The Commission's services are now reaching out for solutions which can be swiftly implemented."
"We are considering solutions for broadening the acceptance of average cost methodologies, and for a more flexible approach on interest on pre-financing and a lump sum option for the personnel costs of owner-managers of SMEs."
"We also take very seriously the concerns on inconsistent interpretation of rules and procedures by the different services when implementing the FP7."
"We are working intensely on implementing measures that ensure a more uniform interpretation and application of the rules."
"We will also work on further reducing delays in providing grants and payments."
"We must not forget that the more profound changes do require a revision of the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules."
"Only then can we really remove some of the big constraints."
"The current control strategy for research expenditure has been designed to detect and correct errors so as to bring the residual error level down to below 2%."
"The Commission agrees that this is costly and puts a great administrative burden both on the beneficiaries and on the Commission."
"So a higher tolerable risk of errors, as supported in your report, could allow the Commission to modulate the control effort, to optimise cost effectiveness and to balance the need for effective control with establishing a more trust-based relationship with researchers."
"Thank you very much for the report and to everybody who has been involved with it."
"It has cleared the ground for very good and important work in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 11 November 2010, at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Innovation and research are now the critical elements of the new development strategy for our continent: the EU 2020 strategy."
"Commitment to research and development has a concrete impact on economic activity, since only innovation gives guarantees of future production with strong value added and, therefore, of increasing levels of job creation and the European Union's competitiveness at international level."
"I have always argued that the regional level is the most appropriate for stimulating research and innovation because it favours universities, public research bodies, large companies, small and medium-sized enterprises, and regional and local public authorities working closely together, specifically as clusters."
"In my region, the Azores, this fact is visible in the dominance of the oceanic and marine research undertaken by the Department of Oceanography and Fisheries of the University of the Azores."
"Encouraging innovation at regional level also contributes to attenuating social and regional disparities, making it essential for cohesion policy to continue to contribute to financing these activities in the outermost regions, like the Azores."
"In view of the mid-term review of the Seventh Research Framework Programme and of the preparation of the future rules for the forthcoming framework programme, we need to consider and find solutions to enable us to eliminate certain obstacles that are making it difficult for interested parties to access EU funding."
"If we are to create a knowledge- and innovation-based European economy, we need to invest in research, thus enabling SMEs, universities, public research bodies and regional and local authorities to benefit from the financial resources made available by the EU."
"However, access to funding in the research sector requires a significant technical capacity and in-depth knowledge of administrative and financial procedures."
"Yet it is also characterised by a tendency to favour 'results-based' projects, meaning that there is low risk tolerance, which discourages the launch of highly innovative projects."
"This situation has the effect of discouraging private sector participation and making the research world little more than a collection of uninteresting projects, thus reducing Europe's competitiveness in the global economy."
"I support the proposals made in the report, which call on the European Commission to encourage a 'user-centred' approach to improve access to funding and guidance documents, which should be compiled in a handbook and translated into the EU official languages, and to place more confidence in the scientific and business community."
"Research and innovation are two elements forming the basis of the Europe 2020 strategy for boosting competitiveness, promoting sustainable economic growth and creating new jobs."
"In this context, the implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme for research must be improved, especially by speeding up and simplifying the administrative procedures involved, by shortening waiting times and streamlining application management."
"However, I would like to stress that, in respect of the new Member States, the framework programme's shortcomings extend beyond the strictly administrative and management remit."
"The main problem in these countries is linked to the lack of research infrastructure, making it structurally impossible to access the funds allocated via this programme."
"Consequently, the Commission should also incorporate in the future proposal on simplification certain specific measures with a view to establishing the development infrastructures in new Member States to provide them with an equal chance of accessing the research programmes."
"The other day, my fellow Members and I adopted with an overwhelming majority the resolution submitted by Mrs Maria da Graça Carvalho on simplifying the financing rules of the Research Framework Programmes."
"The resolution takes steps in a very good direction, but even more decisive steps are needed."
"Our current regulatory system requires such a degree of bureaucratic preparation that it excludes precisely IT initiatives, small and medium-sized companies, and smaller research institutions from among those capable of obtaining funding resources."
"Thus, financial support does not go to the best researchers but rather to the institutes with the best accountants."
"Financial oversight appears currently to be unable to handle any risk, and this is intolerable when it comes to research and development, which often involves investments with uncertain outcomes."
"Risk ought to be managed, not excluded."
"There are adequate regulatory solutions to this and these must be strictly complied with."
"However, regulations that are structurally incompatible with the nature of research must be reformed."
"Another, similarly major deficiency is the geographical asymmetry in the distribution of the research framework programme funds."
"The opportunity for researchers living in the new Member States to obtain support, as compared to those in the old Member States, is infinitesimal."
"As long as the aim of the European Union's research framework programme is to provide the opportunity to all European talent to achieve excellence, it cannot allow such differentiation in the programme's implementation."
"In today's knowledge-based society, expertise has a key role to play, particularly in view of the deepest economic crisis in recent history."
"Research, development and innovation are extremely important in order to maintain Europe's position as a global economic player as well as its competitiveness."
"European initiatives for public funding of research programmes are still too bureaucratic and associated with high administrative costs."
"Simplification of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), currently the largest publicly funded programme for research and technological development, is therefore essential in order to create sufficient incentive for scientific research."
"The research funding should be more trust-based and also more risk-tolerant towards participants in order to allow even projects with a higher risk potential to still seem attractive and to enable the pursuit of cutting edge research."

"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 23:40)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2009 (debate)"
"The first item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report for 2009."
"President of the Court of Auditors. - Mr President, it is an honour for me to be able to participate in the debate today on the European Court of Auditors' annual report on the implementation of the 2009 budget, which I have already presented to you and to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would like to present to the House the four key messages contained in this year's annual report."
"First, the Court concludes that the accounts of the European Union give a fair presentation, and a true and fair view, of the financial position and the result of operations and cash flows."
"This is the third consecutive year the Court has found the accounts to be free from material misstatements and reliable."
"As regards legality and regularity, the Court gives an unqualified opinion on revenue and commitments, as in previous years."
"However, and this is the second key message of this year's annual report, payments from the budget continue to be materially affected by error, except in two areas."
"Those exceptions are administrative expenditure and economic and financial affairs."
"In all other areas of expenditure, the Court found material levels of error."
"I will focus on the two main areas of expenditure: agriculture and cohesion."
"In the area of agriculture and natural resources, the Court estimates the level of errors to be somewhat higher than in 2008."
"However, the results are consistent with the Court's assessment, in both years, that systems are only partially effective."
"The Court recommends reducing the risk of error by improving the quality of information in the databases used for establishing entitlements and calculating payments, and by clarifying and enforcing rules on land usage and maintenance."
"In the area of cohesion, which represents almost a third of the budget, the situation remains that this is the only budgetary area where the estimated error is over 5%."
"Most of the errors found relate to serious failures by national authorities to apply rules on public procurement and to the reimbursement of ineligible costs."
"Many errors could, and should, have been detected and corrected by Member States before certifying expenditure to the Commission, as the audit shows they had the information to do so."
"If we analyse this year's results and compare them to last year, we see that the most significant change is in cohesion."
"That brings me to the Court's third key message."
"The estimate for the most likely error in cohesion spending was significantly lower than in previous years, and for the budget as a whole, the Court's estimate of errors has fallen over recent years."
"However, a degree of caution is necessary before drawing any conclusions about the trend in this area; due to variations in spending patterns, the population of payments can change considerably from one year to the other - 2009 being notably different from 2008."
"Moreover, there is no guarantee that the overall fall in the estimated error rate over recent years will continue, so long as the systems covering the vast majority of disbursements remain only partially effective."
"That brings me to the last key message."
"The information provided by the Commission on recoveries and other corrections is not yet completely reliable and cannot be meaningfully compared with the Court's estimated error rate."
"There are a number of initiatives before us which provide an important opportunity to improve the financial management of the European Union."
"This year's annual report confirms the conclusions and the recommendations set out in the Court opinion on the risks and challenges for improving the financial management of the European Union."
"Improving the quality of spending should be a high priority."
"Simplifying the legislative framework and introducing more cost-effective control systems to reduce the risk of errors should contribute to this goal."
"Earlier this year, the Commission presented a draft recast Financial Regulation."
"In its recent opinion on this, the Court concludes that it contains a number of proposals that provide opportunities for the Commission to improve transparency and financial management."
"Simplification of sectoral legislation remains, however, an important route to a significant improvement in the quality of spending."
"Next year, the Commission will present legislative proposals for policies and programmes covering the main areas of expenditure in the next programming produced."
"When revising expenditure programmes, the Court suggests applying a set of principles to ensure that European added value is likely, that the objectives are clear, that the schemes are as realistic and simple as is reasonably possible, and that accountability is also clear."
"Ensuring the European funds are spent optimally places heavy responsibilities on all of us: on the Commission, when proposing legislation and implementing the budget; on the Member States in managing, day-to-day, some 80% of the European budget; on Parliament and on the Council as legislator and as the discharge authority; and on the Court as the Union's external auditor."
"The Court looks forward to playing its full part in efforts to ensure that the funds are spent correctly and are spent well."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, two days ago, President Caldeira and I already had the opportunity to exchange our views and to discuss the Court's annual report with the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would like here to outline the main points of the discussion and the very first conclusions."
"Before entering the heart of the matter, I would like to recall the fruitful dialogue between the auditor, the Court and the audit team in the Commission and to thank President Caldeira for this excellent cooperation."
"I am pleased with the Court's recognition of progress made;"
"I see indeed many positive messages;"
"I also see some criticism and it is the Commission's commitment to closely follow up on all the Court's recommendations."
"The main messages of the Court's report are key for the Commission's own assessment of the way it assumes its responsibility in managing the EU budget."
"Firstly, for the third year in a row, the annual accounts have received an unqualified positive opinion."
"The Court has evaluated the EU accounts as giving a true and fair view without any reservation."
"The Commission is, of course, very satisfied with this result as it confirms the lasting effects of our accounting reform."
"However, the Court rightly highlights certain weaknesses."
"While none of these affects the Court's unqualified opinion, the Commission is determined to address these weaknesses and therefore continues to improve its day-to-day accounting practices."
"With regard to the legality and regularity of transactions, I am pleased that the positive trend in the reduction of the overall error rate continued in 2009."
"Revenue and commitments for the entire budget are legal and regular in all material respects."
"More than 95% of payments made from the EU budget are free from error."
"This verdict is a positive sign that our efforts to further improve control are having a concrete impact."
"This has been achieved mainly thanks to a substantial reduction of the error rate in cohesion; this progress reflects the Commission's enhanced supervisory role through the ex-ante assessment of management and control systems of the Member States."
"It also reflects the merits of a rigorous approach in either interrupting or suspending payments where problems were identified."
"Finally, in its report, the Court recognises the higher quality of the information about recoveries provided by the Commission, as disclosed in the accounts."
"The increase in the value of funds recovered from projects where errors were found or from national authorities responsible is indeed another sign of this Commission's determination."
"However, I share the Court's view that the Member States' reporting is not yet satisfactory and the Commission will pursue its efforts to remedy this situation for the existing programmes, and also for the next generation of programmes and the shared management."
"I fully share the caution of President Caldeira when he warns of possible oscillations of the error rate, in particular in cohesion, in the future."
"I also agree with the Court when it points out the weaknesses of the Member States' systems and some other issues in shared management."
"In my view, the way forward includes the design of cost-effective control mechanisms; the simplification of eligibility rules where their complexity is an obvious source of errors; and the improvement of the quality of the information provided by the Member States regarding financial corrections and recoveries."
"But this list is not exhaustive."
"Our discussion on Tuesday showed that there are other challenges before us, for instance, a greater accountability for the key financial actors, in particular, the Member States, and a cost-effective control policy based on risk and performance."
"Moreover, in preparing the budget review, I have promoted the new focus on impact rather than input through the definition of clear and measurable objectives and key performance indicators."
"I presented last May my agenda on discharge, audit and anti-fraud for 2010-2014 in the Budgetary Control Committee of this House."
"This agenda outlined the key strategic objectives and concrete steps which the Commission will take to move further towards a positive Court statement of assurance."
"In the light of the Court's 2009 annual report, this agenda remains fully relevant for our future actions."
"To conclude, I am pleased that the 2009 annual report corroborates that our efforts bear results."
"It constitutes an important and timely input to our reflection on how to achieve a more effective and efficient financial management of the EU budget which should guide us in preparing the next generation of programmes."
"Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very good day ahead of us, because for the first time, we can expect the Barroso II Commission to cross the 2% barrier."
"We do not really need the tolerable risk of error."
"This is why the Court of Auditors' report that has been submitted to us definitely represents very good news, in particular, for all of those who are working in this area."
"It is clear that when the Commission makes a genuine and determined effort, it can come up with the results."
"If we look at these results in more detail, it is obvious that they are in part due to the changes in the regulations."
"This is definitely the case and this is the route which we must take in future."
"If the Commission could bring itself to revise the directive concerning public procurement and genuinely make things simpler for public bodies in the Member States, this would certainly be the biggest step that we could take towards a positive statement of assurance."
"I would like to say to everyone who constantly maintains that the European budget is exposed to major risks, it is true that European spending should certainly be subject to more consistent controls than national spending."
"European money is monitored more consistently and has to be accounted for more consistently than many areas of national budgets, as always becomes clear when we visit the Member States, because the national regulations have only been put in place as a result of the European regulations."
"Therefore, we simply need to encourage the Member States and call on them to subject their national spending to the same controls as European spending and vice versa."
"I would like to thank the Court of Auditors, but I would also like to say that I am disappointed by this annual report."
"I have already mentioned that the annual report contains significantly less information than it did in the past."
"We need details of the error rates."
"We have always been given this information for the structural funds, but this year, for the first time, we have not received it."
"We are not at nursery school here."
"We in Parliament rely on having this information."
"When I look back at the hearing involving the members of the Court of Auditors, I recall that they promised to work closely together with Parliament."
"I do not believe that this promise is being kept."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I would like to welcome the annual report and congratulate President Caldeira and all the Members of the Court for their excellent work."
"Allow me especially to thank Mr O'Shea for the excellent cooperation we had concerning the agencies."
"Our role as a parliament is accountability towards the citizens, so we have to make sure that taxpayers' money is used properly, transparently and effectively."
"I expect that the findings of the annual reports concerning the agencies, to be published later, will follow the same trend as in recent years."
"The situation is getting better, but there are still control systems to be improved, problems to be tackled and solutions to be found."
"In the current major economic and social crisis, the significance of monitoring has become more important than ever before, and we in Parliament and the Court of Auditors are together committed to dealing with, and solving, the problems in order to achieve even better results."
"Mr President, Mr Šemeta, Mr Caldeira, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for this report."
"Your organisation, Mr Caldeira, provides an essential service for European taxpayers."
"It is a good thing that the reduction in the error rate has continued this year."
"This is the result of the reform of the Commission which was pushed through by the liberal Commissioner, Mr Kallas."
"There are major improvements over the previous year in the area of cohesion and only a slight deterioration in agriculture."
"However, the Commission should not now simply sit back and do nothing."
"We must make it clear that the huge improvements are based on a very lucky choice of samples."
"Therefore, I am concerned that the positive trend will not continue next year."
"We should make use of the momentum from the first budget discharge under the Treaty of Lisbon to introduce a decisive paradigm shift."
"I would like to make it clear once again that this year's report from the Court of Auditors is the sixteenth in a row which does not have positive overall results."
"How can we finally bring an end to the inefficient and wasteful allocation of funding and to the political connivance in this area?"
"My proposals as rapporteur are as follows: Firstly, the Commission must intervene more strongly in the case of obvious errors and, where these errors are repeated, it must suspend the funding."
"How is it that a Member State of many years standing like Greece is not subjected to sanctions over a period of 10 years, despite the fact that it is in obvious breach of the provisions of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)?"
"Secondly, we must no longer impose double penalties on taxpayers."
"The beneficiaries of EU funding which has been allocated illegally are only required to repay 10%."
"In accordance with the 50:50 rule, the Member States contribute half of the amount from their national budgets."
"This is an insult to taxpayers."
"Let me give you a few figures."
"Between 1994 and 2006, the Member States have been wrongly allocated a phenomenal EUR 7.7 billion in the area of cohesion policy."
"The Commission itself has just made this fact public."
"Only EUR 709 million has been paid back, which demonstrates very clearly the difference in these circumstances."
"This is probably correct, because the Member States are not in a position to come up with accurate calculations."
"The Court of Auditors has confirmed this."
"Thirdly, all the Member States must finally sign and submit national management declarations."
"Fourthly, the Commission must be politically accountable."
"This is why we want signatures at least from Mr Barroso on the synthesis report on annual activities."
"We also want an evaluation report, which is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"There are still some things that are in need of improvement."
"All in all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors very much for this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I read this annual report, I experienced a feeling of déjà lu, a feeling that I was once again reading something that I had been reading for many years."
"First of all, in particular, too many material errors are occurring in the areas of agriculture, the Cohesion Fund, research and development, external aid, development cooperation and education."
"Secondly, the supervisory and control systems have been only partially effective in preventing and correcting reimbursement of claims for excessive or ineligible costs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are still faced with the fundamental problem that Member States are not doing what they ought to be doing, which is properly monitoring the money they pay out to beneficiaries."
"We are talking here about 80% of the European budget."
"Another fundamental problem that remains is that the Commission is not making sufficient efforts to monitor the activities of the Member States in this regard."
"I therefore endorse the rapporteur's strategy, which will entail, on the one hand, ensuring that we demand, above all, national management declarations signed by ministers of finance and, on the other, ensuring that the Commission finally takes action against any Member States that remain in breach and, if need be, imposes tough sanctions: of a financial kind, for instance - withholding subsidies."
"That is, in my view, the path we need to follow."
"Mr President, the Court of Auditors is a kind of great superintendent, we might say a policeman, a friendly policeman, although sometimes I have the impression that it turns a blind eye and is too good and too benevolent towards the institutions which it supervises. The conclusion of this report, the conclusion of the Court's work is as follows: 'good, but not perfect'."
"I have the impression that many people in Europe are more pessimistic than the Court of Auditors."
"The Court must have a greater role, the Court must be credible, so that the European institutions will be credible in the eyes of the taxpayers and voters."
"However, for the Court to be credible, it must really be very scrupulous, because the Court is saying, today, that it is glad the glass is 95% full, while I think many taxpayers will ask: 'but why is it 5% empty?'"
"I do agree with one conclusion - supervision at European level is sometimes more detailed, perhaps, than in Member States, and I call on the Court to exercise greater supervision in the Member States, where the money is quite simply frequently disappearing down the drain."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for an excellent report."
"As we have heard, overall, there has been a reduction in the number of errors being made."
"What should we make of this?"
"In my opinion, this depends on two things: the starting point and our expectations."
"The starting point was horrendously poor."
"In 2008, billions of euro were paid out in contravention of the rules."
"Therefore, the expectations were that there should not only be improvements, but that there should be significant improvements in all areas."
"So, has this happened?"
"Yes, in the area of cohesion, there has been a definite reduction in erroneous payments, which is a good thing, even if their level is still unacceptably high."
"In other areas, however, there has actually been a rise, which is quite simply not good enough."
"The other day in the Committee on Budgetary Control and again today, Commissioner Šemeta claimed that the overall reduction in the number of errors was a result of the Commission's efforts."
"That is fine by me."
"I am happy to give the Commission the credit."
"In that case, however, it is also clear who will be responsible if the error rate increases next year."
"Please take that as an invitation."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, year after year over the last 16 years, the auditors have been refusing to clear 90% or more of the budget, and this year is no exception."
"They talk about errors, but the nature of the irregularities they find goes far beyond that of a mistake."
"Suffice to say that such a situation would cause the closure of a company in the private sector and the conviction of its directors."
"The fact is that taxpayers' money has been unlawfully spent."
"This year, the auditors claim that at least GBP 6 billion should not have been paid out."
"What is the essence of the problem?"
"The lack of responsibility."
"The Commission and the auditors will, as usual, blame the Member States, but the fact is that the failure resides within the Commission due to the lack of proper controls."
"The Commission is in the best position to establish the rules and to sanction those who breach them, but it has failed all along and this Parliament also bears responsibility, as it has approved the situation every year and keeps asking for an increase in the budget."
"There is no hope any more that the EU budget will ever be cleared by the auditors."
"At this point, the only way to protect taxpayers' money is to reduce the EU budget drastically."
"Now I address the British Prime Minister."
"Mr Cameron, in accepting a 2.9% increase for the 2011 EU budget, you have failed dramatically."
"On behalf of British taxpayers, I hereby request that you lead the demand for a significant reduction of the 2011 budget."
"(DE) Mr President, it is true that the error rate in the area of cohesion has fallen significantly from 54% in 2007 to 36% in 2009."
"That is correct."
"It is a fact, and even I have to acknowledge that."
"However, as the rapporteur has already said, if you look more closely at how these figures have been produced, it is obvious that they must be seen in relative terms."
"It is also a fact that, according to this report from the Court of Auditors, the control systems in the area of cohesion are not effective."
"In addition, it is a fact that at least 3% of the money should not have been paid out at all."
"This means that there is still a great deal for Mr Hahn to do, among others, to put this portfolio in order."
"In my opinion, the increase in the error rates in the area of agriculture is obviously a retrograde step."
"Furthermore, wastefulness, in cases for example, where subsidies for miners are paid to billionaires, is not counted as an error."
"I have already mentioned in the committee that I have not received an answer either from the Court of Auditors or from the Commission with regard to the social security benefits which have been paid twice."
"Once again, my question is: Who made the error in this case?"
"Will the money be paid back and how big is the amount involved?"
"Finally, I would like to say that it is important in future for the Court of Auditors not only to check that payments are being made legally, but also to ensure that they are cost-effective and efficient."
"(RO) First of all, I wish to thank Victor Caldeira for this clear report, which is relevant to the Commission's activities and the implementation of the 2009 budget."
"Secondly, I want to clarify from the start something of vital importance to us: once every five years, we are elected and sent to the European Parliament by Europe's citizens, the people who pay taxes and duties and who ultimately make this budget."
"From their point of view, based on the fact that we regularly go back home and meet with them, the implementation of the 2009 budget cannot be regarded as a success."
"Let me give you just two reasons for this."
"Firstly, the national management declarations made are not supported politically."
"In other words, there is no signature either from the minister for finance or the prime minister."
"As a result, we do not know who is responsible for these national management declarations and to what extent they are comprehensible and accurate."
"In practical terms, this paves the way for false reporting and, if not false, then at least incomplete."
"Secondly, where errors have been made in the management of European funds, every state must pay the money back to the Commission."
"In other words, Europe's citizens pay money once to create the European budget and, on the other hand, as losers, they again cover the loss in the national budget."
"Therefore, the citizens of the European Union pay twice for the mistakes, errors or even fraudulent acts committed in the management of European funds."
"Thirdly, I support the Commission and the European Court of Auditors."
"I, too, am in favour of closer ties between this institution and the national audit bodies in each Member State."
"I believe that if we want to have more money in the budget, we must spend better, in the first place, the money we have."
"To spend better the money we have, we must first of all know where problems are and how we can solve them."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that if we can now talk about a reduction in errors, we owe this to the skill, independence and professionalism of the Court of Auditors, and I should like President Caldeira to take note of this."
"I believe that, as well as the Commission, Parliament played an important part in this improvement, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control, which sets great store by the subject of transparency and the effective and efficient use of public funds."
"We must still see what we can do to improve, however, because there are still too many things that are not right, particularly in very sensitive sectors such as agriculture and cohesion, with often worrying error rates in sectors where fraud in areas such as contracts and over-invoicing is rife."
"I believe that it is necessary to lower the rate of bureaucracy and reduce pointless red tape and instead introduce a few clear rules to send out a very clear and determined 'no' to every form of fraud in sectors where corruption is endemic."
"Another important factor is to step up the role of OLAF, the anti-fraud office, to combat all forms of fraud and corruption."
"Another aspect that we cannot fail to emphasise - we learned this also from a recent visit by the Committee on Budgetary control to Italy - is that there is also a risk of the forceful influence of organised crime and forms of corruption on public funds."
"The role of OLAF could therefore be essential from this viewpoint, together with greater cooperation between Member States, the Commission and Parliament."
"Another absolutely essential point is that I believe the Commission must strengthen its independence from Member States."
"I believe that we must block funds to prevent repetition of this type of behaviour, particularly in states where serious errors - I am not talking about minor errors - and very substantial episodes of fraud have been going on for years."
"The credibility level of the European Parliament and the European institutions is determined greatly by the level of transparency and correctness with which public funds are spent."
"I therefore believe that we have room for improvement on this score."
"(NL) Madam President, although the Court of Auditors states that the accountability of European expenditure has improved, it has failed to grant a full declaration of assurance for the expenditure."
"That is partly because, while some improvement has indeed been shown as regards the second largest item, cohesion, there are still errors in approximately 40% of the projects."
"Thus, out of a total budget of EUR 35 billion, there are EUR 2 billion for which no declaration of assurance could be granted."
"I find that unacceptable; the Commission, in particular, should therefore thoroughly investigate how these errors could have arisen and how they might be reduced."
"This is especially important in consideration of the discharge of the 2009 budget."
"Yesterday, Mr Engwirda, a member of the Court, stated that the errors were primarily due to the complexity of the procedures."
"That again demonstrates that it is imperative that Europe become simpler and more transparent."
"If that does not happen, our citizens will continue to see Europe as complicated and overly remote."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to ask Mr van Dalen whether he is aware that the high percentages refer only to the percentage of the sample."
"In other words, it is not 36% of the payments that are in error, but 36% of the payments in the sample."
"If this is extrapolated up, the result is at least 5% in the case of the Cohesion Fund."
"Therefore, the billions that you referred to are not accurate amounts."
"Were you aware of this?"
"(NL) Madam President, I fully understood that."
"The real issue for me is that no declaration of assurance can be given for billions of euro, which is why I have asked the Commission to investigate that thoroughly and also to examine how the situation might be improved."
"Fortunately, the Commissioner has already indicated in his speech a minute ago that he will initiate such an investigation and that he will take the matter seriously."
"(DE) Madam President, estimates provided by the European Court of Auditors show that EUR 6 million disappeared from the European budget in 2009 as a result of carelessness, mismanagement, fraud, ignorance and a lack of checks."
"The Court of Auditors has revealed the scandalous fact that around 40% of EU officials are receiving double the normal amount of family benefits."
"Greece is once again causing problems."
"It has not only been bailed out by other Member States with a rescue package amounting to billions of euro, but is also the front-runner when it comes to subsidy fraud."
"You only need to look at the wooded areas for which Greece has claimed subsidies for green spaces to see the sheer audacity of its behaviour."
"Of course, the situation is particularly bad when it comes to the regional subsidies."
"As the previous speaker has said, if 36% of the payments that were checked were made in error, that is bad enough."
"This is why we are calling on Mr Hahn to take drastic measures with regard to his very important portfolio."
"We do not have money to give away."
"Finally, I would like to compliment the committed employees of the Court of Auditors."
"They are highly motivated and we politicians should be encouraging them to make even more careful checks."
"As politicians, we are in a position to draw up and implement guidelines."
"(PL) Ladies and gentlemen, I think that in discussing this report, we must take care to be sufficiently precise in our statements, because we are very often also talking, here, about errors, irregularities or embezzlement."
"The report shows very clearly that in terms of the error rate found for cohesion policy, there has been a definite reduction."
"It is at a level of around 5%, in relation to which we cannot at the same time talk about errors at a level of 20, 30 or 40%, because this simply confuses the overall picture."
"We have, here, a clear improvement in what certainly is a very complicated policy, since it is managed jointly with the Member States."
"A problem for all of us is how to improve this policy, which has a structure which is simply very demanding and very complicated but which has huge added value."
"The situation is changing, and this should be noted with satisfaction and stated positively."
"However, I would like to draw attention to a certain disturbing part of the report, and I quote: 'Taking this into consideration, the Court concludes that it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison between its own estimate of error rates and the data for financial corrections and recoveries supplied by the Commission.'"
"I think this statement is very important and significant for the future, because we do not want a situation in which the Court concludes that it cannot reach agreement with the Commission about results."
"More work is needed, here, and this matter needs to be explained."
"(DA) Madam President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for once again providing us with an excellent tool for evaluating our use of money within the EU."
"Fortunately, we can confirm that we are moving in the right direction, even though there are still many problems."
"However, because things are moving in the right direction, I think we should use the time to take a closer look at what the next step should be."
"If we look at the situation with regard to administrative expenditure, for example, we can see that we have an effective control system and few errors."
"In my opinion, however, this is not enough."
"We also need to take time to examine whether we are actually using the money in the right way."
"Administrative expenditure is our expenditure on salaries, buildings and such like."
"In this regard, we ought to ask ourselves whether we are really getting enough for the money that we spend on salaries."
"Are we using the money in the right way in respect of how we manage our buildings, etc.?"
"I believe that we now need to take the debate a step further so that we discuss the question of whether it is efficient enough, and so that we also obtain a significantly greater degree of transparency with regard to this."
"I therefore call not only on the European Parliament, but on the Commission, too, to demonstrate a considerable willingness to provide greater transparency and to engage in this debate."
"(CS) It is now the second time in the current session that the annual accounts of the European Union have come up for discussion."
"In the first place, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr da Silva Caldeira and his team for the work they have done."
"On the other hand, I am surprised at the level of error that is again occurring in almost 92% of budget expenditure, counting all chapters with the exception of administrative expenditure and economic affairs."
"I would like to ask to what extent are the Member States responsible for these errors and to what extent is a lack of control on the part of the Commission responsible."
"The answer indicated in the report is that there are many deficiencies in the actual control systems of the Member States."
"I believe that what we need most of all is greater cooperation and openness from the Member States, if such large-scale errors are to be prevented."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, the Court of Auditors have done an excellent job drafting the report auditing the EU budget for 2009, and Mr Caldeira and the members of the Court of Auditors deserve credit for their work."
"I agree with those speakers who have said that the report shows clearly and unambiguously that there is an improving trend as regards the use of EU funds and that the overall error rate is falling."
"Nevertheless, we need to draw clear and obvious consequences from the report as to what we have to do here in Parliament, in the Commission and in the other EU institutions."
"The falling error rate, however, means nothing less than that, according to the Court of Auditors, several billion euro of EU funds have been used incorrectly or irregularly, which may even give rise to the suspicion of crime."
"This means that action has to be taken."
"There is one measure in particular which I would like to mention, namely, that it would be extremely important that the Court of Auditors prepare a breakdown by Member States in the next period to show the extent of the error rate in the use of EU funds and the standard of operation of the control mechanism in each state."
"This, too, may contribute to a further reduction in the error rate."
"(ES) Madam President, once again, we welcome the improvements introduced through the intense dialogue between the Court of Auditors, the Commission and, of course, Parliament."
"This year's report, however, also shows that we cannot rest on our laurels, and that we need to remain vigilant."
"I also think that Mr da Silva Caldeira's proposal for the future regarding cooperation to improve and simplify the important aspects of the Financial Regulation is very positive, as are the new legislative proposals on which we could perhaps work together to achieve a successful result."
"With regard to the other institutions, I will be paying very close attention to all the aspects related to the Council's operating expenditure, especially the Secure European System for Applications in a Multi-vendor Environment system, in which there is a specific reference to the need for improvements in forecasting the Council's budget, and also to isolated aspects relating to the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, whose budgets appear to be severely reduced."
"I am also interested, however, in the fact that we have had information that a case has been passed on to the European Anti-Fraud Office in relation to the Economic and Social Committee."
"In addition, I would like to know the opinion regarding the significant increase in staff in the Committee of the Regions between 2009 and 2010."
"(BG) Ladies and gentlemen, it is vitally important that we emphasise the fact that the Court of Auditors' conclusions acknowledge the progress which has been made by the Commission in controlling the absorption of European funds."
"However, at the same time, I hope that the recommendations and proposals made by the European Parliament in the discharge reports, reiterated for years on end, will actually be taken into consideration, especially in the areas where we still have a high level of irregularities."
"The quality of the information supplied to us by the Court of Auditors should be even better as well."
"I believe that we should really be given the precise figures and level of irregularities which we need to know."
"The good news for 2009 is that the level of irregularities in the area of cohesion policy has fallen significantly compared to last year."
"However, the big question remains whether this reduction will be sustainable over time or is simply a fluke which may also be due to the specific countries chosen to be audited."
"However, in any event, there are unresolved issues on the agenda, linked to irregularities in the areas of external aid, development and enlargement, agriculture, research, energy and transport, education and citizenship."
"I want to assure the Court of Auditors, the Commission and Council that our work in the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control will be very extensively and essentially focused over the coming months on making the management of European funds more efficient."
"We will continue to emphasise the responsibilities which need to be assumed in this regard by the European Commission and Member States and strictly adhered to, as well as the measures to be taken against offenders in order to achieve a real result in protecting the interests of the European taxpayer."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, cohesion policy is the sick man of the EU budget."
"Last year, he was in intensive care and this year he is convalescing."
"However, he is far from making a full recovery and he could have a relapse at any time."
"More than 5% of all the cohesion policy payments were in error and 3% should not have been made at all."
"This amounts to around EUR 700 million."
"A large proportion of these erroneous payments could have been prevented by the Member States."
"The errors are occurring in public procurement and in the payment of cohesion funding, despite the existing control systems, which have been approved by the Commission."
"We need to take another careful look at these control systems."
"In my home country of Germany, the samples showed that all the control systems there which had been tested were only partially effective."
"The responsibility for managing the budget lies with the Commission."
"We can discuss this contradiction - errors in the Member States which are the responsibility of the Commission - in our home countries, we can explain it to the media and we can tell our citizens about it."
"However, in political terms, it is the job of the Commission to resolve this problem in the Member States."
"Mr Šemeta, you need to take control in this area and you will have our support for doing so."
"(NL) Madam President, representatives of the Commission and the Court of Auditors, I rise as coordinator for regional policy of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Looking at the error rate, I see that a clear improvement has been made in terms of cohesion."
"We can now see the impact of the new regulations we adopted for the 2007-2013 period and of the action plans which were keenly advocated, not only by Parliament, but also by both the current and previous Commission."
"Most of the problems, or errors, are to be found in the public procurement dossier."
"Transposition of European legislation into the laws of a number of Member States and the associated implementation have driven up the error rate to its present very high level."
"I therefore ask the Commissioners to come up with an action plan that would, amongst other things, put pressure on Member States or support them with regard to public procurement."
"Last week, I had the opportunity of heading a European Parliament delegation to Romania and we were able to see how they were struggling with this and what kind of difficulties they were up against."
"We could make a lot of progress here."
"Finally, I, too, am very much in favour of national management declarations; that is, financial declarations that Member States would be required to submit, because Member State level is precisely where most of the faults lie."
"Madam President, I want to be as positive as I possibly can about this report, because I always believe that we should use audits to improve things and to learn from our mistakes."
"There are many examples where this can be done by the Commission, by Member States and by beneficiaries in order to improve matters, for example, in agriculture."
"Constant changes in requirements by the Commission cause difficulties for Member States and beneficiaries; in Wales, they tell me that all the time."
"To reduce claims for ineligible land by farmers, the Commission could also provide legislation which clearly defines active farmers across the EU, which would then be used by all Member States, whereas at the moment, they have some discretion."
"Lastly, with CAP reform imminent, there is a golden opportunity to simplify the processes to ensure that in Europe, we have value for money for our spending, but also continue to provide benefits for individuals and communities."
"(PL) Madam President, presentation of the results of the European Court of Auditors' work always gives superb information which enables a comparison of what things were like in the past with what should be done in the future."
"What can the general conclusion be?"
"It seems to be the case that wherever procedures are less complicated and it is easier to use money, we find fewer material errors."
"The more complicated the policy, the more the significance of errors, and sometimes also of irregularities, rises."
"One such example is cohesion policy, which is also very important for the European Union."
"This is why it has also been concluded, here, that the Union's agricultural policy has a high error rate, but where procedures for the use of funds have been simplified, there are fewer errors than where it is more complicated."
"I would like to draw attention to the significance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies, but also - and this has not been spoken about - the significance of cooperation with national parliaments and, in particular, with committees for European affairs, budgets and budgetary control."
"I personally was a member of the Polish national parliament at the time when we started working with information from the European Court of Auditors, and it was very well received by the members."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to offer my very sincere thanks to the Court of Auditors."
"This report is an impressive demonstration of the fact that the controls are constantly improving."
"I am not necessarily concerned by the error rates that have been highlighted, because I believe that the auditing process is a learning system."
"It involves looking more and more closely at the problems and, thank goodness, discovering an increasing number of errors."
"Our task is to work together to avoid these errors occurring in future."
"Therefore, I would like to draw everyone's attention once again to the Fifth Cohesion Report which was presented yesterday."
"The Commission is inviting everyone involved to express their opinions about the questions raised in this document."
"This represents a major opportunity to lay the foundations for future subsidy arrangements which will ensure, on the one hand, that subsidies in this area are easier to obtain, that access is simplified and red tape reduced, and that, on the other, the necessary strict controls are in place to protect the taxpayers' money which is being used."
"Therefore, I am calling on everyone involved to comply with this request from the Commission."
"We in Parliament will, of course, do so."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the debate today demonstrates that further progress was achieved in 2009 in the management of the European budget."
"The clear opinion of the Court on the accounts and the lowest error rate ever for the whole budget, as disclosed by our external auditor, confirm that the Commission took the right decisions and proposed adequate measures to improve the performance of the programmes under the current financial period."
"However, the Court also highlights the areas where further progress is needed by all financial actors."
"I refer, of course, to the Commission, and also to financial actors in the Member States whose obligations and responsibilities under shared management have been clearly reinforced under the new Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"Many of you talked here about the application of sanctions to the Member States, and I have to say that the Commission applies sanctions very rigorously."
"Just now, we are in the process of the suspension or interruption of 40 cohesion programmes amounting to EUR 1.75 billion."
"That is a huge amount, and what is more important is that the number of actions in 2010 almost doubled compared with the number of actions in 2009."
"Just last Friday, we also made a decision to call back unduly spent money in agriculture to an amount of more than EUR 578 million; so we really apply these sanctions rigorously and we intend to do so in the future."
"You can also see from the report by the Court of Auditors that the level of recoveries and financial corrections has increased significantly over the years, amounting in 2009 to EUR 3.3 billion."
"That is also a very significant amount, and our intention is to continue this policy and apply sanctions very rigorously when this is needed."
"The Court's report, and the discharge procedures starting now, will be instrumental not only in addressing the weaknesses of the current programmes but also in drawing lessons for the next generation of programmes."
"The Court rightly pointed out the way forward, which is, of course, simplification and improvements in the procurement rules, because it is true that the vast majority of errors were made because of the violation of eligibility criteria or of procurement rules."
"We have to learn lessons from this, and the Commission is ready to do so."
"It will follow up on the Court's recommendations and is looking forward to a fruitful discharge procedure."
"President of the Court of Auditors. - Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for all the kind comments that you have addressed to the Court on this occasion, as a tribute also to those who work in our institution each day addressing, with the highest professional standards, and in accordance with international audit standards, the concerns of this institution."
"We pay due attention to the recommendations of this House and let me just give you two examples of what we have done in this annual report for 2009 to address the request from this institution for more information."
"We provide you with an overall assessment of the situation; for the first time, we say what the overall situation is."
"We conclude that it has improved over recent years; the most likely errors for the whole budget are decreasing."
"We have also provided you, in particular in the area of cohesion, with more information than last year, because last year we said that at least 11% of the funds should not have been paid; this year, we are able to say that the most likely error estimated is indeed over 5%, which we could not say last year, and that at least 3% of the funds should not have been reimbursed."
"This is the measure of the progress we have found."
"These are facts."
"Why?"
"What are the reasons behind this?"
"What progress have we achieved?"
"We are not inventing facts; we are not being kind to the Commission or kind to the Member States."
"The Court is an independent audit institution governed by the treaty."
"We base our findings on the evidence and it is what we report to this institution, which we have the obligation to assist in this discharge procedure."
"We are willing to assist you in this work and the main reason for this, as we said in our report, is that on the one hand, the systems put in place to manage the funds for this programme period 2007-2013 are performing better."
"The other reason is that the disbursement of funds for the programming period is only 25%, so the financial execution for the period is, in our evidence, lower than what should be expected."
"So the combination of these two factors - better performance of the systems on the one hand and lower execution, so fewer payments effectively made, on the other - has given us the situation where we now are."
"This is where we have this word of caution."
"We have to see how things evolve now with the systems behaving so well across all the 27 Member States and with all the funds to be disbursed in the future. So a word of caution."
"But I said that we are willing to assist this House, and particularly the Committee on Budgetary Control, in its discharge."
"Our Members will assist you with that and provide you with all the information you need."
"But we are also assisting you through our special reports."
"You can find audits and other elements which look at the impact of the funding in real life, at how effectively they have been used, and I think that this is very valuable information for this institution also."
"Clearly, the responsibility for implementing the budget lies primarily with the European Commission, but the Lisbon Treaty says also in cooperation with the Member States."
"If we have to look forward, I would say that we now have a unique opportunity to build a new momentum for a better management of the European Union budget."
"A new Financial Regulation is being discussed and will be adopted soon and that will be the basic line to decide and guide the management for future progress."
"If we have to have simple rules, if we want to have more efficient, cost-effective systems to manage them through the Member States and within the Commission, that is the moment to address those issues."
"The budget review is also on the table next year."
"So the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament are therefore confronted now with a period for taking serious decisions to improve the situation in the future."
"If the European Court of Auditors can assist in that, I would suggest it should be by building on the recommendations that we have already put forward in our opinion on the key risks and challenges for improving the financial management of the Union."
"When you look to the new generation of programmes for the period after 2013, I repeat, we have to ask: are the programmes of funding schemes likely to add value to the European Union?"
"Are we putting forward schemes which are simple, with clear objectives, realistic to execute and whose accountability lines are clear?"
