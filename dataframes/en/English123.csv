"This proposal was largely inspired by the initiative taken by the European Parliament back in 2005 in a cross-party working group led by Christopher Beazley."
"Sweden intends to use its Presidency to draw up a coherent, comprehensive strategy for the area based on proposals from the Commission."
"One of the main events is an extensive high-level meeting that will take place in Stockholm tomorrow and the following day."
"Naturally, Sweden and the other countries neighbouring the Baltic have a great interest in the strategy for the area, but we also believe it could serve as a model for other regions and other regional strategies that would be useful to the entire EU."
"By working across borders and between different sectors in a particular region, we can deal collectively and more effectively with common challenges such as pollution and environmental destruction."
"We can create new business opportunities and new jobs, and improve transport links."
"Consequently, it is important that regional strategies form part of a wider European policy."
"The proposed strategy for the Baltic Sea area is the result of a request made by the European Council to the Commission in December 2007 and the initiative was supported by the European Parliament in a resolution of 12 December 2007."
"It is hoped that the strategy will gain the backing of the European Council meeting at the end of October."
"The aim of the strategy is to improve the environment in the Baltic Sea area and to increase integration and competitiveness in the area."
"The strategy addresses four challenges in particular: ensuring a sustainable environment, increasing wealth, improving accessibility and attractiveness, and guaranteeing security and certainty in the area."
"Getting to grips with the environmental issues is, of course, one of the main priorities."
"There are very serious threats to the Baltic Sea environment which, in turn, means that there is a risk that its economic development will be affected."
"This is a very sensitive marine environment that is exposed to various kinds of environmental impact."
"Decisive efforts are needed, and quickly."
"In particular, overfertilisation and algal blooms caused by excess nutrient run-off are threatening the ecological equilibrium of the Baltic Sea."
"At the same time, the Baltic Sea is also affected by pollution from land-based sources, hazardous substances and the effects of climate change."
"As a result of these acute and serious environmental threats, the Baltic Sea area is an obvious priority in the area of the environment and we hope that conclusions will be adopted in December."
"However, the serious state of health of the Baltic Sea area is not the only challenge faced by the region."
"The economic crisis has made the matter of jobs and growth highly topical."
"Most of the countries in the Baltic Sea area are small and are dependent on exports."
"This means that we must increase integration in order to strengthen competitiveness throughout the entire Baltic Sea region."
"Our aims and goals in this respect are clear."
"We want the internal market to function better in our region than anywhere else, and we want the new Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth to be implemented effectively in this part of Europe."
"We must address the crisis by increasing cooperation and commitment in our immediate area."
"Global competitiveness requires cross-border cooperation between countries and enterprises, in research and through innovations."
"The aim of the strategy for the Baltic Sea area is not to create new institutions."
"Rather, we are endeavouring to use the instruments and policy areas that already exist such that together, they benefit the area in a more strategically coordinated and intelligent way."
"Neither does the strategy involve new resources being injected into the area."
"It is based on existing EU programmes and existing structures and on finding better ways to coordinate."
"Naturally, our objective cannot be achieved overnight, but our goals are ambitious."
"We deserve a cleaner Baltic Sea at the centre of an area that offers prospects for sustainable economic development across borders, supported by the entire EU."
"If we can achieve this, then I am convinced that we will be serving the interests of the Baltic Sea area, and I hope that we will also create a model that can be adapted and applied effectively in other regions."
"I would like to express my thanks for the positive cooperation of the Commission on this matter, and not least the European Parliament - which is, after all, the institution that originally took the initiative and has been a driving force in connection with cooperation in the Baltic Sea area throughout."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Parliament for having included the new strategy for the Baltic Sea region on the agenda of its plenary session."
"The high visibility this provides for the strategy is extremely welcome."
"Of course, it is not a complete surprise to me that Parliament is taking such an interest in the strategy."
"The pioneering work undertaken by Parliament through its Baltic Interparliamentary Group in particular was very much one of the catalysts for the whole macro-regional strategy approach."
"The Baltic Sea Strategy has required a completely new approach from the European Commission as it is the first time that we have prepared an integrated strategy for a group of Member States who have to face the same challenges and who may benefit from the same opportunities."
"I will not hide the fact that the preparatory work has brought challenges of its own, but these have been overcome successfully."
"The four pillars of the strategy provide an overarching framework for improving the overall situation of the Baltic Sea region."
"By addressing the environment, the economy, energy and transport and safety and security issues, the strategy provides an integrated approach covering several policy areas while ensuring close interaction among the fields concerned."
"Since the Commission adopted the strategy in June, the Swedish Presidency has led positive and constructive discussions in Council which are to lead to conclusions already in October."
"This rapid progress is important if we are to maintain momentum as we enter the implementation phase of the strategy."
"I would like to underline this point as it must be clear that all our preparatory work on the strategic framework that I have just described will count for nought unless we start to deliver genuine visible concrete results on the ground, hence the importance of the strategy's action plan which has also been drawn up during the preparatory work."
"The implementation of an action plan will require real cooperation, commitment and leadership from Member States and regional stakeholders to deliver the 80 or so projects included at this stage."
"In financial terms, although there is no additional financing from the EU budget, the strategy proposes a more coordinated use of existing funds and a more imaginative approach to other funding sources such as the European Investment Bank or the Nordic Investment Bank."
"I would now like to say a few words about the planned governance system which is proposed for the operational implementation of the strategy."
"This is one area where there has been much discussion among the Member States, but the overall approach is that policy orientations will be taken by the Council. The coordination monitoring and reporting is done by the Commission and the implementation on the ground is led by the Member States or organisations of the Baltic Sea Region."
"In addition, the Commission proposes to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties."
"However, I would stress that the Commission has neither the capacity nor the desire to lead the delivery of the action plan itself."
"Responsibility must rest with the relevant Member States and other stakeholders directly involved on the ground."
"This is the only way to ensure that the ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the Member States and other stakeholders."
"So what are the next steps?"
"Once we have conclusions from the Council and the European Council, we will take forward the implementation phase of the strategy."
"Here we expect to see a wave of coordination meetings to kick-start the various priority areas and individual projects included in the action plan."
"The first formal assessment of progress made will be presented under the Polish Presidency in the second half of 2011."
"However, prior to that, the first annual forum of the Baltic Sea Strategy will take place next year."
"This will give all stakeholders an opportunity to consider how the first months of the strategy have gone and what lessons might already be drawn at that stage."
"I would like to conclude by saying that I look forward to continuing to work closely with Parliament on all aspects of strategy."
"The Commission very much expects Parliament to be actively involved in events such as the annual forum."
"Your backing is crucial to maintain widespread visibility for the strategy to maintain high-level political support for the strategy and to maintain pressure on the Member States and the regional actors to deliver results."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the PPE Group congratulates the Swedish Presidency on its leadership in starting to implement the Baltic Sea Strategy (BSS)."
"This strategy reflects a fundamental change that took place in this region five years ago."
"Since 2004, the Baltic has become the EU's internal sea."
"That is why the Union needs a comprehensive approach so as to react in a coordinated way to both the opportunities and challenges this new situation presents."
"Furthermore, the BSS is an example of excellent cooperation between the main institutions of the EU."
"As you might know - and as it has been said - the strategy in question was initiated by Parliament three years ago, more precisely by the Baltic Europe Intergroup under the excellent leadership of Christopher Beazley."
"I would also like to express my special gratitude to Commission President Barroso."
"His understanding and support since 2007 were crucial in preparing a practical version of the strategy, which resulted in the Commission communication last June."
"I would like to make three points."
"First, the goal of the initiators was to turn the Baltic Sea area into one of the most competitive and rapidly developing regions of the EU."
"Provided we make maximum use of the BSS, this region could well become a success story of what is now called the Lisbon Programme."
"Second, just now, more than ever, the region needs better access to and security of energy supplies."
"The EU and Member States have to agree on providing alternative channels for energy deliveries."
"First and foremost, it comes down to creating a united energy system around the Baltic Sea."
"Finally, the issue of the bilateral and primarily political Nord Stream project should be settled through respecting the rightful interests of all states around the Sea and certainly not before the Russian Government joins the Espoo Convention."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has put cooperation in the Baltic Sea area at the top of its agenda."
"There is no need for argument here: we need to protect resources and we, too, need to help protect the climate and nature."
"On the other hand, we must also focus cooperation in the Baltic Sea area on economic development, of that there can be no question."
"You have our full support here."
"However, some questions do still arise."
"You just said that there are no additional funds."
"As we discussed this in committee, all the funds are to be made available under the current cohesion policy."
"For me, this raises the question of whether this means under existing projects that are already being financed from cohesion resources or under new projects."
"If so, we need to ask which cohesion policy projects already approved will lose funding."
"This is a very important point, because I already know that the towns, local authorities and regions will come and ask me, what should we do in order to become involved in the Baltic Sea Strategy? How do we get the funds to run this sort of project?"
"If we do not give them a good answer and cannot indicate how this cooperation is to be organised, then citizens' enthusiasm for Baltic Sea cooperation will probably quickly turn to frustration."
"That is not the objective that we are working together to achieve and we therefore need to hold very intensive talks on how to organise this cooperation."
"I therefore ask - and I would ask the Commissioner to take this on board - that not only the Council and the Commission participate in the Baltic Sea Strategy, but also that Parliament is properly involved in this cooperation and in the implementation of this strategy, because we would like other regions to profit as well, as with the Black Sea policy or with cooperation between the states bordering the Danube."
"That would be very important to us."
"Mr President, my group is very happy that the Commission has drafted the EU's first Baltic Sea Strategy document."
"This is also the first strategy document of its kind for this region and we hope that it will serve in particular to speed up the process of cleaning the eutrophic Baltic Sea."
"The region's problems can best be solved through cooperation between its peoples, countries, organisations and businesses."
"My group is especially pleased that Sweden has highlighted the importance of countering the trade in humans and crime."
"I wish, in particular, to thank Mrs Malmström for this, because I think that this is also her handiwork."
"This is an important issue, and it is rather odd that in 2009, we should be having to speak about the existence of a trade in humans in the Baltic Sea region."
"We now need a Baltic Sea action plan to end this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is excellent that the Commission has drafted a proposal for a Baltic Sea Strategy and that Sweden has added it to its agenda."
"I hope that Sweden will acquire something more tangible in its efforts to protect its marine environment, mainly in the areas of agriculture and shipping."
"After all, the Baltic Sea is one of the world's most polluted seas, and its biggest environmental problem is eutrophication."
"Agriculture is mainly responsible for that: there is nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from EU fields."
"Nitrogen and phosphorus take oxygen from the seabed and feed poisonous algae at the surface."
"The question of whether the Baltic Sea is to be cleaned is largely in the hands of the EU."
"The Commission recognises this in its strategy, but the proposals for measures are vague."
"Virtually the only precise measure is to prohibit the use of phosphates in detergents."
"That is a necessary move, but we also badly need new rules for agriculture, so that we can produce food without smothering the Baltic Sea at the same time."
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the fact that in its guidelines, Europe's Baltic Sea Strategy was supposed to promote a comprehensive programme for the development of this part of Europe, inter alia by establishing the most natural and shortest transport routes to balance out the development of the countries of the 'old' and 'new' Europe."
"That is why I am astonished by the Commission and the Council's proposal to change the layout of the central European route."
"The most economic link between the Adriatic and Baltic Sea is the central European route along the course of the Odra, whose overland route ends at the port of Szczecin-Świnoujście."
"I propose a clear memorandum to re-activate the strategy in its original form, which mentions a central European route, one which will not erase from Europe's development plans major ports such as Szczecin-Świnoujście, which is already suffering from the European Commission's decision to liquidate its shipbuilding industry."
"In exactly 2564 hours, the reactor at Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania - the last remaining independent energy source in Lithuania - will be shut down."
"Europe has already invested EUR 200 million in the safety of this power plant."
"To decommission it today, European States will have to contribute another EUR 800 million."
"From a legal point of view, Europe is probably correct; every country has to observe the commitments it has made, but is it really right?"
"Is it right with respect to the citizens of Lithuania and other states?"
"I do not think so."
"Money for the decommissioning of the reactor will have to be taken from people hit by the economic crisis."
"Is it logical or right, when there is a crisis in Europe, when GDP in Lithuania has fallen by 22%, when unemployment has reached 15%, when winter is coming, to close a working nuclear plant which is safe, I repeat safe."
"No, this is wrong."
"Having given its word, Lithuania will implement the conditions of the accession treaty, but this will be a huge sacrifice."
"Following this sacrifice, Lithuania will find it considerably harder to overcome the economic crisis."
"Unemployment in the country will grow even more and poverty will increase."
"Ladies and gentlemen, tell me, does Europe need such a sacrifice today?"
"Do we not have a better way to spend EUR 800 million today?"
"Appealing to the conscience, economic logic and common sense of each one of you, I call on you to add to the strategy we are debating today a provision that Ignalina nuclear power plant will remain open until 2012, i.e. until the end of its safe lifespan."
"I hope that by approving President J. Buzek's political programme in the area of energy, that is, diversification of energy supply and the development of nuclear power in Member States, the European Parliament will make the concrete steps required."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are only 2563 hours and 58 minutes until the reactor is shut down."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in theory, projects such as these on the regional promotion of cross-border cooperation are to be welcomed and make a great deal of sense."
"However, strategies often have the disadvantage that, although targets are set and even reached, sustainability is ignored, even during implementation."
"Sustainability must therefore be included right from the planning phase."
"It is therefore important when implementing this integrated strategy for the Baltic Sea area - a very important exemplary EU project - for regions and organisations to cooperate as a network, because these organisations know best what is important for them in the various sectors, such as nature, social structure and infrastructure; they know what to do for the best."
"This is an area with 100 million inhabitants and an investment budget of EUR 50 billion."
"We need to proceed very carefully here if we are to make a success of this pilot project."
"This pilot project is, as already mentioned, very important for other projects along the Danube, too, for the states bordering the Danube in central and south-east Europe."
"(PL) What a macroregion needs is a coordinated policy of sustainable development."
"This is what the European Parliament, and then the Council, believed in 2007 when it recommended that the European Commission draft a Baltic Sea Strategy and an action plan."
"Here I would like to underline the role the then Commissioner Mrs Danuta Hübner played in drafting this strategy."
"This policy is now being continued by Commissioner Samecki, to whom I also extend my heartfelt congratulations."
"Amongst other things, the strategy responds to the fundamental challenges named here, such as achieving prosperity in a region with little development of innovation or enterprise, or failing to acknowledge the Baltic as a common asset without building a sustainable environment, or security in the region, including energy security, without building new generation facilities and interconnections."
"The same is happening with citizens' security and accessibility of the region thanks to the construction of trans-European communications links."
"I would like to stress the huge role - and it really is a vast contribution - played by the opinion makers who were consulted on this draft strategy, particularly citizens' organisations, local and regional governments, national governments and Baltic organisations."
"The active participation of these organisations should be very useful in realising these strategies."
"The Baltic Sea Strategy is a good example of how we can use the instruments of Community policy to materialise political will over a large macro-regional area of the European Union."
"I would like to make four points, Mr Commissioner."
"First of all, I believe it is key to focus on managing the Baltic Sea Strategy in such a way as to avoid eroding interest both at local, as well as at government and European Union level."
"We should also concentrate on properly funding the implementation and operation of the strategy itself - on this matter, an amendment to the budget has been agreed."
"Secondly, there is the need for full implementation of single market principles in the macroregion, taking into account the experience and engagement at local and regional level."
"The two final matters are: institutional support for funding undertakings within the scope of the strategy, and maintaining good relations with our partners in the region, including Russia, Norway and Belarus."
"Mr President, I think it is wonderful that both the Commission and now, especially, the Swedish Presidency, has breathed life into Parliament's ideas and ambitions in this fragile area."
"We all know the problems to do with the environment of the Baltic Sea and the specific economic difficulties of the area."
"But this Parliament remains ambitious, and I think this Parliament does want to be involved."
"One of the mechanisms you did not mention was the possibility of a regular report back to this Parliament so that we may have a debate like today to watch how things are progressing."
"For me, I will have the pleasure, as a Vice-President of this House, of participating in the conference that you are organising on Friday."
"I think there are concerns still remaining about funding, to make sure that this House sees the results of this strategy that it deserves."
"A macro-regional economic strategy could be the way forward in other ways, in other places, in Europe."
"Let us hope that this one works well."
"(SV) Mr President, I am delighted that environmental issues are a main priority in the new strategy for the Baltic Sea area."
"The Baltic Sea is suffering two major acute environmental problems."
"The first - overfertilisation - has already been mentioned by Mrs Hassi."
"The second problem is overfishing."
"Researchers are entirely unanimous on this."
"Relatively recent knowledge suggests that the lack of top predators, i.e. cod, has further worsened the algal blooms."
"The problem is that the Baltic Sea needs a healthy ecosystem."
"It would therefore be very good if a pilot project - a fast track project - could be established within the new Baltic Sea Strategy involving regional fisheries management in the Baltic Sea area."
"We would also need to prohibit the dumping of cod and this should take effect immediately."
"At present large volumes of young cod that have just arrived in the Baltic Sea are being dumped."
"I call on the Swedish Presidency to take up my challenge and deal with this problem."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was already agreed during the last parliament that the Baltic Sea region was suitable for a pilot project aimed at implementing an internal EU strategy for the macroregion."
"I consider it appropriate that this strategy, which is based on the aim of a more consistent application of Community law and the more effective use of EU funds, does not introduce new laws or institutions and does not depend on any special funding."
"I can see savings in linking up local and regional bodies."
"It is essential in the practical implementation of the Baltic Sea Strategy to rearrange the responsibilities of the various administrative bodies within the system of multi-layered government in order that the activities of the various bodies and organisations do not overlap."
"In future discussions on the impending cohesion policy, it would be useful, at the same time, to clarify how the various macro-regional strategies and mainstream EU regional policies will co-exist alongside one another."
"It would also be useful to clarify how the Baltic Sea Strategy will affect the planned application of a territorial cohesion policy."
"(DA) Mr President, we are discussing a 1 200 km gas pipeline beneath the Baltic from Vyborg in Russia to Greifswald in Germany through an ecologically sensitive inland sea where there is a large difference in sea bed levels, through an area where undetonated explosives from two world wars, as well as poisonous chemicals from the paper industry, are constantly being found."
"Around EUR 100 million have been expended on an environmental analysis performed by the company that is to lay the pipeline, namely Nord Stream - a gas supply agreement between Gerhard Schröder and Vladimir Putin."
"I will not even mention the security issues surrounding the great increase this will bring to Russia's influence in the Baltic, but instead I will stick to the environmental problems this will bring."
"Unfortunately, Finland has already approved the project, but on behalf of Timo Soini, as well as for myself, I would now like to establish the whereabouts of the information relating to the project which the citizens of all the countries on the Baltic need before building work takes place."
"(LV) Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the formulation of a strategy for the Baltic Sea region is a very important achievement for Parliament, in which the members of the Baltic intergroup have played a leading role."
"This strategy is comparable to the Mediterranean strategy which, in its time, stimulated rapid economic growth in the South."
"It will serve as a good instrument for the development of the Baltic region and, as a result, for the whole of the European Union."
"Speaking of priorities, I should first wish to mention the development of a common European Union energy policy, including a competitive Baltic energy market."
"This involves not only the aspects of security of energy supply and energy efficiency, but also, naturally, the development of renewable energy."
"Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia must be integrated into the common regional energy network, including NORDEL."
"Our second priority is further infrastructure development."
"The roads in some Baltic Sea region countries, given both climatic conditions and also sometimes ineffective policies, are in a quite poor state."
"The development of transit corridors and communications networks will stimulate business and create new jobs."
"So that we may speak of effective economic development and protection of the environment, the third priority is an innovative economy, which means growth that is balanced and knowledge-based."
"In order to carry out the strategy, additional finance is essential, and this must definitely be provided in the next European Union financial framework."
"We must now make use both of the EUR 5 billion energy programme and of the globalisation fund and other financial instruments."
"An effective mechanism for implementing and monitoring the strategy is also important."
"It has to be simple, transparent and free of superfluous bureaucracy."
"Regular reviews of the introduction of the strategy and interim reports are essential."
"The first should already be produced in 2010."
"I welcome the Swedish Presidency's active role in getting the strategy going."
"Allow me to express the hope that we shall be effective and flexible in carrying out this specific action plan."
"(PL) Mr President, five years ago, the Baltic Sea effectively became an internal sea of the European Union."
"Today we are debating a draft strategy which will allow us to unleash the huge dormant potential of the region, a project which was the initiative of the European Parliament."
"However, not all the recommendations of this House have been accepted by the Commission."
"The most significant was the lack of, and the retreat from, setting up a separate budget line for the Baltic Sea region."
"The Commission assures us that funding will come from existing instruments, primarily the structural funds."
"However, I fear that without special funding earmarked specifically for this purpose, we will not be able to achieve all our aims."
"The authors of the strategy mention the need for close cooperation with Russia."
"In this context, however, we should not forget the greatest threat at the moment to the Baltic Sea, namely the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline."
"Last year, the European Parliament took a negative stance on this."
"I hope that the new Commission, by instituting the action plan associated with the strategy, will bear this resolution in mind too."
"Mr President, it is indeed a unique European regional policy initiative and a pioneering project."
"Innovation-driven prosperity, the environment, accessibility in terms of transport and energy connections, and security and safety are the four major areas for joint work by all partners who are involved in preparation of the strategy: all three European institutions - Parliament, the Commission, the Council - but also national governments, regional and local authorities, business and academic communities and non-governmental organisations."
"The process of the preparation of the strategy has led to a genuine partnership between all of them."
"Development challenges increasingly do not respect administrative or political borders."
"The strategy will make it possible to replace the often very fragmented and scattered policy responses with a genuine shared response to shared development problems and opportunities."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development, which is the leading committee on this project in Parliament, will give high importance to it in its work."
"We will hold the debate on 6 October with the Commission and the Council; the own-initiative report will be prepared in the months to come."
"We will also keep the implementation of the strategy under review and I trust that this action-oriented strategy enhances the Union's chances to build green, modern and competitive economies."
"(FI) Mr President, the European Union became aware of the Baltic Sea issue quite late on."
"A total of 100 million people live by its shoreline, and then there is Russia, which is important."
"This strategy will have a strong environmental dimension, and this is only right, because the environmental problems of the Baltic Sea are colossal: eutrophication, fading biodiversity, the waste waters of St Petersburg, the problems of Kaliningrad, and so on."
"It has been mentioned here that this will also change the European Union Cohesion Policy, and this, I think, is quite important, and I hope that more will be said about it here."
"Minister Malmström says how it will change because the change to the Cohesion Policy will result, for example, in the danger that, when we speak of the Danube Strategy and the Black Sea Strategy, part of Europe, including northern regions, will be ignored and, in fact, Arctic areas right now are undergoing the world's most rapid changes, and this is important to see."
"(FI) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the Baltic Sea as a region is special in many ways, and so I am very pleased that Sweden has made this strategy one of its priorities during its Presidency."
"It is important that we take the strategy forward and thus also implement it."
"Not only does the Baltic Sea have a very strong environmental dimension to it;"
"I think it also has a major impact on regional policy."
"During its presidency, Sweden has also integrated these regional policy matters closely with this Baltic Sea Strategy."
"The strategy is mainly understood as a document that relates to the countries along its shores and their coastal areas, but it definitely has a robust regional dimension."
"How we go about integrating with this strategy environmental technological expertise, issues concerning inland waters, and its huge impact on transport policy, will also have major repercussions for inland areas."
"The Baltic Sea Strategy must therefore be made part of the common European agenda."
"I hope it gets Parliament's strong support so that the strategy is not just empty words and so that we can achieve something tangible."
"Mr President, as an MEP elected in Latvia, I welcome the fact that the first example of a strategy for a macroregion concerns the Baltic Sea area."
"Nevertheless, in my opinion, a number of Community objectives have been forgotten here - for instance, a high level of social protection."
"Some of the region's Member States, including Latvia, have been severely hit by the economic crisis."
"Our financial sector is interconnected with the Scandinavian one."
"This means that our problems will create problems there, so this is not a national issue."
"Recently, Latvia received medium-term financial assistance for balance of payments, provided for by the Commission."
"Unfortunately, there are no social conditions for such assistance."
"As a result, the government is reducing pensions and benefits, but the Commission tolerates this."
"My second concern is about fundamental rights."
"Mass statelessness and minority protection still constitute a topical issue in two of the region's Member States: Latvia and Estonia."
"I think that the strategy must be more ambitious and seek to attain all the objectives of the European Union."
"(FI) Mr President, I wish to thank the Commission and the Swedish Government for the very active role they have played, and I believe that the Baltic Sea Strategy is a good and important one."
"Without proper financing, however, the project will not succeed."
"In that case, all this will end after the strategy has been adopted."
"Parliament has been pondering for many years how financing should be organised, and last year it unanimously agreed on the budget having its own Baltic Sea Strategy heading."
"That is the means, the instrument, for gathering together all the countless projects that the Baltic Sea Strategy now needs if it is to go ahead."
"I know that the Committee on Budgets has now made proposals for setting aside a little money under the heading, and I hope that the Council and the Commission will also support this, because otherwise the project will simply not succeed."
"Something else we need to do if we want to rescue the Baltic Sea environment is to obtain Russia's commitment to this project."
"I find it incomprehensible how some have been prepared to agree to a gas pipeline running through the Baltic Sea without any obligation on the part of Russia even to commit to the conclusions in the Espoo Convention."
"That is the least we must do."
"Mr President, I welcome the idea of a strategy for the Black Sea region as a pilot project for the macro-regional strategies."
"Initiatives of this kind allow the coordination of EU policy instruments in order to have a coherent, stable and sustainable development of the regions involved."
"On the occasion of the last Council, it was said that a strategy would have been developed for the Black Sea region by the end of 2009."
"This is an extremely important initiative as it can bring about harmonised development and prosperity for the region that, in comparison with the Black Sea area, is far more complex in terms of actors involved and relevant for security, stability, energy and the environment."
"So I would like to ask the Swedish Presidency when such a strategy for the Black Sea region will be delivered, and when Parliament will be informed and involved in this issue."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner Samecki, as a newly elected member from Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania, I very much support the development of a Baltic Sea Strategy and the associated action plan."
"The Commissioner referred earlier to the flagship projects, 80 in total."
"Our common objectives are, of course, to improve the competitiveness of our economy in the Baltic Sea area, taking particular account of the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and of a common energy policy which also takes account of renewable energies."
"That raises the question of how we deal with offshore installations in the Baltic Sea."
"Maintaining clean water, because that is our foundation and our resource, plays a very, very important role here, when we think of fisheries and when we think of tourism."
"That is why investments in treatment plants need to be promoted."
"I think a common planning programme needs to be agreed for all Member States in the Baltic Sea area, because we need to answer the following questions: where will traffic routes be positioned in future?"
"Where will offshore installations be built?"
"How will safety at sea be addressed?"
"That is why we also need to be clear on where the energy routes will be for Nord Stream, for the supply of electricity, and on many other things."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members for the great level of support that you have given us for our continued work on the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"It is only natural that we should be supported by the European Parliament, because in fact you were the founding fathers of the whole idea of a strategy for the Baltic Sea area and I am pleased that you are also going to ensure that this strategy becomes a reality."
"It can only be a success - it can only become real, and not just fine words and rhetoric - if all the Member States genuinely acknowledge ownership and feel a real responsibility for ensuring that the project is realised."
"Success will be guaranteed by working on these projects, setting clear timetables for when they are to be realised and carrying out regular checks."
"I am sure that, just like the Commission, Parliament will continue to put pressure on us to ensure this actually comes to fruition."
"One hundred million people live in this region."
"At any given moment, there are 2 000 ships in the Baltic Sea."
"It is clear that we face enormous challenges here."
"We have had a very broad foundation process and I would like to thank the Commission - first Mrs Hübner and now Commissioner Samecki - for the work they have put in."
"There is a great deal of support in civil society and among the municipalities around the Baltic Sea for us to achieve this."
"Some Members, Mrs Krehl and Mr Itälä, have raised the matter of resources."
"It is not intended that any new funds will be earmarked for the strategy."
"However, there are plenty of resources in the region that we can use."
"EUR 55 million has been earmarked for the region under the existing budgetary framework."
"We also know that we can hope for contributions from international institutions such as the EIB, which has shown great interest in the Baltic Sea region."
"The aim is to keep all administrative costs as low as possible and to work with those who have responsibility locally and nationally for the various flagship projects."
"One of these concerns trafficking - an area mentioned by Mrs Jäätteenmäki."
"There is a project that involves strengthening the training of customs and police officers in the region in order to be better able to identify and work on the issue of trafficking."
"Mrs Hassi and Mrs Lövin mentioned the matter of the marine environment, agriculture and fisheries."
"There are a number of such projects here and I would very much like to see more of them."
"I also believe that the strategy could provide the opportunity to gain a better overview of our environmental efforts and our fisheries and agriculture policy and to ensure that they work towards the same ends."
"There are also other partnerships in the Baltic region."
"We have an extensive and growing energy policy partnership in which we aim to link up the energy infrastructure in the region, to reduce dependence and improve efficiency."
"Naturally, this is something that the Union will continue to work on."
"The Ignalina plant has nothing to do with the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"That was an old decision that already existed from the time of Lithuania's accession negotiations."
"Neither does Nord Stream have anything to do with this."
"Naturally it is related to the Baltic Sea, but it is not part of the strategy."
"It is a commercial project that has been examined in accordance with current international environmental conventions and relevant national legislation."
"The Baltic Sea Strategy is an internal EU strategy."
"It will be what we make it."
"However, it is also important - as a number of Members have pointed out - that third countries are involved."
"We have ensured that we keep countries such as Russia and Norway involved and that we tell them about our work on the strategy as well as signalling to them that we would like to work in partnership with them on specific projects in which we have a common interest."
"We are looking forward to the conference tomorrow and on Friday and are pleased that Vice-President Wallis is coming to Stockholm."
"At the conference, we will discuss the strategy for the Baltic Sea area and we hope to gain a strong commitment from the countries concerned to work towards this becoming a reality, as well as discussing macroregions in general."
"The Danube region and the Black Sea region have been mentioned in this connection."
"I believe that there is a great deal to do here and a great deal that can inspire us."
"We hope to be able to move forward in the discussion, although it is a little too early to set actual timetables at present."
"Once again, I would like to thank Parliament for its strong support for the Baltic Sea Strategy and I look forward to discussing this with Members on future occasions."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for their comments and remarks on different aspects of the strategy."
"Your level of commitment demonstrates that the strategy will be a subject of interest in the forthcoming years, which is good."
"I will be unable to respond to all comments and issues raised in the debate or in your statements."
"I would like just to refer to three broad groups of issues."
"First, the shape."
"I would like to say that the strategy has been designed in line with the objectives and intentions of Member States."
"The Commission did not interfere in the selection of priorities."
"The Commission did not shape the priorities, so the ideas of including certain projects or modifying certain priorities is, of course, possible."
"However, it is to be agreed in the future work related to the implementation of the strategy."
"I want to assure you that the strategy is a kind of living animal and it is, to a great extent, exposed to future modifications should Member States and stakeholders wish so."
"Second point: on management and governance."
"Here I would like to underline that there is a need for a clear division of tasks, for a clear division of labour and responsibilities."
"I think that we should not delude ourselves."
"The responsibilities of Member States, of the Commission and of other organisations involved in the management."
"At this moment, I would also add that we want to involve local governments in the process of implementing the strategy as well as third countries, as was already mentioned by the Minister."
"Of course we foresee reporting concerning progress made in relation to implementation to Parliament."
"Finally, the last issue is financing."
"Several Members mentioned the need for additional funds for new projects etc. I want to explain that the principle of no new additional financing was adopted at the very beginning of the creation of the strategy."
"At present, we have more or less three options."
"We can regulate the use of existing EU funds, for example, by changing criteria for selecting new projects."
"The second possibility is having recourse to other sources like international financial institutions and finally, although it is difficult at a time of economic recession, we can still try to use national resources."
"In this respect, I look forward to the work of the conference to be held in Stockholm because this is the conference which may shape the future approach of Member States and the Commission to the macro-regional approach in the future and it should also embrace the financing of potential future strategies."
"That is why I feel that it will be a good moment to look at the overall macro-regional approach in Stockholm in the forthcoming days."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Sweden, the country to hold the presidency, for having had the courage to make its own region, the Baltic Sea, and matters relating to it, such a major topic in its programme during its EU presidential term."
"It is fitting that the Baltic Sea Strategy that we have been preparing for so long is being dealt with now: there is no time to lose."
"The central aim of the Baltic Sea Strategy and the Action Programme to improve the region's environment and competitiveness must be taken seriously in terms of the funding allocated to it and the measures implemented."
"The objectives must be realised in practice: the strategy must not just remain a fancy declaration."
"We hope in particular that the strategy will expedite the clean up of the Baltic Sea, which is suffering from eutrophication, and help find common solutions to cross border challenges."
"It is on account of these very objectives that all eyes are now turned to Finland, where soon it will be decided whether or not to allow the construction of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in its territorial waters."
"Under the Baltic Sea Strategy, the environmental impact of projects such as these must be investigated using a procedure that is legally binding internationally so that the matter cannot just be shrugged off."
"We must therefore insist that Russia ratifies the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context that it signed in 1991, and the Finnish Government should make this a condition of processing the gas pipeline's construction permit."
"Russia, which also benefits from the Baltic Sea Strategy, only acts according to the agreement when it suits it."
"This cannot go on any longer: the stakes are too high, and we have to know about projects that are harmful to the Baltic Sea before it is too late."
"in writing. - The Baltic Sea Strategy promoted by the Swedish Presidency is very welcome."
"It could readily assume a model function for other European macroregions, like the Danube basin."
"There is, however, one aspect of the development of the Baltic Sea region that demands urgent reconsideration."
"This is the Nord Stream sea-bed pipeline between Russia and Germany."
"Not only is the pipeline the source of serious environmental concern, but - even more urgently - it is a project that has been overtaken by time."
"The future is not in fixed means of delivering natural gas - via pipelines - but through liquefied natural gas."
"Nord Stream has every likelihood of being a wholly unnecessary white elephant, and its protagonists should reconsider the project before more money and more resources, effort and energy are tied up in it."
"The Baltic Sea Strategy announced in June 2009 aims to establish it as a region which is environmentally friendly, prosperous, easily accessible, attractive and secure."
"This is particularly important in the context of the increasing challenges facing the Baltic since the EU's enlargement in 2004."
"It is important to take action aimed at improving the region's environmental situation, as it is one of the most polluted marine areas in the world at the moment."
"Thousands of tonnes of toxic warfare agents lie on the sea bed encased in mines, bullets, bombs, containers and barrels."
"Estimates as to the quantities of these chemicals range from 30 000 to 60 000 tonnes, of which Yprite alone is estimated to make up 13 000 tonnes."
"Chemical weapons were sunk here after World War II in the late 1940s."
"They had been captured in the German occupation zones, and as burying them underground was difficult, the decision was made simply to sink them into the sea."
"Disturbing the chemical weapons lying at the bottom of the Baltic by building any kind of infrastructure could result in environmental disaster, and particularly the disturbance of chemical weapons from World War II during construction of the Baltic gas pipeline is one of the greatest threats to the ecosystem."
"That is why an assessment of the effect of building the pipeline on the natural environment of the Baltic Sea basin is necessary."

"Election of President of Commission (vote)"
"(FR) Mr President ..."
"(The speaker was interrupted by heckling from the right)"
"Are you ill or something?"
"Are you ill?"
"As there were problems with the vote yesterday, I would ask you to check the machines."
"It is not such a bad idea, is it, ladies and gentlemen?"
"As proposed, we are carrying out a trial vote, i.e. a vote to check that we all have cards, we are all seated properly and that the equipment is working."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to repeat: once every five years the European Parliament decides who will lead another European Union institution."
"Today's agenda includes electing the President of the European Commission."
"This election will strengthen the democratic nature of our institution."
"It is we, the elected representatives of all European regions, who will do this."
"The Council of Europe has nominated José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission."
"In accordance with Rule 105(2) of the Rules of Procedure, Parliament may approve or reject the nominated candidate by a majority vote."
"The ballot is secret."
"Let us now proceed to elect the President of the Commission in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will be held using the electronic system."
"I would like to repeat that you can vote from any position in the plenary hall as long as you place your voting card into the personal voting device."
"I say this because there are many new MEPs in the House."
"As usual, in the vote you may vote for or against the candidate, or abstain."
"(The vote is held)"
"Here are the results of the vote: 718 Members voted, 382 in favour, 219 against and 117 abstentions."
"(Loud applause)"
"According to the results we will see on the board - they are not visible yet - the Council's nominee, José Manuel Barroso, has been elected President of the European Commission."
"I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the president-elect on being voted to the position of President of the Commission."
"I would like to say that we have plenty of work ahead of us."
"We will have to face challenges, and our citizens expect us to act very energetically and to live up to their expectations."
"Mr President, I know that you are aware of the priorities of the European Parliament."
"Following the discussions, which we also held within our political groups, like yesterday, you know our expectations."
"For that reason, we greatly look forward to working with you over the coming five years."
"We expect above all to be able to respond to our citizens' needs."
"I congratulate you once again, and you may now take the floor, if you would like to say a few words to us."
"Congratulations, and all the best!"
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my most heartfelt thanks for the great confidence you have shown in me."
"I am hugely honoured and very moved by your confidence, and I take it with a great sense of responsibility."
"I also take this vote of confidence as a sign that this Parliament agrees with the ambitious agenda that I am presenting for Europe over the next five years."
"As I said during the discussions before the vote, I would like to work with all the political groups that sign up to this project, which aspires to a Europe of solidarity and freedom."
"I must, however, give special thanks to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which ran the risk of endorsing my programme in Warsaw before the elections, in an attempt right from the outset to give greater expression to European parliamentary democracy."
"As I said in this Chamber yesterday and at other times recently, as President of the Commission, my party will be Europe and it will be made up of all those who want to come on this exciting journey to make a united Europe."
"These are the people with whom I would like to form the consensus that we need to enhance the European project."
"Please also allow me on this occasion to say a few words to my own country, Portugal."
"Without the initiative and support of its Government and Prime Minister José Sócrates, I could not have stood for election."
"I would like to thank Portugal for its support, which was also passed on to me by the President of the Republic, Professor Cavaco Silva."
"I would like to acknowledge the support of every single one of those ardent Europeans who believe in this project for Europe."
"Finally, I would like to reiterate to you, Mr President, and to all Members of this House, my sincere determination to work closely with you during the next five years so that you can build a stronger European parliamentary democracy."
"I believe that the European Parliament and the European Commission, as typical Community institutions, have a special duty towards our citizens."
"That is exactly what I have said I will do and that is exactly what I am going to do - a stronger Europe for freedom and solidarity."
"(Applause)"
"I have an official statement."
"Under Rule 105(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I shall inform the Council of our results of 10 minutes ago, and would like to ask the Council and the newly-elected President of the Commission to propose jointly the nominees for the posts of Commissioners."
"In view of the amount of work ahead of us, we should work as quickly as possible."
"This was the official statement related to the election of Mr Barroso as President of the European Commission."

"Today we are facing an unusually important, but also symbolic vote."
"Once every five years, the European Parliament decides who will head another EU institution."
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(FR) Mr President, yesterday the President, quite rightly, made much of respect for the Community method."
"This method guarantees the involvement of all Member States, and Community institutions, in the decision-making processes, and this from the very beginning."
"The G4's way of tackling the banking and financial crisis in 2008 was the opposite of respect for the aforementioned method, which Mr Barroso called for yesterday afternoon."
"In 2008, we waited in vain for President Barroso to call for order."
"The European Union is of course France, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy - all members of the G4 - but it is also Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Luxembourg and so on, which were excluded from an important phase in the decision-making process in 2008."
"President Barroso, you should have enforced respect for the Community method in 2008, via the same statement you made yesterday."
"This is why I am unable to support your candidacy."
"Mr President, may I add a personal remark."
"It is difficult for those who have the floor to speak with this din all around."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after my speech I will say a few words in Neapolitan (Part not transcribed in this document, since Neapolitan is not an official language)."
"I will do so not for reasons of local colour, but to attract political and media attention to our emergencies: the emergencies of southern Italy."
"I voted for President Barroso, not least because I hope that he will be the President of the whole of Europe, including southern Italy."
"Located as it is in the middle of the Mediterranean, the South is the gateway to Europe and the link between different worlds."
"Through its history, geographical position and culture of hospitality, it can play an important role for the old continent as a whole."
"Southern Italy should be treated with the same dignity as other places in Europe and, now that it is experiencing difficulties, Europe must intervene as energetically as when it regularised 150 million citizens from the East, who became EU citizens."
"That operation came at a price, and if, today, a worker from Gdańsk earns 28 times more than he earned before, he also owes it to the economic effort of Italy and of southern Italy."
"(The speaker continued in Neapolitan)"
"Mr President, time has, perhaps, habituated us to the hollowness of the ritual that we have just carried out."
"Familiar as we are with the EU structures, we have ceased to see how anomalous, how outrageous, it is that we have supreme executive and legislative power in the hands of an unaccountable and unelected bureaucracy."
"The majority of laws in the Member States come from a European Commission whom nobody votes for and nobody can get rid of. The only bit that pretends to democratic authority is the rite that was just carried out in this Chamber, which I cannot help saying put me in mind of one of those occasional meetings of the People's Assembly in the old Comecon times where we all stand up and congratulate ourselves on having rubber-stamped the decision."
"I have no personal problems with José Manuel Barroso."
"If we are going to have a federalist President of the Commission - and I can see that is the will of the House - it might as well be him as anyone else."
"He seems a nice chap - and, like all British politicians, I am profoundly Lusophile and aware of our relationship with our oldest ally - but there is something farcical about the pretence that there is any democratic involvement in a system that puts a monopoly on the right to initiate law in the hands of people that we cannot vote for and cannot get rid of."
"Mr President, like my previous colleague who spoke earlier, I would like to say that I also have my reservations about Mr Barroso being re-elected as President of the Commission."
"After all, he more than anyone is committed to further European integration, often against the will of the peoples of Europe."
"But he did come to our group meeting, the ECR Group meeting, and explain that he was in favour of smart regulation."
"Now, of course, there is much doubt about what 'smart regulation' means."
"Many people believe that smart regulation is bad regulation, or that any regulation is not very smart regulation."
"But I would ask him, if he really is in favour of smart regulation, to make sure that, on every directive, the Commission carries out a proper economic impact assessment."
"We have going through this House next year the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive."
"The Commission has failed so far to conduct any proper economic impact assessment - in fact they say it cannot be done."
"How, under those circumstances, are we going to get smart regulation?"
"I ask Mr Barroso to reconsider."
"Mr President, I opposed the joint motion for a resolution on forest fires, despite the fact that I agree with European countries cooperating voluntarily to prevent, fight and repair the appalling damage caused by forest fires."
"However, I object to the creation of European Union bodies that would exercise power over Member States in areas that are wider than necessary to deal with this problem."
"I draw attention to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 of the joint motion for a resolution."
"This proposal is exploiting admirable humanitarian responses to the appalling tragedies that we have seen in order to take further steps towards the creation of the European protection force called 'Europe Aid' as outlined in the Barnier report."
"(NL) Mr President, I abstained in the final vote on this resolution, although I did do so with some reservation and a number of doubts, as this text does, without doubt, include many positive elements, things that no one can really oppose."
"I am thinking, for example, of the support for reinforcing the Member States' civil protection measures by means of the exchange of experts and working methods."
"Last summer, we saw once again that some forest fires assume such a scale that cooperation is necessary, but that cooperation between Member States takes place already."
"Such cooperation can, of course, be deepened further, but it is questionable what value there is, for example, in having a separate EU reaction force."
"Doing so simply takes resources from the Member States, creates yet another new EU body with its own staff and adds yet more bureaucracy."
"Written explanations of vote"
"President Barroso has made Europe the world leader in the fight against climate change."
"The European Union is the only international bloc that has a clear, consistent negotiating position for the Copenhagen conference."
"The political guidelines for the next Commission outlined by President Barroso present an ambitious, modern vision for Europe, to which the fight against climate change and the areas of the knowledge triangle are central."
"The challenges facing us are complex, and the responses must necessarily be holistic."
"For the post-2010 period, therefore, President Barroso is proposing a coordinated and convergent approach involving the Lisbon Strategy, energy and climate policy and social policy."
"New sources of growth and social cohesion are proposed, based on a new industrial strategy for Europe, a modern service sector and a dynamic rural economy."
"President Barroso thus prioritises the real economy and its modernisation through scientific research, technological development, innovation and the principles of sustainability."
"The Commission, under the leadership of President Barroso, in partnership with the European Parliament and the Council, will help to cultivate a prosperous, sustainable and socially advanced European Union."
"For the sake of political consistency and out of respect for our electorate, I voted against the re-election of Mr Barroso."
"In the five years of his mandate, Mr Barroso, who harnessed the support of certain EU countries for George W. Bush's war in Iraq, has never been able to revive the European Union or to strengthen it in the face of national self-interest."
"He did not measure up to the task when the financial, economic and social crisis occurred."
"All he has done in these five years is support the wayward paths taken by financial capitalism instead of proposing the new regulations Europe needs in the 21st century."
"The European Commission's policy needs to be reoriented."
"Mr Barroso is not the man for the job."
"His programme is no match for the scale of the current crisis: it lacks a European recovery plan, a pact for employment, regulation and effective supervision of the financial markets, and more robust and prompt instruments to correct the current imbalances."
"We need a directive on public services and a reoriented policy by the Commission on pay."
"If we want to save our European social model, we need a much more ambitious social agenda."
"I am pleased to say that, as a Portuguese and a Member of the European Parliament, I voted in favour of the re-election of José Manuel Durão Barroso as President of the European Commission."
"I believe his performance during the previous mandate, which was beset by so many political, financial and social difficulties, and the experience he acquired in this post, justified the support of the governments and the renewed confidence of this House."
"I deplore the many attempts - not all of them open or serious - to prevent his candidacy from succeeding, and I note that they were frustrated not only by a lack of any credible alternative but also by the foolishness of the arguments on which they were based."
"I regret that Members from my own country could not resist taking that path, which is as easy as it is inconsequential."
"I hope the second Barroso Commission can combine technical competence with that 'something extra'."
"I also hope it will effectively respect and make use of the principle of subsidiarity, and will choose the safety and solidity of taking small steps, as recommended by Jean Monnet, rather than adopting the fast-track approach that has promised much but contributed little to the real progress of the European project and dream."
"However much we aim for the horizon, we only get there by putting one foot in front of the other."
"Let us go the right way."
"I welcome the result of this vote, which brings Dr José Manuel Durão Barroso back to the European Commission Presidency."
"Portugal is proud to have a Portuguese of such recognised ability and quality as Dr Barroso at the head of the Commission."
"It is even prouder to see the value of his work during his first mandate, from 2004 to 2009."
"This value has been acknowledged by the European Parliament in this vote."
"In fact, he was elected by a very large majority, greater than that required by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Over the last five years, Dr Barroso showed strong, comprehensive leadership."
"The energy and climate change dossier, the Services Directive and the regulation on chemical substances are just a few examples of success and leadership."
"He was also at the forefront in the search for solutions and in concrete proposals to resolve the economic crisis that is still affecting us."
"The European Parliament has just sent out a signal that Europe is strong and has a strong leader."
"Therefore, with confidence and hope, we can advance towards a Europe of greater prosperity and solidarity."
"The political guidelines for the next mandate of the Commission, which have just been tabled, reveal its President's intention to continue pursuing the main lines of action that were included in the guidelines of the mandate that is now ending."
"Those guidelines lie at the origin of the deep economic and social crisis that we are now experiencing, the tragic consequences of which - unemployment, inequality, poverty and exclusion - have mercilessly afflicted the workers and peoples of Europe."
"In Portugal, the consequences of implementing the policies resulting from these guidelines have been the destruction or utter crippling of essential productive sectors - agriculture, fisheries and industry; the assault on workers' rights, the devaluation of wages and the corresponding increase in unemployment and insecure work; inequality in income distribution, which now clearly diverges from the EU average; and the failure of the policies of deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation of basic sectors, which have dismantled public services and commercialised essential aspects of our collective existence."
"Keeping these same guidelines means perpetuating the concentration of wealth, maintaining divergence instead of convergence, and causing further damaging eruptions of a latent systemic crisis to occur sooner rather than later."
"We would all like to see a stronger Europe, and for people to be better off!"
"You do too, judging by the 'Political guidelines for the next Commission' which you presented to Parliament."
"Yet more is expected from a candidate for the future head of the Commission: he is expected to say how he intends to achieve this, rather than just presenting a list of challenges."
"In fact, the goals are so wide-ranging that there is the danger of them ruling each other out, and there will definitely come a time when a choice will have to be made as to which of the priorities are 'more important'."
"For example, which would you choose if the aim of European economic competitiveness clashes with the aim of high levels of employment?"
"The text you sent us does not make this clear."
"I have the impression that your document is simply a wish-list of things that were not achieved in the previous term."
"The question is, why not?"
"I would, however, like to speak on the point about the Internet in your programme."
"You mention the importance of the Internet for economic development and the social cohesion of Europe, and even promise that the new Commission will develop a 'European Digital Agenda'."
"What I would like to know is how you intend to implement this idea in practice, and what the Agenda will contribute which is new compared to previous initiatives?"
"Like my friends representing the national movements in Europe, I am one of the 219 MEPs who voted against Mr Barroso."
"He is a likeable and cultured man, but most of all he is the symbol of the failure of the European Union."
"He has failed to save our economies and our jobs from unfair global competition; to help European countries come out of the crisis; to reform the financial system to curb unbridled speculation; to guarantee democracy; to ensure food self-sufficiency; and to curb the accelerated de-industrialisation of our countries."
"In a word, he has failed to demonstrate that the Europe of Brussels is more than a machine for grinding down, impoverishing and enslaving nations and peoples."
"On closer observation, the election of Mr Barroso is also a symbol: that of the way in which this Europe works."
"What sort of uproar would there be if, instead of the President of the Commission, who is going to influence the lives of 500 million Europeans through his policies, it was a Head of State who, despite being the sole candidate, was elected by little more than half of the votes?"
"Today I voted against Mr Barroso's candidacy for three essential reasons."
"Firstly, his own track record in the last five years: a Presidency which was weak, conservative and liberal, immobile in the face of the crisis, incapable of stimulating a coordinated recovery, and exclusively attentive to the wishes of the Heads of State or Government."
"José Manuel Barroso has certainly not furthered a strong Europe."
"Secondly, the inadequacy of his response to the conditions set by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament: providing neither a genuine recovery plan, nor a pact for employment, no regulation, supervision or effective instruments to correct the imbalances in the financial markets, and making not one commitment concerning a framework directive protecting public services."
"Finally, the messages sent out by voters during the European elections, which showed us that they no longer want a weakened, incomprehensible Europe, where compromise is considered a superior virtue to political direction."
"The election of the President of the European Commission is an extremely important act, and the citizens of the EU should have the right to know their representatives' choice."
"Personally speaking, I regret and condemn the secret ballot procedure that leads to a complete lack of accountability."
"Moreover, as I can find no common ground with the policy proposed by Mr Barroso, I confirm that I will not be supporting his appointment as President of the Commission."
"At the end of the five-year term (2004-2009), the assessment of the European Commission's activities does not cast President Barroso in a favourable light."
"Based on this fact, it seems necessary to abstain from voting, especially at a time when a negative vote would be an unwise political decision, given the lack of any alternative, while a positive vote would be tantamount to expressing unconditional and unjustified confidence in an unsatisfactory programme."
"I believe that the support being given to President Barroso by Member States is unarguable proof of the fact that he has not been a strong president, but rather one for whom national interests have taken priority, meaning that it has been national leaders who have set out the guidelines for his mandate."
"The European Commission needs a president to support the development of Community policies, constantly strive for integration and promote the concept of a United Europe."
"He must not be in any way an advocate for national interests."
"From a social-democratic perspective, President Barroso has not fulfilled a large number of the commitments made at the start of his mandate in 2004."
"Very little interest has been shown by the Commission in many of these, including the consolidation of a Social Europe."
"Consequently, I chose not to vote for President Barroso's reappointment."
"I voted in favour of appointing Mr Barroso as President of the European Commission."
"I have come to this decision for four reasons."
"The European Council unanimously proposed Mr Barroso's candidacy."
"In my understanding of democracy, election winners can claim the right to choose one of their own."
"There is no other choice but Mr Barroso; no alternative solution has been seriously considered."
"The criticisms directed at the outgoing President are mistaken about an essential fact, namely that the Commission is able to make proposals and that it is the Member States that lay them down."
"My support also comes with some expectations."
"In the course of his second term of office, Mr Barroso should be a little more independent minded, not least with regard to the large Member States, and the sole objective of his actions should be to serve the general interest of the Community."
"I regret that the Commission has a tendency to evolve into a conglomerate of commissioners, free to act as they please."
"I would ask Mr Barroso to use his influence to counteract this evolution."
"I would like the institution, as 'guardian of treaties', to regain its original strength, in other words, its capacity to show the way with rallying projects."
"Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission, is responsible for the current situation of financial, economic, food and environmental crisis in which Europe is immersed."
"To date, no one has recognised his error, and the blame has instead been placed on the United States."
"To date, the Commission has tried to build a Europe based on policies of privatisation and dismantling of the social state."
"The Commission adopted the Lisbon Strategy, which predicted economic growth of 3% and the creation of 20 million jobs by 2010."
"The failure of this strategy is clear."
"Despite that, the Commission is proposing to renew this strategy and continue with these policies, which are the cause of the crisis."
"This crisis is not a pandemic; it is the result of a gamble on one specific policy: the policy adopted by the European Commission."
"Its foreign policy programme makes no reference to the Sahara or Palestine."
"These issues are not only not its priorities, but the EU is planning to grant advanced status to the Kingdom of Morocco and to upgrade relations with the State of Israel."
"The work carried out by President Barroso over the last five years was characterised by great pragmatism, seriousness and firmness in the way he looked after Europe's top interests."
"His world leadership in combating climate change, the timeliness of increasing Europeans' involvement with the oceans through the launch of the new European maritime policy, and his ability to generate consensus on the financial perspective in a Europe of 27 are a few examples that justify keeping him at the head of the European Commission."
"Economic growth, investment in innovation and training, and fighting unemployment are fundamental pillars for Europe's integration to continue, and they are also Mr Barroso's priorities for the future."
"At a time when the world economic and financial situation is not at its best, Europe needs a strong leader who can breathe life into the European project."
"For all the above reasons and many others, I believe Mr Barroso is the ideal president to guide the EU's destiny in the forthcoming term of office."
"Like 381 of my fellow Members, I supported Mr Barroso's appointment as head of the Commission."
"I did so for many reasons, not least because some people are levelling particularly unfair accusations against the candidate."
"I hear some dream of a new Delors, while they forget that we have changed the world... and Europe."
"The Europe of the 12, of Kohl and Mitterrand, is no more and will doubtless never return."
"The first President of a Commission of 25, then of 27, Mr Barroso had the delicate task of handling the enlargement of 2004, a mandate marked by consolidation."
"The second will be one of ambition."
"I hope it will be so and I want to give him the credit for this."
"I want to refuse to play the game of sorcerer's apprentice, to refuse to wait, not for Godot, but for another hypothetical candidate that the Council has no intention of putting forward."
"I want to refuse to wait and to further weaken our institutions and the reputation that Europe still enjoys among Europeans."
"So yes, we will expect him to keep his promises, such as combating climate change and discrimination, and the urgent concerted action in the face of the economic and social crisis."
"To postpone this vote one more time would be to bark up the wrong tree."
"To wait for a phantom candidate would be a mistake."
"A strong, ambitious Commission Presidency is essential for Europe to regain its position as world leader by seeking a balance between economic and political goals on one hand and social and territorial cohesion on the other."
"Priorities must be defined pragmatically but without neglecting the values that lie at the origin of the European project."
"We have a number of challenges ahead, such as reforming the Community budget, which Europe must address by showing that it is able to set the world agenda on various topics including the fight against climate change and the regulation of financial markets."
"At a time when unemployment is soaring in several Member States, it is vital to seek a sustainable way out of the current economic and social crisis."
"This goal should unite the Member States around the principle of solidarity and the strengthening of the European single market."
"Since I believe that José Manuel Durão Barroso has the qualities that will allow him to continue to successfully fulfil the expectations that we have placed in him, since I think the fact that he holds the post is an honour for Portugal, and since I see it as an advantage for a small, isolated, distant and outermost region like Madeira to have someone in the Commission who thoroughly understands its reality, I support his new candidacy for the post of President of the European Commission."
"I voted against the re-appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the European Commission as, for the past five years, he has been the very symbol of a Commission that chose to disregard the democratic rejection of the Treaty of Lisbon and did so contemptuously and in a particularly arrogant fashion."
"Mr Barroso also repeatedly argued for a new wave of mass immigration and constantly played down the problems associated with the possible accession of Turkey to the EU."
"It is also telling that Mr Barroso yesterday refused to answer a justified question from a British Member about his intentions with regard to a European Commissioner for Human Rights - an internal one within the EU, that is."
"Big Brother Europe marches on, but apparently no one is to know, and that includes MEPs."
"in writing. - Although it is not the norm for me to abstain, I felt that, for today's vote on the election of the President of the Commission, abstention was the right choice."
"I accept that Mr Barroso has made some concessions, for example, on the issue of social impact assessments."
"However, Mr Barroso has failed to show commitment in putting forward proposals of importance to the S&D Group - for example, a strengthening of the Posted Workers Directive, a directive of vital importance for the protection of Welsh workers."
"We also need more commitment about the portfolios given to newly appointed commissioners and a clear explanation from Mr Barroso about the organisation of the next college."
"I do not believe that Mr Barroso's pledge to fight social dumping in Europe is far-reaching enough, and it is for this reason, as well as the abovementioned, that I took the decision to abstain on this vote."
"I voted against Mr Barroso's candidacy, above all, because I believe in a genuinely political Europe, which cannot be satisfied with a Commission bound by the desiderata of big business."
"I also believe that one cannot campaign by calling for another form of European leadership only to then give a blank cheque to a champion of liberalism whose programme is sorely lacking in ambition and values."
"A man who has taken shelter behind the idea of 'better regulation' in order to 'deregulate' everything that I, as a socialist, defend: public services, social protection of workers, respect for health systems, regulation of the financial economy and protection of consumers and of the environment against the power of industrial groups."
"Out of respect for my own convictions and those of the electorate, I feel that these values cannot be called into question by ulterior motives and tricks aimed at obtaining derisory concessions from conservatives who control the majority of the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission, and who will not rest until they have furthered their deregulatory policy."
"Although the vote on the President of the European Commission is secret, I would like to express publicly my support for the candidate from our political family, José Manuel Barroso, and sincerely to congratulate him on his re-election."
"As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) won the European elections, it is quite natural that the President of the future Commission should come from our ranks."
"Therefore, despite the futile unrest among the divided left and the Greens, who did not, however, have a candidate to put forward, Mr Barroso was comfortably re-elected."
"I also welcome his reaffirmed commitment to work in close cooperation with our Assembly, within which he can count on our determination and our support each time the proposals of our European project have to go to the vote."
"Parliament and the Commission will now be able to set to work without delay, which was the most important thing at this difficult time, where there are many challenges to take up swiftly for the sake of all Europeans."
"Moreover, while Europe is involved in the G20 and climate negotiations, it must be united and in good working order: today's clear, unambiguous vote also strengthens it in the face of the other world powers."
"I voted for the European Parliament resolution of 16 September 2009 on the forest fires of summer 2009."
"This resolution follows numerous others highlighting the frequency, the seriousness, the complexity and the impact of natural and man-made disasters in Europe, the number of which has increased rapidly in the last few years."
"The forest fire phenomenon is aggravated by rural depopulation, the progressive abandonment of traditional activities, poor forest management, the existence of vast expanses of forest planted with one single species, the planting of non-adapted tree species, the absence of an effective prevention policy, the levity of penalties imposed in cases of arson, and the flawed implementation of laws forbidding illegal construction and guaranteeing reforestation."
"It is regrettable that, despite Parliament's demands, the Commission has not taken steps to create a European civil protection force, and I welcome the action of my friend Mr Barnier, who has long been proposing this facility."
"Finally, at a time when private insurance companies do not offer fire cover for forests, it is becoming imperative, faced with the private sector's failure to act, to consider a public/private collective instrument to insure forests against storms and fire."
"Unfortunately, conditions of extreme drought and forest fires in southern Europe have been growing both more frequent and more intense."
"Immense damage has been caused in terms of loss of human life (11 people have died just this summer), reduced economic activity and environmental degradation, particularly through an increase in the rate of desertification, in that some 400 000 hectares of European forests have disappeared every year over the last decade."
"Climate change is contributing to the increase in natural disasters, but many cases are still unforeseeable or are caused by criminal acts."
"Scientific research therefore needs to be developed so as to improve risk assessment procedures, fire prevention systems and fire-fighting facilities, and the requisite financial resources must also be released."
"We need a European strategy to combat natural disasters, as well as greater interoperability and coordination among the various Community instruments."
"The Member States should enhance their cooperation and coordination so as to guarantee solidarity and the availability of additional rapid mobilisation resources to fight these disasters."
"I call on the Presidency of the Council to make an urgent decision on the regulation for the new Solidarity Fund, in order to increase transparency and make its mobilisation more flexible in an emergency."
"Southern Europe has been the victim of disasters (drought and fires) that have threatened human lives, economies and local ecosystems and are contributing to the gradual abandonment of extensive areas that were once populated, worked and cared for."
"Rather than being a problem for one country or another, this issue and its serious consequences have now become cross-border in nature and clearly deserve a response at European level."
"As I have said previously, the European Union will benefit if it remains united even in adversity and if it is able to mobilise resources such as the Solidarity Fund as well as systems and methods to avert the causes and mitigate the consequences of these scourges and to provide a flexible, prompt and suitable response to them."
"In addition to the European Commission, which should adopt a leading role in seeking solutions and implementing best practice, the whole forestry sector should be called on to share knowledge, define solutions and point to ways to help diversify the activities associated with forests."
"A Portuguese nursery rhyme says a tree is a friend."
"The European Union should repay this friendship and thus support the future of rural areas."
"The reason why I voted in favour is linked to the need for effective solidarity and the immediate mobilisation of financial resources, so as to be able, with all due urgency, to tackle the socially and environmentally tragic situation that has befallen the areas and communities affected by this summer's fires."
"I believe, however, that the resolution should place greater emphasis on the effects of certain Community policies, particularly the common agricultural policy, which lead people to abandon the land and productive systems, and on activities which contribute to a preventive approach to the problem of fires."
"The consequences of the CAP, particularly in countries like Portugal, are among the underlying causes of the fires which today devastate vast areas of land year after year."
"I believe, however, that this possible and desirable cooperation among Member States in fighting forest fires should not be used to pave the way for removing important aspects of Member States' individual sovereignty, namely in terms of civil protection and measures for controlling and intervening in their own territory."
"Once again this summer, forest fires have devastated the south of France."
"Like our other European neighbours, our citizens have found themselves battling flames, these disasters resulting in both material damage and human suffering."
"This is why I have advocated the setting up of an independent and permanent European reaction force, whose task would be to assist Member States and regions affected by fires and other disasters."
"Equally, we need - and this is also the appeal we have made to the Commission - a strategy which allows us to conserve the rich ecosystems in our natural parks, be it the Bauges, Ardèche or Lubéron, with the whole undertaking relying on funding designed for preventive measures and actions to re-establish the damaged ecosystem."
"Recourse to the CAP might be justified to prevent the spread of forest fires, which are too often the result of abundant undergrowth in some areas."
"Finally, I have also advocated mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, a fund that today is blocked by the Council even though it is needed desperately."
"Mr President, in Monday's debate on the forest fires during the summer of 2009, I said that natural conditions will alter with climate change."
"That is a fact that cannot be contradicted."
"It does not, however, explain environmental disasters, especially if the same phenomena recur every few years."
"We can and must be better prepared."
"That is why I had to vote against my group's position today with regard to Amendment 5 and, to be perfectly honest, that position puzzles me greatly."
"It really is time the Member States of the Union took a look in the mirror."
"One feels fully justified in saying that the destruction caused by forest fires could have been prevented if certain Member States had developed and implemented more effective preventive measures and worked harder to stop criminal activity in the acquisition of more land to build on."
"Our political environment cannot be one where people close their eyes to the facts."
"This benefits nobody, especially when it concerns the scale of the human tragedy resulting from forest fires."
"It has been suggested that climate change is one cause of the increase in the number of forest fires, and it is true that Europe will have to prepare for longer forest fire seasons than just June to September which, until now, has been the norm."
"Summers are beginning earlier and they are warmer and drier, especially in the south, and the risk of fires is therefore growing."
"The problem of fires itself, however, lies not in any progressive change to natural conditions, but elsewhere."
"It is one thing to adapt to the changing environment; it is quite another to accept rigid bad practices and be unprepared."
"In Greece, 130 000 olive trees were destroyed by the fires, as well as many hectares of vines, cattle, beekeeping holdings, storehouses, stables and a large number of greenhouses and houses."
"In Spain, 95 769 hectares have been burnt by forest fires, causing 11 deaths and estimated losses of EUR 395 million."
"The social, economic and environmental damage caused by the fires to local economies, productive activity and tourism is huge, rendering necessary support for affected citizens and the re-establishment of previous environmental conditions through immediate national and Community intervention."
"We urge the Commission to mobilise the current EU Solidarity Fund without delay and make available the resources needed for the purpose of supporting rehabilitation plans for the affected areas, the restoration of their productive potential and the full reforestation of the burnt areas."
"The deforestation is partly due to the construction of roads and railway lines."
"The Commission must promote measures so that public works financed by EU funds include an amount of public investment for the improvement, maintenance and increase of public forest."
"Unfortunately, the summer of 2009 was marked by devastating forest fires in southern Europe, which caused huge material and ecological damage."
"It was clear in this context that arsonists, who profit by destroying forests, are encouraged by shortcomings in or the lack of forest registers, or by poorly defined land use."
"It was therefore important in this motion for a resolution to call on the Member States to revise or amend these registers."
"In addition to reforestation, cooperation between experts, fire brigades and other groups deployed is required both in emergencies and for prevention."
"This motion for a resolution contains logical proposals, such as how the Member States can be supported in a disaster in accordance with the principle of solidarity."
"That is why I voted for the joint motion for a resolution on the forest fires in the summer of 2009."
"We must say straightaway that preventing natural disasters and adapting to climate change is not an easy task."
"Even if the European Union fares somewhat better than other regions of the world with the creation of a strengthened civil protection mechanism and the financial godsend represented by the Solidarity Fund, more than 600 000 hectares are destroyed each year."
"I am not just talking about the forest fires in the Mediterranean Basin, the worst of which were those of summer 2009 in the uplands around Athens."
"For me, two proposals seem essential to improve the situation."
"Firstly, Mr Barnier's report of 2006 on a European civil protection force must be implemented in full."
"We are still waiting for the European green helmets to be set up to give substance to a European policy for civil protection voted for by citizens."
"Secondly, it is important for the Commission to have a right to oversee what is happening locally."
"It would be surprising to say the least if European grants were paid when some forest fires were probably started by criminals with the sole aim of preparing the land for development."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on forest fires."
"So far this year, over 200 000 hectares of forest have been destroyed by fire in the European Union."
"That is more than in the whole of 2008!"
"In Poland, the coefficient of the threat of forest fires is one of the highest in Europe."
"In April 2009, the number of fires was the highest in five years."
"We must take urgent and effective measures to counter climate change, which is one of the causes of the fires."
"Another important issue in the adopted resolution is that of coordinating EU mechanisms for the prevention of climate change and, in particular, the effective use of the Solidarity Fund to limit the consequences of fires."
"We need to set up a European reaction force capable of acting quickly in case of natural disasters."
"This would be a financial and organisational completion of the actions undertaken in the Member States."
"I hope that the Parliamentary resolution on fighting the effects of fires will be duly considered by the European Commission and mobilised to intensify its own actions in this field."
"in writing. - Today's debate on forest fires in welcomed."
"The devastation to many sites of natural beauty is a loss to us all."
"We must show solidarity with our colleagues and help the countries affected."
"As a result of the reforestation promoted by the regional government, along with initiatives by environmental protection organisations, recent studies show that the forests of Madeira have increased by almost 5 000 hectares in the last 36 years, an achievement that is all the more noteworthy because it goes against the national trend."
"This inestimably valuable heritage must be protected and, while we certainly need to be prepared to respond to forest fires, I feel it is essential to balance the allocation of resources across fire prevention, detection and actual fire fighting."
"I voted in favour of this resolution since I believe this policy can be promoted at European level through a strategy of solidarity that seeks to coordinate fire response and the effective prevention of hazardous forms of behaviour."
"With special emphasis on the outermost regions, this approach should involve both the authorities and the owners of forested land in cleaning up woodlands, planting native species and repopulating rural areas."
"Criminal behaviour should also be suitably punished at a national level."
"Flexibility in the implementation of procedures associated with the use of existing structural funds or new ones, such as the EU Solidarity Fund, will allow a swifter response to be given to people affected by the loss of farmland, homes and livestock as a result of fires and other disasters."
"I abstained from the final vote on the compromise resolution on the aftermath of the forest fires in 2009."
"This was because I note that the majority in this Parliament believes that combating forest fires at the European level should not be restricted to support and coordination but that, in reality, a kind of separate European fire-fighting corps would have to be established, yet another European body that would cost vast sums in order to duplicate work already performed by others."
"It is, in any case, an illustration of the fact that the Euro-federalists are less concerned about efficiently and competently managing our continent and more concerned about making a statement, namely that everything must be regulated at the European level - in spite of the principle of subsidiarity that we hear acclaimed so frequently."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Financial services (signature of the acts)"
"Under the codecision procedure, legislative acts are signed by the President of the European Parliament and the current Presidency representing the Council."
"Before resuming the sitting, a legislative package will be signed to make it effective."
"Cecilia Malmström, the Minister for European Affairs, will sign on behalf of the Council."
"I am very pleased that Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner is also with us today."
"I would like to say a few words on the legislation we are about to sign today."
"Today, the eve of the extraordinary summit of the European Union in preparation for the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh is a good occasion to strengthen the role of the European Parliament as co-legislator."
"I have been asked to represent the European Parliament at the dinner of Heads of State or Government."
"We, the European Union, will be preparing for our participation in the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh."
"Today we have an important package of four different legislative acts under the codecision procedure approved by us in response to the financial crisis."
"What is in the package?"
"A capital requirements directive, a regulation on credit rating agencies, a new regulation on cross-border payments, and a decision establishing a new programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and audit."
"The directive and the regulations are aimed at protecting EU investors and the European Union's financial system, and at increasing consumer rights guarantees and ensuring better supervision."
"These acts are aimed at stabilising the financial markets."
"We are thereby fulfilling the predictions, but the legislation we are signing was drawn up by Parliament in the previous term."
"Would Minister Malmström like to take the floor before signing the legislative acts?"
"Mr President, we are now going to sign a number of legal acts that are absolutely central to the EU's response to the financial and economic crisis that has hit Europe so hard and that will continue to have an impact."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Czech Presidency, which worked very hard to get these acts in place within a short time."
"It was thanks to the Czech Presidency that we managed to bring about quickly such successful cooperation between the Council and Parliament, as well as quick, effective agreements."
"As I mentioned previously, we are cautiously optimistic about the economic situation, but we also know that unemployment will hit many countries very hard in the coming period."
"There is therefore still reason for Parliament, the Council and the Commission to work closely with each other."
"I am looking forward to our cooperation and I am proud to be able to sign these acts along with you, Mr President."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that what we are doing is an expression of the continuity of the functions of the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"There have, in the meantime, been elections to the European Parliament which have in no way impeded our activities or our work."
"I would like to now ask Minister Malmström to proceed with the joint signing, which will be done at this table."
"I also invite Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, Mrs Berès and Mrs Bowles - the previous and current Commissioners on Economic and Monetary Affairs - I would ask both of you to come here to the middle, and the rapporteurs, who include Mr Karas and Mr Gauzès."
"You will all be present at the signing, and the Minister and I will sign."
"I would also like to point out that Mrs Starkevičiūtand Mr Hoppenstedt are former rapporteurs, but are no longer in the European Parliament, as they were Members during the previous term of office."
"We shall now proceed to the signing."

"Conclusion of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EC and the Republic of Tajikistan (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the Council and Commission statements on the conclusion of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EC and the Republic of Tajikistan and"
"the recommendation by Alojz Peterle, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Tajikistan, of the other part"
"(12475/2004 - 11803/2004 - C6-0118/2005 -."
"Madam President, honourable Members, Commissioner, Mr Peterle, I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to discuss the EU's links with Tajikistan and, in particular, the importance we place on laying a new foundation for our relations with the country by entering into a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"I know that Parliament has a strong interest in this issue."
"As far back as February 2008, in your resolution on an EU strategy for Central Asia, you called on the Member States to ratify the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement quickly - thereby confirming Parliament's intention to approve the agreement within the near future."
"Now the Agreement has been ratified and there is a strong desire to move on with the remaining steps as quickly as possible, so that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement can enter into force as soon as possible, hopefully before the end of the year."
"If so, it would send a clear signal that we are opening a new chapter in our relations between the European Union and Tajikistan."
"Tajikistan is an important part of our overall strategy for Central Asia."
"This hardly accessible country is one of the poorest in the world."
"It has a poorly maintained border with Afghanistan, making it a major route for drug smuggling and a way into the region for radical Islamists."
"Consequently, we have a great interest in supporting Tajikistan, both for its own sake and in order to solve our common problems."
"We are already doing this through a number of contacts."
"The Swedish Presidency sent a high level group to the region in July, and a ministerial conference with Central Asia was held in Brussels yesterday."
"However, Tajikistan is one of very few countries on the EU's eastern border with which we have not yet concluded an overall agreement since the Cold War ended."
"If we seriously want to get to grips with the issues that I mentioned, we need to create a suitable framework for our future relations."
"The arrangements for political dialogue and practical cooperation with Tajikistan must be improved so as to better reflect the shared challenges faced by the region."
"A Partnership and Cooperation Agreement would provide us with a more structured way of discussing matters in which we have a shared interest: human rights, the rule of law, the drugs trade and organised crime, as well as terrorism and religious organisation."
"At the same time, we need to make progress on issues relating to democracy, good social management and human rights in the region."
"We are well aware that this is no easy task."
"I therefore very much welcome the structured dialogue with Tajikistan on human rights that is providing an opportunity to conduct a proper discussion."
"The second round of this dialogue will take place in Dushanbe on 23 September."
"We must continue to encourage Tajikistan to introduce a programme of reforms."
"Developments are often very worrying."
"We would like to see a more democratic approach within the country as regards freedom of organisation, religious freedom, freedom of the media and the development of civil society."
"We must do our utmost to convince Tajikistan that the rule of law must be observed in the fight against illegal activities, the drugs trade and terrorism."
"We must emphasise that human rights and basic freedoms must be respected as a way of preventing ethnic or cultural conflicts."
"We are also very worried about the extensive corruption that is to be found in the country."
"It is hindering not only development in Tajikistan, but also effective contributions from donors."
"We should use every channel available to appeal to the Tajik authorities to tackle this problem as quickly as possible."
"We cannot ignore the fact that all the transit routes for the drugs trade - or a great many at least - pass through Tajikistan."
"The country is vulnerable to radical movements and international organised crime."
"We must increase our support for Tajikistan in order to counter this activity while, at the same time, providing alternative sources of income."
"This strategy accords well with our commitment in Afghanistan and our work on stabilising that country."
"We welcome Tajikistan's interest in cooperation and support its efforts."
"Tajikistan has demonstrated an open, constructive attitude to discussions on our shared challenges."
"That is positive."
"This dialogue is an important element of our support for Tajikistan in its work on promoting cooperation with its neighbours and finding solutions to urgent, complex regional problems such as climate change, water and border controls."
"In view of the fact that we have a strong interest in dealing with many of these problems more effectively and efficiently, I welcome the opportunity to create a new basis for our relations with Tajikistan."
"The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement provides us with a framework within which we can develop our bilateral relations further and thereby contribute to the overall goals of our strategy for the whole of Central Asia."
"I therefore call on this Parliament to vote in favour of the Agreement, so that it can enter into force as soon as possible."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Peterle for his excellent report, and also the resolution, which gives a very good analysis of the situation in Tajikistan and makes recommendations which I can support."
"Since the EU Strategy for Central Asia was adopted in June 2007, our relationships with all the countries of Central Asia have been deepening to our mutual benefit."
"The rhythm of contacts between us has gathered pace, and there is now a shared understanding of the benefits of greater cooperation on security matters, border management and controls, education, governance and energy diversification."
"The strategy is succeeding in forging a new kind of partnership with the five Central Asian republics."
"Clearly, though, this overarching strategy is underpinned by individual and differentiated bilateral relations that reflect the varying aspirations and orientations of the countries concerned."
"As you all know, our cooperation with Tajikistan is currently still governed by the trade and cooperation agreement concluded with the USSR in 1989 and endorsed by Tajikistan in 1994."
"This agreement does not fully reflect our ambitions under the Central Asia Strategy any more, nor does it serve to support the kind of relationship we now seek with Tajikistan."
"Your assent to the new EU-Tajikistan Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which is before you for debate today, would therefore represent a major step forward, allowing us to widen and deepen our cooperation with this country."
"Today's Tajikistan is confronted, as has been said already, by major economic and social challenges."
"It is important - and in Europeans' own interests - that Tajikistan should succeed in tackling its difficulties."
"This is a country which shares a nearly 1 500 km border with Afghanistan, and which lies close to the Swat Valley in Pakistan."
"It is a territory vulnerable to spill-over from these conflict areas and to infiltration by Islamic militants."
"Tajikistan is also key to efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs to Europe from Afghanistan."
"Greater cooperation with the European Union can therefore play a part in helping to prevent the spread of instability."
"A key element in Tajikistan's vulnerabilities is its weak economy."
"The poorest of the Central Asian republics has been badly hit by a substantial decrease in prices for aluminium and cotton due to the global downturn."
"This, taken together with a 34% drop in remittances in the first half of 2009, gives rise to concern that poverty levels may be rising, and that a precarious socio-economic situation could provoke social unrest."
"I believe that we are now on the right track with Tajikistan, supporting and encouraging indispensable reforms."
"This has also been the focus of EU Special Representative Morel's frequent visits and of my own visit in spring 2008."
"There is progress, but clearly more needs to be done."
"The Government has made it clear that, in addition to greater trade and cooperation, it is willing to implement measures to improve social welfare, health, education, tackle corruption and improve human rights."
"It is to be welcomed that President Rahmon has created the post of an ombudsman."
"The ombudsman will be an important interlocutor for us in the next round of the EU-Tajikistan human rights dialogue that you mentioned, on 23 September."
"Judiciary reform is still making slow progress, but we hope the recommendations of a recent human rights civil society seminar in Dushanbe will be taken into account by the government, particularly in reform of the legal profession and the new criminal procedure code in Tajikistan."
"I am, of course, very well aware of your concerns on democracy and human rights in Tajikistan and I can therefore assure you that the Commission will take these concerns fully into account in our dialogues with this country."
"As to the economic reforms, we see progress, for example, on the drafting of a cotton debt resolution mechanism, which hopefully will pave the way for wider agricultural reforms and the implementation of 'Freedom to Farm', crucial to tackling poverty in the country."
"The European Parliament's assent to the PCA today will help us to continue to work with Tajikistan on a whole range of political and economic reforms, with a special focus on democracy and human rights, and also to ensure their thorough implementation."
"The reform effort is already underpinned by a relatively large amount of bilateral assistance from the Commission."
"Indeed, it is EUR 66 million for the period 2007 to 2010 which will even rise to EUR 70 million over the three years 2011 and 2013."
"Our aid will focus on sector support for social protection and health, public finance management reform and technical assistance for private sector development."
"This process will be supported by our delegation in Dushanbe."
"It is my intention that, before the end of this year, our regionalised office there should become a fully-fledged delegation to encourage the reform process and facilitate full implementation of the PCA."
"In particular, I hope it will help us to maintain a thorough assessment of progress in the key areas I have mentioned which we will then measure against clear benchmarks."
"The decision to conclude a partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Communities, their Member States and Tajikistan is in line with the European Council Strategy for a New Partnership with Central Asia and Tajikistan's clear will to develop broad cooperation with the European Union, in trade and many other fields."
"I am pleased to see that all the Member States have ratified this agreement and hope that we will be able to give our assent to the agreement with Tajikistan, just as we have previously assented to agreements with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan."
"This will mark the end of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the former Soviet Union."
"Acting on the basis of its fundamental values and principles, the European Union expresses with this agreement its strategic interest in cooperation with Tajikistan, which it regards as a very important partner in this part of the world."
"The EU also wishes to deepen its relations with Tajikistan, thereby contributing to the security, stability and economic progress of this country and the development and consolidation of its democratic institutions, as well as to the protection of human rights and the rule of law."
"The more specific objectives of European policy on Tajikistan relate primarily to supporting the struggle against poverty, supporting good governance and reform, as well as to effectively tackling drug trafficking and organised crime."
"This report takes a critical stance on the state of democracy in this country, expressing concern about corruption and the state of civil society but, at the same time, it calls upon the Tajik Government to tackle the problematic situation in the field of education and training, as soon as possible."
"The report also expresses justified concern about violations of human rights, in particular, women's rights, religious freedoms, judicial independence and the conditions governing the work of civil society organisations."
"That being said, the report also welcomes the commencement of dialogue on human rights, the progress of which is essential for the development of bilateral relations."
"This agreement reflects our conviction that Tajikistan has the potential to create a modern, functioning state which is capable of successfully carrying out its regional role, in particular, in fighting the extremism spilling over from Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region."
"Among other things, the report also reminds us of the importance of energy and water, as these issues concern inter-state relations within Central Asia and require joint tackling."
"By way of conclusion, allow me to compliment my colleagues on their constructive collaboration and the Commission on its valuable help."
"Above all, I would like to thank the Embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan for their cooperation."
"I firmly believe that, with this agreement, the European Union will be able to build on and deepen the cooperation which it has had with Tajikistan to date, and I hope that this will be the spirit in which this agreement is implemented in the near future."
"I warmly recommend that you adopt the agreement with Tajikistan."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Alojz Peterle, on his highly factual and - I would like to stress - very balanced report on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and Tajikistan."
"Tajikistan has come in for a lot of criticism for its lack of democracy."
"What we most often disapprove of is the lack of press freedom, religious freedom and corruption."
"I do not wish to dispute those charges here."
"However, we do need to take into account the fact that Tajikistan has recently made progress both in combating corruption and improving the human rights situation, as well as various other sensitive areas."
"In addition, it is a relatively stable country, which is important, considering its strategic location."
"However this has already been covered today."
"As a neighbour of Afghanistan, and the associated problems of the large-scale production and sale of drugs, terrorism and growing extremism, and with another increasingly unstable neighbour, Pakistan, Tajikistan could be a natural ally of the European Union."
"It is therefore in the EU's interest to continue to support democratic processes in that country and to strengthen its political, economic and social potential."
"Let us remember that Tajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics."
"It was one of just 12 countries that was last year on the UN's list of the countries worst affected by the world food crisis."
"I am pleased in this respect that the report also mentions the Millennium Development Goals."
"Let us also remind Tajikistan of these."
"The European Union is Tajikistan's primary trading partner."
"Both sides should make efforts to implement the agreement as fast as possible, thereby supporting the country's development and stabilising its economic situation."
"Merely criticising what is wrong in Tajikistan will not achieve this."
"We also need to send out a positive signal that we care about developing contacts with this country and, in my opinion, Mr Peterle's report, along with the entire Parliament, has sent just such a signal."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Tajikistan is a word seldom uttered in this House, and so we - I speak on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and also as a member of the Committee on International Trade and of the Delegation for relations with Central Asia - welcome this agreement."
"I also welcome this decision to take swift action to promote our representative offices in the region, as the Commissioner mentioned just now."
"Moreover, Tajikistan, which is a country that can surprise us but which is often described as an outpost of Europe, is not on the periphery of the world - just as none of the other countries in Central Asia, Afghanistan being the main one, are either."
"It is in this country that some very important battles are being fought in relation to drugs trafficking, the fight against authoritarianism and fundamentalism, and the establishment of the rule of law and democracy, which are, unfortunately, still very fragile."
"With this legislative instrument we will be able to make progress, not only from a trade perspective but, I hope, from a political and cultural perspective too."
"Madam President, conditions are far more favourable for embarking on a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Tajikistan than, for example, Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan, these latter countries being total dictatorships."
"Tajikistan, however, is on something of a better path, and this agreement will allow the European Union to have some influence on the situation there."
"It was agreeable to hear that, in the name of the Council and the Commission, the cooperation pact would focus on human rights and democracy and try to promote the development of the rule of law."
"It was also excellent to hear that an ombudsman's institution had been established in Tajikistan."
"In many countries, this is a very important instrument, and the European Union should lend its full support to this new institution."
"I would like to raise another point regarding the question of water resources."
"This region is rich in water resources, and the European Union could help Tajikistan to exploit these resources of theirs rationally and democratically, taking account too of the interests of those countries whose territories lie downstream and which might possibly suffer from the effects of large hydroelectric power stations."
"Whatever the case, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to emphasise the importance of regional cooperation, so that the local economy in Central Asia might recover."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, Tajikistan is not blessed with the energy and mineral resources of other countries in Central Asia."
"However, that is no excuse for marginalising Tajikistan at the expense of its wealthier and larger neighbours."
"Central Asia is a region vital to the EU's political and energy security."
"In terms of strengthening relations with the EU, some countries in the region will progress faster than others."
"That is inevitable."
"But we must retain a sense of collective engagement as we continue to improve ties with what was, until quite recently, a diplomatically isolated and largely overlooked region, particularly by the European Union."
"Favouring some countries in Central Asia over others risks creating a discord and division in the region."
"In particular, Islamist terrorists in the region have shown a determination to exploit poverty and inadequate governance to radicalise the people and spread their message of hatred."
"The Government of Tajikistan has rejected extremism and, with the help of the international community, is seeking now to consolidate its nation's democracy."
"Tajikistan still bears the scars of a brutal civil war between secular and Jihadi forces that erupted after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s."
"People in Tajikistan have no wish to see the return of bloodshed, which is why they have given courageous support to NATO operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan."
"The ISAF mission in Afghanistan is vital to Tajikistan's long-term future and its desire to find a security anchor westwards."
"It is fair to say that Tajikistan's record in democratisation and human rights is imperfect, but I am convinced that dialogue and engagement on the EU's part will encourage Tajikistan towards positive change."
"Certainly, that seems to be the European Union's view with regard to Belarus and Uzbekistan, so Tajikistan deserves to be treated in the same way."
"The ECR Group therefore supports a deeper strategic political and economic partnership with Tajikistan based on a commitment of progress towards openness, democracy and higher standards of human rights."
"Madam President, thank you for the report."
"As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I questioned the competent representative of the Commission in a debate on the role of this agreement within the framework of EU immigration management."
"He clearly stated that, when it entered into force, it would pave the way for cooperation with the border security agency (Frontex) and for numerous immigration regulations, such as within the framework of readmission agreements and border security with Afghanistan."
"The 1 200 km long border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has already been addressed here."
"It will then also become another target of the EU's repressive policy to keep out refugees."
"Thus, the European Union wants to seal itself off from refugees far beyond its external borders."
"Yet again, we see that this is a fundamental component of EU foreign policy."
"As a result of such partnership agreements, refugees are interned in camps, in which, as we all know, inhumane conditions prevail, as is currently the case in Ukraine."
"The problem has already been addressed here in general terms."
"This form of so-called international immigration management involves serious infringement of the Geneva Refugee Convention and of international human rights."
"I therefore call on the EU to start fighting the cause of flight rather than the refugees."
"The European neighbourhood policy is one means of making fortress Europe even more impenetrable, which is why it is looked on very sceptically from our point of view, from the point of view of the GUE/NGL."
"Madam President, quite honestly, this debate gives me mixed feelings."
"On the one hand, I welcome the fact that Mr Peterle's resolution clearly points out the many problematic areas in the Tajik economy and society."
"On the other hand, I find it incomprehensible that, at crucial points, Tajikistan is described as a relatively stable country."
"I have just heard it again in a debate and I absolutely cannot understand where this idea comes from."
"Well, the European Union gives the impression that this agreement has to come about come what may."
"This will have undeniable consequences for the credibility of the large amounts of criticism that will still have to be made later on."
"What I read in paragraph 2 about the disappointment of the Tajik Government I find entirely astonishing."
"We must debate the disappointment, ladies and gentlemen, of, for example, the Protestant minority or the Muslims confronted with an Act on Religion that deeply interferes with their religious life."
"Instead of this completely misplaced disappointment, the Tajik Government should take care of the large amounts of work it needs to do at home."
"I hope, Commissioner, that this is also followed up on conscientiously."
"Madam President, I am very much in favour of this agreement."
"I believe it is a big step forward in the cooperation between the European Union and Tajikistan, which is a very important country for several reasons."
"I just want to quote one contribution to the stability and security of our continent of the EU."
"Tajikistan is at the crossroads of drug trafficking from Afghanistan to Europe and Russia."
"At least 30% of the heroin produced in Afghanistan comes to Europe and Russia through Tajikistan."
"Ten years ago, the international community started a big operation in Tajikistan, strengthening all the drug control apparatus, and I am very happy to see, ten years later, that it is working and that it is going ahead very well."
"This agreement is a direct contribution to the stability and security of Europe."
"I see there are still many limitations and colleagues underlined the problems in Tajikistan in terms of human rights, poverty and so on, but I believe this agreement is Europe at its best and I am very much in favour of it."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, believe that this cooperation agreement with Tajikistan really is very positive and can help to achieve what I believe are some important and precise objectives."
"The first objective concerns the strategic position of that country, which can genuinely be of use in promoting an area of peace, security and stability."
"The second objective, I believe, is and must be to encourage the growth of that country from an economic and social point of view, because we know that it is one of the poorest countries in the region."
"Lastly, we must ensure that freedom, democracy and rights are the fundamental elements that govern the application of this agreement."
"Leaving aside any limitations that may be found, I believe we should welcome the report on which we are voting in this House."
"(SL) I would like to congratulate Mr Peterle on an excellent report."
"The suffix '-stan' means 'state' and Tajikistan is the last of the countries whose names end in '-stan' to be recognised as a state by us."
"Up until now, we have always overlooked it, which was a great injustice."
"However, the stability of Central Asia is in the interests of the region itself, in our interests, and in the strategic interests of the world as a whole."
"All the countries in the world are interlinked like a connecting vessel, which is why we also need to demonstrate our maturity by ensuring that all the countries in this region are given equal attention, regardless of their size, stage of development or how much energy wealth they possess."
"It seems to me that we have now righted this wrong and made up for lost time."
"For this reason, I would like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commission, as well as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and the Swedish Presidency, for finally consigning this delay to the past."
"From now on, things will be better."
"(PL) I would like to thank you very much for allowing me to ask a question."
"I believe concluding this agreement will be a good idea, as it is a step in the right direction."
"However, I do ask myself, and I would also like to ask Minister Malmström the question: among the many activities that the European Union has planned, would it not be desirable to put greater emphasis on helping Tajikistan to train those responsible for securing the border with Afghanistan?"
"We are well aware that this is an extremely crucial issue."
"The border stretches for 1500 kilometres."
"Tajikistan has great problems protecting the border, particularly as there is a large Tajik minority on the Afghan side."
"I therefore think that among the various initiatives undertaken by the European Union, we should also consider helping to train the Tajik forces and the people who are responsible for keeping that border secure."
"(DE) Madam President, I would also like to say that Mr Peterle has produced an excellent report."
"We should be clear about one thing: the freedom-loving people of central Asia are among our most important partners."
"This region has often been dominated by foreign powers."
"For the first time in a long time - for centuries - it is again free."
"We should exploit this opportunity to establish a real partnership of the free."
"I heard talk earlier of crime."
"Of course, we must work together to combat crime, but first we should look at the culture in these countries and understand that these are ancient trading nations."
"They do not just trade in drugs; they trade in goods which were always important for Europe and the world."
"We should therefore say that this is about partnership, not paternalism."
"(EL) Madam President, I, too, should like to touch on the question of crime, which has already been raised, and the question of illegal immigration."
"It is a fact that Tajikistan is at a nerve point, in a geopolitical position, and Europe should examine how we can manage to reduce both crime, in connection with drugs from Afghanistan, and - first and foremost - migratory movements."
"It is a fact that Europe can no longer sustain these migratory movements via Tajikistan and from Afghanistan and other countries, a fact which primarily the Mediterranean countries, such as Malta, Cyprus, Greece and Italy, are paying for now, but which it is certain, with mathematical precision, will be paid for at a later date by all the countries of northern Europe."
"Of course, we must respect the rights of all the people who come from these countries but, at some point, Europe too will need to protect itself and realise that we cannot sustain these migratory movements from Asia."
"Madam President, as Mr Peterle says in his excellent report, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is part of a greater strategy for increased regional stability in Central Asia."
"It is only right that we make this significant move, because there are so many problems and they are so extensive and affect so many countries, not least Afghanistan and Pakistan, but each country has its own specific problems."
"Mr Peterle deals with all this very systematically in his report."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament is still holding the banner high as regards human rights."
"Human rights are a problem in Tajikistan."
"There is still a lot to do in the country as regards respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"That is why it is so useful, as the Commissioner has said, that we have this dialogue on human rights."
"I am sure that the Commission will be very clear at next week's meeting about European values and the expectations that we have of Tajikistan."
"This summer, the EU supported a conference that dealt with precisely the matter of strengthening the rule of law in Tajikistan and which was attended by representatives from the research world, civil society, non-governmental organisations and foreign experts, as well as by many representatives of Tajikistan's own authorities."
"It is a matter of improving the independence of the legal authorities and strengthening the rule of law."
"Mrs Hautala brought up the matter of water."
"This is very important in the region."
"The EU is supporting a number of sustainable development projects for hydroelectric power."
"These projects must be based on scientific studies, have a regional perspective, and take into account the specific needs that exist."
"Mr Zemke mentioned the matter of border management."
"This is a very important issue."
"The EU is supporting the region to the tune of EUR 66 million up to 2010 and EUR 70 million in the three-year period thereafter."
"This must surely provide scope for strengthening not only border management and control, but also training of customs and police officers."
"I am sure that the Commission will return to this later."
"To sum up, there are many difficult and complex problems in Tajikistan and throughout the region."
"There is some light at the end of the tunnel, but we must not underestimate the problems."
"I am very pleased that the House is unanimous as regards the importance of taking this step of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"It will provide us with a better tool to use in our work on improving stability and resolving these problems and with which to conduct an active dialogue with the country on human rights and democracy."
"It is an important step forward and fills a gap that has existed in our regional strategy up till now."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, we have firmly believed for a long time that an EU-Central Asia Strategy is vitally important and will have a positive effect on security, stability and prosperity in the countries of Central Asia."
"As Mr Tannock rightly said, we should not marginalise Tajikistan."
"On the contrary, I think we should engage with this poorest country of Central Asia."
"Having said this, yes of course we are also fully aware that there are huge challenges for this country."
"I think it was Mr Arlacchi who mentioned that Afghanistan remains the first opiate- and heroin-producing country in the world and, of course, the whole transit takes place through Tajikistan and through other Central Asian countries."
"Afghan opium and heroin are being trafficked out of the country, mainly through Iran and Pakistan on the southern routes and through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan on the northern routes."
"So we know that this is an extremely important issue."
"But we also see that drug production has decreased in Afghanistan and now it is really a matter of working together in order to make this decrease still further."
"For that, we have introduced BOMKA, the border management programme."
"That is excellent because it works against smuggling."
"It is helping these countries to trade legally but, in particular, it is also working against drug production."
"I have visited those institutions myself and I can tell you they are working very well."
"We are also organising training."
"Training is among the European Union programmes."
"Let me say a second word on the human rights question."
"The new partnership and cooperation agreement will provide us with an instrument to deepen our dialogue with Tajikistan in this field, and there is the human rights clause."
"This will give us the opportunity and the means for discussing with the Tajik authorities all related issues, such as child labour, women's rights, freedom of assembly and religious freedom - absolutely, Mr Belder, because there are still some problems."
"Water has also been mentioned."
"I have known about these problems for very many years."
"We have tried to help the Tajiks and now we play the role of facilitator among Central Asian countries."
"We are convinced that it has to be tackled at regional level, taking countries' interests and needs into account - both upstream, which means Tajikistan and Kurdistan, and downstream, which means Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan."
"I think only in this context can a permanent solution be found."
"Therefore we are working with all the countries and, in this context, a national policy dialogue on water is scheduled for 2010 - next year - in which all these issues will be addressed, and then, of course, we will try and come to terms."
"My final remarks: the time is right to support the final stage of the ratification process for the partnership and cooperation agreement."
"More intense cooperation with Tajikistan, supported by you, by Parliament, is in the interests of our citizens."
"A positive vote will send a strong signal to Tajikistan that the European Union honours its commitments under our Central Asia Strategy."
"It will pave the way for a partnership essential to our own security and help us encourage greater regional cooperation, so vital for the stability of Central Asia."
"I would like to thank you all for your attentive words, new insights and new emphases."
"I am pleased to see that Parliament stands united, once again, in this debate and that it has the will to forge a stronger and tighter partnership with Tajikistan."
"I am also pleased that we are aware of Tajikistan's identity and its special role in the region."
"I, for one, would be delighted if we were to devote an equal amount of attention to the monitoring of the implementation of this agreement, and we will soon have the opportunity to do just that."
"However, allow me to recall the importance of Parliament's role in such cooperation, one vehicle of which will be our delegation to the countries of Central Asia."
"I firmly believe that we will be able to finalise this agreement tomorrow with a great majority."
"When it does take effect, the European Union and Tajikistan will have the opportunity to cooperate, at regional, bilateral and global levels."
"Thank you very much for your help and cooperation."
"I have received a motion to wind up the debate from the Committee on Foreign Affairs pursuant to Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 17 September 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome all agreements between the European communities and the countries of the former Soviet Union, provided that such agreements are based on equal rights and mutual benefits."
"If it is established in the report presented to today's plenary session of the European Parliament that the proposed agreement will help to reinforce and consolidate the Union in Tajikistan and Central Asia from a political, economic and commercial perspective, then I would like urgently to draw your attention to the following considerations which I share with many other people."
"The agreement must not in any way be viewed as a possible stepping stone to an EU military presence in the area in question."
"It is absolutely essential to develop the European Union as a peace project, free of superpower or military ambitions."
"The proclaimed war on terrorism cannot be conducted in the area in question without cooperation from Russia and other neighbouring states."
"Last but not least, I would like to point out that we must approach the extraction and use of raw materials in a spirit of complete equality and mutual interest."
"New regulations on visas for Western Balkan countries (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia) (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on new regulations on visas for Western Balkan countries (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia)."
"Mr President, moving quickly on geographically to discuss another area that I am again very pleased to address: the prospects of visa liberalisation for certain countries in the Balkan region."
"It is excellent that the European Parliament is addressing this at such an early stage in its period of office."
"It shows how important we all believe it to be that the people of the Western Balkans are brought closer to the European Union."
"It is undoubtedly the most important issue for the citizens of the Balkan region as far as their present links with the EU are concerned."
"Visa liberalisation will firstly make it possible for people to move more freely throughout Europe and will create more open societies."
"Many people in the region - particularly young people - have never been to Western Europe, and naturally visa liberalisation would open up a range of opportunities for contacts and exchanges."
"That is the real benefit of this initiative."
"In 2007, the EU embarked upon a process intended to result in visa requirements being removed for the countries of the Western Balkans."
"There are two aspects to this process: the countries themselves had to make significant progress as regards the reliability of documentation, better legislation on migration, improved rights for minorities and, not least, the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"In return, the EU would offer visa-free travel."
"Visa facilitation was introduced back in January 2008, linked to commitments in the areas to be addressed."
"However, only genuine visa liberalisation will enable the economic and bureaucratic barriers erected by visa obligations to be removed."
"Liberalisation of the visa requirements that apply to citizens of the Western Balkans is an important measure that will strengthen ties between this region and the European Union."
"We can expect this to stimulate a pro-European attitude among both the governments and the peoples of the region, because it shows that the European integration process has real advantages."
"Continued isolation, on the other hand, would lead to a feeling of exclusion and prevent exchanges of ideas and, in the worst case, could foster narrow-minded nationalism."
"Obviously, our aim is the opposite: to open up the EU, to provide the countries with access to Community programmes, to make it easier for people to be in contact and to promote development and exchanges both between the countries of the Western Balkans and between these countries and the EU."
"Not least, visa liberalisation will create new opportunities for trade, industry and transfer of know-how."
"These are important elements in alleviating the consequences of the economic crisis."
"Consequently, the Commission's proposal that was submitted on 15 July is very much to be welcomed."
"It is proposed that in a first step, the visa requirement will be removed for citizens of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, which have biometric passports."
"The aim is that on 1 January 2010, we will liberalise the visa requirements for these citizens and later extend this to other countries once they also meet the conditions required."
"The Commission has assessed that three countries - Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - by and large already meet the conditions for visa liberalisation."
"The appraisal of Serbia and Montenegro is continuing and we hope that by this autumn, we will have confirmation from the Commission that all the conditions are met, so that we can take the next step."
"I must emphasise that many of the conditions that we have set for liberalisation, such as reform of the police system and combating corruption, will also benefit the countries in their preparations for EU membership and thus create a situation in which everyone wins as far as harmonisation of the rules is concerned."
"It also provides a good example of how the principle of conditionality can work in the Western Balkans."
"Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina will not be included in this first decision on visa exemption, but they are not being left in the lurch."
"I know that that is a matter of concern to many in this House."
"It is only a matter of time before these countries also meet the necessary conditions in the Commission's roadmap."
"In order that the process can be concluded as soon as possible, we are continuing to emphatically support and encourage Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina to make further progress on the remaining targets, and I hope that they, too, will be able to benefit from visa liberalisation in the near future."
"The EU will do all it can to help and support these two countries in their efforts to achieve their objectives, particularly as regards the rule of law."
"Where Kosovo is concerned, the Commission's proposal involves no change."
"Here, the visa requirement will remain for the time being."
"In the future, we will have to look at how the measures can best be extended in order to give the citizens of Kosovo the same rights as others in the region."
"Here we are awaiting a communication from the Commission in October containing ideas for encouraging deeper cooperation and links with Kosovo."
"The Council has only just begun its discussions on the Commission's proposal, but the Presidency will work hard to ensure that we can reach agreement as soon as possible."
"We welcome the great interest that the European Parliament has shown in this proposal and the fact that initial discussions are already taking place in your committees."
"In view of the incredible significance of this proposal politically, I am sure that we are in agreement on the goal, which is to conclude this process as quickly as possible with satisfactory results, so that visa liberalisation can become a reality as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Minister, Mrs Malmström, for everything she has told us, and which I will try to confirm on behalf of the Commission."
"On 15 July, the Commission proposed the abolition of short-term visas for citizens of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia."
"As you have underlined, Minister, this is obviously an historic moment in our relations with the Western Balkans."
"This proposal for the abolition of visas is based on the progress made in the last six years in the areas of justice and home affairs, in accordance with the commitments made at Thessaloniki in 2003."
"The Commission proposal has been submitted to the Council."
"The Member States support the approach proposed by the Commission and confirm their intention to work in close cooperation with the European Parliament to guarantee the formal adoption of the text during your Presidency, Minister, the Swedish Presidency."
"I thank the European Parliament for appointing the rapporteurs within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and for setting an indicative timetable scheduling the submission of the report for the end of September, and the votes within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and then in plenary, for October and November."
"The goal is, in fact, to obtain visa exemptions for citizens of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro on 1 January 2010."
"The Commission's proposal is based on the results of the dialogue launched in the first half of 2008 with the five countries of the Western Balkans."
"Road maps have been drawn up stipulating criteria, the realisation of which involves the adoption of structural reforms in the key area of JFS - justice, freedom and security."
"This method has proved to be a very important incentive for the countries of the region to progress towards reforms, notably in relation to document security, with the introduction of biometric passports and identity cards for border control and global policies on migration, and also in relation to public order and security policies: the fight against organised crime, corruption, human trafficking, and finally, of course, fundamental rights, including matters of citizenship."
"Having studied these reports, we can say that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia meets all of the criteria in its road map."
"Montenegro and Serbia have made very considerable progress."
"However, for Serbia, there are still some conditions to be met, in particular, with relation to the verification of identity documents submitted by Kosovo residents and people of Kosovan origin living abroad when they request a Serbian biometric passport."
"The second condition for Serbia is the control of borders with Kosovo and cooperation with EULEX, and thirdly, the drafting of a national strategy on migration."
"As for Montenegro, a lasting solution must be found for displaced persons."
"Measures still have to be taken in terms of the effective introduction of the law on foreigners, as well as measures enhancing administrative capacity and which are designed to fight corruption and organised crime more effectively."
"That is the situation in these three countries."
"Despite the very significant progress accomplished in the course of the last few months, Bosnia and Albania have not yet been able to complete the requisite reforms demanded in the road map, such as the abolition of visas."
"On the basis of this analysis, the Commission, in response to the invitation made by the General Affairs Council in June 2009, has therefore proposed the abolition of the visa for the citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia."
"For Serbia, persons resident in Kosovo, or persons of Kosovan origin who are resident abroad and who hold a Serbian passport issued by a central authority in Belgrade, will be excluded from the liberalisation and will be required to obtain a visa."
"Indeed, since 1999, Serbia has not been able to provide verification for identity documents held by people from Kosovo."
"The Commission has considered the security risk that this category of people represents for the Community, as well as the fact that there has, as yet, been no dialogue on the subject of visa liberalisation with Kosovo."
"Therefore, the decision to include certain countries in this liberalisation of visa requirements is based on the merits of each individual country."
"As far as Serbia and Montenegro are concerned, we will follow closely the measures taken by these two countries to fully implement all of the criteria."
"In terms of the progress already made by Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission is convinced that these two countries will be in a position to meet all of the criteria in the near future."
"In October, their authorities will submit supplementary information to the Commission on the progress made in recent months."
"On the basis of this information, evaluation missions will be deployed at the beginning of next year, and then the Commission will draw up new evaluation reports to be discussed with Member States."
"Following this, the Commission hopes that it will be in a position to propose the waiver of the visa requirement in 2010."
"In accordance with the procedures in force, the proposal will be discussed at the Council and will be the subject of an opinion at the European Parliament."
"The formal adoption of the text by a majority of the Schengen countries should therefore take place during the Swedish Presidency, which will allow the effective introduction of this abolition of visas for citizens of these three countries from January 2010."
"As you have said, Minister, all this means the possibility, particularly for the young generation in these Balkan countries, of participating much more in European life, of integrating into it, and we think that all of this can be extremely beneficial, both for these countries and for our Europe."
"There you have it."
"Those are the points I wanted to make following the excellent observations made by the Presidency."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Western Balkans need Europe and we Europeans need stability in the Western Balkans."
"The Western Balkans are a central part of Europe and we must do our utmost to bring this important part back home to Europe."
"For that reason, these are the right proposals."
"The reality of life in this area has been described; the depressingly long queues at visa offices, the young people with no prospect of making an application to leave the country and get a taste of life in Europe."
"A lot of people experience this area as a prison, where they have no contact with the outside world."
"We all want to put an end to this and, in my group, Mrs Pack, Mrs Bildt and Mr Posselt are working on this with a great deal of dedication."
"We all stand for this."
"What worries us is that, as a result of the different treatment of the states in this area, there will be separatist movements and different classes of citizens in the area of the Western Balkans will be created, which could certainly lead to problems."
"However, the citizens in the European Union equally expect security."
"That means that the standards that Commissioner Barrot described here today, namely security standards for police cooperation, in the fight against illegal immigration and economic migration and for biometric data, are the agreed minimum standards which represent the rules of play."
"Our citizens expect those rules of play to be adhered to."
"That brings me to my second point: there must be no foreign policy concessions on the question of visa waiver."
"We should not give these states a free rein."
"The rules of play are clear and anyone who abides by them has every chance of having visas waived."
"The pressure on the states which have been unable to improve their standards hitherto, despite EU aid, should not let up."
"These are the two flanks that we in the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) consider to be right."
"We trust in the evaluation that the European Commission has carried out and can therefore approve the present step."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we support, of course, the Commission's proposals, as they mark a very important step for the three countries in the region just mentioned, which will enjoy a visa-free regime as of 1 January 2010."
"I myself am from a country and of a generation which enthusiastically welcomed the lifting of the visa regime prior to our country becoming a member of the European Union."
"I would also say that this is the first and most important sign that things really are moving in the right direction, and that one day, the final destination of these countries will be the European Union."
"At the same time, I cannot help but express, to some extent, my astonishment at the Commission's excessively administrative approach to this matter."
"Although, on the one hand, technical matters are important, in the sense that compliance is needed and the countries have to fulfil the necessary conditions to become part of the European Union, and therefore be granted this visa-free travel facility, the Commission's decision to exclude Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to some extent, beggars comprehension."
"It fails to reflect the delicate nature of this issue in the region."
"It underestimates the influence it could have on the future development of relations between the countries of the region, and the attitude of ordinary citizens in the region to this decision made by the European Commission."
"For this reason, we believe that the European Commission's decision should be reviewed to include Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a clear timetable setting out when these countries could be included in the visa-free regime, subject to fulfilling specific conditions."
"In this respect, this issue is particularly delicate with regard to the population of Kosovo."
"Our question is therefore: when does the European Commission intend to initiate a dialogue on visas with Kosovo, and has it considered what the consequences would be, in terms of Kosovo's stability if this dialogue is not started as soon as possible?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the ALDE Group firmly and consistently supports the goal of EU accession for all the Western Balkan countries."
"We are aiming to equip their citizens to join an integrated free movement area with a single market and common values."
"Freedom of short-term travel is a vital part of preparation for that."
"The Commission and the Council obviously share that goal, so why on earth has the Commission managed to put forward such an ill-judged and divisive proposal?"
"The Liberal Group certainly does not want to undermine the pressure for high standards of passport and border security and the rule of law more generally, but this exercise has to be fair, consistent and effective."
"It is not as if there are no anomalies at present."
"For instance, Serbia and Montenegro have been included in the July proposal: although they did not meet the benchmarks at the date of the proposal, they are expected to do so in the future."
"Then there is the requirement for biometric passports, of which Bosnia has now issued 40 000, by the way; but Croatians, who have benefited from visa-free travel for some time, do not need one."
"We are saying that Serbia's stabilisation and association agreement cannot be progressed while Mladić stays hidden, since it shows lack of control over the security services."
"But for visa waiver, they are deemed to meet the requirements of Block 3: Public order and security - some contradiction here."
"The way to keep Bosnia and Albania up to the mark would be to include them in the legal scope of this proposed regulation, but to make the actual implementation of visa waiver conditional on a Commission declaration of compliance - in fact, similar to that which the Commission needs to make this autumn about Serbia and Montenegro."
"The process would be exactly the same, though a bit later."
"Any prolonged delay for Bosnia and Albania and the complete exclusion of Kosovo will have very divisive and detrimental consequences, encouraging the search for Croatian, Serbian or, in the case of Kosovars, Macedonian passports, and undermining the integrity and governance of Bosnia and Kosovo in particular."
"I cannot believe the Commission and the Council intend to pursue this damaging path."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I am in favour of visa liberalisation and I am also in favour of attaching certain criteria to visa liberalisation, but what I am more in favour of is peace and stability in the Western Balkans."
"What do you think it will do, especially to young people, to Bosnian Muslims, to see their Croat- and Serb-Bosnian peers with double passports hopping in and out of the EU for a weekend?"
"Do we really want to take the chance of fostering nationalist feelings and deepening the divisions in a country where stability is still so fragile?"
"And for what?"
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is really not that far behind Serbia in complying with the criteria."
"They are already issuing biometric passports and have made about the same amount of progress on the other criteria."
"I therefore strongly ask you to include Bosnia and Herzegovina in the present proposal for the sake of those people living there who are working very hard for a better future - with the memories of war still too fresh in their minds."
"I am very happy that today our colleague, until recently Minister Cecilia Malmström, has spoken on behalf of the Council."
"This House has been poorer for her absence, but the Swedish Presidency has certainly gained from it."
"I would like to say in Swedish 'tack' - or 'thank you' - for her speech, which in my language, in Polish, means 'yes' - and it is therefore a fitting word, as I fully agree with what she has told us on behalf of the Council today, even though I have some small but important comments."
"In the first place, I really do not want this appropriate initiative of the Council, supported by the Commission, to be - to put it bluntly - some kind of alternative to the rapid accession of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro to the European Union."
"It is what the societies of those countries expect, and it is what they deserve."
"I do not believe that we should substitute the perspective of fast-track accession to the European Union by these countries by waiving visa requirements."
"Secondly, I believe that the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Kosovo also deserve visa-free travel as soon as possible."
"In this regard, we need to consistently hold up definite European prospects before them."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Federal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, we believe that the Commission proposal to waive visas for citizens from Serbia, Montenegro and FYROM who have biometric passports is a step in the right direction and implements the European Union's commitment towards the people in this area, so that they can plan trips and travel to the rest of Europe without the need for a visa."
"I must point out that, when it comes to the Western Balkans, we are talking about a traumatised area which recently experienced war and civil conflict for which the European Union and certain of its Member States bear responsibility."
"The wounds of this area are healing slowly."
"That is why we believe that the visa waiver procedure for the citizens of all these countries is a very important step and will give them the opportunity to communicate with the peoples of the rest of Europe."
"However, I cannot not point out the terms and conditions which, if I have understood correctly, bring a degree of uncertainty to whether the Council will approve the visa waiver for Montenegro and Serbia in October."
"Firstly, for Kosovo which, unless I have misunderstood, is subject to Security Council resolution 1244 and, especially, for the Serbian minority living in a state of rural prison, guarded within geographical prisons, we are essentially refusing free communication."
"A double whammy: we do not allow them to travel within their country, nor do we allow them to travel to the countries of the European Union."
"Secondly, I have numerous reservations as to whether certain of these preconditions which we are demanding of Serbia and Montenegro relate to this specific issue and do not serve other political objectives."
"That is why I consider that you should endeavour in October to waive visas for the inhabitants of Montenegro and Serbia and for the other countries in the Western Balkans."
"Madam President, firstly, peace and stability in the Western Balkans is certainly in the interest of the whole of Europe and, of course, because I am from Greece, it is logical that it should be in our interest even more, because we border some of these states."
"As such, we would consider the direction you are taking to be the right direction."
"However, I wish to single out FYROM."
"The Skopje government is cultivating extreme nationalism towards one Member State of the European Union, namely Greece, circulating maps which show a part of Greece, Macedonia, together with Thessaloniki and numerous other towns, under occupation, thereby basically cultivating the spirit that these lands, which are supposedly occupied by Greece, should be liberated."
"I do not wish to focus on the question of the name, to which you may be indifferent, even though the Greeks are very sensitive to a name being hijacked."
"However, you must surely understand that we cannot return to nationalism, the fostering of nationalism, in these countries, to the detriment of other Member States of the European Union."
"(DE) Madam President, that visa requirements for Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro are to be abolished shows that the reform efforts of these countries are clearly bearing fruit."
"However, ten years after the end of the conflict, the graves are still deep and ill-feeling is still simmering beneath the surface."
"Clearly this has to do with the fact that Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia, which have not been included this time, are feeling disadvantaged."
"Clearly people there prefer to cultivate old antagonisms, rather than ask themselves what their neighbouring states have done better and how progress can be achieved in order to earn visa waiver."
"In any event, Serbia should soon acquire the status of candidate country, as it is moving towards accession on several counts."
"However, the wounds are far from healed and every measure by the EU is being evaluated accordingly."
"That is why we need, on the one hand, to communicate the reasons for our decisions better and, on the other hand, make it clear to Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia that they still need to make an enormous effort to move equally towards accession."
"In any event, peace in the Balkans, on the doorstep to the EU, has become far more important than the accession of Turkey, which is being so fiercely advocated on many sides."
"Madam President, today we in the EPP say to the people of Bosnia, of Albania and of Serbia: you are not forgotten; we have not abandoned you."
"We understand, especially to the people of Sarajevo, your frustration."
"But at the same time, we say to the people of the European Union, we will not bend the benchmarks."
"The rules have to be the same for everybody."
"Your security is important for us."
"Mainly we say to the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina: take your responsibilities; put your house in order; do your homework."
"We appreciate the progress that has been achieved recently."
"We will ask the Commission to continue to support you but if I have learned anything in my six years of the wars and peace in the Balkans, and believe me, this is an issue very close to my heart, victimism, the blame game and scapegoating belong to the past."
"This is an issue of European integration."
"We have to look at this from a European perspective and, as Mrs Cecilia Malmström said, the best way to start the U-turn that is needed to go from dependence and victimism is for them to take the country into their hands, and to start those visa reforms which are badly needed and necessary anyway."
"I hope we can agree on a clear message to the authorities in the region that we will support them but we will not compromise on the security of our citizens - that they have to take their responsibilities."
"I think we should support the Commission proposal, and, to those who think that this could be destabilising, I would like to say that stability will come with European integration."
"It is very unfortunate that passports are issued in Zagreb and in Belgrade, and we should definitely try to reduce that as much as possible, but we cannot make different rules for the Bosnian people."
"It is not in their interests."
"What we can do is to do our part in this Parliament to accelerate the process and make a decision, make our policy so that the Council can take a decision within this year."
"(SL) As you probably know, I am rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs regarding visa liberalisation for the Western Balkan countries."
"In July, the European Commission sent us a proposal recommending the lifting of visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro."
"Macedonia has already fulfilled all its obligations, whereas Montenegro and Serbia are required to meet the remaining conditions as soon as possible."
"Although I very much welcome the Commission's proposal and appreciate the demanding nature of this work, I am disappointed by the fact that this document has totally omitted the remaining countries, without even giving them a timetable of any kind."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are using a clear roadmap for the lifting of visa requirements and are aware of all the conditions that need to be met before that can happen."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular, achieved great progress on this score during the summer, judging by reports from independent organisations."
"The decision to omit Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania from the list is primarily a technical one."
"We are all well aware that even the best technical decisions can have major political consequences."
"The fact is that it is the Bosniaks who have been omitted from the visa liberalisation process."
"We must all take on a share of political responsibility for the implementation of this process, which will be a prerequisite for peace and stability in the Western Balkans."
"We also urgently need to think about initiating the visa dialogue with Kosovo, as that will help advance structural reforms."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must not put ourselves in the position of putting the brakes on the lifting of visa requirements for all the countries of the Western Balkans which have a clear European perspective."
"Visa liberalisation in the Western Balkans is not a jigsaw puzzle with which you might wish to amuse yourselves."
"We are dealing with people here, with their quality of life and mobility, and facilitating the closest cooperation possible, not least, economic cooperation."
"(SL) I congratulate Macedonia and hope that Montenegro and Serbia also get to the same stage."
"That would be good for all the three countries and for the Western Balkans as a whole."
"It is unfortunate, however, that Bosnia has been omitted from this package."
"The efforts made as regards Bosnia have been inadequate and insufficiently successful, and by this I mean both our efforts and theirs."
"The main obstacle to progress in Bosnia is the state of mind, the feeling of powerlessness, which is paralysing people and institutions there."
"The Bosniaks are the only people in Bosnia who have not been allowed to travel freely throughout Europe."
"They do not have a second state to resort to and, for that reason, they have been ghettoised."
"They are the only ones who cannot harbour dreams of dual citizenship."
"That is humiliating."
"They feel overlooked, belittled and punished by the European Union."
"We must provide political assistance to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to enable it to help itself and its citizens."
"The European Union shares responsibility for the situation in Bosnia and for the stability of the region."
"That responsibility lies with the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"Bosnia is close to having its visa requirements lifted."
"The only problem left is the problem in people's heads - in their heads and in our heads."
"There is a wall rising between us and them, a wall higher than the Berlin Wall."
"Let us break down that wall and let us help Bosnia to get its visa requirements lifted, now, as soon as possible, in the same package as the other three countries in this region."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, we Greens obviously welcome visa liberalisation for Montenegro, Macedonia and Serbia."
"That is something I campaigned for very strongly in recent years when I was still a member of the Austrian National Assembly."
"It is an important step in the direction of fulfilling the dream of a unified and peaceful Europe."
"However, the path on which you have embarked has a number of stumbling blocks."
"It will result, above all, in the Muslim citizens of Bosnia feeling discriminated against."
"This was already the case when you merely announced that there would be liberalisation for the other states."
"You argue on the basis of technical conditions that Bosnia and Herzegovina has not yet met, but you apparently overlook the fact that there are still problems in other states which are now being liberalised."
"Bosnia has already issued 40 000 biometric passports and has already passed a regulation for displaced persons, which other states do not yet have, and it has introduced an anti-corruption agency, which Serbia, for example, does not yet have."
"I get the impression that there is also political discrimination here and I consider that very dangerous for peace in the region and for a multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"So to name this danger once again: there is a danger that ethnic dividing lines will be formalised here too."
"I therefore call on you to conclude a common package with Bosnia and Albania and to start visa talks with Kosovo."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, certain areas of the Balkans are still unstable and are communication routes for illegal traffic controlled by organised crime networks."
"Particularly serious is the traffic in human beings, which often involves exploitation in the form of illegal work or prostitution."
"The liberalisation of visas must therefore be accompanied by the rigorous application of security rules, one of which is the introduction of biometric passports."
"As far as we are aware, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have still not implemented these technical measures in full."
"It is therefore crucial that we do not liberalise visas for these two countries until their governments cooperate in full and the technical measures guaranteeing the identity of the parties concerned have been implemented."
"A failure to meet requirements does not, in my view, represent discrimination."
"(RO) I am pleased that today we are discussing the visa waiver for some Balkan countries and I must tell you why: my grandparents were born in Macedonia, my father in Albania, my grandmother in Greece and my mother in Bulgaria, while I was born in Romania."
"I am here today, thank God, so that I can ask Olli Rehn: is it possible to lift visa requirements for Albania by the middle of 2010, as has been promised?"
"This is a question which I would like an answer to because it touches on my emotions, my relations, my family and my roots which lie across almost the entire Balkans."
"Please God."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we were all delighted about the proposed liberalisation of visas."
"We have already been fighting for this in this Parliament for a long time and now a start has been made."
"That is not enough for us."
"I think that the wrong wording was chosen in June."
"Today - as we have heard - there are still problems in Serbia and in Montenegro."
"So why did we not include Albania and Bosnia in this wording and say, here too there are problems that need to be overcome?"
"That would not have caused too much damage."
"It is, of course, a fact that the politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina have little interest in improving what is, from every point of view, the awkward situation of their fellow countrymen."
"Why should they?"
"They have a job, they can travel, they waste their time with useless nationalistic conflicts, instead, for example, of working for a good school system, for a good infrastructure, for a good health system, nor have they ensured that the benchmarks for visa liberalisation are in place."
"Visa liberalisation would bring a breath of fresh air at long last to this nationalistic fug in Bosnia and Herzegovina and finally give the young generation hope."
"However, since the announcement of the Commission's evaluation, measures have been taken in Bosnia and Herzegovina to combat corruption and a number of important laws have been set in motion, so that the technical preconditions can be met in autumn."
"However, it is not just a question of technical preconditions; it is also a question of the political aspect of things."
"There is the question of the biometric passports;"
"I know that not many have yet been issued and I would sincerely call on the Commission and some of the Member States to help issue these biometric passports."
"Technical assistance means a great deal."
"The Council, the Commission and local politicians must really make every effort to stop the ethnic divide in this country from widening further still."
"A refusal to liberalise visas for Bosnia and Herzegovina would ghettoise the Muslims, as the Croats and Serbs have a way out of this country."
"The Bosnian passport - normally a passport is unmistakable proof of a nation - will be worthless in the eyes of its holders if it does not open the door to the EU."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council to help these countries."
"Albania will manage."
"They have a new government; they will manage, but Kosovo will only manage if you all help."
"You have our support."
"You do not need to turn a blind eye, but you should set political standards, not just police standards."
"(SK) The liberalisation of visa policies in the Western Balkans is both a politically sensitive issue and a highly sensitive issue in human terms for the inhabitants of these states and this region."
"At present, we are talking about Montenegro, Macedonia and Serbia, which is very important in a historical context, but we should not introduce a two-speed system in the Western Balkans on a long-term basis and we must bring Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular, into this process as quickly as possible and also Albania of course."
"The Western Balkans have close geographical, cultural and historical ties to the European Union and to our Member States, and despite the extremely turbulent events that have unfolded there in recent times, it must be said that both the reforms and our expectations are gradually being fulfilled and that political leaders in these states really are making great efforts to meet our expectations."
"In my speech, I would therefore possibly like to ask not only the Council and the Commission but also everyone here in the European Parliament to support the leaders of the various states in their efforts and to provide them with assistance in respect of those issues that have yet to be resolved."
"We must also not forget that the countries of the Western Balkans are of great geopolitical importance to us for many reasons."
"As Serbia and Montenegro now face important domestic challenges which we all hope they will overcome, I would like to stress once more that it would be very appropriate to fix a date as soon as possible for those countries that have been excluded from the process, by which I mean Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania."
"Madam President, these measures allow visa-free access to the EU Schengen group Member States from Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia as from January 2010."
"The Commission envisages giving Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina visa-free access possibly by mid-2010."
"So within 12 months, we could see another 20.7 million people given free access to the EU."
"Strictly speaking, this should not affect the UK, which is not a member of the Schengen group, but in reality it will."
"Access to the EU for millions more people from some of the poorest and most corrupt countries in Europe will enable them to cross the first barrier in gaining illegal entry to Britain."
"These countries will eventually be full members of the EU anyway, with full legal access to the EU."
"These measures are yet another undermining of Britain's ability to control her own borders, and yet another reason why Britain should leave the European Union."
"(BG) Madam President, we are all clearly aware of the advantages and disadvantages of free movement, but let us look at it from another aspect."
"Are the three countries in question really fulfilling the fundamental criteria required in order to be granted such privileges as part of the visa waiver?"
"The Bulgarian minority in Serbia has been totally neglected and discriminated against for almost a century now, while Macedonia, ever since its foundation, has pursued in practice a constant and consistent anti-Bulgarian policy."
"The latest act committed by Macedonia in this regard was to arrest the Bulgarian citizen Spaska Mitrova and give her an exceptionally harsh sentence."
"Mitrova is a member of the Bulgarian association 'Ratko'."
"This association was banned in Macedonia, which resulted in Macedonia being ordered to pay a fine for breach of human rights."
"The Bulgarian public find it unacceptable that concessions are made to countries that breach the rights of Bulgarian citizens, in other words, citizens of the European Union."
"(HU) I think it is important that the moment has come when we can finally talk properly about the issue of visa-free travel with regard to the Western Balkan countries."
"It is gratifying that these countries, which have fulfilled the commitments they have made to date, can also be instrumental in making the process of crossing borders as smooth as possible."
"As a Hungarian MEP, I cannot but support these efforts because they will make it possible for Hungarians living in Vojvodina in Serbia, for example, to establish a more direct link with the mother country."
"Citizens who live on either side of these borders and who speak the same language and foster close family and cultural ties will not be able to find sufficient words to express the importance of being able to cross borders without any barrier or visa."
"On this point, although not closely linked to visa-free travel, certain forward-looking decisions have also been taken, such as the law recently adopted in Serbia governing the operation of the minorities' national councils."
"These mark serious progress in terms of the institutional protection of minorities' rights."
"Facilitating visa-free travel cannot be regarded simply as a technical issue."
"It is a very clear political matter."
"A vital contribution is made to these countries' political stability, knowing what entitlements they are granted with a passport from their own states and to what extent it is recognised by the European Union."
"It would be unacceptable if the negative differentiation among the states in the region were to continue in the long term."
"This is why I appeal to the key responsibility of the Commission and the Council in these matters."
"The European Union has the political responsibility to offer the Western Balkan countries the prospect of joining the European Union. it should help these countries catch up and encourage the formation and strengthening of their democratic institutions, which includes minority rights as well."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President."
"I too would like to welcome Mrs Cecilia Malmström and Commissioner Barrot."
"I am also delighted with this proposal that has been put forward."
"As a former Hungarian Foreign Minister, I have worked very hard together with others to bring the Western Balkan countries closer to the European Union and make them take the next step on the path to accession."
"We also know that, from this perspective, visa-free travel is the thing which people perhaps understand and feel the most."
"It now paves the way for them to enjoy freedom of movement and to form closer human relationships."
"Perhaps it will also help with what I think we all consider important, which is sustaining the motivation of these countries during the very difficult process which accession entails."
"We know that some very serious steps must be taken."
"Very often, certain traditions need to be transcended which we know it is not easy to transcend."
"It is very important that the three countries are now given visa-free travel."
"I would also like to draw your attention to a view which has been voiced many times today, namely, that the balance in the Western Balkan countries is very delicate."
"There were already ethnic tensions before the war, but they have still remained following the war."
"We must therefore assess every kind of measure from the perspective of whether it will decrease or increase these tensions."
"In the case of Bosnia, as has been mentioned several times today, this decision is not only beneficial and important because Bosnia has now been left out, but also because a large number of Bosnian citizens who have a Croatian or Serbian passport will enjoy visa-free travel, while the remainder will not."
"The same situation applies to Kosovan citizens too, so that anyone who can obtain their passport in Serbia will enjoy visa-free travel."
"I believe that it is important for us to emphasise once again that a political decision must be made, not only a technical one."
"For this reason, it is our responsibility to help these countries achieve visa-free travel as soon as possible, within a very specific timeframe."
"(DE) Madam President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I too share Mr Weber's security concerns, having spent ten years in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"This subject has a profoundly foreign policy dimension."
"I am from a generation which grew up with hundreds of thousands of so-called Yugoslavian foreign workers."
"During the communist dictatorship, the people of southeast Europe living on the borders of Yugoslavia were free to travel, despite the communist dictatorship."
"Today we talk of Europeanisation, we send in troops and officials, we spend a great deal of money and, at the same time, we are imprisoning young people in these countries."
"That is why the liberalisation of this visa regime is urgently needed."
"However, I too have a number of criticisms to make: firstly I am delighted that Macedonia is on board."
"Macedonia is exemplary in meeting the criteria, but we should not cite this to Macedonia as compensation for its justified wish to have a date finally set for accession negotiations."
"Secondly, Kosovo: it has been said that it must abide by the rules of play, but a player can only abide by the rules of play if they are allowed on to the playing field."
"Kosovo has not been allowed on to the playing field."
"We intervened militarily, in order to liberate the Kosovars from oppression."
"Now the country of the former oppressors are to enjoy visa waiver - and I welcome this, because there is no collective guilt - and Kosovo cannot aspire to it."
"Even if there are shortcomings there, it is we who must beat our breasts, because we basically administer this country."
"In other words, we must give Kosovo every opportunity, because if Serbia enjoys visa waiver in the long run and Kosovo is absolutely excluded, that will lead to unacceptable distortions."
"Thirdly, Bosnia and Herzegovina: I - like several Members - signed the protest against the exclusion of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"This land of three nations - badly designed under the Dayton Agreement, which is in dire need of review - with an international administration, which is equally guilty of inefficiency, must ultimately be given an opportunity to take the path to Europe, without being disintegrated."
"Disintegration for Kosovo or Bosnia would endanger our security more than any technical details."
"(EL) Madam President, we must acknowledge that the visa waiver for Serbia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro is an important step towards the European integration of the Western Balkans."
"However, it should apply to all the nations in the Western Balkans and avoid creating new dividing lines in the area."
"Of course, no one can justifiably maintain that the European Commission is biased against the Muslim citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"On the other hand, we should not forget the peculiar status of Kosovo, whose independence is not recognised by all Member States of the European Union."
"We want the inhabitants of Kosovo to benefit from the visa waiver; however, whatever the solution found, it must not prejudice the final arrangements concerning its status."
"The Commission has acted correctly in not closing the door to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania."
"However, it must proceed swiftly, so that no new divisions threaten stability in the area."
"For their part, of course, the states need to make the necessary reforms which, lest we forget, touch on the question of security and combating organised crime."
"This Parliament has stressed for years that easier contact with the outside world and greater facility for travel will reinforce peace, exchanges at all levels and, ultimately, stability."
"The issue of visas is not simply a technical issue; it is a deeply political issue which affects the European future of the area and all the nations in the area have a right to that future."
"(SV) Madam President, I think that at this stage in the debate there is no longer any doubt of the importance of visa liberalisation to the citizens of the Balkans."
"The ability to travel freely is, along with education, perhaps the most important tool that we can offer the new generations, of whom we expect so much commitment to the democratisation process throughout the region."
"Consequently, I welcome the proposal on visa liberalisation for Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro."
"The progress of any individual country on its journey towards the EU represents progress for the whole of the Balkans."
"Some of these countries have had to wait a long time; some perhaps longer than necessary."
"We in the European Parliament and the two countries not yet included in visa liberalisation should learn lessons from this."
"Although this is a highly sensitive political issue, I would like to point out that the rules on visa liberalisation are clear and universal."
"The conditions must be met."
"Let us not make this more of a political issue than is necessary, however."
"Let us look at what remains to be done and how we can ensure as quickly as possible that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are soon also able to join the family of visa-free countries."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina has made great progress recently and will soon have fulfilled most of the remaining requirements in the roadmap."
"I therefore call on the players in Bosnia and Herzegovina to adopt the anti-corruption act and lay down rules for the exchange of information between the different parts of the police service as quickly as possible."
"I urge them to try to ensure that this work is completed by the end of September, before a report is sent back to the Commission."
"In its new analysis, I then expect the Commission in turn to judge what progress has actually been made and, once the EU's requirements have been met, to propose that the Council approve visa liberalisation for Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"I hope that this can take effect in July 2010."
"(RO) Madam President, Commissioner, the visa waiver for some of the countries which belong to the Western Balkans region marks an initial confirmation of the European Union's commitment to continuing the European process of integration."
"However, I believe that unfortunately, the Commission's proposal is incomplete."
"Citizens from Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina will not enjoy the same treatment, which is going to create differences between citizens in the Balkans."
"I would like to remind you that there is already a division between the previous generation, which benefited from the opening up of the former Republic of Yugoslavia to Europe, and the current generation, which has not enjoyed equal treatment from the European Union."
"However, this proposal will result in citizens of countries in the former Republic of Yugoslavia who do not benefit from the visa waiver trying to obtain a second passport in a country belonging to the former Yugoslav federation, which the European Union accepts without a visa."
"We have already come across this type of scenario in the case of Moldovan or Georgian passports versus Russian passports."
"I believe that the logical solution is to apply the same treatment to all Balkan countries and, at the same time, I call on the Commission to look into including Moldova as well among the group of countries in south-east Europe."
"(RO) As an MEP and socialist, I welcome the communication from the Council and Commission on the visa regime for the three Western Balkan countries."
"It is a first definite step towards their integration into the European Union, a first achievement for future EU citizens in the Western Balkans."
"However, I also appreciate that the lack of any clear prospect in the form of a roadmap for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Kosovo must be a matter of utmost concern to us."
"I am not only talking about the disappointment among the general public, but particularly about the risk to political stability in the three countries."
"Above all, I am expecting the European Parliament and the newly formed European Commission to maintain a predictable schedule for integrating the Western Balkans into the European Union."
"It is the only way that we can fulfil the mandate which we were elected for: to unite Europe."
"(RO) Madam President, one minute will be more than enough for me to welcome an historic decision for both the Balkans and Europe."
"I believe that freedom of movement is the gateway to democracy and knowledge."
"You have given these three countries an opportunity."
"However, at the same time, I believe that Europe is also a Europe of regulations which, as European citizens, every one of us must abide by."
"You have put forward this proposal because you have assessed that the rules and conditions that we set have been met."
"I am of the view that you will submit a proposal to extend this to Albania and Bulgaria when these European regulations have been met."
"In your decision, you will certainly draw up a recommendation for speeding up this process."
"I am one of those who think that this is not an issue of discrimination."
"Quite the opposite, in fact."
"I feel that this process will help encourage the other two countries to perform better and meet these conditions because, since the adoption of this decision, the other three countries have proved that when they wanted their peoples to enjoy a different status, they were willing to do what it takes."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I am in favour of liberalisation and of European integration up to and including the completion of this mosaic that is the Western Balkans because, as someone said earlier, we need the Balkans to be stable."
"This integration is therefore crucial and must happen as soon as possible."
"However, on the subject of immigration - which we spoke about yesterday and which represented security and human rights - we must be very careful, because I believe that the checks must be carried out thoroughly, and not made easier."
"The timescales must correspond to these checks, which should be speeded up if possible."
"Next, I note that there is a gap in this area, about which very little has been said, and that gap is Kosovo."
"You will understand me perfectly well when I say that this gap makes it quite simple for people from the other countries to travel between Kosovo and Macedonia."
"I know that a report is being prepared that will tell us something in the next few days, but please give us some more information about Kosovo this evening."
"(NL) Madam President, the Minister said it so well: visa liberalisation is necessary in order to strengthen a bond with the EU, prevent rising nationalism and avoid isolation."
"How can it be possible, then, that the proposals threaten to isolate the Bosnian Muslims?"
"Great inequality is arising within a single country, as Serbian and Croatian Bosnians do receive a passport."
"The Muslims, however, sadly have no neighbouring country that will give them a passport."
"Who will stand up for the Bosnian Muslims?"
"Will the Commission do it?"
"Will the Council?"
"Can you tell me for certain whether the Commission or the Council have held talks with Croatia and Serbia about exercising restraint in the issuing of passports as it should be clear that their actions will create a great deal of unrest."
"(BG) I would like to congratulate Mr Barrot for the European Commission's position on liberalising the visa regime for the Western Balkans."
"As Foreign Minister at the time when visa requirements for Bulgaria were lifted, I know the great emotional effect the visa waiver and ending of humiliation had on our citizens."
"At the same time, however, as an MEP, I cannot but agree with Mrs Pack and Mrs Bildt that true European solidarity involves the European Union providing logistical help in meeting criteria rather than deviating from them, as this has a demoralising effect on societies and absolves governments of responsibility."
"The change must come as a reward for the effort put in, not as a double standard."
"The societies of the Western Balkans have to get used to demanding their governments to do their job."
"They must know that the visa regime is being delayed not because of European nit-picking, but because they have not done their bit."
"Solidarity should be given in return for taking responsibility."
"When a position of principle is at stake, a person's religion and ethnicity do not matter."
"(RO) I support the European Commission's decision, which embodies the commitment shown for years on end with regard to the visa waiver for citizens of the Western Balkans region."
"However, I believe that the citizens of the Republic of Moldova should enjoy the same rights regarding the freedom of movement in the EU as soon as possible."
"The European Union must continue to develop its open-door policy to these countries, and the visa waiver is an important step on the path to European integration for these peoples."
"To supplement this decision, which will lead to the development of cross-border business opportunities and allow people the freedom of movement, European institutions must consider organising cultural and educational programmes which will publicise European values in these countries."
"Against this background, reinforcing border security and combating international crime must continue to be a priority."
"Finally, I wish to reconfirm that Romania has not recognised Kosovo's independence."
"(SL) I would like to express my satisfaction with the progress of the visa liberalisation process over the past 18 months."
"This is a major achievement and I would urge you to make rapid steps to continue in the same vein."
"In the past few days, we have received reports from Sarajevo that the process of fulfilling the roadmap requirements is gathering pace, despite all the difficulties."
"This also holds true of areas as sensitive as police coordination between Banja Luka and Sarajevo."
"I call on the Commission and the Council to monitor this progress on a continuing basis and to be responsive to it."
"The European Union must be capable of bringing its influence to bear on any political forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina which are seeking to sabotage this process."
"The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina must not be allowed to suffer because of the irresponsibility of their politicians and we have an obligation to help them in that regard."
"I call on the Commission to include Bosnia and Herzegovina within the visa-free zone as soon as possible."
"A selective approach to visa lifting will not strengthen the European prospects of any Western Balkan country whose communities are divided, because selectivity brings with it new divisions."
"I welcome every move that combats selectivity and firmly believe that lifting visa requirements for all those countries would certainly help improve the image of the European Union in the eyes of the people in these countries who need an opening on the world after years of conflict."
"I would also like to point out that there are thousands of young people living in these countries who have never been able to travel abroad."
"Their only source of knowledge about Europe and the world is television."
"We have an obligation to strengthen their European prospects as well."
"I am aware of the security considerations, but those leaving their countries with ill intentions will find a way to cross into the EU anyway."
"However, we are holding back hundreds of thousands of those who have good intentions."
"I would, therefore, urge the Council and the Commission to review their positions as soon as possible, to follow up the progress in these countries, and to lift visa requirements for the countries which were not included in the first group. Thank you very much."
"Naturally, I call on the governments of these Western Balkan countries to fulfil their obligations as soon as possible, in the interests of their citizens and their EU accession prospects."
"Madam President, the liberalisation of the visa regime for the Western Balkan countries is important, as this measure matters most to ordinary citizens in the region and it will clearly show the benefits of the EU rapprochement process."
"I am confident that the conditional inclusion on the white list of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina will prove to be a strong incentive for meeting the rest of the benchmarks on the road map."
"In our case, back in 2001, such a strong signal was sent, and in a couple of months, we managed to fulfil all pending conditions."
"It is essential that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are included on the Schengen white list as soon as possible, and the Commission should provide all the necessary technical assistance to the authorities of these two countries in order to meet the necessary conditions in a short while."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (SV) Madam President, there is no doubt that visa liberalisation is incredibly important for the people of the Balkans."
"Just like you, I have met many frustrated people - particularly young people - who are unable to travel around Europe as they would like, unable to visit their friends, unable to enjoy the freedoms that we all have."
"It goes without saying that achieving visa freedom for these people would be good for them, good for their countries, good for the whole region and good for the EU."
"That is why I am delighted that the conditions are already in place to give this opportunity to the three countries mentioned - the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia - at the end of the year."
"It is regrettable that not all the countries of the Western Balkans can be included in this proposal at present, but let there be no doubt that the Swedish Presidency is extremely keen to strengthen the integration process - and eventually the enlargement process - in the Balkan region."
"Those of you who know me will be aware of just how committed I am to this matter."
"If this commitment is to be credible and become a reality, however, we must insist on the conditions being met."
"It is essential that we do so for the sake of the people of the Western Balkans as well as for the benefit of our own citizens."
"We must ensure that the criteria set are met."
"As Mr Weber said, we cannot make concessions where foreign policy is concerned just to be nice."
"That applies whether we are talking about visas or accession."
"I know that the people of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are disappointed."
"I can understand that."
"They have not been forgotten, however."
"We will do everything we can to help them and to make visa liberalisation possible, and that includes in technical terms."
"We must give a clear political signal that the opportunity is there for them to be included."
"That is what we are doing today."
"However, it is up to the authorities and politicians in those countries to finish off the job."
"I do not believe that a time lag between the removal of visas for the first three countries and for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina will cause instability."
"On the contrary, it shows that the EU keeps its word and that if they do what is necessary, then we will keep our promises."
"We must support them and we must help them."
"I believe they will be able to get a positive report from the Commission in 2010."
"Commissioner Barrot has also said as much."
"Where Kosovo is concerned, discussions on the visa regime started back when Kosovo was still part of Serbia, but we are working on finding a solution."
"I hope that the Commission will point the way forward in its report so that in the longer term, we can also bring about visa liberalisation for the people of Kosovo."
"The proposed visa liberalisation for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia is a very important first step."
"I hope you will help us to take it."
"I also hope that very soon, we will be able to move on and take the next step for the rest of the region."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to mention that this is a groundbreaking step."
"It is the first time that we have really had a regional approach."
"I would add that this road map method is one based on very objective, very precise criteria, which also help encourage these future Member States to actually realise that we have a Europe of rules, a Europe of values."
"I would like to stress that point."
"You will not be surprised that the Commission is particularly attentive to everything that contributes to the fight against people trafficking and against corruption."
"It is important, this Europe of values."
"We must be particularly mindful of this."
"I do not know if some of you understood me correctly: I stated clearly that, in the course of 2010, we hope to make proposals for Bosnia and Herzegovina and for Albania."
"There is, therefore, a process in motion which does not aim to discriminate against anyone."
"We simply want the road map's objective criteria to be observed increasingly."
"It is true that in the case of Albania, the issuing of biometric passports still has to be improved."
"I myself went to Albania to present the first biometric passport in that country and I can tell you that I gave as much encouragement as possible to see that Albania, its political leaders and those of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are fully aware of the efforts required."
"We are helping them to establish civil registers, for example, because no matter how hard you try to provide biometric passports, if there is no civil register, it is not possible."
"Thus, we are helping them technically."
"It is quite clear that in all this, Albania, in particular, must implement the existing framework for combating organised crime and corruption."
"In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there also has to be good border control and closer cooperation between police authorities."
"That is what we want."
"I think that we have good reason to believe that, in 2010, these two countries will also benefit from the abolition of visas."
"I would also like to say to you quite simply that for us there is no question of ethnic or religious discrimination."
"Incidentally, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, there is a significant Muslim minority."
"There is no question of discriminating against the 25 or 30% of Muslim Albanians in Macedonia."
"Therefore, I would really like to reassure you and to tell you that this is part of a process that we have planned and that the Council has willingly accepted."
"I will also give you an answer on Kosovo."
"In March 2009, an expert mission funded by the Commission resulted in some positive findings."
"It is true that the Commission is also encouraging Member States to establish effective consular missions in Pristina."
"I can confirm that we will have a report, which will be submitted shortly, on the exact situation in Kosovo."
"It is quite clear that in all this we want to open this European perspective to all of the Balkan countries, and we are thinking in particular about the young generation."
"Some of you have put particular emphasis on the fact that travel and much easier exchanges with other European Union Member States are, of course, very beneficial."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is why, once more, we will build a Europe of regulations and of values that we hold very dear."
"I will tell you quite simply, we are on the right road, but evidently we still need to see a final push by two of the states."
"I hope that in 2010, they will also be able to see the visas waived."
"That is what I can tell you, giving you the assurance, in any event, that the Commission's process is one which is objective, which is really very attentive and not at all conducted in a spirit of any sort of discrimination, but in a spirit of cooperation."
"I am personally very committed to this."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The European Commission and European Council are being called on to make an announcement soon about opening up the EU zone to the citizens of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro."
"This is a very important moment for more than 10 million European inhabitants who would like a visa to cross the EU's border."
"Macedonia was on Europe's side when Europe needed it."
"Even Serbia has realised that Europe wants it to come onboard, but it needs to be reconciled with its recent past to do this."
"Serbia has worked closely with the international institutions, such as the International Criminal Tribunal, and has acknowledged the mistakes of the past."
"The time has come for Europe to reward the efforts of these states for coming into line with the democratic and economic requirements which are typical of the EU-27."
"Their journey has not been easy, but the efforts which have been made must be fully recognised."
"Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro have definitely taken the turning for the European Union."
"This is why I think that the EU must decide in favour of lifting the visa requirements imposed on citizens from these three countries."
"Their governments have demonstrated that they share the same values as we do."
"A positive decision would therefore give new impetus to the internal reforms, which are very much needed in Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro."
"I welcome the Commission's initiative to remove the visa system for citizens from the Western Balkans region, more specifically the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro."
"Such measures, intended to bring these states and the EU closer together with a view to integration, will reduce the potential for conflict in the region significantly."
"As far as Romania is concerned, which shares a border with Serbia, this kind of measure can only serve to provide a further guarantee of amicable cross-border relations."
"This measure will contribute to a greater freedom of movement for the Romanian population in Romania and Serbia, as well as support the development of commercial relations between our country and Serbia and Montenegro."
"I am confident that removing the visa system for these three countries mentioned above is only the start of the process, with the measure being extended later on to Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Although they have not yet met the Commission's requirements, I believe that with coordinated efforts, the results will become evident in a short time, Before I end, I would like to emphasise that the visa waiver and the freedom of movement for people in the Western Balkans must not arouse fears, but establish the belief that Europe's security zone is being extended for the benefit of all of us."
"in writing. - (HU) The European Union has become stronger after every expansion, not only because it has created a common market for almost 500 million citizens, but also because it has guaranteed stability in Central and Eastern Europe."
"The Balkan countries are an integral part of Europe."
"The economic crisis or the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty must not delay the process leading to these countries' accession to the European Union."
"I firmly believe that extending the expansion process to the Balkans is a vital process which the European Union must support in order to strengthen its global role."
"We must not forget that the Balkan countries' catch-up process, along with the healing of the wounds from the bloody war at the end of the 20th century, guarantee the European Union's stability and the region's well-being."
"Waiving the visa requirement for Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a vitally important event for these countries as part of their process of catching up, while also reflecting the European Union's responsibility to the region."
"This process must be resolutely continued."
"It will then enable Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and - at the appropriate time - Kosovo to benefit as soon as possible, after meeting the relevant conditions, from the application of visa-free travel."
"I support, without reservation, the view of those European politicians who think that suppressing the Balkan countries' ambitions to join the EU would entail unforeseeable, damaging consequences."
"Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the law on protection of minors (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Council by Sophia in 't Veld, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Leonidas Donskis, Gianni Vattimo, Sarah Ludford, Ulrike Lunacek, Raül Romeva i Rueda, Jean Lambert and Judith Sargentini, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the Lithuanian Law for the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information - B7-0201/2009),"
"the oral question to the Commission by Sophia in 't Veld, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Leonidas Donskis, Gianni Vattimo, Sarah Ludford, Ulrike Lunacek, Raül Romeva i Rueda, Jean Lambert and Judith Sargentini, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the Lithuanian Law for the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information - B7-0202/2009),"
"the oral question to the Council by Rui Tavares, Cornelia Ernst, Cornelis de Jong, Marie-Christine Vergiat, Willy Meyer and Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the Lithuanian Law for the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information - B7-0204/2009),"
"the oral question to the Commission by Rui Tavares, Cornelia Ernst, Cornelis de Jong, Marie-Christine Vergiat, Willy Meyer and Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the Lithuanian Law for the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information - B7-0205/2009),"
"the oral question to the Council by Michael Cashman, Claude Moraes and Emine Bozkurt, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, on the Lithuanian Law for the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information - B7-0206/2009), and"
"the oral question to the Commission by Michael Cashman, Claude Moraes and Emine Bozkurt, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, on the Lithuanian Law for the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information - B7-0207/2009)."
"author. - Madam President, I think this is a very important subject that we are discussing here today."
"It is about European values."
"We put in the oral question and we have also drafted a joint resolution about the Lithuanian law, which is allegedly about the protection of minors."
"But it actually does the contrary, because this law may well foster ignorance, taboo and stigma."
"It will expose young and vulnerable gay, lesbian and transgender people to bullying and exclusion."
"It will therefore lead to immeasurable distress and suffering by young people, the very people that this law is designed to protect."
"Instead of protection, it inflicts harm on young people."
"Therefore we have addressed this question, and I am very happy that in the summer, we received a letter from Commissioner Barrot expressing the European Commission's concern about this law, saying that the European Commission will keep a very close eye on it and make sure that any national legislation is in line with European legislation and principles."
"I think that is very important, because the European Commission should not only intervene when market rules are being violated but also, and in particular, when European values are being violated."
"We cannot tolerate discrimination."
"Europe is a community of values - values which I know are shared by the majority of our Lithuanian fellow citizens."
"We are all Europeans."
"With reference to the resolution, colleagues, I would ask for your explicit support for the resolution and, in particular, for the amendment that seeks to insert a reference to the existing anti-discrimination directives, because I think that is the very minimum."
"I also ask for your support for the request in the resolution to ask the Fundamental Rights Agency for a legal opinion on this law."
"Finally, I think we can be proud, as a European Parliament - if we adopt the resolution tomorrow - to be the voice of the shared values of Europe."
"Madam President, as the previous speaker said, this law passed in Lithuania endangers European values, European law and also the freedom of people, namely the freedom of young people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or perhaps transgender, to live their life without fear."
"According to this law, factual information on this is supposedly damaging to these young people."
"I can tell you what that means: it means that these young people must live in fear and possibly suffer depression."
"We know that there is an increased rate of attempted suicide among young people who are lesbian or gay or who are confused in their coming-out phase about how they will live their lives."
"This law flies in the face of European values, which is why I was delighted that Commissioner Barrot responded on this back in July."
"You also told the European region of the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) that the Commission would analyse this text and explain what its next steps would be."
"What I am interested in today is what you intend to do."
"What have you - and the Council - already promised the Lithuanian Parliament?"
"We know that the former Lithuanian President and the new president, who used to be a commissioner, do not approve of this law, but the parliament is insisting on it."
"I am delighted that a proposal is on the table today, including a motion for a resolution."
"I truly hope that we shall all accept the resolution tomorrow and can petition the European Union Agency on Fundamental Rights to take a position on this law, as that is what it is there for."
"In the meantime, it should be quite clear in our common Europe that lesbians and gays will not disappear from families and schools merely because a law prohibits information on them."
"Being different is normal, including in this, our common Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this law begins by claiming to protect children against the promotion of homosexuality in public information."
"What does that actually mean?"
"Does it mean that if I have a cinema in Vilnius and want to put up a poster for the film Brokeback Mountain, I cannot do so?"
"Does it mean that if I give a lecture on homosexuality in a public place, theatre or university in Lithuania, I cannot do so?"
"Does it mean - as has already been discussed in the Lithuanian Parliament - that I will have to pay a fine of up to EUR 1 500 or do a month's community service under the changes to the criminal code that are currently being debated in Lithuania?"
"Can a television programme, for example, show a homosexual couple that is happy, or must it only show one that is unhappy?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, there was a date that surprised me when these amendments to the law on the protection of minors in Lithuania were passed: it was 14 July 2009."
"14 July is, of course, the day when we gathered here for the first time in this seventh parliamentary term, and also the day marking the 220th anniversary of our European principles, including the right to seek happiness, the principle of freedom of expression and even the principle of freedom of assembly."
"Now the freedom of assembly is also at risk, because the Lithuanian Parliament, again, has more recently been discussing the possibility of banning events such as 'gay pride' marches."
"Well, when we gathered here for the first time on 14 July 2009, it was because we had a duty - I would say a sacred duty - to defend these values, and these are the values that are at stake."
"We know how those things begin, and we also know where they always lead."
"What are we going to do next?"
"Appoint a committee to see what is and what is not promotion of homosexuality?"
"Where - in books, theatres, cinemas, advertising?"
"Vilnius is one of this year's European capitals of culture, deservedly so, and certainly much to the delight of all Europeans."
"Being a European capital of culture also entails responsibilities, however: the responsibility of promoting European culture for the best reasons and not to put it under the spotlight this year for the wrong reasons."
"I therefore appeal for a vote in favour of our resolution and call on the Agency for Fundamental Rights to issue an opinion on this very serious topic."
"That is certainly the least that the Members of this House can ask."
"author. - Madam President, can I say, as a gay man, I am proud that this House and others are speaking out against this proposed law."
"This proposed law will clearly breach EU treaties on human rights, particularly Article 6, as well as the Employment Framework Directive and general policies on non-discrimination."
"It also, interestingly, breaches the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in that it encourages discrimination against young lesbians and gay people."
"So, whom does it protect, and from what?"
"The British Conservatives introduced in Great Britain a similar law in 1988."
"It was recognised then, and recognised now, that these laws lead to censorship and the promotion of discrimination and homophobia: discrimination and homophobia which destroys people's lives and blights the souls of those who practise it."
"The proposed law has been condemned by NGOs, including the International Lesbian and Gay Association, the Council of Europe and Amnesty International, as well as others."
"It affects young lesbians and gay men - teachers, public officials - and could be used to prevent young people having access to any material - films, books, plays, works of art - created by a gay man or a lesbian."
"Are they going to try and stop young people studying the works of Plato, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman, Tennessee Williams, Tchaikovsky and others, the music of Elton John, or idolising tennis greats such as Martina Navratilova?"
"It will affect the very way young people and others speak, think and act."
"And why?"
"Young people need education, not isolation; they need to understand the world in all its diversity and be taught respect for those who are different."
"The love of one human being for another is never lessened by gender or sexuality: it is love."
"Lesbians and gay men are ordinary men and women made extraordinary by extremists' preoccupation with our sex lives and the defamation that lesbians and gay men are a threat to society."
"That is a vile misrepresentation."
"Any civilised society is judged not by how it treats its majority but how it treats its minorities."
"So I say to Lithuanians and people across Europe: reject this dangerous step back to the past."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, allow me to start by underlining that freedom of expression and non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity are cornerstones of our democratic societies."
"Our Union is based on various principles and values that all the Member States are expected to support."
"We cannot insist on and stand up for respect for human rights in other countries if we cannot uphold these fundamental principles ourselves within the EU."
"These fundamental rights and, in particular, freedom of expression and the right not to suffer discrimination, are recognised in Article 6 of the Treaty establishing the European Union and are also contained in Articles 10 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"These principles are further stated in the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"There is legislation at Community level to safeguard this area."
"Directive 2000/78/EC prohibits discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of religion or creed, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"Last year, the Commission tabled a proposal to extend this protection to other areas."
"This proposal is currently under discussion in the Council and Parliament has submitted a positive opinion."
"We welcome this initiative and hope it will be adopted before long."
"This is about legislation at European level."
"At national level, Member States can adopt national legislation in the area of fundamental freedoms and rights provided - and I repeat: provided - that this legislation fully respects the Union's and the Community's primary and secondary legislation, falls within an area in which the Community does not exclusively have competence, and is justified by the fact that there is no legislation at Union or Community level."
"The law in question that was adopted by the Lithuanian Parliament in July and the proposed amendment of the Criminal Code and administrative law that is being discussed are a cause of great concern for the Swedish Presidency."
"However, we must not forget that the law has not yet entered into force."
"From our perspective, a law that aims to ban the promotion of a certain sexual orientation violates fundamental values such as freedom of expression and the fact that all people are equal."
"The Presidency has made this position clear in contacts with the Lithuanian Government on repeated occasions."
"As regards the more legal issues raised by Members in their speeches, it is important to point out that the Council does not have a formal role here."
"Compatibility between national legislation and the treaties is not a matter for the Council, nor is it a matter for the Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"It is up to the Commission to judge whether a Member State is meeting its obligations under the treaties."
"That involves not only monitoring whether Union and Community legislation is correctly transposed and implemented nationally, but also ensuring that primary law at European level is fully respected."
"As I am sure Mr Barrot will say, the Commission can initiate appropriate proceedings if it considers that a Member State is not complying with primary or secondary legislation."
"Where Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community is concerned, the Council would be deeply concerned if it were to find cases of discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"However, a proposal from the Commission is required if the Council is to initiate a discussion of whether discrimination is taking place and the measures to be taken if so."
"In the same way, under Article 7 of the Treaty, the Council can only take action if a third of the Member States or the Commission put forward such a proposal with due justification."
"Since the law has not yet entered into force, no such proposal has been tabled."
"I can assure Members that the matter of discrimination against LGBT people is on the Swedish Presidency's agenda."
"We will be discussing it at an equality summit in Stockholm on 16-17 November."
"Naturally we take the European Parliament's concern very seriously."
"It is about respect for fundamental rights and human rights."
"In formal terms, however, this must be dealt with within the legal and institutional frameworks."
"As the Council's representative, I have tried to answer the questions as correctly as possible and explain the limitations."
"I look forward to hearing the viewpoints of the representatives of the Commission on this matter."
"Madam President, the Minister has explained very well the legal elements of this problem."
"I would like to say here that the Commission has repeatedly expressed its firm condemnation of all forms of homophobia."
"The phenomenon represents a flagrant violation of human dignity."
"The Commission notably repeated this position before the European Parliament on 23 April 2007, during the plenary session in which the Resolution on homophobia in Europe was adopted."
"In areas that fall under the umbrella of Community competences, the European Union, as well as the Member States when they implement Union law, are required to respect fundamental rights."
"These are binding principles of Community law."
"The Lithuanian law for the protection of minors against the detrimental effects of public information largely falls within the scope of Community competences, as its contents concern implementation of the Directives on audiovisual services and on electronic commerce."
"Therefore, the Commission informed the Lithuanian authorities, even before the adoption of the draft law, that some measures of this law would raise serious concerns in relation to their compatibility with fundamental rights and Community law."
"In spite of this warning, it would seem that the current version of the law adopted on 14 July last does not dispel the concerns expressed by the Commission beforehand."
"In this context, the Commission can only express reservations, and serious reservations, on the compatibility of this law with the principles of freedom of expression, the principle of non-discrimination, and with children's rights, including their right to access information necessary for their development."
"The Commission will not hesitate to take every measure necessary to ensure respect for Community law, including, of course, fundamental rights."
"According to information made available to the Commission, a working group has been established in Lithuania on the initiative of the President, Mrs Grybauskaitė, in order to introduce additional amendments to this law."
"These amendments should be proposed at the end of October."
"The Commission will, of course, await the outcome of the work of this committee and the contents of the amendments before giving a definitive opinion on the law such as it will enter into force."
"Indeed, I can only support Mrs Malmström's very clear point that it is up to the Commission to monitor the situation and ultimately to propose sanctions and to punish breaches of European Union regulations and of fundamental rights, a fortiori."
"That is the information that I wanted to give you, showing you that our position on this matter is extremely clear."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, the law that is being criticised and debated, despite the fact that it will not enter into force until March, contains only one single line prohibiting the promotion of homosexuality to minors; that is the greatly troublesome part."
"The President of the Republic of Lithuania took the initiative by tabling clarifying amendments immediately."
"Thus, our resolution is practically knocking on an open door."
"What we should be doing is concentrating on Parliament's intention."
"The key words in the troublesome line about the promotion of homosexuality to minors are 'promotion' and 'minors' - not 'homosexuality', as some would have it."
"The possibility of direct promotion to minors has been dealt with by the adoption of a law."
"'Promotion' is a deliberate action going beyond the simple and necessary information currently provided by sexual education, which should include a clause of tolerance to homosexual appeal and love."
"The promotion of homosexuality to minors, if we open our eyes, may quite often mean significantly more - from encouraging them to try it, to the seduction of minors, even for homosexual prostitution."
"The media might benefit from such business, probably by disseminating such promotion to minors."
"Dear colleagues, parents and grandparents, please now listen to your hearts."
"Would you be in favour of opening up this whole area of challenges to your own offspring?"
"(Interjection from the floor)"
"OK, that is the case for you."
"What if they are exposed to such special 'promotion' regularly and without restriction?"
"It seems as though we are stumbling between two trees: the first, if someone likes tricky doctrine, is the right of children to be mentally abused, while the second is the right of children to be protected from abuse."
"Let their self-determination come with maturity."
"My proposal is to support the positions recalling both the Convention on, and the Declaration of, the Rights of the Child, and to delete paragraph 1, which is irrelevant at the present time and therefore inappropriate for Europe's highest House."
"Madam President, Mr Landsbergis has given a deeply unconvincing justification of this law."
"I was surprised;"
"I thought he would justify it more."
"The Council and the Commission have expressed their deep concern, and that is the correct line."
"Anti-discrimination and freedom of expression are absolutely fundamental principles in European law."
"In my own Member State, as Mr Cashman said previously, we had such a law in 1988, but it is now history and this law will become history because, as a Community of values, one of the EU's greatest strengths lies in our common endeavour to raise the bar on human rights and the protection of our fundamental freedoms."
"It is also difficult when one Member State is under the spotlight for a potential breach of this law but it is because of our Community of values that we can analyse those laws and we can say, as the Commission and Council have said, they cause deep concern for us."
"The Fundamental Rights Agency should do its job and give its opinion and, as the Commission and Council have said, there are problems within existing law, anti-discrimination laws in this European Union; let us defend what we have and let us ensure that the Socialist Group, along with our sister party in Lithuania, condemn this law, and let us hope that that is what will happen - that it will be consigned to history."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the Lithuanian Law on the Protection of Minors from the Detrimental Effects of Public Information struck human rights defenders and media people in Lithuania and beyond as overly homophobic and profoundly undemocratic."
"Please let me draw your attention to the fact that this law was vetoed by the former President of Lithuania, Valdas Adamkus, but he was overruled by the Lithuanian Parliament."
"In addition, this law has been severely criticised by the current President of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaitė."
"The law was assessed in vigorous terms by the Lithuanian media, commentators, and civil liberties and human rights defenders, who stressed its homophobic substance along with its extremely dangerous political implications, such as censorship and self-censorship."
"This law has little, if anything, to do with the protection of children."
"Instead, it is against gay and lesbian citizens of the country."
"Whatever the case, the equation of homosexuality with physical violence and necrophilia is morally repugnant and deeply disgraceful."
"Still, it is difficult to believe that the adoption of such a law is possible in an EU country at the beginning of the 21st century."
"Personally I take this law as an unfortunate move and as a profound misunderstanding, to say the very least."
"Changes to Article 310 of the penal code and Article 214 of the administrative code are being debated in Lithuania's Parliament that will criminalise, with the threat of a fine, community work or imprisonment, anyone involved in the promotion of homosexuality in any public space."
"If this is not our slide to state-sponsored homophobia and criminalisation of public expression of our gay and lesbian citizens, what is it then?"
"Last but not least, this law is a disgrace, but even more so would be an attempt to obfuscate, trivialise and, in effect, justify it."
"This is to say that I strongly support the resolution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a crucial moment in the process of European integration because, until a short while ago, we would surely not have had this type of debate."
"This is simply because no parliament would ever have considered adopting a law of this nature."
"This means that this is not an internal issue of Lithuanian policy."
"Put simply, we must conclude that we are facing an issue that directly affects the survival of European credibility."
"No part of the European Union - and here we have the three institutions - can remain silent while a Member State adopts laws which persecute and criminalise something as universal as the right to choose the person with whom you have emotional or sexual relations, regardless of gender or age."
"Mr Landsbergis, talking normally about homosexuality, bisexuality and transexuality is the best guarantee of a child being able to live with his or her own sexuality, with respect for himself or herself and for the rest of the community."
"This is important because what we are specifically calling for at this time is a guarantee of healthy growth, without coercion or negative stereotypes or criminalisation of childhood."
"We can do this precisely by holding a normal debate on this situation, as we are doing, and not by prohibiting or criminalising it."
"The law on the protection of minors in Lithuania was drafted out of concern for the emotional and psychological development of the youngest consumers of media which have an increasing presence in children's lives."
"Another concern of the Lithuanian legislators was that children should be brought up according to their parents' convictions."
"I do not believe that there is anyone in this House who would not agree that these are important and burning issues."
"These intentions deserve appreciation, and not criticism, although that is not the main point here."
"There is no article of this law that infringes European law, and in most cases the law does not even touch upon European law."
"The issues raised in the written question are firmly within the remit of the national laws of Member States."
"Nobody has given the European Union authority to act in these areas."
"That is the fundamental reason why we are opposed to the issue being raised at European level, and why we will never agree to any particular ideology justifying European law in exceeding its authority."
"That is also the reason why we cannot support any of the resolutions tabled in this matter."
"Madam President, this is not about ideology."
"I would say it is about the equal value of all people."
"I would also like to thank both the Commission and the Council for their unusually clear position."
"I feel convinced that Parliament, the Commission and the Council are now acting in consort where this violation of fundamental values is concerned."
"We are talking about the EU and the EU's respect for fundamental human rights."
"That must also apply to all the individual Member States."
"In practice, this proposed legislation risks making any information about LGBT issues illegal."
"Just imagine if people were suddenly banned from fighting for the equality of all people regardless of sexual orientation."
"It is beyond doubt that the proposed legislation is an attack on human rights."
"I will not even count how many human rights it violates."
"I will simply say in brief: I fully support this resolution."
"I hope that Parliament will be as unified as possible in voting in favour of this resolution tomorrow."
"(FR) Madam President, above all, I would like to point out how important the fight against all forms of discrimination, particularly discrimination based on sexual orientation, is to the European Union, to Parliament and to all our colleagues."
"What are we talking about today?"
"We are talking about a draft law in Lithuania which is causing a problem, which is causing such a problem that Mrs Grybauskaithas become involved."
"She has exercised her veto; she has even set up a working group, which will propose amendments to us."
"I therefore have complete confidence in her, and I am sure that this problem will be resolved and that the Member State concerned will find a solution to this serious problem that is discrimination based on sexual orientation."
"We have consulted each other, some groups have proposed a resolution and we have fortunately come to a joint resolution."
"I am therefore convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that this joint resolution will be adopted tomorrow and that this problem will be resolved."
"It is, of course, important that the intellectual and mental health of our children is protected, but I would still like to remind you that the fight against all forms of sexual discrimination is important."
"We have worked for this for many years."
"We have the Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"It does have a purpose."
"We have battled for it to be established and there is no question today of it being abandoned or being thrown out."
"I would therefore like to thank you for your willingness to adopt this joint resolution."
"I thank all of my fellow Members who have put so much into these negotiations."
"It is a great pleasure to see that we have succeeded in putting together this joint resolution and I hope that it will be adopted in this House tomorrow."
"(LT) I welcome the European Parliament's initiative to begin a debate on the question of the Law for the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information, passed due to the efforts of the Lithuanian right wing parties."
"It is regrettable that the law was passed without its compliance with international and European Union law being sufficiently debated and assessed."
"The voice of non-governmental organisations also fell on deaf ears."
"Under the guise of the noble goal to protect children's rights, in actual fact, a legal basis has been created to divide society, limit information and discriminate against individual groups of society."
"The former President of Lithuania vetoed the draft law, while the new President has set up a working group, which will submit a new draft of the law to Parliament in its session this autumn."
"I hope that there will be sufficient political will in Lithuania to improve the law, all the more so because we have experience adopting and implementing progressive laws in this area."
"Six years ago, the Law on equal opportunities was adopted thanks to the efforts of the Lithuanian social democrats and this prohibited any direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of age, sexual orientation, disability, race or ethnic origin in all areas of life."
"At the moment, a similar draft directive is being debated in the Council of Ministers."
"This European Parliament resolution should encourage the Lithuanian Parliament to adopt such a law, which respects human rights and freedoms, and in which there is no place for any form of discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I, too, am shocked by the fact that there is a parliament in Europe that is capable not only of proposing regulations of this kind, but also of actually adopting them."
"This law is not only an unacceptable violation of the rights of gay men and lesbians in Lithuania, it also does serious harm to the position of homosexuals throughout Europe."
"The parliament of Lithuania is telling them that their sexual orientation is something that they should be ashamed of and from which children need to be protected."
"I expect the Commission and the Swedish Presidency to make it absolutely clear to the Lithuanian parliament that fundamental values such as equality of treatment and non-discrimination are non-negotiable in Europe - not now, not ever, not by anyone!"
"For that reason, I would like the Commissioner to pledge specifically, here and now, that the Commission will not hesitate for a moment to take Lithuania to the European Court of Justice if this law enters into force."
"(SK) Lithuania has passed a law which provides important protection for children and young people against the external effects of information which might seriously harm their further development."
"It is clear that social and family policy fall under the competence of the individual Member States of the EU and therefore no European initiatives can condemn Lithuania for this."
"The law in question does not contravene any international standards in the area of human rights."
"I have studied the issue and that is the case."
"I firmly believe that, on the contrary, the law strengthens processes for protecting children from exposure to information or images which - and I stress this - their own parents want to protect them from."
"I would like to call for a consistent application of the subsidiarity principle which Ireland has secured in the protocol to the Lisbon Treaty."
"For all that, such 'warnings to member countries and states' are setting a serious precedent in clearly sensitive areas such as the family."
"(LT) For the first time in the history of the European Parliament, in this honourable House, the actions of the Lithuanian Parliament are being debated in a negative context."
"No matter how innocent or good-willed the authors and supporters of the laws under debate are, they definitely did not lead us into the 21st century Europe."
"I think the fact that the Seimas majority's overconfidence in its sense of justice had a role to play - above us only sky, we do what we want and we do not care about international commitments."
"This debate is a very serious reaction by the Council and the Commission; it is a warning sign to Lithuania's legislators that we must not step backwards, almost to the Middle Ages, but act by looking forwards, taking advantage of the experience and traditions of the countries of the European Union."
"Therefore, these discussions are needed as is the resolution."
"(SV) Madam President, all people are born equal and have the same inviolable value."
"Consequently, Parliament must make it very clear today that we are talking about the citizens of Europe, irrespective of the Member State concerned."
"Since the EU's fundamental values are tolerance, openness and freedom, I am pleased that the newly elected President of the Commission has made it clear today that he is going to appoint a commissioner whose portfolio will encompass precisely these issues of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"It is particularly regrettable that a country such as Lithuania - which once experienced repression and dictatorship - has now, as a free and independent state, instigated a law so despicable and which represents censorship, lack of freedom and intolerance."
"All of us who support democratic principles and have any common sense must now emphatically denounce this Lithuanian law, and we must vote tomorrow."
"Let the Members of this House remind each other that the greatest of all is love."
"(SK) In 2006, Slovakia was condemned for asking for freedom of conscience."
"Today Lithuania finds itself in front of this community because it wants to protect children from the sexualisation of society."
"I consider this discussion to be a manipulation of the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights, a document which is legally binding."
"This House is ignoring the legitimacy of a national parliament which has twice voted through the law without criticism."
"This House is requesting an opinion from the Human Rights Agency."
"The Agency, however, does not have the authority to examine the effect of national laws."
"I have a question: what must the Irish be thinking ahead of the forthcoming referendum?"
"They must be thinking that the time will soon come when they will be criticised here in this House over their laws protecting the family and protecting life."
"I am sorry that here in this esteemed Parliament, we fail to respect European values, we fail to respect diversity and national culture and we fail to respect child protection and the right of parents to educate their children."
"Madam President, I think the three institutions have made their viewpoint in this debate very clear."
"Respect for human rights, tolerance, the inviolability of the individual and the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of - among other things - sexual orientation are fundamental values of the European project and must remain so."
"The Member States have a duty to respect both these values and the actual laws that apply in these areas within the EU."
"The Presidency is greatly concerned about the law in question, but we know that it is also subject to debate and criticism in Lithuania."
"As has been mentioned, President Grybauskait- who was formerly a Commissioner and is well-informed concerning the values and laws of the EU - has herself initiated a process in which this law will be reviewed and made compatible with EU legislation."
"I am extremely pleased that the Commission has been so clear about what will happen if, contrary to expectation, the law enters into force in its original form."
"Madam President, I fully agree with the Minister's conclusions."
"I would also just hope that the working group that Mrs Grybauskaithas put in place will be able to prevent the introduction of a law which, in some respects, would be at odds with European law."
"I would like to stress one point: we feared that some of the provisions of the law would go against certain directives, on audiovisual services and on electronic commerce."
"It is not actually our job to determine family law, which is one of the competences of the Member States."
"This being so, everything that has been said previously and in the course of the debate shows that matters need to be assessed better at national level, in this case in Lithuania."
"At the conclusion of this debate I have received five motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 17 September 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"My judgment on the motion for a resolution on the protection of minors in Lithuania is intended to demonstrate a very serious institutional concern."
"Often, individual MEPs or political groups claim to address issues that relate to the domestic policy of individual States: that does not seem right."
"In the case in point, the plan is seemingly to make the European Parliament express an essentially negative opinion on a Lithuanian law - the full content of which is unknown - with the laudable aim of protecting minors, while surreptitiously imposing a position that the individual Member States have been left to establish at their own discretion."
"This, I might add, is something which the European Court of Human Rights has stipulated on many occasions."
"The principle of equality is beyond doubt, and no one is trying to call into question the dignity of persons with particular sexual orientations."
"My reservation is of an institutional nature because it concerns the relations between the European Union and individual Member States."
"Discrimination is prohibited under European and international law."
"There are provisions to this effect in the treaties, the European Convention on Human Rights and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"No Member State may enact laws that contradict these documents."
"The Lithuanian law is inadmissible, as it is absurd and homophobic in nature."
"Homophobia is a disease."
"People who are afflicted by hatred for homosexuals deserve no sympathy."
"They are not so much homophobes, as sexual orientation chauvinists."
"And like all other chauvinists, they must be challenged and appropriate laws enacted against them."
"In 1990, the World Health Organisation removed homosexuality from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Problems."
"It also confirmed that no type of sexual orientation is a disorder."
"In any societies, including Lithuanian society, there are lesbians, gays and bisexual."
"They make up about 4 to 7% of the population."
"They are a minority who are entitled to full rights."
"The Equality Marches, which cause such concern to some people, are organised, amongst other reasons, to remind people of this basic, fundamental principle of equality."
"For this reason, I appeal to the Council and the Presidency to take appropriate steps to prevent Member States from enacting discriminatory legislation."
"We must show that the European Union says a firm NO to all discrimination and intolerance."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0203/2009)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: Animal welfare"
"Given that animal welfare is one of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency, and given that countries such as Ireland have already put in place successful animal welfare schemes in relation to the live transportation of animals, including the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme which helps to ensure that our weanlings for export are stronger and better prepared to cope with the journey, has the Swedish Presidency any plans to take into account schemes such as these for the live export of animals in order to ensure that a balance is reached between the sustainable export of live animals and the safeguarding of animal welfare in any new legislation?"
"Furthermore, given that Ireland is an island nation and relies heavily on the export trade of weanlings, has the Swedish Presidency any proposals that would inhibit this vital trade for Ireland?"
"Madam President, I have the honour of answering a question from Mrs Harkin."
"The Council shares the Member of Parliament's concern regarding animal welfare."
"The Commission's regular tabling of proposals has resulted in the continual establishment of a fair amount of Community legislation in this area."
"The Swedish Presidency aims to maintain the debate on animal welfare and good animal husbandry."
"These are priority issues for our Presidency in the area of agriculture and a special conference on animal welfare will be held in the Swedish city of Uppsala on 8-9 October."
"The conference will be based on the results of the EU-financed project on Welfare Quality."
"Since 2004, the project has produced a scientifically based system to assess how well livestock is cared for in farming."
"The project is also investigating the best ways to provide feedback to farmers, consumers and other stakeholders."
"More than 40 institutions and universities from the EU and Latin America took part."
"Another topic that will be discussed at the conference is how animal welfare can be improved globally."
"There will be speakers from international organisations such as the WTO and FAO, global enterprises and the international meat industry, as well as representatives from the US and Namibia."
"The results of the conference may be of relevance for the conclusions planned by the Council in response to the Commission's expected communication on animal welfare labelling."
"As regards taking the initiative for any legislation, I am sure the Member is aware that it is up to the Commission to make proposals."
"The Swedish Presidency is currently working on a proposal from the Commission for a new directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes."
"At this stage, the Commission has tabled no further proposals for legislation on animal welfare that will be dealt with during the Swedish Presidency."
"I am very pleased that you are saying that you want to keep the debate going and that you are having a conference in Uppsala on the matter."
"The truth is that the legislation that we have in place is really only in effect for about two years."
"I know that we in Ireland have certainly bought into it."
"We have ensured training for handlers."
"We have upgraded transport systems and, as a result of all of this, our trade is working very well, but, if we stop it, obviously competition will be gone in the market at home, etc. What I am asking is whether it is important to change legislation that is really only in place and only working effectively for two years."
"The other question was about what robust scientific data is in place to show the need for this."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Well, as you said, it is important to evaluate this properly and see what is being done; what the results have been."
"We are gathering scientific evidence."
"At the conference in Uppsala, we have invited both experts and scientists to be the background for the discussions at that conference."
"As I said, we hope that these can be the basis for the Council's response to the communication that will come from the Commission."
"This is what I can say at the moment."
"But we also very much welcome the opinions of the European Parliament."
"We hope that this could be a very good start for the discussions and gather as much information as possible."
"One point: I hope that science is prevailing over emotion in relation to the transportation of animals."
"I would ask you to address the issue of the transport of horses which, I think, has not been addressed sufficiently, and I think there is huge concern about that at the moment."
"I would suggest that animal welfare concerns on farms may increase because of the disastrous prices that farmers in many of our Member States are being paid for their produce."
"They are doing their very best to keep welfare standards up, against the background of very poor commodity prices and, therefore, no income on farms."
"So I think we need to be sensitive to this issue."
"This is a very controversial topic in Ireland and is grist to the mill of those advocating a 'no' vote on the Lisbon Treaty."
"In view of that and in view of the fact that Ireland is an island, and that without live exports there will be a cosy cartel operating, particularly for beef and sheep prices, can you give us any hope that this will be addressed or compromised prior to the vote on the Lisbon Treaty on 2 October?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I do understand the concerns of Members of this House and of the citizens."
"Unfortunately, I cannot promise that this will be solved before the referendum."
"We are currently awaiting the Commission proposal."
"It has been delayed for reasons I do not know."
"As soon as it comes, we will throw ourselves at it and start to discuss it."
"I cannot tell you more because we are waiting for the proposal from the Commission."
"I hope we can do this without dramatising it, but rather evaluate it and look at it from a scientific and evidential point of view."
"Subject: Child trafficking in the EU"
"A report published in July by the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) highlighted the severity of the problem of child trafficking in the EU."
"Large numbers of children are trafficked within our borders for sexual exploitation, forced labour, adoption and organ extraction."
"I welcome the inclusion of human trafficking as a priority issue in the Swedish Presidency's work programme, but would like to know if any proposals will be considered specifically in relation to the trafficking of children, as the FRA recommends?"
"Madam President, the Swedish Presidency shares the Member's concern regarding child trafficking for sexual exploitation or for other purposes."
"This kind of modern slavery is one of the most lucrative kinds of international organised crime."
"Of course, it is despicable and it is a serious problem, both within the EU and in the rest of the world."
"Human trafficking has long been an important item on the EU agenda and clearly we must continue to implement a combination of measures to combat this appalling violation of the most fundamental rights."
"Europe must redouble its efforts in respect of preventive measures and the fight against organised crime, as well as the protection of the victims of crime."
"The EU's commitment to combating human trafficking is clear from the adoption and implementation of both legislation and non-binding instruments on this issue."
"To start with, a joint action to combat trafficking in human beings was adopted in 1997."
"The most important piece of legislation is the 2002 Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings."
"In March 2009, the Commission tabled a proposal for a new Framework Decision on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims of such activities."
"It was intended that this would supersede the Framework Decision of 2002."
"One of the objectives of the proposal is to provide for the special treatment of vulnerable victims - children - in criminal investigations and proceedings, with a view to preventing what is known as secondary victimisation."
"This proposal is linked to another proposal that is oriented even more towards the specific needs of children, i.e. the proposal for a Framework Decision on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and repealing Framework Decision 2004/68, which the Commission tabled at the same time."
"The aim is to create a more consistent legal framework, make it more effective and make the penalties for perpetrators more severe."
"These two proposals are currently being discussed in the Council."
"They are based on a significant international consensus, particularly in the UN Palermo protocol and the measures to combat human trafficking contained in the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse."
"In conjunction with a ministerial conference that the Presidency is holding in Brussels on 19-20 October, which will focus on overarching EU measures against human trafficking, the report from the Agency for Fundamental Rights will be presented and discussed in detail and the conclusions will be presented to the Council."
"The Swedish Presidency also intends to bring up human trafficking and the sexual abuse of children as priority issues in the Stockholm Programme, which we intend to adopt at the summit in December."
"Thank you very much, Minister."
"I know that this issue is hugely important."
"We in Sweden have been pushing this issue in recent years, just as the EU has."
"I would simply like to point out that I think it is a great shame that Members of the European Parliament will be unable to attend the conference on 19-20 October because we will be here in Strasbourg, and we cannot be in Brussels at the same time to take part in this important conference."
"It is a shame, but that is the situation."
"I am also aware that the Swedish Presidency has said that it wants to bring up the issue of the exploitation of children in connection with travel and tourism."
"The intention was to do this at a conference on 20 November when the Permanent Intergovernmental Group L'Europe de l'Enfance is to meet, but I have now heard that the Presidency will not be raising this issue."
"Why is that?"
"Are you going to raise it on another occasion?"
"Madam President, thank you, Mrs Hedh."
"I know that Mrs Hedh is very committed to these issues."
"It is very unfortunate that the conference in Brussels clashes with the session."
"The reason that it is on these dates is to coincide with the EU Anti-Trafficking Day, which is being held at the same time."
"That is why they coincide."
"It is indeed unfortunate."
"As regards the Member's second question, concerning why this has been dropped: I was not aware of this."
"I will have to check and get back to you on that and perhaps communicate an answer to Mrs Hedh."
"Thank you very much for that reply."
"I am sad as well that the conference is being held when we are in Strasbourg."
"But can you make sure that on the agenda of that conference we do have the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking highlighted?"
"Because there are a number of Member States who still have not signed it, and there are some Member States - including Sweden, of course - that have not ratified it."
"So I think it is very important to make sure that it is high on the agenda at that conference, so we can make anti-trafficking a reality."
"We have the wherewithal there."
"We really must act on it."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Yes, Ms Lynne, I will bring this to the attention of the organisers."
"Subject: Message for FAO high-level meeting"
"What message will the Council be delivering on behalf of the EU at the forthcoming session of the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)?"
"Madam President, we are covering many different issues."
"The UN FAO conference will start on 18 November."
"One of the most important items on its agenda is reform of the FAO."
"The reform process is based on the action plan approved by all the members of the FAO in 2008."
"This action plan involves many different types of reforms."
"Among other things, the future activities of the FAO will be determined by a results-based management system that will promote greater efficiency as regards the allocation and utilisation of scarce resources."
"We also expect the reform process to have long-term effects on the FAO's work on matters concerning its staffing and local offices."
"The conference will also deal with matters relating to changes in the FAO's charter and the reforms to the Committee on World Food Security."
"This reform is important because it is linked to the establishment of a global partnership on agriculture, food security and supply."
"In order to discuss these matters at a political level, the FAO is holding a World Summit on Food Security in Rome on 16-18 November."
"The Presidency will be represented there and we will present a declaration that is partly based on the Council's conclusions on food security that will be adopted at the FAO conference."
"In its conclusions concerning the FAO on 11 November 2008, the Council acknowledged that the current food crisis demands a common united and coordinated response from the global community, supported by civil society and the private sector."
"To this end the EU should support a global partnership for agriculture and food in accordance with the EU's action plan for the Millennium Goals."
"This was welcomed by the European Council in June 2008."
"Furthermore, in its conclusions, the Council welcomed the ongoing reform of the FAO that is being implemented in a constructive manner by all the member states of the organisation within the framework of the conference's committee."
"In the light of this, the Presidency feels that the summit should have a clear political aim and launch a new management system for world food security, with a rejuvenated and stronger CFS taking a leading role."
"The Presidency feels that it is essential that this summit establishes a forward-looking, action-based system capable of getting to grips with the current food crisis and increasing efforts to achieve the first Millennium Development Goal - to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger."
"Reform of the CFS and broad commitment to the global partnership will be of the utmost importance in bringing this about."
"The Presidency feels that the summit should have this clear political aim, to launch a new system for managing the world's food supply in which a rejuvenated and stronger CFS plays a leading part."
"At an operational level, the Presidency feels that this summit needs to establish a forward-looking, powerful system capable of taking on the challenge of the current food crisis and increasing efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"I do appreciate the detailed response."
"Can I just hone in on what the attitude of the Swedish Presidency is in relation to the role of the common agricultural policy in assisting the concept and the desire for global food security."
"What role do you think our policy can play in that?"
"Do you think it is important that we have a common policy in Europe, given our concerns about global food security?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - We have not discussed that in the Council in the light of this particular conference, but it is clear that the common agricultural policy can play a role and can also, when we discuss it in the future, play an increasing role in facilitating the poorer countries to be part of the common market, as well as in where we can help to mitigate and to eliminate the current acute crisis."
"We have done that."
"Now the world situation looks a little bit better."
"There are positive reports coming from almost all the different markets."
"That is excellent, and I would give it a little bit of time to reflect on how we can address those conflicts in the future and how we can use a slightly reformed common agricultural policy to help those poor countries and to avoid a similar situation."
"We are talking here about global food security, but I would like to just briefly mention food security in the EU."
"In my opinion, food security in the EU depends on food production in the EU."
"Just today, the ALDE AGRI group had a meeting with Commissioner Fischer Boel and we were discussing that very issue and the future, as has already been alluded to, of the CAP, particularly post 2013, and the fact that the budget may be cut, etc. There are really serious implications for food production in the EU."
"I know that is only part of the wider discussion we are having here this evening but, nonetheless, it is hugely important for those who are involved in agriculture."
"You have already given an answer but, if you have any further thoughts on that as far as the Swedish Presidency is concerned, I would appreciate them."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - This is a complicated and very big discussion."
"It touches upon the conference itself but it is, of course, something that goes much further."
"We do not have the intention of really starting those discussions; we have been waiting to receive from the Commission an element, a communication regarding the future budget; it was promised - as was agreed by the Council in 2004 already - that we would have a thorough revision of the income and the outcome of the expenditure of the budget including, of course, the CAP, which is such a big part of the budget."
"This communication has been delayed - there are now rumours that it will come by the end of the year."
"If it does, we, the Swedish Presidency, intend to have a first discussion among the Member States on it, but it will be up to the Spanish Presidency to really start working on these issues."
"So for the moment, I cannot give you any more details."
"Subject: Stability and Development Pact"
"In June, the European Council affirmed its commitment to healthy public finances and to the Stability and Development Pact."
"Nevertheless, as many as 20 Member States are expected to be subject to the excessive deficit procedure by the end of the year. What initiatives will the Presidency take to achieve its objective of correct and responsible implementation of the Stability Pact and where has it identified the difficulties so far in correctly implementing it?"
"Does it consider that the crisis necessitates a fresh revision of the Pact or is the reform adopted in 2005 sufficient for the Pact to be respected and effective under present conditions?"
"Which exit strategy and strategy for reducing public deficits does it prefer and what is the timetable for implementing such a strategy?"
"Does it consider that 2010 should be a year of fiscal consolidation and discipline or that a degree of flexibility should be retained in public finances, particularly in view of the forecasts of dwindling employment?"
"This issue was also discussed earlier today."
"During the current crisis, public authorities have taken extraordinary measures in terms of both monetary policy and budgetary support."
"These efforts were necessary and appropriate, and played an important part in averting an even more serious crisis, in stabilising the economy and in preventing a drastic economic recession."
"The stabilisation of the economic and financial situation does not mean that the recession is over, however."
"We need to be extremely cautious and ensure that our policy for the future combines the necessary support for the recovery - which we hope will come - with a responsible attitude to sustainable public financing in the medium and long term."
"It is precisely the need to balance these two objectives that makes the flexibility adopted in the 2005 review of the pact so sensible."
"In difficult economic times, the authorities must take the action required to promote economic activity."
"Once the recovery has picked up speed and is driven by its own momentum, however, we must ensure that our public finances are sustainable and we must establish credible plans for budget consolidation."
"Since circumstances differ significantly in the various Member States, the schedules - the timetables - for ending financial policy incentives and monetary policy measures will also vary."
"This will be reflected in many of the deficit procedures that will be aimed at individual Member States, but it needs to be coordinated, and it must remain in line with the overall framework of the Stability and Development Pact."
"Consequently, the Presidency is planning discussions within Ecofin in the autumn concerning appropriate exit strategies and their coordination."
"I expect these discussions to result in a clear accord on ambitious consolidation at the right time in each Member State in order to guarantee long-term sustainability."
"Thank you Minister for your very clear reply."
"I trust that you will focus in particular on whether we should insist on 2010 being a year for improving public finances or whether there should be some way of providing extensions or delays, as this is something from which the Union has not benefited to date in its policies."
"That is a very difficult question to answer."
"At the G20 Summit next week, we will be starting an initial discussion of exit strategies."
"However, it is clear that circumstances vary widely in the different Member States, and therefore the timetables will vary slightly."
"I hope we can start this process quite soon, but it also depends on how the economic situation develops."
"There is light at the end of the tunnel, we think the worst is over and thus we need to look more into this idea of an exit strategy."
"If we do not do it gradually, it is the most vulnerable members of our societies who will be hit by rising unemployment, severe public cuts and the risk of inflation."
"However, at present, it is a little early to say exactly when that time will come in the various Member States."
"Subject: EU measures to combat unemployment"
"A recent Eurobarometer poll indicated that whilst 72% of EU citizens say the European Union is 'playing a positive role in creating new job opportunities and fighting unemployment,' only a little over a third of respondents had heard of the EU's tools to combat unemployment, such as the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"Is enough being done to promote awareness of these key instruments?"
"Madam President, the Council shares the Member's concern regarding the results of the latest Eurobarometer as regards awareness of important EU instruments to combat unemployment such as the European Social Fund and the EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"From the aspects of both democracy and legitimacy, it is important to communicate to our citizens what the EU does."
"The Council places great importance on the European Social Fund and the EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund and we want these to be used effectively to combat unemployment."
"These two instruments are important financial tools for combating the current recession and increasing employment in that they introduce integrated flexicurity strategies and ensure that skills are improved and better matched to the needs that exist."
"The Council expressed this in December 2008 when it backed the rapid introduction by the European Social Fund of supplementary measures to support employment."
"The Council also announced improvements to the procedures of the EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"The original regulation was therefore reviewed to allow the Fund to react more effectively to support workers who had lost their jobs not just as a result of globalisation but also temporarily because of the financial and economic slowdown."
"However, it should be pointed out that the implementation of these funds, including appropriate information and publicity, is a matter for the Member States and the Commission."
"As regards the European Social Fund, the Member States must provide information on initiatives and cofinanced programmes with a view to highlighting the role of the Community and the aid provided by the funds."
"In this context, I would mention the European transparency initiative launched by the Commission in 2005."
"One of the foremost aims of this initiative is to improve information to the general public concerning the EU funds available by publishing the names of recipients of direct subsidies within the framework of the EU's cohesion policy."
"Where the EU Globalisation Fund is concerned, information on the measures financed should be provided by the Member States."
"At the same time, I would remind you that the Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established relatively recently."
"Lack of knowledge may be due to the fact that this fund has provided assistance in relatively few cases as yet."
"Thank you very much for your very concise response."
"I have just one other query."
"I understand that there is strong opposition within the Council to the proposal to frontload the European Social Fund to 100% for the upcoming two years."
"If that opposition is maintained, can the Council suggest any alternatives that have been put forward to maintain the momentum of the European economic recovery plan?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Yes, we have indeed discussed this in the Council several times."
"There is a quite unanimous view that, for the sake of the quality of the project, there should be an element of national financing as well."
"Therefore, the proposal to eliminate that has no support from the Council."
"However, we are aware of the situation and of the problems."
"We have asked the Commission to present an alternative proposal."
"I brought that up with Commissioner Samecki, who is responsible for it, just two days ago."
"They are working on such a proposal and will present it as soon as possible."
"(RO) I am sorry that the necessary support in the form of 100% financing is not being provided through the Council at a time when we are talking about the European Social Fund's role in reducing unemployment, especially during the current crisis."
"I would also like to mention that during the current economic crisis, we are seeing increases in unemployment, particularly affecting steelworks and shipyards, or even technical unemployment, in addition to workers actually being made redundant."
"I would like to ask you the following question, bearing in mind the need to invest and safeguard the European Union's economic competitiveness in the future as well: what measures do you envisage taking to facilitate the use of European Social Fund and European Globalisation Adjustment Fund resources to support the industrial sectors experiencing economic hardship?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - As I said, we have asked the Commission to come up with alternative proposals on how this particular Social Fund can be used in this situation where, as you say, lots of people all around Europe are without work, and we hope that the Commission will present such a proposal without undue delay."
"However, we do a lot of other things as well to combat unemployment; this is the responsibility, of course, of the Member States, but there is also a collective responsibility for us to try to coordinate, to facilitate the completion of the internal market, to eliminate obstacles, to get the Services Directive working from 1 January, to get rid of red tape and to stimulate people to be employable, while giving them resources to complete their education or to restart in another direction."
"Unemployment will also be discussed at a particular informal Ecofin meeting in October, where unemployment is one of the main issues on the agenda; and in the light of the discussion that I know is taking place within the European Parliament, but also in almost all Council formations concerning the future of the Lisbon Strategy, there are lots of issues being discussed."
"So the Social Fund is only one instrument to combat unemployment."
"It can be improved, and it can be more widely used to show the public how it is used in a better way, probably."
"But it is just but one element in the whole range of instruments that we have and that we must use in order to combat unemployment."
"Subject: Information about Chechnya"
"What steps is the Council going to take, following the murder of the human-rights and peace activist Natalia Estemirova and the subsequent closure of the Memorial human rights group's office in Chechnya, to enable the monitoring of human rights observance there to continue?"
"What does the Council think of the idea of opening an EU office for that purpose, in Grozny or in close proximity to Chechnya, or at least of sending a temporary mission to Chechnya?"
"Madam President, as soon as the Presidency heard of the murder of Natalia Estemirova, we immediately issued a statement condemning the murder and expressed our deepest condolences to her family and colleagues within the Memorial human rights organisation."
"We also urged the Russian authorities to investigate the murder quickly and thoroughly and to bring the perpetrators to trial."
"I can assure Mr Posselt that the Council will continue to follow developments in Chechnya very closely and we will give particular attention and respect to human rights and to the situation of the defenders of human rights."
"The Council has urged the Russian authorities on several occasions to do everything in their power to protect these people in Russia in accordance with the universally acknowledged UN Declaration on human rights defenders."
"I would stress that the EU already has a presence in Chechnya as a result of the Commission's aid project, diplomats from Moscow's embassies in the EU Member States and in the form of regular visits to Chechnya."
"The Council would like to emphasise the importance that it attaches to Mr Posselt's questions and it is concerned about the human rights situation in Chechnya, but we do not consider there currently to be any particular need for the office or mission that he has proposed."
"The European Union is present in the region and we will continue to monitor the issues of respect for human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles in Chechnya and will address these whenever the need arises."
"(DE) Thank you, Mrs Malmström."
"That is the first good answer I have received from the Council on this subject."
"Thank you."
"Nonetheless, I have a brief supplementary question: does the Council intend to address the question of Chechnya again under the Swedish Presidency, because the Russian leadership has issued a series of announcements about changes."
"However, action needs to follow and we see none, which is why I would ask that you brief us properly once again on this issue in the run-up to negotiations on the agreement."
"We intend to have an urgency debate on this matter tomorrow."
"Madam President, yes, we continually raise issues of human rights in our dialogue with Russia and human rights will be on the agenda at the summit that we hope will take place between the EU and Russia during the autumn."
"Subject: Authorisation from the Turkish Government for hydrocarbon prospecting within the exclusive economic zones of EU Member States"
"The Turkish Government has decided to give the go-ahead to the state-owned Turkish petroleum cooperation (TPAO) to explore for hydrocarbon deposits within the exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of Greece and Cyprus."
"This follows on from the threatening stance adopted by Turkey in a bid to deter Cyprus from proceeding with the exploitation of its EEZ, thereby forcing it to veto the unblocking of the energy chapter."
"Given the potentially explosive impact of the above decision by the Turkish on its relations with EU Member States, can the Council provide the following information:"
"What immediate measures will it take to ensure that the Turkish Government reverses its decision to authorise prospecting for hydrocarbon deposits in the EEZ of the EU Member States?"
"What measures will it take to ensure that, with respect to Cyprus, also Turkey complies with the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement and recognises its right to an EEZ?"
"When is it expected that Turkey will adopt the Convention on the Law of the Sea, which has been incorporated into Community law?"
"Madam President, the Council is aware of the events brought up by the Member of Parliament."
"As regards Turkey's relations with the countries in the region concerned, Turkey - just like every other country - has a duty to act to encourage good neighbourly relations and peaceful dispute resolution."
"That is the essence of the UN's Charter."
"It is also an important requirement for accession to the EU."
"Within the context of Turkey's negotiations with the EU and the related conclusions drawn by the Council, the EU has called on Turkey to avoid any threat, source of conflict or action that could have a negative effect on good neighbourly relations and the process of peaceful dispute resolution."
"Moreover, on a number of occasions, the EU has emphasised the importance of progress in the normalisation of bilateral relations between Turkey and all the EU Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus, and stressed the sovereign rights of all Member States of the EU."
"As regards the matter of the Additional Protocol, the Union's position is extremely clear."
"Turkey has a duty to apply it in full and in a non-discriminatory way."
"All these matters are systematically raised by the EU, most recently at the meeting between ministers from the EU troika and Turkey that took place in Stockholm in July and in the Association Council in May."
"I can assure the Member that the Council attaches great importance to these matters and that we will continue to monitor developments extremely closely."
"(EL) Madam Minister, I appreciate your willingness and determination to give clear replies to our questions."
"May I say that we shall be debating the question of the Nabucco pipeline in Parliament tomorrow and remind you that, in January 2009, the Turkish Prime Minister threatened Brussels that his country would re-examine its support for the construction of the natural gas pipeline if negotiations on the opening of the energy chapter do not continue."
"This chapter, as you know, has been blocked by the veto exercised by Cyprus, because it has been threatened by Turkey about the exploitation of its exclusive economic zone."
"As, therefore, the question of exclusive economic zones is of crucial importance and may cause a major problem for numerous EU policies, I ask you again what measures the Council will take to ensure that Turkey recognises Cyprus's right to an exclusive economic zone?"
"Madam President, both the Council and the Commission have noted this and we will monitor the matter closely."
"In all our dealings with Turkey, we will continue to raise the matter and the importance of good neighbourly relations."
"The next opportunity will be at the foreign ministers' troika in November."
"I hope that incidents of the kind mentioned by the Member can be avoided."
"Where the energy chapter is concerned, this is currently being screened in the various Council formations and discussions are ongoing."
"It is a little too early to announce the results of this analysis and, as the Member will be aware, each step in this process requires unanimity in the Council."
"Subject: EU policy in Burma"
"Can the European Council make a statement concerning the policy of the European Union towards Burma and outline what measures the European Union is pursuing so as to help release Aung San Sui Kyi, who has been imprisoned there since 1990?"
"Madam President, the EU has followed the situation of Aung San Suu Kyi closely ever since she was imprisoned twenty years ago."
"The Council has worked continually and very actively on her behalf."
"On many occasions, we have called on the authorities in Burma to release her."
"Furthermore, during this time, the Council has taken specific action a number of times."
"To mention some of these actions:"
"In August, the EU immediately condemned the judgment against Aung San Suu Kyi and the proceedings against her, which had no legal basis."
"We called on the authorities in Burma to release her immediately and unconditionally."
"The Council stated that the legal proceedings against Aung San Suu Kyi represented a crime against national and international law."
"Moreover, the EU's high representative, Javier Solana, spoke out on behalf of Aung San Suu Kyi at the ASEAN ministerial meeting and the subsequent ASEAN-EU ministerial conference in July, at which a representative of Burma was also present."
"Strong demands were also made by many others present at this meeting, including representatives of the USA, China, Russia and others, for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners."
"Through its Special Envoy for Burma, Piero Fassino, the EU has also been very active in supporting the measures taken by the UN and the UN's Special Adviser Ibrahim Gambari, and has also consulted important EU partners in Asia."
"The authorities in Burma have chosen to ignore the protests against the imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi and the calls to release her that have been made by a large number of countries and organisations, including the Secretary-General of the UN, the Secretary-General of ASEAN and a number of ASEAN Member States, of which Burma is, after all, one."
"As there has been no response from Burma, the EU has taken further action directed against those responsible for the judgment."
"We have placed members of the judiciary and others involved in the action against Aung San Suu Kyi on the list of persons who are to be denied visas and whose assets are to be frozen."
"We have expanded the list of persons and units that are to be covered by restrictive measures so as to also include the freezing of assets held by companies owned and controlled by members of the regime in Burma or by persons associated with them."
"The response agreed on by the Council on 13 August is entirely in line with the resolution passed by the European Parliament in October 2008."
"I can assure the Member that in addition to these specific measures, the EU will intensify its work within the international community and, in particular, with like-minded partners in Asia in order to bring about the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners."
"This is a fundamental first step in the process of national reconciliation that is required if the 2010 elections are to be able to be regarded as free, fair and credible."
"I would like to thank you, Madam President-in-Office, for your comprehensive reply."
"Can I ask you what action the European Union has taken, or is in the process of taking, to assist the thousands of refugees that have fled Burma's northern Shan State into China as a result of August's violent clashes between the junta and ethnic minorities?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I am very sorry."
"I do not think I can answer that question."
"I will have to come back to you on that."
"I am sorry."
"Subject: Closer EU-US relations"
"Can the European Council outline the initiatives that it is pursuing so that closer political and economic relations can be built up between the European Union and the United States of America?"
"Madam President, the Council attaches the greatest importance to relations between the EU and the US."
"Transatlantic relations represent a cornerstone of the EU's foreign policy and are based on our shared values of democracy, human rights and our commitment to open, integrated economies."
"The new administration in the US has given a new stimulus to these relations."
"We are firmly resolved to continue this cooperation."
"This is a time when definite results are expected in our transatlantic relations, on both sides of the Atlantic."
"I am pleased to be able to state that there are many areas in which the EU cooperates closely with the United States in order to expand our strategic partnership and achieve results."
"Naturally we will continue to cooperate very closely on a number of regional issues such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, the peace process in the Middle East, Russia and the Western Balkans."
"We cooperate regularly on crisis management and I am delighted that the United States is now taking part in a civil ESDP mission, namely EULEX in Kosovo."
"We will be cooperating closely on climate issues ahead of the Copenhagen Summit at the end of the year."
"The new administration has raised the ambitions of the United States substantially in this area."
"We welcome this and hope that they will be able to present comparable objectives as regards reducing emissions in the medium term as part of the agreement."
"We have also long cooperated on energy matters."
"We feel that this must now be taken to a higher level and we hope to establish a special energy council for the EU and the United States."
"This could become a good forum for increased cooperation between us in the areas of energy security, markets, sustainability policy and research into new energy technologies."
"Another issue of high priority is, of course, the financial and economic crisis."
"Very close cooperation is needed here if we are to restore confidence in the financial markets and get them to work properly."
"In the area of trade, the Doha Round must be concluded ambitiously in 2010."
"This is essential if we are to foster economic recovery and fight protectionism."
"The US has a key role to play here."
"Naturally, we will be discussing these issues at the G20 Summit next week."
"Both sides have shown interest in deepening our cooperation on justice and home affairs and in increasing understanding of each other's regulatory and political frameworks."
"The statement on the closure of Guantánamo Bay, which mentioned deepening transatlantic cooperation on justice and home affairs, is an important step in this direction."
"As regards non-proliferation and disarmament, the cooperation between the EU and the United States has been reenergised and the Obama administration has been very keen on this."
"Washington and Brussels are working together to ensure that significant progress is made on issues such as the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty of Non-Proliferation, the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and implementation of a solution to the deadlock at the Conference on Disarmament so that we can achieve a treaty banning the production of weapons-grade fissile material."
"There is strong interest on both sides in strengthening transatlantic political dialogue and cooperation on development work."
"The EU and the US are the world's largest donors and we therefore have a common interest in improving efforts in the area of development."
"We are conducting discussions concerning how this can be done."
"The forthcoming summit between the EU and the United States is an excellent opportunity to discuss these and other relevant issues at the highest level."
"I am extremely proud that the Swedish Presidency has been given the opportunity to lead the EU at the summit."
"We are firmly convinced that the summit will promote transatlantic relations in a positive and constructive manner."
"Thank you very much Minister."
"It is great to have you back here, albeit in a different guise."
"Specifically on the two issues where I think we can most cooperate: on proliferation, number one; and secondly with regard to the financial crisis."
"Does the Swedish Presidency - representing the Council, of course - have specific ideas that they want to bring to the US-EU Summit that will take place very shortly, in particular, about the differences there appear to be between France and Britain on one side and the rest of the European Union with regard to the financial regulations that would apply?"
"The US appears to be closer to the others within the EU, maybe, than they are to the French and British ideas that were announced yesterday by Gordon Brown."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - This morning we had a debate on the preparations for G20."
"I know that there are different proposals discussed in the media but I must say that the EU is extremely well coordinated."
"We have had discussions with the finance ministers and tomorrow night there will be a dinner with Heads of State and Prime Ministers to finalise the coordination in the light of the Pittsburgh meeting."
"The EU stands united."
"We know what we want."
"We have a concrete proposal, and the fine tuning will be done tomorrow."
"So I am not really worried about that, and I am also very happy that, with the help of the Commission and Commissioner Almunia, we have reached this very rare stage of strong unity within the European Union."
"These are our priorities and our solutions that are being discussed and we will, of course, try to find cohesion on as many points as possible with the American Administration and the other partners at the G20 meeting."
"On non-proliferation, we are very happy that this is again on the agenda."
"It has been difficult for some time to raise it and we are very happy with President Obama's commitment to that."
"But it will take time."
"There are complicated technical issues and it will take time to pursue them."
"We are very process-oriented."
"We will try to move them forward but I cannot tell you how long this will take and what deadlines we have."
"But it is on the agenda."
"We are very committed to moving forward and I think this is also a wish that our American counterparts share."
"Madam President-in-Office, I would like to ask you about the EU-USA-Russia triangle."
"As we know, on the initiative of President Obama, the USA and Russia started very important negotiations on nuclear disarmament."
"How, in your opinion, can the Council and the European Union facilitate, and have its input in, these negotiations which are so important for the future of mankind?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I am very happy at this news."
"I think it is an important step that those two countries sit down and discuss, as you say, important issues for mankind, and we can but hope that they move forward in a concrete way."
"There is a global nuclear summit in March 2010 where the EU will be present, of course, as well."
"This is also a good opportunity, in the light of that, to coordinate our views and to see how we can contribute to make these discussions as successful and fruitful as possible."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"Composition of committees and delegations: see Minutes"
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 09.00)"
"Crisis in the dairy farming sector (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission (B7-0208/2009) by Mr De Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the crisis in the dairy farming sector."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the dairy farming sector is going through one of the deepest and most serious crises of the last few decades: the fall in the price of milk and the more general crisis in the dairy farming market have now become a source of concern throughout Europe."
"This is a cyclical crisis, caused by the difficult economic situation, which has led to a decline in milk consumption and created stagnant markets, with the prices paid to producers in free fall."
"The prices paid to milk producers have plummeted everywhere, averaging 24 cents per litre within the European Union."
"Many economic operators are in an even more serious situation, as they get prices of less than 20-21 cents, when their production costs come to at least 40 cents per litre."
"Other markets, such as the cereal, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets, are showing some alarming signs too."
"On this front, first of all, we should continue to make use of all the measures at our disposal so as to stabilise the market and to stimulate an upturn in consumption, but at the same time we need to be able to look to the future with medium- and long-term policies and to do everything possible to identify acceptable and lasting solutions aimed at minimising the risk of price fluctuations."
"In this context the Commission proposals extending the intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder have been welcomed and accepted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the unanimous vote of 2 September demonstrates."
"We believe, however, that these proposals are not enough to mitigate the serious consequences of the crisis in the sector."
"That is why, still in relation to the adoption of the European Commission's proposal, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted an amendment to my proposal that also reintroduces aid for private storage of cheese, which was abolished under the health check on the common agricultural policy in November 2008."
"This was a unanimous decision, Madam President, Commissioner, representing what are, in essence, identical views shared by the members of the Committee on Agriculture, which I have the honour of chairing, and expressing our desire to send out a strong signal to the Council and the Commission at a sensitive time for an extremely important sector for European agriculture."
"As well as being a first important demonstration of the positive leadership that we as the European Parliament want to provide when looking ahead to codecision in agricultural matters too, this is a measure that can also offer immediate help to dairy farmers, who are grappling with an increasingly difficult market and with an obvious and dramatic fall in sales."
"However, these initial measures, on which we will vote today, are not enough to support the producers in crisis, and that is why the Committee on Agriculture, through an oral question and a resolution on which we are preparing to vote, is calling on the European Commission to introduce new and effective measures to combat the crisis and to support the sector."
"We want to encourage and at the same time support the European Commission in the process of deciding what must be done to end the crisis in the European dairy farming sector once and for all."
"In this sense we hope that the Commission will provide an exhaustive answer to our questions and will take our proposals seriously, so that interinstitutional cooperation produces the results that European agriculture deserves and shows its solidarity by offering practical support to European farmers in crisis, who need our help today."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, would you allow me to use a bit more than the three minutes' speaking time allocated to me, because on this important and serious issue I think three minutes would not actually be sufficient."
"First of all, I would like to say that I am very happy with the questions put by the Committee on Agriculture, because this gives me an excellent opportunity to clarify the actions that have already been taken."
"Let me also thank Parliament for its ongoing work in this area."
"We are all committed to finding solutions."
"You are, and so am I."
"Not everyone agrees with my preferred solutions, but I strongly believe that these solutions are working, that they will work, and they are also solutions that we can defend politically."
"Mr Paolo De Castro asked on behalf of the Committee that we say what we are actually doing."
"The top line is good news: prices are improving."
"For example, in the course of one month butter prices went up by 4% in France, 8% in Germany and even more in the UK."
"Skimmed milk powder also went up by 4% in France and Germany, and 2-3% if we look at the average all over Europe."
"Average milk prices have been going up, and Albert Deß just told me this morning that the spot market prices are now at 30 cents in certain areas."
"We can see that intervention buying on cheese has almost stopped because the market price is higher than the intervention price, which is another positive signal."
"We are not yet where we want to be, but we are heading in the right direction."
"This makes me more confident than ever before that the policy approach that we have been taking from the very beginning is the right one."
"You know the key elements of what we have been doing."
"We have been using all the market measures available and here we expect to spend approximately EUR 600 million over a 12-month period."
"We have indicated the possibility for Member States to start the direct payment of the single farm payment to farmers from 16 October instead of 1 December, and we decided under the 2003 reform to decouple the dairy premium - EUR 5 billion every year - and transport it directly into the single payment scheme."
"We have the recovery package and the decisions taken in the health check that provide another EUR 4.2 billion to face the new challenges, including restructuring in the dairy sector."
"All this of course is on top of what we can do under the rural development policy."
"Just for clarification to Paolo De Castro, intervention for cheese was actually abolished in 1994."
"I think there must be some confusion between intervention and private storage because private storage was abolished by the decisions in the health check."
"As I said, our current approach seems to be working."
"I am therefore more determined than ever before not to go back to the future in ways which would hurt our dairy sector in the long term and leave our farmers without any kind of predictability."
"In other words, making a U-turn on the health check decision is not an option and something that the European Council, the heads of state, explicitly asked me not to do."
"So, the idea of keeping the quota system after 2013 is not on the table."
"Freezing quotas is not on the table, and neither is any return to the use of certain expensive but inefficient market instruments of the past."
"They are not on the table."
"This certainly does not mean that we have now done the job in terms of policy."
"I think it is time for further action."
"We need to follow up on the dairy report from this July, use the measures in there and then decide on other actions for the longer term."
"If I could start with the report, I will look first at state aid."
"The report floated the idea that Member States could temporarily offer aid of up to EUR 15 000 for farmers under this temporary crisis framework."
"The Commission has actually already launched the boat and expects to change the rules in the coming weeks."
"The second point is streamlining the procedures for responding to prices in the dairy sector."
"At this moment, milk is not actually included in Article 186 of the single Common Market Organisation which allows the Commission to take temporary actions quickly under its own power during times of market disturbances."
"I am therefore proposing that we include the dairy sector in Article 186, and this will enable us to spring into action in the future if we hit serious problems in the dairy sector."
"For example, our recent extension of intervention had to be approved by the Council, and Parliament voted on this as well, but, if the dairy sector had been included in this Article 186, we could have acted immediately."
"More generally speaking, we could with almost immediate effect mobilise measures stimulating demand and/or we could limit the marketing of milk, and all this would only be put in place on a temporary basis and under the condition that we had the necessary financing available."
"The third follow-up point from the report concerns the buying-up schemes by Member States."
"One way to restructure is that Member States can actually buy quotas from farmers and put these quotas into the national reserve."
"As you know, the national reserve counts in a sense as part of the Member States' total quota, so if individual producers go over their quota, but Member States as a whole do not exceed their quota, with the national reserve included, then no super levy is actually paid."
"What I intend to propose is that bought-up quota kept within the national reserve will not count as part of the national quota when it comes to deciding whether we have to add or to ask the farmers to pay the super levy or not."
"If the super levy should then be collected anyway, then the part corresponding to the bought-up quota could then be used for restructuring."
"It might sound a bit complicated, but it is actually a very efficient tool."
"All of these steps are actions that we are taking now with an almost immediate impact on the markets, but we also need to do something about steps for the medium and longer term."
"I would like to thank France and Germany here for their ideas and their input on these different possibilities."
"The first longer-term issue is about using contractual relations between milk farmers and the dairy industry to better balance supply and demand in the dairy market."
"I believe that this is a much, much better approach than the quota system, and it already works in parts of the European Union."
"Milk producers and dairies have clear agreements which remove a lot of the uncertainty."
"On the other hand, some Member States simply do not use this possibility, but this can be changed by looking for a legal framework for these contractual relations, whilst clearly safeguarding fair competition."
"The second long-term issue is about the balance of power, and you know that we have had this discussion a lot of times."
"We need to be able to see within the whole chain from primary producer to supermarket chains where the added value is disappearing."
"We will look into future markets as well and, finally, I think a lot can be done on production costs and innovation."
"In order to deal properly with all these ideas for the medium and long term, I want to establish a working group with experts from the Member States and the Commission so they can go to the heart of these issues."
"For me, the problem in the dairy market is not only an issue between the Commission and Member States."
"Parliament actually plays an important role as well, and I am looking forward to the discussion here today on this important issue."
"Thank you for being so patient."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, extremely difficult to summarise this problem in two minutes, but I will try to do it in the style of bullet points."
"The dairy sector is in trouble."
"Many dairy farmers are seeing their very existence under threat."
"The main reason for this is a huge drop in milk product sales."
"The Commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard."
"I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry."
"Last year, when the price of butter reached more than EUR 4 for a short time, a large proportion of the ice cream industry stopped processing butter fat."
"I know the figures for Germany, which show that around 100 000 tonnes is no longer being processed by the food industry, which corresponds to a million tonnes of milk."
"We must try to stimulate sales once again, in order to clear these quantities from the market."
"I would like to thank the groups that have helped in drawing up our joint motion for a resolution."
"Unfortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in this discussion."
"Commissioner, as a short-term measure we are calling for an increase in the de minimis subsidies in an additional motion which is being tabled with 40 signatures, because this would be an opportunity to help the smaller dairy farmers in particular."
"It would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation."
"I know a lot of farmers who are 58 years old and who would like to stop working soon."
"An appropriate regulation would be needed for this."
"Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for your work."
"I would ask you to put in place appropriate regulations to improve the situation of our dairy farmers."
"Perhaps you will still have the chance to remedy this situation in the near future."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Commissioner, the Commission and the Council have taken a long time to react to the serious crisis affecting the sector."
"We are all agreed on that."
"The terrible situation the sector is facing requires swift, decisive action, or we risk seeing the ruin of many thousands of farmers throughout Europe."
"My political group has made a great effort to enable us to reach the compromise contained in the resolution we are discussing here today."
"I hope the proposals merit your attention, Commissioner, because only by acting to reduce supply and simultaneously stimulate demand will it be possible to restore market equilibrium and bring prices up to profitable levels for producers."
"I regret that the compromise did not include the temporary suspension of increased quotas or the introduction of a likewise temporary premium to reduce production."
"The measures we propose are, however, a useful contribution for overcoming the crisis more quickly."
"It remains for you, Commissioner, to duly follow them up."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, as we have heard from other speakers, there is a crisis in the milk sector."
"There is no doubt that we must take action to alleviate their pain, but let me make it very clear that this is a short-term crisis which requires short-term market measures by the Commission, as outlined in the resolution."
"Let us also be clear that, for too long, European consumers have paid for a dysfunctional agricultural policy which has failed both farmers and consumers."
"This crisis should not therefore be used as an excuse to turn our backs on the road to further reform and liberalisation of the CAP."
"That is why we have tabled amendments to this effect and why I welcome your reassurance on this matter."
"We also want to see the Commission focused on sorting out the market, which is clearly failing."
"Consumers are losing out as they fail to get the benefits from the fall in milk prices."
"Farmers are losing out because they do not receive a fair share of the retail milk price."
"We welcome the Commission's investigations into the food chain but, Commissioner, we want you to go further."
"Will you commit to action that will root out supermarket abuse of their monopoly positions?"
"Will you commit to a competitive market that allows producers a fair share of the cake, and will you commit to a functional milk market that gives a fair deal to farmers and a fair price to consumers?"
"I look forward to your response, Commissioner."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for months now livestock farmers have been warning the Commission and the Council of the gravity of the crisis."
"Tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed in rural areas."
"The European Union had counted on growth in world demand."
"Its experts got it very wrong."
"The financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption."
"The decision by Mrs Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture, to maintain the increase in quotas and the Council's wish to dismantle them by 2015 are a provocation to milk producers."
"Times have changed."
"European policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment."
"The milk prices imposed on producers do not cover production costs."
"On each litre of milk, some small farmers are losing up to 30 cents."
"At the end of the year, many of them will not have made a single euro, or will even have lost money."
"Some of them, too, as we are told by regional officials, are today going so far as to take their own lives."
"In the face of this unprecedented crisis, the European Union must take significant steps, quickly."
"We call upon the Heads of State or Government who are meeting this evening to prepare for the G20 to place the issue of the dairy crisis on the agenda for their meeting, so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to livestock farmers."
"The European Union must boost the negotiation capacities of dairy farms, so that they are no longer subject to the dictates of the agri-food industry."
"It should also put in place a safety net to guarantee a remunerative price so that the price never falls below the production costs."
"The European Union must put a stop to its export refunds programme."
"It has just committed the enormous sum of EUR 480 million, adopted with the backing of various parliamentary groups from both the right and the left, in order to sell its surpluses cheaply on the world markets."
"It is destroying hundreds of thousands of farming jobs in the south and is cynically pushing farmers to move off the land or to immigrate."
"Above all, the European Union must immediately make drastic reductions, of 5%, in European milk quotas, in a way that is inversely proportional to the volume delivered by small producers, in order to swiftly re-establish a balance between supply and demand."
"A laisser-faire policy is unacceptable."
"It has terrible consequences in terms of employment and land use patterns."
"Without the small farmers, there will be no Europe."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I feel very strongly that the Commission was very late in acting on this particular problem."
"They sat on their hands for too long, and many farmers have suffered grievously for that."
"We can either decide to help the industry, or we can decide that we will ultimately let our farmers go out of business: then we can import from abroad with all the problems that brings us."
"I welcome your remarks for the future, Commissioner, but I am not happy about your remarks for the short term."
"I think we need to do more in the short term to help the industry through this present crisis."
"Those short-term measures require immediate action."
"Of course I remember the time of the milk lakes and the butter mountains, and I do not want to go back to that."
"I do not think anybody in the industry wants to go back to that situation: neither the farmer, nor the processors, nor the Commission nor we in this Parliament."
"We do not want to return to that, but one of the main problems I see at this moment in time is that, while the farmers have taken a drastic reduction in what they are receiving for their milk, consumers are paying almost the same as they paid before."
"Until we tackle the power of the supermarkets in this area we will not have the answer."
"They have to be controlled."
"We need an ombudsman, someone who can tell the supermarkets that they are acting beyond their remit, that they are ripping the people off, ripping the farmers off and putting them out of business in the process."
"Madam President, once again I can only regret the positions adopted by the Council and what has just been said here by the Commissioner, who persists in not getting to the bottom of the issue and not recognising the need to review the decisions reached on the dismantling of milk quotas."
"Instead, she wants to continue deregulating the sector against the farmers' best interests."
"We therefore insist on supporting the need to maintain the quota system, albeit with readjustments to adapt them to the needs of each individual country, including the scrapping of the annual 1% increase until 2015."
"Does she not believe that, at a time of such serious crisis in the dairy sector, what is more important than deregulation of the sector and liberalisation of international trade is support for agriculture and the dairy sector in the Member States, so as to promote rural areas and employment with rights?"
"Does she not consider it essential to create an extraordinary support fund for the dairy sector at Community level, benefiting the most affected producers and countries, and to define new forms of aid for milk and meat production?"
"I consider it necessary."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to stress my doubts about the proposal to extend the 2009-2010 intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder, since this proposal is in danger of turning short-term measures designed for the current crisis in the market into structural measures that would actually restore the dairy farming sector to the position it was in before quotas were introduced."
"In an effort to make the market measures more balanced, where benefits are not given solely to those Member States involved in butter and skimmed milk powder production, I call for the reintroduction of Community aid for private storage of cheese with a long maturation period."
"Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the matter of the origin marking and labelling of dairy products and to the traceability of products: this is a request that comes directly from European consumers - in ever greater numbers - and one that might help us to tackle the crisis in the dairy farming sector."
"I hope that my fellow Members from the other groups, too, can endorse this proposal."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her words to us today."
"In my country, in Northern Ireland, the dairy sector is of vital importance."
"When the dairy sector struggles, the rest of the rural economy struggles."
"Currently dairy farmers receive just over 20 cents per litre for milk amid escalating costs."
"In Northern Ireland not only have they had to contend with poor milk prices and high costs, but we have suffered a third consecutive wet summer and this has had a devastating effect on the dairy industry in Northern Ireland."
"It was distressing last night to see farmers in Belgium so angry and feeling so helpless that they are spraying milk onto their fields in protest at the poor price of milk and the difficulties that they too are encountering."
"The Commission has taken welcome steps to put a base on the market but we cannot sustain prices at an uneconomically low level."
"I call on the Commission to take short-term measures to help: measures that will increase demand for milk; measures that will cut the cost of production; measures that will address the supply chain with its decreasing farm-gate prices and high supermarket prices; and measures that in the long term will create a sustainable industry and a future for young farmers who are experiencing severe difficulties with low prices and high bank charges."
"Madam President, when farm women start protesting you know there is a serious difficulty."
"At the weekend I met a group of Irishwomen called 'Farm Women for a Fair Price' and I think we should note the words 'fair price' because producers are not getting a decent or fair price - and that is what this debate is about."
"It would be churlish not to welcome the comments from the Commissioner about a stability coming into the market place, although at a very low level, and I acknowledge that the Commission has taken steps and spent money to bring stability to the market place."
"It is just that it is not enough and it did not happen quickly enough and we have a severe crisis."
"I want to say that, in relation to the future, your comments are particularly welcome."
"I am worried that this House is divided on the issue of milk quotas because when we have codecision, if the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, we are going to have to think more coherently as a group and give clear signals to farmers rather than divided messages, so let me repeat that your comments about making links between producers and processors, about production levels, are something we need to explore, something we have to have a further debate on."
"But we need to ask you, Commissioner, what type of market support measures do you think will exist in the absence of quotas that can ensure a fair and decent price to our producers?"
"And, also, please tackle the marketplace: it is not working."
"Everybody says they are making no money from milk, including the supermarkets -which I doubt profusely - but we need more clarity, and we need fairness for farmers."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I will be brief."
"I think that there are two parts to this debate."
"There is the immediate question of how we can extricate ourselves from this crisis."
"All measures, ranging from assistance for farmers to intervention measures, are necessary - in fact, absolutely necessary."
"We must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope."
"That is what we, together with several fellow Members, are proposing here in Parliament."
"Secondly, there is the structural question regarding the management of the dairy market, and this is where our views diverge from yours, Commissioner."
"You propose that we move in the direction of using contractual relations."
"I can tell you in advance that introducing contractual relations between industrial firms and farmers will, in the long term, result in those industries competing with each other, on a Europe-wide scale."
"In order to regulate a market, we need public regulation."
"There is no other solution."
"After this crisis, that is what the debate must be about."
"I think that, in this debate, we must respect all opinions and all options;"
"I fear that we acted too quickly at the time of the health check to settle an issue such as quotas, which up until now, as I would like to point out to all those who have spoken, have made it possible to maintain dairy production in Europe, to ensure that the dairy industry is highly developed and, at the same time, to keep prices at a level that was easily affordable for customers."
"Madam President, in the last 12 months the majority of dairy farmers in Ireland and across the European Union have been selling their milk for less than the cost of production."
"The livelihoods of dairy farmers are under serious threat."
"While the Commission's decision to extend the intervention period for butter and skimmed-milk powder until 2010 is very much welcome, short-term measures would not alleviate the pressure on dairy farmers in the long term."
"Actions must be taken now that will manage, not just the current difficulties, but are long-term and will ensure a sustainable and successful industry into the future."
"Financial assistance is required by dairy farmers immediately."
"The creation of an EU dairy fund of EUR 600 million, as called for by Parliament in the 2009 budget procedure, is urgently needed."
"Dairy farmers are entitled to fair prices, and an appropriate system of price supports is required to guarantee milk producers a reasonable minimum price per litre and a reasonable income for them to survive."
"Irish and European dairy farmers must not be forced out of business and I urge the Commission and the Council to take immediate and effective action."
"Commissioner, may I say to you that you have been a very successful Commissioner, and I pay tribute to the immense work you have done."
"You have recently announced that you are stepping down, and I would urge you to solve, or to make as much of a contribution to solving this problem as possible, before your departure."
"(ES) ¡Bon dia!"
"I am addressing this Parliament without being able to do so in my own language, Catalan, which is spoken by over 10 million European citizens."
"Today, on behalf of my Group, I want to express our solidarity with the whole of the agricultural sector, and in particular with the strike by milk producers and their actions across Europe."
"The current situation is unsustainable and requires a political solution."
"Clearly, the measures adopted to date by the Commission have been unable to alleviate the crisis or provide a viable alternative to the quota replacement scheme planned for 2015."
"As a result, in Spain for example - Galicia to be precise - 14 000 milk producers have had to cope with root-and-branch restructuring in order to continue living and working on the land, but today they are still on the verge of imminent disappearance."
"For all these reasons, in the same way that the Commission has intervened in other sectors, it must also intervene in the milk sector, by regulating production, redistributing quotas, offering temporary compensation, encouraging product traceability and helping to bring producers and consumers closer together by correcting the dysfunctions caused by the distribution oligopoly."
"Why has the Commission not positively intervened to prevent the negative consequences of this oligopoly established by the major distributors?"
"Why are we not guaranteeing the rural survival of our milk producers - and farmers in general - who provide extremely positive economic, social and environmental knock-on effects?"
"- (CS) - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in the dairy produce sector shows that the entire European system of quota-based regulation is faulty and ineffective."
"What we need is not more regulation and manipulation of the quotas but the complete elimination of milk quotas."
"The opportunity to produce milk should go mainly to producers who have low costs and who achieve a profit."
"The way to overcome the dairy crisis is to eliminate milk quotas as quickly as possible."
"I support the Commissioner's attempt to eliminate quotas by 2015, but I would not be sorry to see them go even sooner."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, listening to your statement has increased my concerns even more."
"The statement is not a sufficient response to the scale of the suffering being experienced by milk producers and farmers in general."
"The crisis is a structural one, and has not been caused merely by current circumstances, as you have said, but by the successive deregulations."
"That is why we are calling for an exceptional meeting of the European Council, in order to save small-scale agriculture."
"The Council ought, firstly, to decide to set up an exceptional fund to provide assistance to non-industrial dairy production; secondly, to immediately set a minimum intra-European price that the central buying offices would be obliged to adhere to without any increase in prices for consumers; and, thirdly, to block national production quotas and put a stop to improper imports from outside the Community."
"Madam President, I have major concerns for the dairy industry in the UK."
"I feel that the biggest problem lies with the retail industry, which is making huge profits off the backs of our dairy farmers."
"When we see what the supermarkets are charging consumers for milk, and then look at what the dairy farmer actually receives, the difference is just incredible."
"The work and the major cost in producing milk are borne by the farmer, but at the same time the supermarkets are reaping huge profits."
"The margin that the farmer receives is so unfair."
"We need to put pressure on the supermarkets to pay a fair price to the industry, and it is my view that the price of milk in the supermarkets will not have to change."
"The consumer will not have to pay any more for their milk."
"The supermarkets need to reduce their profit margins."
"It is quite scandalous when we see the massive profits that these supermarkets are enjoying every year and at the same time our dairy industry is struggling."
"If action is not taken on the issue in the very near future then I really do believe that many of our dairy farmers in Wales, and the rest of the UK, will go out of business."
"I have one quick point on what the Commissioner said this morning about the super levy."
"I am concerned by those comments."
"I think it will hit our most efficient producers - those who have risen to the challenge, responded to the market and invested heavily in their farms, following a lead from the Commission that quotas will be abolished."
"Imposing a super levy goes against the structural changes which both the EU and the UK Government claim to support."
"(BG) Madam President, the Commission is in an extremely upbeat mood again, bearing good news, but I fail to understand and cannot see anything good in thousands of tonnes of milk being thrown away in protest at the policy currently being pursued."
"The truth is that Mr De Castro and the other previous speakers are quite right in saying that the Commission and the Council did not do enough during the health check to prevent this crisis."
"Incidentally, where are the representatives of the Council who should be taking a stand on this issue, seeing as the Council holds the deciding vote in any reforms?"
"My Eastern European colleagues and I on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development warned on several occasions that we needed a much greater increase in quotas, or their total removal, because our countries, being new to the European Union's systems, were the first to feel the impact of the crisis."
"Unfortunately, we have remained a lone voice in the desert, and the fault for this lies with Parliament."
"I deeply regret that we pro-reformists, who really wanted the agricultural policy to be reformed, have turned out to be prophets of doom."
"I hope you learn the lessons for the future."
"(RO) Many people have asked during this period, right from the start of the crisis, to freeze the increase in milk quotas."
"This type of measure would not only not provide a solution, but would be a mistake, at least from the following points of view."
"First of all, there is no basic economic link between the increase in milk quotas and the fall in market prices."
"Quotas have increased, while production has fallen."
"I cannot see where the link is."
"The market itself offers the explanation for falling prices."
"I believe that setting fixed quotas would lead to a rise in prices over time."
"However, the beneficiaries will be, once again, not the producers, but the processors and retailers."
"If we want to limit production we should perhaps encourage producers to stop livestock rearing voluntarily, by providing incentives rather than measures which could distort the market."
"Assuming quotas are frozen, what is going to happen when, for instance, demand on the global market picks up again?"
"What could European producers do?"
"Because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"As I was saying, what could European producers do, assuming demand on the global market picks up again?"
"Because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on willy-nilly."
"If we were to cut production now, farmers would obviously give up cow rearing, but it would be very difficult to replenish the livestock when we realise that what some people now imagine would be a good measure is, in reality, a big mistake."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Council, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Member Mr Capoulas Santos, who has made this resolution possible."
"Today we are talking about our dairy farmers and whether we are going to leave them in the lurch or deal with them in an honest manner."
"I do not believe that we should leave them in the lurch, but should be honest in our dealings with them."
"Yes, short-term measures to overcome the crisis are urgently needed."
"Yes, intervention is perfectly acceptable for a short period if the price of milk has reached rock bottom, and additional subsidies, loans and funds to combat the crisis are justified."
"However, what is totally unacceptable is, firstly, to start up discussions about milk quotas again and, secondly, to reintroduce tax-funded export refunds for products supplied to developing countries."
"We abandoned this one way street in 2003 and I appeal to you to keep it that way for the sake of our dairy farmers."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the world economic crisis has thrown the global market off balance."
"As milk producers we are suffering the effects of prices having hit an all-time low."
"We are hearing over and over again that the adopted milk quota regulations should be amended."
"As a dairy farmer myself, I can only warn you against doing this."
"The Commission's intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be relaxing."
"However, I do not think that this intervention is really a good means of achieving this, because it will result in stocks piling up which could burden a recovering market later on."
"I therefore call on the Commission to explain how it is going to deal with this problem."
"Madam President, can I compliment the Commissioner on her vision for the future of the industry, and may I say that I strongly support her intention to abolish milk quotas."
"I think this is the right decision to make."
"I also welcome her proposals to meet this current crisis as a sensible and appropriate way to support producers through a difficult time."
"There are, however, two points that I want to make."
"Firstly, in my view, the implementation of the super levy at this time would be inappropriate."
"It is a short-term, knee-jerk reaction."
"It will send all the wrong messages and it will only effectively penalise efficient producers who are making plans to stay in the industry for the long term."
"Secondly, we need to recognise that there is little or no direct relationship between the price in the retail sector and the raw material price received at the farm gate."
"That is what I term a dysfunctional price-chain mechanism."
"The major influence will always be the global marketplace, and we have to recognise that the global marketplace will always be volatile."
"I therefore urge the Commission in the long term to come forward with plans to ensure that there will be some sort of stability mechanism for the benefit not only of producers but also, of course, of consumers in the long term."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, you ended your speech by saying that there is a crisis in the milk sector, and yet you started by saying that all possible measures have already been taken and that the situation is being sorted out."
"You should know that it takes a wise woman to recognise that she was wrong."
"That is a saying in Spain, which could very well be applied to this situation."
"For months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history."
"Despite that, because the European Commission and certain governments - seemingly including my own, the Spanish Government - do not want to allow their arms to be twisted, they are refusing to go back on the decisions relating to the health check of the common agricultural policy."
"Those decisions were taken without any thought for the fragility of this sector, and in a market context very different from the one that has developed since that compromise was agreed."
"It makes you think that the Member States did not want to see, or could not see, at that time, the storm that was approaching."
"The reform has very quickly become irrelevant, due to the major turnaround in the market, which demonstrates that the sector is totally at the mercy of price volatility."
"The fact that major producers such as France and Germany - countries which, in absolute terms, obtained the biggest increase in their national production quotas in this agreement - are now the ones asking for a review of the health check decisions raises a lot of issues."
"As I see it, the Member States were wrong and should have listened more carefully to the voices, including mine, which were calling for any final decision on the future of the sector to be postponed until 2011."
"It is a shame that no one listened to us."
"Perhaps you should do so now."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, today's debate is vital so that we can express our concern about the crisis in the milk sector."
"We must sort out this situation, which is threatening the future of a large number of milk producers in the European Union."
"This is a European crisis that must be tackled from a European perspective, with ambition and by using all available Community tools, something which the Commission at the moment seems incapable of doing."
"Commissioner, you should not pass the buck to Member States so that they help whoever they can."
"We must find common solutions."
"As a result, this Parliament has an important responsibility in demanding measures aimed at reinvigorating demand, and not only those measures indicated in the motion for a resolution, but also those available through the common organisation of the market."
"Another important issue is the huge difference between the prices paid to the producer and the final price paid by consumers, something which affects not only the milk sector, but all agricultural and livestock products."
"There are many men and women who, faced with the current uncertainty, need a clear and firm signal from us that the continuation of this activity will be guaranteed."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, yesterday in Wallonia over three million litres of milk were poured away by farmers disillusioned by the most serious crisis ever seen in the sector."
"They receive only 19 cents per litre."
"The crisis is caused by an over-abundant supply of milk, which is making prices drop sharply."
"Deregulation is encouraging volatility, and market conditions now are totally the opposite of what they were a short time ago."
"Commissioner, please stop stubbornly hiding behind choices made last year and take into account what is really happening on the ground now!"
"The Council is also to blame, firstly for not being here to listen to the debate, but also for not taking decisions, because it is swayed more by purely national interests than by a European vision of agriculture."
"The market is not working."
"There is over-production."
"It would be very simple to freeze the 1% increase in quotas, or to reduce the quotas immediately by 3 to 5%, because we urgently need to come up with some short-term solutions."
"Adopting this measure would kill two birds with one stone: we would give the producers a decent price once again and, by reducing production, we would reduce the European bill of hundreds of millions of euros spent on various interventions, including export refunds."
"(PL) The action that has been taken - I have spoken today to Polish farmers and Polish product manufacturers - indicates that there has been an improvement, albeit not a significant one as yet, in the situation facing the dairy sector, but that there has been no change at all in the very difficult situation facing Polish and European farmers."
"They still receive very little money for their products, below the viability threshold."
"This also applies to those farmers who have invested a great deal of money, including EU funding and loans."
"This situation is plunging them into further difficulties, and they are unable to meet their obligations."
"In view of these problems, I would like to talk about the future."
"Today, we have to react to what is happening right now, but we also have to think about what lies ahead and plan our common policy to take farmers into account as well."
"At this juncture, I would like to repeat the following: the common policy in respect of dairy farmers needs to involve plans for sensible investments in this sector, so that we can avoid spending money which, as a result of increased production, will land us in the kind of trouble we find ourselves facing today."
"I also trust that all the political powers will reach an agreement regarding future quotas."
"(HU) Those who have spoken before me quite rightly refer to the fact that we should not return to the quota system and export subsidies, but the policy which the Commission has pursued has completely failed."
"The crisis has not eased."
"This is why Mr Le Foll and I are proposing that we temporarily freeze the quotas, but only temporarily."
"The new Member States are still at a particular disadvantage because of phasing-in, as we are receiving just 60% of the subsidies from the envelope in Brussels this year."
"As a counterbalance to this, the Hungarian government proposed increasing the quota-based subsidies, but the Commission did not respond positively to this suggestion or to the one from France, specifically from the French ministry, either."
"I finally call on my fellow Members to support the amendments from Mr Le Foll and his colleagues."
"We also support the proposal from Elisabeth Jeggle in favour of creating a EUR 600 million dairy fund and the extension of the school milk programme."
"(DA) Madam President, thank you Commissioner for a good start - and a good introduction to the debate!"
"I recognise that Europe's dairy farmers are facing a crisis on a major scale, but I simply do not understand how my fellow Members can think that you, in the Commission, have not done enough."
"I would definitely like to call on you, Mrs Fischer Boel, to reiterate what you have done."
"It seems to me that the list of initiatives coming from the Commission is a long one, in fact it is almost too long."
"It is almost as if we are destroying the progress that we made in connection with the health check."
"I would also like to point out that the efforts that have been made thus far on behalf of the dairy farmers have clearly not been mirrored in relation to those workers in the car industry who have lost their jobs or those workers in the shipbuilding industry who have lost their jobs as a result of the current economic crisis."
"So I can only ask that we take a little care about how we handle this crisis and that we also make sure that we do not destroy the sound progress that was made, despite everything, as a result of the health check."
"The idea of freezing the milk quotas is, I think, completely hopeless!"
"Nor can we go back to the old models by granting export refunds - that simply ruins the market for someone elsewhere in the world."
"We have to be careful."
"Commissioner, I would nonetheless like to ask you to reiterate the long list of activities that you have already undertaken so that my fellow Members can see that there is certainly no need for us to go crazy and start enacting numerous additional measures with the result that we destroy the sound progress that has been made."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the measures are without doubt inadequate."
"We propose other, more targeted interventions, especially for the mountainous and disadvantaged areas of the European Union, so that all the Member States benefit equally; interventions such as reinforced protection for designations of origin, not just inside the European Union, but on the international markets, clear labelling and mandatory indication of the origin of dairy products, the reactivation - and why not - of private storage of dairy products and provision for satisfactory aid, an increase in eligible destinations for export refunds, full transparency in the supply chain and a reduction in the gap between producer and consumer prices."
"We are not the mouthpieces for the farmers' interests."
"We are here to convey the anxiety, the cry for survival of the creative forces of the European countryside, and that cry for survival from the people in the European countryside is for us a standing instruction to act."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner - I would have liked to have been able to address the Presidency of the Council too - ladies and gentlemen, as you yourself acknowledged the other day, Commissioner, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the price paid to dairy producers no longer covers the current costs of production."
"What that means is that our producers are in the process of decapitalising."
"Just now, you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months."
"Those measures do exist, we will grant you that."
"They have not, however, produced the anticipated effects because, in our view, they are not extensive enough, and there is definitely too much uncertainty about how effective their target is."
"This morning you mentioned a recovery in the market, but the producers will certainly only see the effects of this in the payments made at the beginning of next year."
"The agricultural products market is not the same as the market in metals or the energy market."
"It calls for regulatory tools, because the cycles of the seasons and nature also have an effect on market conditions."
"Your interpretation of the health check, carried out under the French Presidency, surprises us, since the interim assessments that it produced in relation to the dairy sector leave all avenues open, including the possibility of new decisions on tools for regulating the markets."
"The French delegation, to which I belong, is convinced that a renewed quotas system will be necessary after 2013."
"The tension that existed on the food products market prior to the current economic crisis has demonstrated the fragility of the balance across the world between production and consumption."
"After having partially dismantled the intervention tools, we have neither the right nor the legitimacy to dismantle today the production tools that we will need in the short term."
"Commissioner, we must give farmers back their dignity: these are men and women who are not afraid of hard work."
"(ES) We cannot allow the milk sector to collapse."
"It is vital for our rural world, and for food security and quality."
"Futures markets and the medium- to long-term prospects of the milk and dairy products market in the European Union are showing positive signs."
"We must prevent these falling into a negative situation."
"We need anti-cyclical actions and joint initiatives."
"The collapse in prices clearly shows the inadequacy of support measures."
"The distortions in the dairy farming market mean that each supply chain cannot function effectively or fairly."
"Producers are suffering price drops which are unbalancing the market, not being passed on to consumers and delaying the sector's recovery."
"This must be corrected."
"We must ensure fair competition and also reinforce traceability during marketing."
"(FI) Commissioner, you mentioned that there is no longer any question of a return to the quota system."
"Have we not seen what happened in the dairy industry after the Commission decided in the spring gradually to withdraw these quotas?"
"That was a very poor and short-sighted decision."
"The complete withdrawal of quotas will deal the deathblow to many small farms."
"Is this the sort of policy that the Commission wants to implement?"
"The fact is we need a restrictive system for the dairy industry."
"If quotas are out of the question, I would appeal to you, Commissioner, to ensure that the Commission proposes other solutions to resolve the crisis."
"This is a European crisis and we have to implement an agricultural policy that guarantees at least a reasonable standard of living for farmers, regardless of country and region."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I am an elected representative from a region in the west of France, where there is a very high concentration of dairy farmers, and I do not believe that you have acknowledged the tragic social situation they are experiencing today."
"Commissioner, when you speak of 'producers', what I hear is 'manufacturers' and 'distributors'."
"Dairy producers do not need your compassion, Commissioner."
"They do not need the outmoded liberal theories that have drawn us into an unprecedented world crisis."
"Dairy producers need a genuine agricultural policy."
"They need strict quotas."
"That is why we are calling on the Council to overturn your policy and instead to create a genuine policy to support dairy producers and to put an end to this policy of destroying them en masse."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, our debate really has taken place in the shadow of dramatic events related to farmers spilling milk in protest."
"We are all deeply shaken by what has happened."
"I wanted to refer to a problem that was mentioned by my colleague, Mr Nicholson, namely the way in which large commercial chains and hypermarkets have abused both their consumers and, in particular, their suppliers."
"I would like to remind you that the European Parliament, during the 2008 parliamentary term, adopted a written resolution - I was one of the co-authors - on the need to put an end to these abuses, and for the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter."
"According to my information, action has been taken, but the process seems to be too slow."
"I would like to ask whether the Commissioner is interested in this matter and, generally, what the future prospects are in relation to these kinds of activities."
"There is something really wrong with the economic policy of the European Union, as farmers receive less than 10% of the value of their products."
"This has to change."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner to take action on this issue."
"(CS) Commissioner, you see as progress a 3% - 8% increase in the price of finished products such as skimmed milk and butter."
"In my view, this is an insult to our farmers."
"The main problem is the price at which milk is purchased from farmers."
"In the Czech Republic, for example, the purchase price is up to 25% lower than the production cost, but the price of the finished product which is then sold in the shops would easily cover all the farmers' costs."
"The main problem, therefore, is that there is a large hole somewhere."
"This problem has to be resolved."
"In the Czech Republic we now have fewer cattle than we had after the Napoleonic wars."
"This is now even putting at risk the upkeep of rural areas."
"Mr Bové is quite right and Mr Fajmon profoundly ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) Mr President, emergency measures are obviously needed, as the situation is disastrous."
"But is it not possible that the problem lies somehow with the basics?"
"Surely there is a problem with a model or system where a huge quantity of soya is imported from Latin America, for instance, thereby increasing the oversupply in Europe while destroying the environment in Latin America."
"In the ensuing crisis, we then rack our brains about whether we should export agricultural produce to the developing world at dumped prices, therefore ruining the market over there, along with the situation of smallholders and producers."
"Do we not need a new model, such as food sovereignty, instead of imposing on agriculture the free-trade logic dictated by the WTO?"
"My second question is the following."
"We are asking for specific advice or a proposal on how ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, we saved the banks, because we had to."
"Now we are faced with a situation where we need to prevent thousands of farmers from going bankrupt in the short term because prices no longer cover production costs."
"However, we must ensure that we maintain our production potential in order to supply the population with high quality foodstuffs."
"I belong to a generation which experienced food rationing."
"I remember having to cycle eight kilometres in the winter of 1944 just to get two eggs."
"It will hopefully not come to that, but security of supply - not only in the energy sector - is also important."
"If we are not prepared to take the measures that have been called for in our resolution, the cost in terms of the social, economic and environmental policy consequences in the EU will be many times what ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the European Commission stated in its communication of 22 July, the situation in the dairy farming sector has deteriorated dramatically during the last 12 months."
"However, taking into account the huge impact of the crisis on dairy product prices, and in particular on the income earned by producers, the measures proposed to date by the European Commission and debated by the Council of Ministers have been inadequate to counteract the fall in demand and its consequences."
"The current crisis is not only giving us the challenge of reversing the fall in demand, but also an opportunity to encourage the consumption and promotion of dairy products."
"We must also ensure that the indisputable quality of the initial product is maintained intact until it reaches the end consumer."
"In this respect, actions such as improving labelling, increasing milk consumption among certain groups of the population or using milk to feed calves may help not only to improve the current situation, but also the whole structural situation in the sector."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Members of Parliament for this very dedicated debate."
"I have actually listened very carefully."
"But of course I have also noted the different views that I have heard among the different Members of this Parliament."
"As regards the quota system; it seems to be the scapegoat of this whole situation in which we find ourselves."
"I do not underestimate - and I have been very precise on this since the very beginning of the discussion - that the dairy sector, not only in Europe but globally, finds itself in an unprecedented crisis."
"That must be very clear."
"So I certainly do understand the frustration that I see among farmers in different parts of Europe, not all over, but in different parts of Europe."
"The abolition of the quota system was decided back in 2003 so it is not a decision that was taken overnight while nobody knew what was happening."
"Then, in the health check, we had the discussion on increasing the quotas to try to find a soft landing for the dairy farmers."
"But I think that those who want to point their finger at the quota system for being the reason for all the problems in which dairy farmers find themselves are wrong."
"Because we see that even with a quota system in place, we have not been able to maintain high prices and the structural changes in the dairy sector have taken place anyway."
"If you look at 1984, when the quota system was introduced, we had 1.6 million dairy farmers in the old EU-10."
"Today in EU-10 we have 300 000 dairy farmers: less than one fifth of the number of dairy farmers today compared to 1984 with a quota system in place."
"So these structural changes are taking place anyway."
"I do not think that going back or rolling back the decision in the health check is the right policy, and here I am supported by all heads of state saying clearly in their decisions from the meeting in June that I have to stick to the decisions from the health check."
"I have never, ever, during the health check discussions, signalled any openness to roll back these decisions because that would certainly jeopardise predictability for farmers within the European Union."
"But, José Bové, I think you said I had not been acting with preciseness; that is, the laissez-faire attitude."
"I do not think it is fair to say that we have been doing nothing."
"I am not going to repeat all the different measures that we have been taking."
"I think that, if Member States want to pay specific attention to the dairy sector, they now have the possibility with the health check to reallocate the direct payments so they give a special preference to the grassland areas."
"That is a possibility and I know that at least one big Member State has taken the opportunity to use this possibility, and for the mountainous areas there are lots of different possibilities."
"We have production in Europe today that is 45% below quota, so what would happen if we actually wanted to cut quota by 5%?"
"We would actually damage the situation for the young farmers that have invested in the future."
"Therefore, I would recommend to those countries, those Member States, who really want to help their dairy sector that they use this buy-up of quotas from those who want to leave the dairy sector."
"That is a much better way of securing the maintenance of those who have invested while giving a helping hand to those that want to leave the sector."
"That is I think the right policy."
"Could I then just correct the misunderstanding on the super levy?"
"We are not introducing a new super levy system."
"We are just giving the possibility that, if Member States are buying up quotas from farmers, they can reduce the number of kilos or tonnes from their ceiling, but it is not a new super levy that will punish any of the farmers."
"Just on some of the promotion."
"We have already reserved EUR 14 million for promotion for the rest of this year."
"We have agreed on extending the school milk scheme; yogurt that is low in sugar - that is, containing no more than 7% sugar - will now be introduced into the school milk scheme."
"Labelling - I hear from different Members of Parliament that there is interest in a labelling system."
"Let us discuss that in the context of the quality paper that is actually on the table at the moment."
"So I think there are lots of possibilities."
"Then, finally, on the food chain, I completely agree with you that that there is no transparency in this chain and we cannot see where the added value is disappearing."
"Therefore, I am looking forward to the presenting of this report before the end of the year so we can see what the situation actually looks like."
"I must say that, if you look at the supermarket situation all over Europe, there are huge differences."
"Germany has a tradition or number of discount supermarkets."
"These supermarkets are using dairy or milk products, drinking milk as a produit d'appel to get the consumers in, and they are offering a very low price but they are just handing over the bill to the farmers, paying them the low price."
"So, I think it would be very interesting and necessary to see what is actually happening in this chain, so let us get this transparency on the table and let us, internally in the Commission, but also in Member States' competition authorities, look into the market."
"It has been a very interesting discussion here today."
"I hope that you have noticed the short-term measures and the long-term measures that have been worked out together with France and Germany."
"I am sure that we will have some very interesting discussions on the future of the dairy sector in Europe because we all want our dairy sector to have a future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commission for deciding to come here to Parliament today to present new proposals on the crisis in the dairy farming sector."
"It is important for the parliamentary term that has just begun to be characterised by an interinstitutional dialogue between the Commission and Parliament, a positive dialogue, which has in fact already launched the codecision process."
"We will assess your new proposals very carefully, Commissioner, and it will be my job to ask the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to issue an opinion on the new ideas immediately, without delay."
"May I conclude, however, by pointing out that, if the amendment adopted unanimously within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also adopted by this House in plenary, it will become a political problem if the Council, after the ratification of Lisbon, should then vote it down."
"I therefore invite you, and the Council, to give it serious consideration."
"To conclude the debate, I have received seven motions for resolutionspursuant to Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I come from an outermost region, the Azores, where milk production is the pillar of the economy, society and the environment."
"In recent weeks we met with the producers, their organisations and the processing industries."
"They all agree."
"It is crucial that the Commission should give a more effective and urgent global response in order to tackle the current situation."
"Cash flow in the sector is drying up."
"It is vital that the outermost regions be looked at particularly carefully by the EU and be included in its responses to mitigate the effects of the current crisis."
"They are all of the opinion that we need to stop the increase in quotas."
"In a market thrown off balance by surpluses, any country that increases its production harms all the others."
"They also believe that we should continue to maintain quotas as a supply regulation mechanism that stabilises their activity."
"In the current scenario of total liberalisation, its social, environmental and economic effects on these regions need to be urgently studied."
"Specific measures must be designed to prevent the collapse of this activity, which is responsible for our beautiful countryside, the quality of our environment and rural areas, and the economic progress and convergence that we have been achieving."
"in writing. - (HU) The current dairy market crisis has been caused mainly by raising milk quotas."
"The European Commission and Member States' governments are also responsible for the current grave situation affecting the dairy sector, as in 2008 they supported raising the quotas, resulting in the creation of milk surpluses and the collapse of prices."
"This decision was based on the European Commission's erroneous market forecasts."
"However, the European Commission did not abandon its intention even when it became obvious that the production increase was contrary to market trends."
"This is why the European Union must immediately drop its measures leading to an increase in dairy production."
"Furthermore, we also oppose the permanent removal of quotas after 2015."
"The important lesson to be learned from the current crisis is that the dairy market needs to be regulated."
"Without this, prices will become unpredictable."
"European dairy producers cannot endure the losses caused by large-scale price volatility."
"I am pleased that, with a view to easing the crisis, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of my initiative, which would raise the export subsidies amount from EUR 450 million to EUR 600 million."
"Without the export subsidies some of the surpluses would remain on the EU internal market, which would lead to a further price decrease."
"in writing. - Milk quotas need to be cut by between 5 to 10 per cent in order to push prices back up to a sustainable level."
"But quotas alone will not save the dairy sector."
"While the Commission is correct to adopt a long-term view, it cannot detach itself from reality - and the stark reality is that the agriculture industry, in particular the dairy sector, is in real danger."
"The lowest milk prices since 1983, together with high costs, poor weather and lack of credit, have created an unprecedented cash flow and income crisis for dairy farm families in 2009."
"While the indications are that markets have bottomed out, badly needed price increases still appear some way off, and EU action is needed."
"I agree with IFA President Padraig Walshe and Dairy Chairman Richard Kennedy that the quickest way to speed up price recovery is for the EU Commission to make more aggressive use of all market supports such as:"
"Export refunds"
"Processing aids"
"Extended full-price intervention"
"Longer private storage scheme for butter"
"Careful handling of stocks"
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, last year the situation in the dairy sector declined dramatically."
"The producer price for milk fell, and at present many milk producers are having to sell dairy products at a price that does not reflect production costs."
"The survival of milk producers is now seriously under threat."
"Up until now it has not been possible to resolve the crisis in the dairy sector with the measures the Commission has implemented."
"Now it is time to roll up our sleeves and come up with new solutions."
"The Commission must stabilise the dairy market in Europe quickly."
"At the same time it should also undertake a thorough evaluation of the future of the dairy industry together with actors in the sector and the Member States. Thank you."
"In order to tackle the particularly difficult economic circumstances currently confronting the dairy sector, strong action by the European Union is now urgently required."
"In common with the majority of the Member States, I believe that the solutions put forward by the Commission are unsatisfactory."
"Of course, I welcome the flexibility that it is permitting, which will enable the national aid ceiling to be increased from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 for producers who are struggling."
"It is nonetheless vital for us to adopt more effective intervention tools."
"In order to deal with the growing volatility of prices, our markets must be regulated to a greater extent."
"The joint statement made by 16 Member States on the state of the European dairy market offers the Commission some valuable suggestions on improving the regulation of dairy markets."
"I also believe that it is necessary, as seven Member States are requesting, to look at temporarily suspending the increase in quotas."
"I would also like to reiterate my support for the introduction of a 'Dairy Fund' to help producers' organisations and cooperatives, and also to support agricultural investment, modernisation, diversification of dairy farming, measures linked to geographical location and marketing measures for dairy products."
"in writing. - (ET) Observing the present situation in the dairy market, it is clear that our sector is still largely unprepared to cope with the consequences of the global economic crisis."
"As a result, the development of the common agricultural policy should continue to be aimed towards improved competitiveness and, in the long term, less market management."
"Giving the common agricultural policy a 'check-up' is a step in the right direction, and maintaining the same direction in discussions of the common agricultural policy after 2013 is the only way to strengthen the sector."
"We are currently going through the deepest crisis in the dairy sector, triggered by the global crisis, which is basically a result of a discrepancy between demand and supply."
"The fall in the prices of milk and dairy products primarily affects farms with low incomes."
"For this reason, I do not think that the quota system ought to be frozen in all Member States, but each state ought to decide how to set their own quotas."
"The problem is that, compared to 1983-84, only one-fifth of producers have remained in the market, and we are now at risk of more farms closing down."
"We therefore need to adopt urgent measures to prevent this from happening."
"We ought to take the following measures to end the crisis in this sector: extend the measures envisaged for storing butter, milk powder and cheeses, speed up the creation of a dairy product fund to meet the needs of small producers and young farmers, and reach an understanding with the supermarkets in terms of setting a fair price for both agricultural producers and retailers."
"Energy security (Nabucco and Desertec) (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on energy security in relation to the Nabucco and Desertec projects."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, energy will definitely continue to be the focus of this Parliament for the next five years."
"At the same time, we have made good progress over the last five years in establishing a robust European energy policy with three goals: security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness."
"In achieving all these goals, the external dimension is extremely important for two reasons."
"Firstly, EU import dependency - currently, 50% of energy resources come from outside the European Union, and the trend is upwards."
"Secondly, issues related to sustainability."
"The climate change goals cannot be achieved anywhere in the world unless energy is produced more cleanly and used more efficiently."
"For this reason, dialogue with the producer, transit and consumer countries is crucial."
"The two projects mentioned in today's plenary are, in a way, complementary and at the same time fit well into the overall strategy."
"First of all, Nabucco."
"I came from Baku yesterday, and we are definitely still on course to fulfil this project."
"We made a major breakthrough this July."
"An intergovernmental agreement was signed between four European countries and Turkey, which means that we could already take a final investment decision next year with a view to having gas supplies by 2014."
"We have identified three sources that are ready to commit gas volumes."
"Firstly, there is Azerbaijan, where the final investment decision about Shah Deniz 2 should be made in the very near future, and then there are other fields, in Turkmenistan and Iraq, which at this stage are the biggest sources of supply."
"Where are the difficulties?"
"There are always difficulties related to the particular way we operate in the energy field and how a lot of producer countries are organised."
"In the European Union, projects are industry-driven, which means that there is always a very clear calculation of all the commercial risks."
"The countries that have the resources would expect more forward-moving decisions."
"That means, for example, the EU decides to build a pipeline, it builds a pipeline, and then we commit the gas."
"The philosophies are different."
"At the same time there is a clear understanding that EU companies are ready to buy the gas, and we are moving forward towards it."
"I believe that the transit issue is more or less solved."
"We are still awaiting the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement, but I would not expect too many difficulties."
"Also, to facilitate buying gas from regions that have particular ways of selling gas, we are developing the concept of a 'Caspian development corporation' that would allow for reduced risks for companies buying gas, for example at the Turkmen border, or investing in areas where the political and economic risks are quite substantial."
"We are well on track, and I believe this is a good example of cooperation between industry-driven projects with political support from the EU institutions."
"We have also committed some funds for the southern corridor and particularly for the Nabucco project."
"We have launched a call for proposals."
"At this stage I cannot say whether this was successful or good enough but at least the invitation was made."
"Desertec is also an industry-driven initiative that is currently at an initial stage."
"It sounds very interesting that we use the solar energy potential of Africa and transport it to the European Union, but we need some flanking measures for this project to materialise."
"First of all, there is the technological development that we have supported for many years."
"A large concentrated solar power plant will be inaugurated this month in Seville."
"This is one technology that could be used for this Desertec project, and I believe that we would not have advanced so far in this technology without EU support."
"Secondly, we need to work with partners because it is very clear that we cannot just say we will take your territory, we will put solar panels in and transport electricity to the European Union."
"There should be common ownership of these projects, if they are to happen at all."
"For this reason we will have a conference in October on using renewable sources together with countries from the Mediterranean and the Gulf."
"It is clear that for Desertec to be successful we need common ownership of these projects, otherwise there will be no successful outcome."
"Last but not least, there is definitely the issue of interconnection."
"There are two types of interconnection that we need to separate."
"One relates to the philosophy and markets."
"We have supported the integration of markets in North Africa for some time."
"Progress has been made, but we need to strengthen these measures."
"The second type is physical interconnection with the European Union, using cables."
"I believe that Desertec will come step by step."
"It will not be one big project but I believe there will be elements that could ultimately fit our objectives: clean energy for the countries involved and additional exports to the European Union."
"We have also provided for commercial incentives."
"With the Renewable Energy Directive we have established the possibility for EU countries to invest in third countries and transport electricity to the European Union, and then the goal will also be fulfilled with energy produced in the third country."
"That said, it is definitely difficult at this stage to give any timetable for Desertec."
"It is a new initiative, which is still in its infancy, and we cannot say Desertec is part of our security of supply strategy."
"It is a promising move towards a climate change strategy that we need to promote, but Nabucco is there for security of supply, and it is too early at this stage to rely on Desertec."
"I would like to conclude that the best security of supply measures we can take are inside the European Union."
"This House has been a very strong supporter of energy efficiency."
"Energy efficiency is not only to do with climate change."
"It really is a very important element in the security of supply."
"I would say it is more important than Desertec and Nabucco, plus even South Stream and Nord Stream, combined."
"It really is the biggest element."
"Three legal instruments are being discussed with the Council, and I would emphasise that we need to be ambitious and successful with these."
"On renewable energy, I am very grateful for the support of this House for the recovery plan, and I am quite positive regarding what I have heard about the applications for offshore wind energy."
"It seems that all the funds that were committed to support offshore wind energy will be committed."
"This is not only EU money because the overall envelope was roughly EUR 600 million, but the overall size of this project is EUR 4 billion, so industry is investing most of it."
"I believe this is a very good combination, as renewable energy also gives security of supply."
"Last but not least, I know that sometimes there is an issue about carbon capture and storage (CCS)."
"CCS is usually needed for two reasons. One is as a global response to climate change but, from another point of view, we will also use coal and lignite for our security of supply."
"There has also been very good progress on applications for the financing provided with the recovery plan, so the recovery plan was successful, in my opinion."
"After announcing the results, we - the Commission, the Council and Parliament - definitely need to review how to channel EU funds to strengthen the European Union's security of supply."
"Many other steps will also definitely need to be taken to strengthen the security of supply of the European Union."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, we all agree to speak with one voice and have a common foreign policy on the security of energy supply."
"It is acknowledged that the energy mix and energy supply differs among Member States according to geography and other distinct factors."
"So, diversification also covers supply."
"A diversified and interconnected network can, if appropriately redirected, one day become the security of supply for all."
"We support the need for a southern corridor, and Nabucco is a common European project."
"However, questions need to be answered on the recent agreement between Mr Putin and Turkey, on the quantity of gas from Azerbaijan vis-à-vis the investment, on Gazprom's offer to buy all Azerbaijan's exports, on the stability of Iraqi supply, and on the Russian promise to pump double the amount through South Stream."
"The energy dialogue with Russia is a necessity based on the pragmatic and equitable principle of security of supply and security of demand."
"All other geopolitical considerations must be set aside."
"On solidarity, we need tangible plans for emergencies, such as storage and new LNG technology."
"Cyprus, for example, invests half a billion euro on LNG, and I regret that the Union assists with only EUR 10 million."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your report."
"The question of security of supply for our citizens is becoming ever more important."
"In this context in particular, your portfolio will play an even greater role in future - and it will be important for the European identity, too."
"As you quite rightly said, diversification is also necessary."
"I absolutely agree with Mr Kasoulides that cooperation with Russia will always be important, as it is an important partner with regard to gas supply."
"However, we should not be too dependent on any one country, whichever country that may be, but we should diversify, and Nabucco is a good way of going about this."
"My third point concerns the solidarity that is needed in the EU."
"You have presented a number of proposals as to how we should increase our solidarity and also how the role of the EU as a mediator in conflicts that affect us, in particular between Russia and Ukraine, can be strengthened."
"You also talked about Desertec."
"I believe both projects are important, as they differ in terms of their timescales."
"We also need to consider - and that would be a task for your successor, whether that is you or someone else - how we in Europe, on the one hand, can be in favour of a number of large projects, such as Nabucco and Desertec, while at the same time advocating the decentralisation of some of our electricity and energy production."
"There are currently a number of industrial projects under development - which are also industry-driven - which enable consumers and even households to become more involved with a type of energy production that brings energy security."
"This ranges from smart meters on the one hand to actual production by individual households."
"In this regard, Europe's approach could be to say 'yes, of course we need an external supply, we need security of supply and large, innovative projects like Desertec, but we must also ensure that the people, the companies and enterprises as well as individual households can have greater control over their energy budgets and energy consumption in terms of price, the economy and the environment'."
"on behalf of the ALDE group. - (NL) Mr President, it is an honour, as a newly elected Member, to address this plenary session for the first time."
"I do so also as a former member of the Lower House of the Dutch parliament and Deputy President of Liberal International, as I aim to see European politics, national politics and international politics as one."
"In the field of energy, in particular, there is, of course, a direct connection between these forms of politics."
"Mr President, when it comes to our position, Europe's position, in the world, we are currently open to blackmail."
"We are dependent on unstable regions and countries with undemocratic regimes."
"This has to stop."
"That is why my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, supports Nabucco and Desertec, and I would like to draw attention to the major role that the former parliamentary leader of my national party, Mr Van Aartsen, has played in this project."
"Mr President, there are two points that I want to make."
"I am pleased that the Commission accepts that business has an important role to play."
"It cannot be just the authorities - national government, Europe or international bodies - that are involved in energy."
"Business emphatically does have a role to play."
"Secondly, Mr President, we in this House should not accept taboos such as those on looking into nuclear power again, as part of our energy mix."
"This also applies to Europe in international relations."
"Nuclear power, nuclear fusion and nuclear fission are of vital importance."
"There are major problems in relation to waste, but we must ensure that we allow research and development and knowledge exchange to play their part in this regard."
"Nuclear power has a major role to play because it will help combat the greenhouse effect."
"Once again, my group, too, does not have a definitive view here."
"We, too, need to open up this discussion again, but we must not declare nuclear power a taboo in this House."
"I would therefore like to hear the Commission's opinion on this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we are talking today about external energy security policy, we are, of course, aware of one particular fundamental truth, which has already been mentioned by Mr Piebalgs, and that is that the crucial front line in terms of energy independence is within the European Union."
"To put it more precisely, if we could introduce low energy standards or zero energy standards for our buildings then we would save more natural gas than Nabucco, South Stream and Nord Stream combined could import."
"It is important that our resolution states that the cost-effective options of renewable energy, the energy efficiency strategy and energy saving in particular must be a central part of this policy."
"If that is the case, then no additional nuclear power will be needed at all, in our opinion."
"Secondly, an important message in this resolution is that we need a common external energy security policy for the EU, which is something that we do not have at the moment."
"This policy should include the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy within the framework of a neighbourhood policy and a common position to be taken by the EU in negotiations with the transit countries."
"The Commission should make sure that it has sufficient capacity for this, as called for by Parliament two years ago in its resolution on this issue."
"In our view, Nabucco is a high priority project, because it would strengthen our independence in terms of energy, particularly with regard to Russia, although I agree with Mr Kasoulides when he said that there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered in this regard."
"However, it is a pity that some Member States, through their promotion of the South Stream project, which is openly competing with Nabucco, have been undermining the policy of energy independence."
"With regard to energy policy, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also believe it is important not to forget human rights and to neglect the human rights dialogue when we discuss energy."
"When we broaden our perspective to include Desertec or even the Arctic - as we do in our resolution - it is also important that we do this in a spirit of partnership rather than neo-colonialism."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I have three brief points to make."
"Firstly, complacency over energy policy is putting us increasingly in the dangerous position of dependency on Russia."
"Where possible it clearly makes sense to coordinate our response, but any unified EU policy would inevitably be skewed by those countries that are already in bed with Gazprom and related interests."
"And we should not be handing yet another area of vital national interest to the European Commission, which sees every possible crisis as an opportunity to extend its competence."
"Needless to say, many of us will vote against any endorsement of the Lisbon Treaty or further efforts to take forward political integration on the back of the various energy concerns of our countries."
"Secondly, diversification of sources of supply requires greater commitment to Nabucco."
"For the success of this pipeline, Turkish cooperation is essential, yet the opening of the energy chapter in EU negotiations with Turkey is being blocked."
"What are the Council and Commission doing to resolve this unhelpful situation?"
"Thirdly, I notice the word 'nuclear' does not appear in the resolution."
"Clearly, sustainable, diverse sources of energy supply require a greater commitment to nuclear energy and in that respect I agree with our colleague Mr van Baalen."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, energy security is quite rightly on the external policy agenda today."
"However, instead of securing power and influence and the last reserves of fossil fuels, instead of insisting on giving priority to dependency, we are, in my opinion, facing completely different challenges when it comes to establishing a sustainable energy policy."
"Firstly, there needs to be a global switch to more renewable sources of energy, more energy efficiency and energy saving."
"In other words, we do not need disputes about external energy policy - and certainly not if that is all we are going to do - but rather we need intelligently-provided, affordable energy for everyone."
"Secondly, energy security must be part of a responsible peace and development policy for the EU."
"Access to energy is vital for every individual, for economic development and for the fight against poverty."
"A project like Desertec must not therefore be a way of using energy policy as a means to continue colonialism."
"What will the people of the African countries, where the population is growing and energy requirements are rising, get from this?"
"Why have they not up to now been involved on an equal footing in the planning and decision-making processes?"
"The global energy supply is also part of crisis prevention and peace policies."
"This approach is also lacking in the European Union's relations with the South Caucasus and Central Asia."
"As energy suppliers - for example Nabucco - these countries are becoming of more and more interest to the EU, but I see no conflict prevention and sustainable development concept at a local level in these countries."
"It is time that the EU put an end to an external energy policy that merely increases competition for oil and gas reserves or extends nuclear technology."
"Genuine partnerships for renewable energy and for decentralised supply are what is needed now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know for certain that demand for energy will increase and that European gas production is on a steady decline."
"It is crucial for the Member States, and therefore Europe, to implement policies to ensure an abundant, secure supply."
"Diversifying the sources and the transport networks fulfils this requirement."
"On that basis, no competition exists between the various projects under way, such as, for example, Nabucco and South Stream."
"These diversification policies have also meant that, over the last few years, Europe has become less dependent on the main suppliers."
"For example, the supply of Russian gas to Europe has gone down from 75% in 1990 to 45% today."
"The Nabucco project is therefore fine, and the South Stream project is fine."
"Until Europe has a single, common energy policy, Italy has not only the right but also the duty to take action in every way possible, from energy saving to nuclear ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) On 13 July in Ankara, at the time of signing the Nabucco agreement, Mr Barroso said that the gas pipelines were made from steel."
"However, Nabucco is 'cementing' relations between the people involved in this venture, establishing a strategic link between the European Union and Turkey."
"Prime Minister Putin said that anyone can lay as many rusty iron pipes in the ground as they want, but they will need something to fill them up with. It is precisely the uncertainty about sources that is the biggest concern with this project."
"The only thing for sure is that the EUR 8 billion investment will be a good deal for those involved in it."
"In actual fact, just like the concerns caused by Ukraine, the transit country for the Russian delivery, Turkey may similarly cause problems."
"There are also many of us who do not agree with establishing a concrete link between Turkey and the European Union."
"What is Desertec all about?"
"North Africa, revolving mirrors, solar cells, continuous-current transmission and meeting 15% of energy requirements."
"At the moment, this is much more of a mirage than a realistic plan."
"Desertec will not be the main course on the European Union consumers' menu."
"It is much more likely to be just a very expensive dessert."
"This is why I am suggesting that we get involved in research into increasing the safety of nuclear energy, because this type of energy is clean and cheap as well."
"This is a serious consideration because energy security stops with the consumer, or rather the bill and whether he can pay it."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, energy is a vital lifeline for the whole of society, for individuals and for the economy."
"It is therefore important for us in Europe to find common solutions, although it is certainly right for the energy mix to remain a national responsibility."
"This means that during our joint deliberations we do not need to fight over nuclear energy, low-carbon energy and other types of energy, where my opinions differ from those of Mr Bütikofer, for example."
"However, we must try to reach a common position where the external aspects of energy security are concerned."
"As regards internal policy, I fully agree with the Commissioner that the issues of renewable energy and energy saving, for example, are more important, as is research into new possibilities."
"However, in order to reduce our dependence on external suppliers, we need to diversify."
"Desertec and Nabucco are important instruments in this regard."
"We also need to negotiate with Russia in connection with issues relating to the partnership and cooperation agreements and energy security now that Russia - wrongly, not rightly - has withdrawn from the energy charter."
"This is also an important task for us."
"However, we must recognise that we are dealing with countries that are not necessarily reliable and that, unfortunately, we cannot make a distinction between reliable and unreliable countries."
"We must therefore counter supplier power with the consumer power of the European Union."
"Interconnectivity, the issue of common gas stores - these things are important to ensure that the supply to any individual country cannot be shut off."
"If we all help each other, we will be so strong that no one will be able to disconnect us."
"That is the crucial point that we need to get across here."
"In this regard, we must also make it clear that private investments are necessary, because the situation will be impossible without them."
"Much has already been done, but our overarching common security interest must be brought into line with economic interests in order to achieve the best possible solution."
"That should not be seen as a contradiction."
"I believe that we will then indeed find an appropriate solution."
"It means that matters relating to competition law also need to be considered here, and by that I mean that it should not be the power of large suppliers, for example Gazprom or even other companies ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, I want to highlight the timeliness of this motion for a resolution and also welcome the effort made by all groups to achieve a joint motion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in order to prevent the reoccurrence of the situation of helplessness suffered by many of our citizens when Russia decided to cut off the gas supply through Ukraine, it is clearly vitally important to maximise the diversification of energy sources and gas transport."
"In this respect, we urgently need to build new gas pipelines, which, like Nabucco and other projects, will help to improve security of supply in Central Europe."
"However, to ensure a supply in all European Union countries, these efforts must be supplemented by supplies from the south of the continent."
"Having said this, I want to underline, as the Commissioner has already done, another dimension to this problem."
"The recent crisis showed us that the EU did not lack gas stocks, but rather transmission capacity."
"That is why it is important to focus our efforts on improving interconnections within the EU."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you should believe me when I say that there is a great deal of room for improvement in this situation."
"I will give you the example of my country."
"As you know, Spain could become an important transit axis for Europe, thanks to its connection with Algeria via the Medgaz pipeline, which is already in an advanced stage of construction, and its six liquefied natural gas plants, whose capacity could be doubled if another emergency situation were to occur."
"However, Spain cannot help without improving its interconnection capacity through the Pyrenees."
"Lastly, we should be aware that the construction of major infrastructures is only one part, albeit an important part, of the EU's security of supply policy."
"This security also particularly depends on energy saving and the use of renewable energies."
"It is in this context that we regard as vital our cooperation with the North African countries in the development of renewable energies."
"This is linked to my call to reinforce the supply from southern Europe."
"As a result, Commissioner, the Mediterranean Solar Plan, led by the Union for the Mediterranean, is an attractive idea that we in this Parliament want to support."
"Mr President, we have three great challenges in this area - security of energy supply, the inefficiency of our internal market in energy and the imperative of combating climate change."
"Desertec and Nabucco are central to meeting these challenges."
"If we succeed in developing high-voltage solar thermal power in North Africa, we can give a sense of purpose to the Union for the Mediterranean, we can assist in water provisioning in the countries on the southern Mediterranean rim and we can develop electricity generation technology, for which there is a massive world market."
"If we can convince Member States of the political need for greater energy independence, and stop Berlin and Paris from undercutting it at every turn, Nabucco can help us diversify our supply of oil and gas."
"The motion for a resolution before us today says little about what we need to do here in the European Union."
"We need to develop renewable energy production - solar thermal and other."
"We need to build high-voltage DC electricity distribution capacity through a smart grid - some EUR 50 billion of investment, but creating many jobs - and we need oil and gas storage facilities and, even more, a storage policy to reduce our dangerous dependence on Russia."
"Our energy provision will continue to rely on oil and nuclear power but, as we prepare for the World Climate Change conference in Copenhagen, the only big idea is the switch to renewables."
"Wind could meet all the new electricity demand in China in the next 20 years and replace 23% of their coal generation."
"Deserts get more energy from the sun in six hours than humankind uses in a year."
"Commissioner, you said this is not part of our strategy for security of energy supply."
"Well, it should be, and it must be."
"Mr President, energy security is for us to a large extent a question of energy independence, as many have said, and, as Mr Piebalgs said correctly, the most effective strategy is that of efficiency, savings and renewables."
"But we, as Greens, are also realistic and realise that, in the medium term, we will need gas supplies."
"Therefore, we are in favour of diversification and also see the Nabucco project as a European priority project."
"But let me say why we do not believe that a nuclear strategy is a strategy of independence, certainly not of energy independence."
"After all, uranium is imported, and not only from countries we like."
"And, if we speak about security, we have to mention the security implications of nuclear energy, namely nuclear proliferation, and we see the problems that we have with that in other very high-profile security issues."
"We cannot neglect that, and we cannot say that nuclear energy is completely separate from the question of nuclear proliferation."
"In addition, our group strongly believes that all projects have to address concerns about transparency and corruption and cannot stand in the way of a frank and strict human rights dialogue with the cooperation countries, as well as a holistic and political approach to these countries."
"(PL) From the moment when the agreements on the construction of the Nabucco and South Stream projects were signed, a great race began."
"Time will tell whether Nabucco will play its part in the European Union's foreign and security policy."
"That is why I am surprised at the European Commission's policy towards Russia with regard to this matter."
"The Commission is gravely mistaken in thinking that South Stream is not a rival project to Nabucco."
"The Commission is wrong not to react to Gazprom's further encroachment onto the European energy market."
"Moreover, the Commission is wrong to agree tacitly to the implementation of Gazprom's projects in the Baltic and the Black Sea."
"Nabucco will only be successful if it receives long-term political guarantees."
"That is why we need active policies in Central Asia, in the Black Sea region."
"Creating links, in terms of the energy sector, between these countries and Europe will strengthen their sovereignty, improve European security and perhaps even open the door to the reforms we anticipate will take place."
"If Afghanistan constitutes a test for NATO, then energy security is certainly a test of the European Union's mettle and maturity."
"The success of these plans depends solely on our political will."
"Amendments to the treaties are a lesser issue."
"(FR) Mr President, the independence of our region's energy supply and the security of energy installations and consumers ought not to go hand in hand with defiance of the interests of the peoples of the gas-producing countries and the transit countries, otherwise we risk generating conflict."
"Competition between gas pipeline projects is not only a source of trouble, but is also a factor in tensions in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia."
"Removing gas and other energy sources from the serious problems caused by the speculative markets, through tariff agreements that respect the producer countries and the transit countries, and that provide security to European consumers, would make it possible to guarantee security all round."
"That could be the task of a European Energy Agency supervised by Parliament and the Council, whose sole policies would be cooperation and promoting the public interest."
"Why, then, do we have the feeling, in this case, that commercial interests prevail over the interests of the European people?"
"I would also like to issue an official warning to the Commission to avoid the temptation of using the Nabucco project as a Trojan horse for obtaining Turkey's accession to the EU by forcible means."
"Respect for secularity, for women's rights and for the rights of the Kurdish people, as well as acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide, must remain the criteria by which Turkey's potential accession is decided."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, you are known for your pragmatism and sense of realism, but I would say with all due respect that I do not see the Nabucco pipeline as final or as quite such a given."
"Having examined the capacity of this pipeline, we have established that, in order for it to be viable and efficient, it needs 31 billion cubic metres of gas a year."
"You have just returned from Azerbaijan and you feel certain that it is a supply country."
"Azerbaijan promises everyone gas."
"Where it will find the gas to fill the pipeline is a question which continues to distress the countries involved in the Nabucco pipeline."
"So far, Baku is saying 'I'll give you all gas', but it is not in a position to guarantee even its safe transit."
"As for Iran, to which you referred Commissioner, it will have stormy and possibly explosive relations with the European Union for a long time before it becomes a gas supplier."
"The international energy market is saying that Russia is behind the Azeris and that we shall find ourselves face to face with them."
"My question is, before you commit financially, can you please secure our supplier?"
"(DE) Mr President, Nabucco was Giuseppe Verdi's first hugely successful opera."
"In harmony with the new Italian-Russian remix, South Stream, the energy project of that name is, however, in danger of being scrapped."
"When we consider that a supposed member of the Green party like Joschka Fischer has signed a lobbying contract for a six-figure sum, then the entire composition sounds more like a pointless pop song aimed at a limited market than a symphony of sustainability and economy."
"Over the next few years, electricity produced from solar energy will become significantly cheaper."
"The entire investment could be used to generate a total of 8 000 megawatts of wind energy."
"If natural gas fields in Iran and Iraq are also to be closed to Europe, then we will probably experience the same fate as Verdi himself, as he did not find peace for years after his Nabucco project either."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being very clear in your explanation of the current situation in relation to Nabucco and its potential and viability - seemingly in the short term, according to what you said - and also for the information on the Desertec project."
"There can be no doubt that the Sun is an extraordinary source of energy."
"Converting this energy into energy that can be used by people is an area which has seen major developments in the last 20 years."
"However, there is also no doubt that we still have a way to go before the full potential and viability of this source can be technologically assured, particularly in projects such as the Desertec project which we are now discussing."
"This project is very welcome and we must therefore support it and keep moving forward in order to solve the technological problems."
"However, I must really draw your attention to the fact that, when talking about energy efficiency, and particularly about security of supply and therefore diversification of energy sources, one particular energy source is ignored to a certain extent."
"I am of course talking about nuclear energy."
"This energy source is systematically being discriminated against, because it does not fit with what is happening in many EU countries or with global trends or with mankind's current energy needs."
"This situation must be turned on its head."
"We must adopt an attitude of considering all possible energy sources in terms of the role that they can play."
"Here in this Parliament we cannot so obviously turn our backs on this reality."
"(BG) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is no coincidence that the issue of energy policy and energy security comes up quite often in this House, particularly following the situation early this year when several members of the European Union were virtually left without gas supplies."
"This was probably the breaking point in relations between the European Commission and the Member States as a whole regarding this issue."
"What we are now discussing is not so much the technical questions and details of developing energy policy within the European Union as the external aspects of energy security and the European Union's development in this sphere, because at the end of the day there are two sides to this issue."
"It is, after all, an important question, as it ultimately affects every single citizen."
"We must be clearly aware of this when discussing Nabucco, which is undoubtedly one of the highest-priority projects in this sphere, along with Desertec."
"We must also be clearly aware that there are countries in the European Union which rely not only on a single supplier, but also on a single supply route."
"I therefore cannot accept that Nabucco will pose a challenge to projects such as South Stream and, to some extent, Nord Stream, whose aim is to supply gas directly from Russia to a European Union Member State, thereby ensuring that the European Union is not dependent on transit supplies through countries which are both politically and economically unstable."
"In this respect, the European Commission is right to declare that there is no challenge posed, and that we have to try to integrate all these separate projects into a common strategy where, I stress, Nabucco is obviously a major priority."
"We expect the Commission to come up with its own proposal for increasing gas reserves within the European Union, which is very important, and for developing an interconnection system between Member States with a higher capacity, which is also a very important element in guaranteeing security both for citizens and for business in the European Union."
"We should not, of course, underestimate the issue of energy efficiency, which is another important element in our policy of guaranteeing energy security for the European Union."
"Mr President, I want to thank the Commissioner for reminding this House that there is also a demand side to energy security."
"The decision to take incandescent light bulbs off the European market will save the equivalent of the annual electricity generation of Finland."
"This autumn we are seeking agreement with the Council on a package of energy efficient measures."
"Forty per cent of the energy we use is consumed in buildings, so it matters a great deal for the future of energy security that we set high standards of efficiency for both new and existing buildings."
"I hope that Member States in the Council will support the Parliament's proposals, which are designed to put a stop to the utter waste of energy which is currently used in heating, cooling and lighting."
"If nothing else, Ministers should support those proposals out of self-interest because it will considerably ease their job and their responsibility of keeping the lights on and the gas flowing."
"Mr President, we have three main concerns with Nabucco."
"The project is being developed too slowly and in a lacklustre way, and we do not like the Commission's position, reiterated by Mr Landaburu a week ago, which stated that the Commission is neutral between South Stream and Nabucco."
"The Commission should be in favour of Nabucco."
"Secondly, we wish the Commission to become more active vis-à-vis those Member State governments that time and again seek to gain a competitive edge and advantages at the expense of other Member States."
"I will not mention those countries today other than to say that one has a capital called Rome."
"If we do not move quickly with Nabucco we will witness unpleasant events similar to those in Hungary where the Surgutneftegas company obtained a critical amount of shares in the Hungarian company MOL."
"A similar situation also prevails in Baumgarten, Austria."
"Otherwise, Mr Commissioner, we wish you good luck in creating the common energy policy still missing in the EU."
"Mr President, Europe's future depends on securing energy."
"As both the Nabucco Agreement and the Desertec initiative show, Turkey is an essential gateway, and in this regard I echo Mr Van Orden's point."
"It is critical at this time to be building greater trust and deeper ties with countries who will be our energy partners, including Middle Eastern and North African states."
"In relation to many of these there is a connected development issue."
"With Desertec the mass generation of electricity from solar power is a unique opportunity for revenue generation, which must be used for the benefit of their people also."
"This opportunity must not be squandered."
"Unfortunately, some Member States - including my own - have not used the recent past to prepare a coherent energy strategy."
"My own constituency, the North West of England, has been identified as a prime area for wind power generation, and yet the UK's planning laws are an obstruction."
"Whilst we must look outward for future energy supplies, Member States must also make the best use of the resources and potential they already have."
"(PT) Mr President, I have been listening carefully and would just like to raise three issues."
"The first is: what are we actually talking about when we talk about energy security and energy?"
"Are we talking about people - people for whom we must guarantee equal access to energy and guarantee security so they are not left without energy during the winter; are we in the end talking about the power relations between great powers; or, worse still, are we using energy security and these projects, like Nabucco or Desertec, as excuses to send out messages to other regions of the world or other countries?"
"If it is to send out messages, with what moral authority are we doing so?"
"The second point I would like to make is that, whenever we speak out against non-transparent transactions by foreign entities within the European market, we ask the Commission to take immediate action."
"I would like to know how this request of ours stands in relation to non-transparent transactions on the European market by Europeans themselves."
"To finish, Mr President, I would like to make a third point."
"I just feel we have all missed a great opportunity to have a medium- and long-term policy."
"We chose the short term and, once again, we have been left with a strengthening of the interests of the internal market and of the big industrial companies."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not before time that the security of supply is recognised as a key energy policy issue."
"Unfortunately, it is not as simple as it is sometimes made to appear in political debates."
"We are talking today about two projects: Nabucco, a very tangible project that we can work on, and Desertec, an interesting project or an interesting idea or a vision and no one can yet judge precisely whether, where and how it can be put into effect."
"We need to concern ourselves with concrete matters and work on those."
"We must also promote visionary projects, but we must guard against believing that there is only one solution to any particular problem or only one strategy for solving the problems."
"Thus, the point made by many fellow Members here is absolutely right: there is not just one answer, there are many solutions to these problems."
"These include, for example, the fact that we must not allow a very intensive debate on the CO2 problem to make us increasingly dependent on gas, which then brings us problems once again because we need new pipelines."
"We must say 'yes' to the coal policy, and that is why we need new power station technology."
"We must say 'yes' to CCS, 'yes' to nuclear power and to renewable energy and 'yes' to energy saving."
"It is not a question of one thing or the other, but of doing all of these things together."
"Anything else would, in my opinion, be immoral and irresponsible and I believe we would not be doing ourselves any favours."
"This also relates to the question of the source of supply and transport routes."
"Here, too, there is not just one answer."
"Anyone who believes that they can simply rely on a debate about pipelines is mistaken, of course, for if we want fewer dependencies we must keep a variety of options open, including LNG, and set about dealing with these."
"The question then remains - and it is a very important question - as to how we ensure that the necessary capital is made available to implement the required projects."
"What is the use of wonderful plans if there is no one willing to invest in them?"
"Therefore, the way in which we pursue our energy policy and how we deal with those who we expect to invest in the projects is important."
"Companies must be encouraged."
"We must guard against believing that we can force everything to happen and predetermine every last detail."
"Last winter many solutions worked without any political decisions being taken because clever people cooperated wisely in different places and because the Commission provided helpful mediation."
"(SV) Mr President, it is, of course, unacceptable for people in Europe to be without power in the middle of winter or for people to be forced into unemployment because the industries in which they work are unable to pay the high energy prices and are therefore forced to lay people off or even close down their operations."
"It is therefore extremely important for us to take wise decisions in order to safeguard energy supplies."
"At the same time, the requirements made of the large infrastructure projects that are needed must be clear with regard to both environmental impact and the countries' independence."
"Member States must not be placed in a situation where they are at risk of being at the mercy of another state."
"The environmental impact analyses must be carried out by reliable and independent bodies before large projects are allowed to get underway."
"This of course applies to all of the large projects identified, but I would like to mention the Baltic Sea in particular, which is a large and sensitive inland sea."
"We need analyses and decisions that guarantee that the Baltic Sea will not be turned into a dead sea because we in the European Parliament did not have a sufficiently long term view and were not demanding enough when we took our decisions."
"We owe this to our children and grandchildren."
"Mr President, everyone wants energy security, so why do we not have it?"
"Maybe it is because there are 27 interpretations of what energy security means."
"Personally, I interpret it as meaning, among other things, diversifying the sources and moving away from our gas dependency on Russia."
"We do not have to look too far for evidence of this, just at some of our Member States which, being too far from Russia to have a pipeline, do not have all the problems attendant on dependency."
"I think we should focus on LNG, developing technologies, building LNG terminals and bringing gas from all over the world."
"We should also contribute to establishing a global market for LNG such as there is for oil and commodities."
"Concerning the Nabucco pipeline, I think the project should be quickly redesigned to take into consideration gas from various sources, and reconsider a shorter route which might lead from Georgia, Ukraine, under the Black Sea to Romania."
"We just have to look at the map."
"The fact that Member States have different interpretations of, or interests in, energy security is also proven by the fact that some countries involved in Nabucco have also signed up for South Stream, thereby lowering Nabucco's credibility and the chances for a common European energy policy."
"South Stream definitely means increasing dependency on Russian gas."
"(PL) Listening to my fellow speakers, I wonder whether the citizens of the European Union are doomed to merely listen to our words."
"It is something we could have tested in January of this year, during the energy crisis."
"After all, we are adopting resolutions as we all feel that the Union is not coping with the issue of energy security."
"We also note, Commissioner, that there is less interest in Nabucco among the EU Member States, although this is not the case for all energy projects."
"In the north, we have the Nord Stream project, which is a very serious move against the common foreign policy."
"In the south, there is the South Stream project."
"Here, too, the EU Member States are keen to get involved."
"However, when it comes to Nabucco, all we hear are promises, but there is neither sufficient money nor political support."
"While we are discussing the subject in Strasbourg, the cement mixers have arrived on the shores of the Baltic to work on the Nord Stream project."
"I would like to know whether I can hold supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon to their word, namely that when the Treaty is ratified, they will cease to support the Nord Stream and South Stream projects."
"Nabucco may prove to be an excellent step towards ensuring energy security."
"If we continue to merely issue statements then, during future energy crises, when we send EU citizens pamphlets containing our resolutions, they will burn them."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Piebalgs."
"His statements just now confirm that South Stream is not Nabucco's competitor but a further contribution to the diversification of Europe's energy supply sources."
"Europe's energy security is based on a variety of sources, routes and supply countries."
"At zero growth, future demand for gas is estimated at an additional 100 to 150 billion m3 by 2020."
"Based on these assumptions the development of different options is imperative, and South Stream is not an alternative to Nabucco, but in fact complements it."
"The Commission regards the southern corridor as a series of projects including Nabucco, South Stream and the Turkey-Greece-Italy interconnection (ITG)."
"The anti-Russia debate is therefore in conflict with what we will see happening over the next few years."
"The European Parliament must call for pragmatism and above all consistency in the decisions that the European Union has essentially already taken: with the European economic recovery plan, with Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks, and with the second energy security strategy."
"The diversification of sources, routes and supply countries is the real pillar of Europe's energy security policy and, leaving aside the political and economic interests of the various countries most directly involved, the South Stream-Nabucco challenge must be analysed with realism, not through the distorting prism of ideology but rather with a clear vision of what needs to be done."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, if we are to address the problem of our energy security in a reliable and viable manner, we need a global strategy which responds to the need to differentiate energy sources and adopt common rules in terms of transit countries, because our dependence on a single energy source is as bad as our dependence on a single transit country."
"We therefore need a balance and that will not be achieved either by adopting a cold-war tone of voice towards Russia, on which we are or will be energy-dependent anyway, or by supporting a single alternative pipeline, namely Nabucco, at a time when there is still uncertainty about its supply capacity and the political and economic conditions in the countries on the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus."
"As for Desertec, I agree with many of the objections formulated and I want to add this: the strategic objective of the European Union must be to gradually make ourselves independent of energy imports, not to replace imported natural gas with imported electricity from renewables."
"If we really want to become energy self-sufficient and independent in the long term, we need to promote energy efficiency and make the best possible use of renewable national energy sources."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate you on your integrated approach in this proposal."
"This diversification is very important and I would also like to concur with what my colleague Mr van Baalen said, namely that we need to consider all forms of energy, including nuclear power."
"Yet - and this is something I learnt at primary school - the Sun is the source of all energy and I believe that we must focus on the Sun in future."
"When it comes to diversification, it has to be about not only the types of energy, but also the suppliers."
"Many of you have spoken about Russia."
"So far, Russia has always supplied us when we have asked it to, but in the future it will be important to have more suppliers."
"Next, how can we guarantee energy security?"
"We can only guarantee it if we can also get our energy supply via the networks and I believe that your most important task - you have negotiated a number of obstacles, Nabucco, Desertec - in the coming years will be to realise an integrated network where the countries involved, all the EU Member States, are pulling in the same direction and are also willing to implement energy policy in an integrated way."
"You can ask institutional financiers, private investors, for the money, but I believe that you need to start working on an integrated network right away, a kind of supergrit, an induction loop for Europe capable of reaching every end-user."
"(FR) Mr President, energy is not an area over which the European Union has jurisdiction."
"Mr Piebalgs, congratulations on all that you are doing."
"Energy and access add up to war - sometimes in military terms, sometimes in political terms, and sometimes in economic terms."
"As for gas, we are going to have a gas war."
"We will not know, moreover, if gas is the cause of the war or a consequence, but in any case we will have a gas war."
"We know the figures: in the countries of the Caucasus, there are two centuries of reserves; in Russia, one century; in North Africa, half a century; in the Baltic, half a century; and in Europe, about 20 years."
"We must therefore prepare to import gas."
"Yes, Commissioner, Nabucco is a sound project, and we must support it, but we must give financial and political support to all the diverse sources of energy supply, both Nord Stream and South Stream, from the North and from the South."
"We must also rely upon our industrial companies, which are competent and fair, and which have an ethical code, but let us not be naive."
"Commissioner, I urge you to study, straight away, the proposals by certain Member States that would like us to have an operational European instrument for taking action on the gas market, that is, to create a European central buying office for gas, something which you are, moreover, doing for the Caucasus with the Caspian Development Corporation."
"With regard to Desertec, I would like to offer my congratulations."
"We know the figures: 1 km2 of desert receives the equivalent of 1.5 million barrels of oil."
"This is an excellent project for the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"We know that 0.3% of the planet's deserts could supply the entire world with energy."
"We know that we will solve our energy problems through human ingenuity and science, but in an ethical and moral way."
"Commissioner, you are doing a very good job, because we have here a Europe that produces results, a Europe that protects, and a Europe that acts."
"Well done, and please continue - you will have the support of the European Parliament."
"(LT) The 'Nabucco' gas pipeline would allow Europe to feel strong and safe."
"However, not all countries in the Caspian region are following the road to democracy and not all can be trusted."
"Much depends on relations with Turkey."
"Even if, for the time being, there is no prospect of opening the door to that country's membership of the EU, we must not push it away and not provoke anti-European feeling there."
"The Desertec project is especially significant in that it points to the future."
"When discussing energy security, too little attention is paid to renewable energy sources and, in particular, energy efficiency."
"I am pleased that this is exactly what the Commissioner underlined today."
"Financial and economic mechanisms should be established at EU level, which would encourage EU Member States and individual companies to save energy and switch to the newest and cleanest technologies and this would be a serious contribution to energy security and to combating climate change."
"(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, as a Latvian politician, I know very well what it means for a state to be energy dependent."
"Although Latvia generates about one-third of its energy needs from its own renewable resources, the remaining two-thirds of our energy balance-sheet comes predominantly from one supplier state - Russia."
"As a small country heavily dependent on energy supplies, we understand very well how expensive this dependence can be both for the end-consumer in terms of price and for the country as a whole in terms of potential political vulnerability."
"The energy balance-sheet of every European Union Member State is different, but we are all concerned by one and the same question - the security of energy supply."
"Security of supply can be achieved by diversifying sources of supply, for the more suppliers we have the less dependent are we on each individual supplier."
"Russia is an important partner for the European Union in terms of gas supplies."
"In Europe, we import in total about one-quarter of all gas consumption from Russia."
"Some countries, such as Latvia, are even wholly dependent on supplies of gas from Russia, and with every year Europe's overall dependence on supplies from that country is tending to increase."
"One of the alternative sources of supply is the projected Nabucco pipeline, which would deliver gas from Central Asian countries to Europe, via Turkey."
"I consider it very important for Parliament to give special support for this project, for it will directly strengthen our common gas supply security."
"The Nabucco pipeline, however, is only the start of the solution for our common gas supply security."
"We have to achieve a united European energy policy that would coordinate our activity across all energy issues. Thank you for your attention."
"(HU) Mr President, first of all, allow me to express my thanks that I can speak in Hungarian in this House, which allows me to greet the Vice-President in this language."
"I would like to begin by saying that, if we look back at the last five years, Commissioner Piebalgs has probably become one of the most successful commissioners for the balanced, forward-looking policies which we have jointly accepted with Parliament up until now."
"In January, at the Nabucco conference held in Budapest in Hungary, Commissioner Pielbags stated for the first time that the European Union wants to offer political and financial support to the Nabucco project."
"We will have to raise an estimated figure of some EUR 8 billion for the 3 300-kilometre pipeline."
"The two most important tasks we have ahead of us then are to find some EUR 2 billion from the European Union budget and, secondly, to draw up those conditions which will make it easier and simpler for the project to access credit, and on better terms."
"The original promise was for some EUR 30 million."
"We need to realise that we have to go further."
"I am confident that in the few months that lie ahead, the Commissioner will make every effort or leave it to the next commissioner to ensure the project's success."
"We are all very aware that in the event of an economic crisis, it is not households which bear the main brunt of current and power failures, but companies."
"We are talking, fellow Members, about those companies where our voters and our citizens work, and we are jeopardising their income by jeopardising energy security."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy security is undoubtedly a fundamental priority that must be enhanced firstly by increasing energy efficiency and diversifying the suppliers, sources and supply routes, but above all by promoting the Union's energy interests in respect of third countries."
"Now, the March European Council declared that, in order to achieve its energy security objectives, the European Union collectively, but also each of the Member States, must be prepared to combine solidarity with responsibility."
"This, in my view, is the crucial point: European energy policy must be inseparably linked to the Union's foreign policy, because, while we keep on saying that our foreign policy action will be truly effective when we speak with one voice, that is just as true for energy policy."
"Yet that is precisely the point; until that time - that is, until we are able to speak with one voice - the efforts of many governments that are involved in complex operations such as Nord Stream and South Stream must be viewed not as in conflict with support for Nabucco but as part of the same strategy, in which we combine pragmatism with realism in order to put our citizens' interests first."
"For that reason it is a definite 'Yes' from us to Nabucco, but just as definite is our decision to support the efforts made by our governments to ensure that diversification of supply guarantees the well-being of our populations."
"(RO) In 2008 the European Union posted a record commercial deficit of EUR 242 billion, mainly due to the increase in the price of imported energy."
"The Nabucco project pipeline will pass through Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria and will provide the European Union with an annual supply of 30 billion cubic metres of natural gas from the Caspian Sea."
"The EUR 200 million allocated to the European economic recovery plan are insufficient."
"We call on the European Union to supplement the funds allocated significantly."
"Desertec will use solar power from North Africa and will also include the implementation of a Mediterranean plan for capturing solar power and the construction of an electricity transmission network, which will link the European Union with the Middle East and North Africa."
"The EU must invest more in the diversification of energy supply sources."
"As rapporteur for matters relating to the energy performance of buildings, I call on the EU to provide innovative financial instruments to boost the investments in the use of renewable energy sources and in improving energy efficiency, especially for buildings and in the transport sector."
"(RO) Nabucco will provide for a large part of the European Union's demand for gas."
"However, what is even more important about this is the political aspect: it will eliminate our dependence on a single source."
"The recurring crises have highlighted that the current situation, with Russia as a single source and Ukraine as the only transit country, does not provide any security for Europe's economy and citizens."
"The development of new energy supply routes must be just as important as developing relations with Russia."
"The delay in launching the Nabucco project has been due, unfortunately, to the individual interests of certain Member States."
"Member States must realise that it is not only the countries which the pipeline passes through or the commercial companies involved which will enjoy the benefits of this project, but all Europe's citizens whose national governments must guarantee their well-being and safety."
"The mistakes which have led to this project being delayed must not be repeated in relation to securing sources of gas."
"There are countries in the region, such as Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iraq and Iran, which want to supply the gas pipeline with their reserves."
"The Commission must repeat what it has done for the intergovernmental agreement, which is take part in the subsequent negotiations and reach a positive outcome as quickly as possible."
"If we do not get on and do it, others will, and I am very sure that it will not be in the interest of Europe's citizens."
"(ES) Mr President, given the EU's dependence on external energy supplies, securing its supply is an issue which must always form part of the EU's external policy."
"In addition, all predictions agree that energy demand in the world will increase significantly over the next 25 years."
"Here in Europe, we have to reduce our high dependence on Russian gas, particularly following the crises in recent years."
"There is also a clear strategy in Russia to secure its dominance in Europe over the gas sector."
"That is why we have projects such as Nord Stream, Blue Stream II and also South Stream."
"We therefore need to diversify in terms of suppliers and routes."
"That is the reason for the interest in Nabucco, which will give access to Azerbaijani and Iraqi gas, and also to gas from Turkmenistan, thus reinforcing our energy relations with Central Asia, which is an increasingly important region."
"I am therefore delighted about the agreement reached last July, as reported by the Commissioner, and also the explicit support given to Nabucco by President Barroso in the political guidelines that he recently presented."
"I know that there are doubts about the viability of Nabucco, but I also had doubts about the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which is now a reality."
"I must stress that the countries around the southern rim of the Mediterranean also have an important role to play in the supply of gas to Europe."
"The main country in this respect is Algeria, which is an important supplier of gas to my country and to Italy."
"We must ensure that the work on the Medgaz pipeline is quickly completed."
"I also want to highlight countries such as Egypt and Libya in terms of gas supplies."
"To sum up, energy issues must be a priority in the Euro-Mediterranean relationship, to the benefit of both sides."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon includes energy as a shared responsibility and lays down that one of the EU's energy policy objectives will be to guarantee the security of energy supplies."
"This really encourages us to move forward with developing an increasingly essential common foreign policy on energy, as stressed by the motion for a resolution to be adopted today."
"I will end by saying that this is a difficult objective, as proven by our failure in Europe, in the European Union, to achieve a true internal market in energy, because we do not even have the necessary interconnections."
"That is why I am delighted about the commitments made in this respect in the document mentioned by President Barroso."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, as my fellow Members have just said, the recent gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine demonstrates the urgent need to increase the European Union's energy security and independence."
"The European Union is still too dependent, particularly on its gas imports, since by 2020 it will probably have to import approximately 80% of its gas."
"This situation cannot continue, because if it does it will permanently jeopardise the European Union's energy security."
"Clearly, the infrastructure projects in progress, which you have just alluded to, are a step in the right direction."
"The recent gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine is already several months behind us."
"Commissioner, what about the coming winter?"
"It is absolutely vital for those who have experienced shortages and those who fear them in the future to know how Europe will protect them from these possible new crises."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present resolution makes clear once again the need to develop a consistent European foreign policy, including from the point of view of the security of energy supply."
"A lot has already been said today regarding Nabucco and Desertec."
"As regards diversification of the sources of supply, I would like to draw your attention to a neighbouring region which up to now has been characterised by stability and reliability in supplying Europe and which also has a huge exploitation potential and will become more accessible as a result of climate change."
"I am talking about the Arctic region."
"Here there is, on the one hand, an existing tradition of pragmatic cooperation, including with Russia, for example, and, on the other hand, the EU as such does not currently have a presence there, unlike Russia, the US, Canada and even China."
"In order to secure the long-term interests of Europe in this region too, I would therefore argue in favour of developing a pragmatic, long-term strategy, together with partners such as Norway and Iceland, with the aim of cooperating with Russia, the US and Canada to balance the various interests there, not only with regard to the common security of supply, but also environmental issues and access to the new ice-free transport routes."
"This will also avoid the potential conflicts which could otherwise arise there in the rush to secure the energy sources that are still available."
"(NL) Mr President, Turkey has an important role to play in reducing Europe's dependence on Russia."
"The question now is what price Europe is prepared to pay Turkey."
"In the meantime, Turkey is playing two hands and is seeking to benefit both from the Nabucco project and from South Stream."
"It is not in Europe's interests."
"I call on the Council and the Commission to make an unambiguous choice for the Nabucco project."
"This project would directly reduce our dependence on Russia and, given the slow decline in the demand for gas in Europe, it is in any case totally unnecessary to realise two southern supply routes."
"Turkey must nail its colours to the mast and put its weight fully behind the Nabucco project."
"The negotiations with Turkey on this topic should, however, be kept strictly separate from the country's accession negotiations."
"It should not be the case that Turkey receives an entry ticket for the Union in exchange for being cooperative."
"(PL) The European Union needs suppliers whose business dealings remain transparent and who fulfil their obligations."
"The Energy Charter and the Transit Protocol are an attempt to establish a system based on clear principles."
"Russia's recent indication of its desire to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty should be viewed as a warning."
"It should be a warning for companies investing in Russia, as well as for the Commission."
"It should also encourage the Commission to take action, as soon as possible, to create a European energy security system."
"We can only hope that Russia will respect the Charter and will not take any definitive action."
"The European Union's internal gas market has to operate without any restrictions, allowing cross-border connections and gas networks."
"European gas consumers cannot be left at the mercy of monopolies."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much liked what the Commissioner described here today with regard to the Desertec project."
"This project has huge potential and its appeal indeed lies in the fact that it is made up of many separate small projects."
"This will create jobs and will prepare the way for the environmentally sound industrial policy that we are striving for."
"I have a question for the Commission."
"When you were talking about the Desertec project, I had the feeling that the handbrake was on to some extent."
"What concrete measures are planned with regard to network infrastructure, which is a massive problem in connection with the development of renewable energy?"
"The idea is, of course, to transmit the electricity to Europe via high voltage direct current lines from the deserts."
"What supporting measures can the European Commission take with regard to this?"
"Is something already being considered in this regard?"
"What can we expect from the next Commission in this area?"
"Mr President, the ECR Group supports the need for an EU common external energy security policy based on solidarity between Member States, but energy mix must remain a Member State competence."
"We must, of course, diversify away from overdependence on Russian oil and gas, of which even the UK, traditionally dependent on the North Sea and Norwegian gas, is now an importer."
"We must develop the southern corridor and should consider the White Stream project, in addition to the Nabucco project, as a priority, but also with trans-Caspian and even trans-Saharan routes as exciting future prospects for the European Union."
"We need better gas-storage capacity in Europe and more integration of our pipeline and electricity grids."
"In the UK we are keen on new nuclear power stations as well."
"I welcome investment in renewables, including the Desertec solar project, which combat climate change as well as aid diversification."
"We also need better energy efficiency - though the recent EU ban on incandescent light bulbs is draconian, ignores the health hazards to the skin and the environment from the mercury, and makes the EU needlessly unpopular in my country."
"(ES) Mr President, the predictions indicate that, between now and the year 2030, gas consumption in the European Union will increase by more than 40% and that our own internal production will fall."
"This means that demand will not be met, even with all the projects currently in hand."
"As a result, we need all possible sources of supply, and we particularly need to coordinate all the actions of the Member States in order to optimise their contribution to our joint needs."
"The South Stream and Nabucco projects involve very important economic, energy, historical and political aspects."
"We must consider these very carefully, with great intelligence, and remain mindful of the concerns and needs of all the countries affected."
"Many of the problems that we are now suffering could be solved if we, firstly, decisively coordinated the actions of all Member States, if we built more liquefied gas terminals, if we improved the internal market and if, once again, we spoke with one voice."
"Mr President, I welcome the text put forward today by the various political groups and the earlier statement by the Commissioner, particularly the recognition of the need to diversify our energy technology and to secure our supply."
"But of course there is no one answer to ensuring our supply."
"All technologies must be considered."
"There has to be a mix, including CCS, and, of course, where I come from is Wales, which still has a plentiful supply of coal."
"Energy efficiency must also be improved."
"That is why I believe we should be spending more of European Structural Funds on energy efficiency measures to save energy, but also to boost the economy."
"I would also like to make two further quick points."
"Firstly, on Desertec, which I believe is an exciting project, but we have to recognise that it is a long-term project."
"It is not a quick fix."
"Secondly, the storage of gas reserves is important, but again we need to recognise that it is expensive and funding will be required."
"So, I support all the texts put forward today, particularly by the S&D Group, but these are important points and I would welcome the views of the Commissioner on those points."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a decision mentions that the Russian company Surgutneftgaz, whose ownership is unclear, recently acquired a major stake in the Hungarian oil company MOL."
"I would like to say something more about this."
"I personally submitted a written question to the Commissioner following this transaction."
"He stated in his reply that he considered legitimate our demand to provide stronger protection for European energy companies against external acquisitions lacking any transparency."
"This is good news."
"We must also add that the current regulations are unsuitable for achieving this objective."
"However, regulations on transparency can be easily circumvented."
"This is why we are asking the European Commission to abandon its convenient position of idle introspection."
"It should draw up, in cooperation with governments, the legal framework for providing effective protection against hostile takeovers."
"Mr President, the open market is a joint European achievement."
"Let us not make ourselves vulnerable precisely on this issue."
"(SL) It seems that the 'catch-the-eye' system is working well and I am happy to hear that that is the case."
"We need a secure and diversified supply."
"We all agree on that."
"However, I think that too much of our discussion today has centred on a single issue: on warnings of a Russian threat."
"Such talk can have no constructive consequences for Europe and I think that we would be much better served if we developed a partnership with Russia."
"I would also be grateful if Commissioner Piebalgs could let us know what progress has been made in the dialogue on energy security, on improving our relations with Russia and on the implementation of democratic standards, which is something to which we would like Russia to pay greater attention."
"(PL) In September 2007, on the basis of the decision of the European Parliament and the Council in 2006 and with regard to the matter of - amongst other things - the Nabucco gas pipeline, a European coordinator for the project was appointed, namely Mr Josias Van Aartsen."
"In 2009, he presented an interesting report, which contained equally interesting conclusions."
"One of these conclusions concerned the difficulties that may be encountered when implementing the Nabucco project."
"Even the current levels of funding point to this fact."
"I would like to ask whether you think that, notwithstanding your personal interest in the matter, the appointment of a coordinator for the implementation of the Nabucco project might make its implementation more efficient, so that we may be sure that what we are discussing today, and what the Member States - including my country, Poland - also expect to happen, will have a 100% chance of becoming a reality."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it would be difficult for me to answer all the questions raised, but I would like to emphasise a couple of points."
"First of all, the policies we follow in the energy sector seek to promote the wellbeing of our citizens and our industry."
"What we are looking for is a secure supply of well-priced and clean energy."
"This is our overarching goal."
"Secondly, we never make any side deals when we are discussing energy agreements."
"There are no compromises either on enlargement or on human rights."
"We work from the point of view that interdependence in energy supply is the most important thing and is beneficial for all - for suppliers, transit countries and consumers."
"It takes time to convince our partners, but that is the only way to achieve stability."
"Thirdly, even if it sometimes seems that we are slow, I think that basing ourselves on the industry proposals, and on support for industry, is crucial because that makes us strong."
"Perhaps it does not make us a speedboat in the energy ocean, but it makes for stability."
"When we make a change, we have a much broader basis for it, so we are much safer."
"All the projects have been well checked for cost efficiency and future viability."
"So I believe that is the right support to give."
"The next area where we have a weakness, and which we are continuing to discuss, is external energy policy and coherence."
"It is true that there is a lot of controversy - or at least perceived controversy - and, as a Commissioner, I would definitely be happy to see a more coherent external energy policy."
"The motion for a resolution addresses exactly this issue because, although there is no in-built conflict between Member States, there is perceived conflict."
"All the activities pursued by the Member States also benefit the European Union."
"So we should follow this up and really try to build a system where we speak with one voice, not only verbally but also in terms of the points of view that we want to emphasise."
"For this reason the second strategic energy review is still very important."
"All the points that we put forward in the second energy review are still there."
"At the same time, from the Commission's point of view, we clearly see that we cannot afford to move from interdependence to dependence."
"That is why we particularly support diversification projects like Nabucco and LNG - not that they completely change our relationship of interdependence with other countries, but they give us additional safety margins."
"So that is what we are doing, but at the same time we definitely take note of what happens in the energy world."
"Regarding the point on nuclear energy, we have moved away from this option."
"We have adopted a Nuclear Safety Directive but it is very much a national and very sensitive point."
"I really believe that, from the Union point of view, we should build upon the cooperation of nuclear safety regulators and try to establish a safer and more coherent system."
"But I doubt that we could go further than that."
"Last but not least, I really believe that these issues and debates very much help to shape energy policy, but there is no single instrument that provides for it."
"There are many instruments, and we will come back to this debate in the future."
"Thank you very much for this debate."
"I will be very happy also to answer questions in the ITRE Committee, or in any other committees that would like to discuss energy issues in more detail."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received six motions for a resolution which have been submitted in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome the progress that has been made through the signing of the agreement in Ankara launching the Nabucco project and the protocol to the agreement for launching the Desertec project."
"The Nabucco project must be made a priority as it provides a solution to the gas supply problem, which has intensified in recent years."
"I know that, although Nabucco is a project which is just as important from a geopolitical perspective, the project's partners must also have, at the same time, strong commercial motives so that it becomes a reality as quickly as possible."
"The economic crisis, which has reduced the money that the participating companies have available for investment, along with a number of uncertainties linked to the sources supplying the pipeline are obstacles which must be overcome."
"The EUR 200 million we are offering the project are welcome, but we also need to step up political and diplomatic measures with Turkey and the countries in the region supplying the gas."
"I would therefore like to call for a show of solidarity by Member States in order to be able to avert gas crises similar to those that we have had in recent years."
"We cannot wait for the Treaty of Lisbon to come into force and the Nabucco project to be completed while Europeans are running the risk of remaining without gas in the middle of winter as a result of disputes between Russia and Ukraine."
"in writing. - (BG) Unfortunately the EU still does not have an effective energy security policy."
"In recent years the first steps have been taken in this direction, for which I would in particular like to congratulate Commissioner Piebalgs. Bulgaria has also contributed in this respect."
"However, these processes are still too slow, particularly in the light of the particularly dynamic activity on the part of Russia and other competitors."
"We need a much clearer and more active policy which must include some of the following strands:"
"encouraging the completion of all projects involving the supply of gas to Europe, which can realistically secure market-based funding, including the Nord Stream and South Stream;"
"encouraging the construction of new facilities which will contribute to energy independence and reduce CO2 emissions, in particular plants powered by nuclear and renewable sources of energy;"
"developing common rules for the supply and transit of gas;"
"an active policy towards the countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus to secure supplies of Caspian gas for Europe."
", in writing. - This debate has become an additional proof of how badly the EU needs a united energy policy."
"There are Members who urge the Commission and Member States to take concrete coordinated measures in the spirit of solidarity and who propose to act like the EU already had such a policy."
"Their efforts have not only political and moral but also practical value because as representatives of the citizens they can speed up the creation of the common energy policy."
"There are others who use the absence of such a policy as an excuse to justify their bilateral deals with suppliers which often ignore the requirements of transparency and fair competition, not to mention European solidarity."
"This is a short-sighted and risky approach which plays into the hands of those undemocratic suppliers whose political strategy is to split and weaken the EU."
"The Commission should provide not only political and legal but also financial assistance to companies which are engaged in efforts to diversify our energy supplies."
"To really advance towards genuine energy solidarity, the Member States should start to inform each other and the Commission on their agreements with third partners."
"in writing. - (RO) As we are at the start of a new mandate, I feel that one of the areas where the European Parliament must be more actively involved is safeguarding energy security."
"Bearing this in mind, I want to highlight the importance of the Nabucco project, which will help safeguard the European Union's energy security as this will guarantee European consumers access to alternative sources via a secure route."
"The signing of the agreement on 13 July 2009 between Austria, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Hungary on the Nabucco project, marking the political commitment of the partner states participating in this project to continue their efforts to construct the gas pipeline, has sent a positive signal to investors and the countries supplying natural gas."
"The countries involved in this project must, along with the European Commission, continue to focus their efforts on attracting investment and guaranteeing reliable suppliers for Nabucco."
"in writing. - (RO) In addition to achieving number one position in the list of gas exporters, Russia has recently become the largest exporter of oil in the world, overtaking Saudi Arabia."
"This situation puts Moscow in a special position of influence, based on having control of these resources."
"However, energy is a commodity which must be subject to the principles of the market economy."
"It must not be possible for energy to be used as an instrument of political pressure."
"The energy crises which Europe has faced have highlighted the importance of diversification of energy supply sources."
"They have also demonstrated the added value Nabucco offers in this respect for the entire European Union."
"Romania has been and remains a strong supporter of the Nabucco project."
"In fact, Romania signed the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Nabucco project in July, along with Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria."
"We regard the conclusion of this agreement as a success and an important step forward."
"A gas pipeline of the size and ambition of Nabucco will need to face many challenges before it becomes a reality."
"The only solution for overcoming these challenges is to persevere with the appropriate measures."
"in writing. - We try hard to encourage a coherent energy policy, but such a policy exists and is fully implemented."
"There is only one small problem: it is NOT ours."
"It is Russia's."
"Now, we have the French EDF company signing into South Stream."
"Before that, we had the Russians taking over the Hungarian company MOL's interest in Nabucco."
"And before that we had the Austrian gas terminal in Baumgarten being taken over by the mysterious Centrex company."
"We need a clear, European energy policy, and we need it now."
"This is possibly our last opportunity to rally behind Nabucco."
"Otherwise, if the Council and the Commission remain neutral, they should be prepared for very cold winters and very hot politics."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to call for silence in the House because we have received news from Kabul of a very serious attack against the international peacekeeping force, and the sketchy information that we have so far talks of six deaths in the Italian contingent, among the Folgore paratroopers."
"I would therefore ask you to call for a minute's silence in the House precisely so that we may remember those who are fighting to establish our ideals of peace and freedom throughout the world."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you have just heard from Mr Mauro, a tragic incident has taken place in Afghanistan: six peacekeepers have lost their lives."
"I would kindly ask that we rise and observe a minute's silence as a mark of respect in light of this tragic incident."

"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I voted against the resolution concerning Lithuania because I found this resolution to be a premature and unbalanced reaction to a law that has not yet even entered into force, let alone in its original wording."
"It is true that human rights fall within the competence of the Union."
"However, in this case the Union comes very close to infringing the principle of sovereignty of a Member State, and that is why I have opposed this resolution, also bearing in mind that it would have a negative result on the Irish referendum as a bad example of how the sovereignty of the Member States could be treated."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted against this resolution because Lithuania will be able to deal with the problem on its own."
"The Lithuanian President has created a special group to review this legislation, which is only supposed to come into force in 2010."
"Moreover, I think that the resolution would constitute an excessive amount of interference in the affairs of a sovereign nation such as Lithuania."
"Furthermore, this resolution contains a statement to the effect that the legal opinion of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights should be requested."
"It does not fall within the remit of the Agency for Fundamental Rights to evaluate individual countries and draw up an opinion on such cases."
"It would set far too dangerous a precedent."
"(DE) Mr President, I am an enthusiastic pro-European and advocate of a European constitution as well as the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I am also a fighter for human rights."
"However, this resolution inflicts a lot of damage on Europe, particularly in the run-up to the Irish referendum, and it misuses the issue of human rights for ideological purposes."
"The Lithuanian law has nothing to do with human rights, but if anything it actually protects the human rights of Lithuanian children rather than violating them."
"I therefore consider this resolution to be an ideological disgrace."
"The Left and the Liberals in this House have caused serious damage to Europe and to human rights with this resolution."
"(NL) Mr President, our Lithuanian friends would certainly have envisaged something else for themselves."
"After liberating themselves from the yoke of the Soviet Union, they wanted to be members, as quickly as possible, of that other union, which likes to put itself forward as a unique association of free nations."
"Now, though, it seems to be once again the case that one form of guardianship has simply been replaced by another, albeit a more subtle one."
"Today, too, Lithuania is no longer free: when the Lithuanian Parliament adopts a law aimed at protecting minors, it is castigated for its trouble and shunned."
"There is not a single area that is still free of European meddling and this is something that is definitely not going to improve over the coming years."
"On the contrary, in fact, the new European Commissioner for Human Rights - what's in a name? - will reinforce this European guardianship still further."
"Thank you, Mr Verhofstadt, thank you, the other mandarins of the Commission, for the likes of this suffocation of freedom."
"Mr President, see how the thicket of EU regulation grows."
"See how Brussels shoots its tendrils into every crevasse, every nook of national life."
"Issues like this, the protection of minors, are for many of our constituents sensitive and ethical issues."
"If we in this Parliament presume to legislate for the nation states, what is the point of them?"
"Is there no limit to our presumption?"
"Let me make my position absolutely clear on this."
"When the United Kingdom had the closest equivalent to this legislation, which was called Section 28, I was virtually the only Conservative to oppose it."
"I was years before the rest of my party in pushing for full equality for gay people, including on the equalisation of the age of consent, and on civil partnerships."
"I am delighted that the rest of my party has now reached that point of view."
"But I am not a Lithuanian legislator!"
"The people who should determine this issue in Lithuania are those who are answerable through the democratic mechanisms and procedures of that country."
"If we are not prepared to allow them to do that, we might as well mothball our national parliaments, turn them into museums and lock the door."
"(DE) Mr President, the survival of many farms is in serious jeopardy."
"I am therefore pleased that we have today adopted a cross-party motion for a resolution on the crisis in the dairy farming sector."
"I deeply regret that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in drawing up this motion."
"It should be made clear that we cannot overcome this crisis with the measures proposed by the Commission alone."
"First and foremost, we must increase the consumption of milk products in order to reduce the strain on the market."
"In this regard, the promotion of sales is more important than stockpiling."
"Constructive proposals such as the use of milk powder to feed calves, establishing minimum prices for cheese products, clear labelling of cheese analogues and the use of butter fat to assist in the manufacture of ice cream and bakery products have been around for a long time."
"Why they have not, as yet, been implemented by the Commission is beyond me."
"I would urge the Commissioner to take note of the proposals in the motion for a resolution and implement them as a matter of urgency."
"- (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to explain why I abstained from voting on the crisis in the milk and dairy products sector."
"It is a sad fact that the situation in the dairy sector is extremely critical."
"Despite the fact that consumer prices have risen by 14% over recent years, the purchase price of milk has fallen by almost 40%."
"Many European dairy producers are therefore now facing ruin."
"In the Czech Republic, for example, 15 Czech dairies are clinically dead in financial terms, according to the managing director of Madeta, Mr Teplý."
"The situation must be resolved on a systematic basis, however, through long-term management of the sector, not just through short-term support measures such as subsidies, intervention purchases and support for private storage."
"This only distorts the market while not preventing price instability."
"At the same time, we must establish a level playing field for farmers from all Member States, and not just in the diary sector."
"(DE) Mr President, this proposal from the Commission is essentially to be welcomed and it is a sensible one, at least from an economic and politically realistic point of view."
"However, it should be added that, if we look at this situation from all angles, the drop in prices is not merely the result of a fall in demand."
"We also need to take into account the problems of the dairy farmers in Austria and the Alpine region."
"The small domestic farms cannot realistically compete with the huge dairy farms in northern Germany and the Netherlands."
"This gives rise to an imbalance."
"The release of the entire quantity of milk would force dairy farms in Austria to close down and it would have serious and unpredictable consequences, including for the cultivated landscape."
"A few multinational companies would then dominate the European market."
"I can well imagine what consequences this would have for food quality as well."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few days the legitimate protest of milk producers about prices, about the lack of European Union intervention and about the authorisation - not in the future, but immediately - of labelling, especially that of artificial dairy products, has been taking place throughout Europe."
"We want fresh products on the tables of our consumers, products of which we can know the origin, and not the rubbish that we get from other countries: powdered milk passed off as fresh milk from our own producers."
"Tomorrow, milk will be poured away in Padania, as in the rest of Europe - and this is an important protest, because it maintains the quality of our products."
"We in Europe want to eat wholesome food, from our region: good, fresh milk, milk that I obviously drink."
"We in Padania drink in memory of the sacrifice made by our producers, which this Europe must protect."
"The European Commissioner has excluded cheese with a long maturation period from the provisions; powdered-milk producers are the only ones it safeguards."
"This is a disgrace!"
"(HU) We are living, Mr President, at a time when dairy farmers are committing suicide every day, even in rich Western countries like France."
"This is therefore a huge tragedy."
"I voted in favour of both of Mr De Castro's reports because immediate, urgent intervention is required."
"However, we know that milk powder and butter have been stockpiled in the intervention stocks."
"They will be taken out of the intervention stocks and will only end up pushing down prices again."
"This is one problem I have."
"The other problem is that this measure is much more likely to help large farmers than small ones."
"We should not forget, however, that smallholders are in need of immediate help to make a basic living, whereas for larger farmers it would simply preserve or increase their profits."
"Fundamental changes are needed."
"We finally must guarantee food sovereignty instead of using the free trade model dictated by the WTO."
"As other speakers before me have said, we need food produced locally by local farmers."
"Mr President, like all those who have spoken I am aware of the extent of the crisis in our agrarian sector."
"Any Member who represents farmers knows that."
"But the crisis is a product of our existing agricultural system - the common agricultural policy - which has had calamitous consequences for farmers in my part of the United Kingdom."
"And not only for farmers: for our consumers, for our taxpayers, and indeed for the poor of the Third World who find that their markets are denied and that they then have surpluses dumped on them."
"We were gradually moving, in the European Union, away from the system of direct support that had such deleterious environmental and economic consequences, and now we are rushing back in."
"I can tell you that in the United Kingdom people have clear memories of how the milk quota system worked."
"We were allocated a quota that was less than our national production, so we have the extraordinary sight of British farmers using milk as fertiliser or pouring it away down the drain and then having to re-import milk from the Netherlands, France or other parts of the European Union to get up to the level of demand."
"We were just beginning to get away, and now this House has voted to bring it all back."
"Anyone who thinks that the European Union is going in the direction of doing less and devolving power need only look at today's vote."
"Mr President, last week saw the re-release of several albums by the band The Beatles in digitally remastered form."
"This week we are debating the milk quota system in a remastered form."
"They might not have much in common at first glance until you consider the title of one of the Beatles' songs, Back in the USSR."
"That, I think, sums it all up."
"Here we have a system where prices and quotas are decided by bureaucrats, not by the needs of consumers or even the needs of suppliers."
"Here we have a system where consumers pay twice over for higher prices and higher taxes to support a system that did not complain when prices were high."
"I remember towards the end of the last mandate, Martin Schulz saying that at last he had seen a social democratisation of the EPP."
"Well, actually I think his dream has gone further and we are seeing the Sovietisation of the EU."
"Are we really looking at an 'EUSSR'?"
"(DA) Mr President, we Danish Liberals have a great deal of sympathy for those farmers facing the great economic challenges of our day and, in fact, we also have a great deal of sympathy for the idea of giving short-term assistance to those in need."
"The only problem is that short-term, institutionalised support schemes never remain short-term, despite the many fine declarations of intent."
"They always become permanent in the end, and this is something that all those of us who have been involved in implementing them, be it here or in our national parliaments, do know."
"That is why we fear - and we think it is right that we should do so - that the measures that this resolution recommends, and the Commission's initiatives, too, seen in this light, will lead, de facto, to a more permanent route away from the excellent reform process towards efficient agriculture that the Commissioner has been responsible for, and we therefore feel we must reject this resolution."
"Mr President, I voted in favour because the issue of energy supply security is of paramount importance today for all Member States of the European Union."
"The recent Russian-Ukrainian crisis has clearly demonstrated existing problems in the energy sector, and especially the total dependence of some Member States on single suppliers of natural gas."
"The Baltic countries, which are isolated from the rest of Europe, are left to the mercy of gas suppliers from eastern Europe."
"Now it is more important than ever to develop a comprehensive common energy policy based on solidarity, the diversification of energy sources and defence of common interests."
"I would like take this opportunity to thank the Commission and especially the Swedish Presidency for presenting the Baltic Sea Strategy, which will allow effective mobilisation of structural funds to be used more efficiently to achieve common goals."
"I am convinced that, if properly implemented, the strategy will become an example of regional success."
"Finally I would like to urge the Commission to take a leading role in the implementation of the Baltic Sea Strategy in order to ensure that in certain cases the interests of individual Member States do not take precedence over the achievement of common strategy goals."
"(PL) I voted in favour of this resolution, as the question of energy is an important test of European solidarity."
"The Member States have to work together on this matter."
"Energy policy must be linked to foreign policy."
"The Commission also has to look at diversifying energy security in the various EU Member States."
"The battle against climate change means that energy which depends on coal may face dire financial straits."
"Price hikes will then affect the citizens."
"It is high time that we introduced a common, EU-wide policy in this field."
"The Commission must clearly state that it will combat the selfish attitudes of Member States which see no danger in a continued dependence on one supplier, such as a reliance on Russia for gas, for example."
"We need action."
"The European Commission and the Commissioner for Energy need to express their political will clearly."
"(RO) Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution and I will now explain why I did."
"The European Union is dependent on energy imports."
"Energy consumption is continuing to grow, but the natural resources are limited."
"Energy security assumes at the same time diversification of sources and transport routes, as well as highly efficient interconnection between Member States, which is currently being worked on through various projects, with European financing for the gas pipelines between Romania and its neighbours, Hungary and Bulgaria."
"This is where we are at the moment, I told myself, but what do we still have to do?"
"I would like to draw a perhaps bold, but simple comparison with electrical energy."
"At the moment, our houses are supplied with electrical current without us knowing where it comes from."
"A diversified network supplying natural gas and numerous transport networks must enable us to achieve the exact same aim: guaranteeing a gas supply in any situation, regardless of the situation."
"This is why I supported and still do support the Nabucco project, but also the move towards diversification of renewable energy sources, at the same time."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted in favour of the report on a proposal for a Council regulation as regards the 2009 and 2010 intervention periods for butter and skimmed milk powder, because I see these measures as the continuation of a positive measure that has had immediate effects in regulating the excess supply affecting the milk and dairy market."
"The drop in prices on the world milk and dairy market over the last 12 months resulted from a general increase in production and a fall in worldwide demand due to the economic and financial crisis."
"That justifies continuing public intervention for butter and powdered milk."
"On the basis of the report by my Italian fellow Member Paolo De Castro, I voted for the proposal for a Council regulation derogating from the regulation on common market organisation (CMO) as regards the 2009 and 2010 intervention periods for butter and skimmed milk powder."
"Following 2007's worldwide explosion in the prices of all foodstuffs, and therefore of milk, the last 12 months have seen a collapse in prices."
"I back the Commission, which in early 2009 introduced aid for private storage of butter in an effort to support the market."
"Given the exceptional nature of the situation, I support the extension until 28 February 2010 of the current public intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder, through a tender procedure."
"In addition, in view of the uncertainty regarding the time needed for the dairy products market to recover, I have backed the authorisation given to the Commission to extend the 2010/2011 intervention period, again through a tender procedure, should market conditions make it necessary."
"in writing. - This report refers to the proposal for a Council regulation which derogates from the Single CMO Regulation with regard to the intervention periods for butter and skimmed-milk powder."
"Due to the fact that there is a serious crisis in the dairy sector I have voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (SV) We are fully aware that the situation of dairy farmers is unsustainable."
"However, we are equally aware and convinced that interventions by the EU are not the solution."
"The time has now come for a transition to a market-based, insurance-based system that liberates farmers without upsetting the domestic or global market."
"It is also high time that there was a review of the situation with regard to competition in the large-scale input industry and in the almost as large food industry, which stands between the farmer and consumers."
"in writing. - (PL) With regard to the amendments which propose a freeze on milk quotas, I would like to state the following."
"Firstly, there is no basis for assuming that a proposed increase in production quotas (which would follow a review of the CAP) would have an impact on the crisis in the sector."
"Secondly, freezing an increase in the quotas (which is what the amendments to the European Parliament resolution propose) would punish farmers in countries which are currently on the verge of using their quotas."
"It would be unfair and even immoral to change the rules at this stage in the game."
"Thirdly, I would like to remind you that, at the 2002 summit in Copenhagen, we negotiated (these negotiations included Poland) on the subject of milk quotas, in the knowledge that these quotas would apply until 2007."
"In Luxembourg, the quota system was extended until 2014, without our participation or right to vote."
"We cannot resolve the problems in the dairy sector by giving some producers the opportunity to improve their lot at the cost of other producers."
"Our concepts and actions should aim to give everyone an opportunity, regardless of what country they come from, whether it be the 15 old Member States or the 12 new Members."
"in writing. - (DE) I agree with the Commission's short-term solution of purchasing butter and milk powder."
"However, I call for a long-term solution to the dairy crisis, for example by using flexible quantity control to give a milk price that covers costs."
"The milk surplus must be stemmed at national level by imposing European requirements."
"in writing. - (DE) The crisis in the dairy sector has also led to a slump in the price of butter and skimmed milk powder."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal to continue to subsidise the market and to extend the intervention period up to 28 February 2010."
"It is to be hoped that, following this, the market will recover and that prices will once again be determined by supply and demand."
"For a limited time, however, I believe that this intervention is necessary and have therefore voted in favour of the rapporteur's proposal."
"The serious crisis in the dairy farming sector is putting the very survival of dairy farming at risk."
"Therefore, I think it is right to remain opposed to individual quota management, since this would in fact mean superseding the end-of-year compensation payments, a mechanism that is, on the contrary, crucial to the Italian production system."
"Rather, I am in favour of a temporary increase in the intervention price, of initiatives and measures designed to achieve a balance within the sector, of enhancing the information offered to consumers, and of the important step of introducing labels of origin for milk and dairy products."
"In particular, for the purpose of restoring the balance of supply and demand, we should support the proposal temporarily to freeze part of the quotas assigned to individual States and to provide for a compensation mechanism for producers forced to destroy part of their herds that is proportionate to the percentage of the milk quota frozen."
"The European Union is currently going through one of the deepest crises ever recorded in the dairy sector, which is due to the increase in production and significant drop in global demand."
"Given the dire situation which Europe's dairy producers find themselves in, we must continue the period of public intervention (i.e. for buying and storing skimmed milk powder and butter) at least until February next year or until 2011, if it is considered necessary."
"I do not think that we can allow ourselves to stand by and watch farms in Europe being closed down because in a year's time we would need to import milk and dairy products from outside the Community."
"If we also consider that the health standards will not be anywhere near those we are looking for, we have far too much to lose."
"This report is welcome in this context."
"However, to be able to really solve the problem of the dairy sector, we must adopt related measures because this stock of products involves allocating considerable resources and it could happen at any given moment that this stock will be of no use."
"We must invest now in a sustainable agricultural system, capable of meeting our food requirements, even if we are in the midst of a financial crisis, in order to prevent a food crisis occurring later."
"in writing. - This is a proposal that amends the direct support schemes for farmers that are currently in place."
"Due to the fact that I am in agreement on the need for such amendments I have voted in favour."
"We are at the start of a new mandate when we set out the priorities for the European Union's future policies."
"I know that we are tempted to focus our attention on certain issues which we consider to be extremely important and ignore others."
"On this point, I would like to emphasise that we can give up many things, but we cannot give up eating."
"This is why agriculture must remain a priority area for the EU."
"In my view, we must increase the minimum amount of aid granted to farmers above the limit of EUR 15 000 set by the Commission, as well as allocate an increased budget to promote the dairy and dairy product sector."
"I strongly recommend support for farmers producing milk and meat, with a view to stabilising markets, by including them in the Temporary Crisis Framework for state aid."
"Furthermore, the direct aid systems need to also take into account the particular features of the new Member States where agriculture plays an important role in the national economy and ensure that support is maintained for agriculture to enable them to overcome the structural problems and achieve the objective of convergence through boosting the development level in the agricultural sector and eliminating the differences in terms of efficiency and competitiveness in relation to the old Member States."
"in writing. - The fight against terrorism has been high on the agenda of this House."
"However, we must strike the right balance between the security measures and the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights."
"We also need to ensure the utmost respect for privacy and data protection."
"Balance and proportionality must be the key principles on which the fight against terrorism is based."
"The European Union has always demonstrated a firm commitment to the protection citizens' privacy, and that must be maintained."
"The Community is based on the rule of law and all transfers of European personal data to third countries should respect procedural guarantees and defence rights."
"It goes without saying that any transfers must comply with data protection legislation at national and European level."
"SWIFT is a key infrastructure, and we must ensure that any requests for data transfers are duly justified, based on targeted cases and strictly subject to judicial authorisation."
"The Community must take a firm stance in the negotiations with the US to ensure that SWIFT data cannot be used for any other purposes than those linked to terrorism financing."
"in writing. - (SV) We Social Democrats have chosen to abstain from the vote on Amendment 1."
"It is vital for democratic control that the European Parliament and the national parliaments have access to the documents and negotiation directives prior to the negotiations with the United States' authorities concerning access to financial payment messaging data."
"European citizens must be able to be confident that the transfer of their bank details does not violate national or EU law."
"At the same time, we realise the importance of being able to investigate crimes of terrorism effectively in the future, but not at any cost to democracy."
"I voted for the joint resolution on the envisaged international agreement to make available to the United States Treasury Department financial payment messaging data to prevent and combat terrorism and terrorist financing."
"However, as representatives of the citizens, and being aware of the sensitive nature of this subject, which affects fundamental rights, we require strong guarantees prior to the signing of any agreement with the United States on SWIFT."
"These guarantees are: that data be transferred only in order to combat terrorism; that a reciprocal mechanism oblige the United States to transfer relevant financial information at the request of the European authorities; that the validity of this interim agreement be restricted to 12 months at most; and that a new agreement be negotiated later on, once the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, with the full participation of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments."
"I would also like the veil of secrecy that has to a large extent shrouded the heart of this issue to be lifted and we MEPs to be given far more information about the procedures laid down in this agreement than we have so far received."
"in writing. - (DE) According to the planned international agreement, financial payment messaging data is to be made available to the United States Treasury Department to prevent and combat terrorism and terrorist financing."
"The transmission of financial payment messaging data to foreign powers constitutes a serious encroachment on the fundamental rights of our citizens, particularly when the recipient of the data is the United States of America."
"The US has shown many times in the past that it does not take data protection seriously, particularly if it has to do with achieving and implementing the projects and goals of the government."
"Although this motion for a resolution has good intentions to protect European citizens, the inappropriate use of these important data cannot ultimately be ruled out."
"For this reason, I have voted against the motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - Tajikistan occupies an important geographical position since it is situated at a key intersection between Europe and Asia and therefore plays an important role in enhancing the stability of the region."
"I have voted in favour of this resolution which seeks to identify a number of important issues that should be addressed in Tajikistan."
"in writing. - I very much welcome the proposed EC-Tajikistan Partnership and Cooperation agreement which provides a framework for future EU cooperation with Tajikistan."
"The Central Asia region is very important in economic and political terms for the Community and this agreement will help to consolidate and strengthen the EU's political and economic and trade relations and presence in Tajikistan and Central Asia in general."
"Moreover, it will also promote economic growth and support sustainable development, actions against poverty, and stability in Tajikistan and the Central Asia region."
"I am delighted to see that this agreement also incorporates such issues as actions against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, trafficking, the drug trade and organised crime."
"From now on, both the EU and Tajikistan will pursue a close political dialogue which will open the way for deeper relations in a great number of fields."
"In 2007, under the German Presidency, the EU adopted a strategy for Central Asia aimed at a new association."
"The Agreement with Tajikistan is part of this strategy and it has been indicated that its main ambition in the region is natural resources, particularly gas."
"I voted against the report on a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Tajikistan because the EU is only interested in that country for its natural resources and its geostrategic position, given that Tajikistan has borders with Afghanistan and China."
"The EU's relations with third countries should be based on other interests, on mutual interests, always with respect for the sovereignty of both parties and of course with respect for the management of their resources."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues can agree with much of this report."
"We remain wholeheartedly supportive of providing equal rights and opportunities for people regardless of their disability, race, religion, or sexuality, and abhor discrimination in all its forms."
"However, we do have serious misgivings with regard to the involvement of the Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Union on issues which we believe to be the preserve of individual nation states."
"That is why we have decided to abstain on this resolution."
"in writing. - Members of the European Conservatives and Reformists strongly support equal treatment for all regardless of race, religion, sexuality, or disability, and strongly condemn discrimination in all its forms."
"However, we do have serious misgivings with regard to the involvement of the Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Union on issues which we believe to be the preserve of individual nation states."
"As a democratic nation, we believe this matter should be decided by the Lithuanian parliament and the Lithuanian people."
"Therefore, we have decided not to support this resolution."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the Lithuanian Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information, since I believe that the law passed by the Lithuanian Parliament on 14 July 2009, under which it is prohibited 'to directly disseminate to minors [...] public information whereby homosexual, bisexual or polygamous relations are promoted', because it has 'a detrimental effect on the development of minors', should be urgently reviewed."
"According to the European Union's principles, all forms of discrimination, and in particular discrimination based on sexual orientation, should be eliminated, and therefore the Agency for Fundamental Rights should give an opinion on the law in question and the amendments to it in the light of the EU Treaties and EU law."
"The motion for a resolution that is being put before us today is truly mind-boggling."
"The finger is being pointed at a country because its democratically elected parliament is in the process of examining a law that - in common with the laws that exist in the majority of the Member States - is designed to protect minors, and that is aimed specifically at protecting them from any propaganda promoting homosexuality, bisexuality or polygamy."
"What could be more natural, where children are concerned?"
"Well, no, it seems that this is 'discrimination', and the entire EU is mobilising against poor Lithuania, which is 'guilty' of banning proselytising and of encouraging family values."
"What is even more astonishing is the fact that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which theoretically claims to be Christian democrat and to have certain moral values, has also put its signature to this absurdity, which the left initiated."
"As usual, children's rights count for nothing in the face of pressure from certain lobby groups."
"It should be said that, in their time, some Members of this Parliament were advocates of paedophilia in the name of universal freedom and of the right of all, no matter how young, to sexuality."
"This resolution is not just criminal, it is disgusting!"
"I voted for the resolution condemning the Lithuanian law for the protection of minors against the detrimental effect of public information, which sets out to ban any information on homosexuality if it is accessible to minors."
"This law totally contravenes European laws, specifically with regard to combating discrimination based on sexual orientation, with a largely homophobic content, and also poses an obstacle to freedom of expression."
"It has been widely condemned by NGOs, including the ILGA (International Lesbian and Gay Association) and Amnesty International, and by the Council of Europe."
"We must offer young people a vision of society that is open to diversity and founded on the principle of respect for others, however different they may be."
"For its part, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must act in a responsible manner and launch infringement proceedings against Lithuania, should it persist with its decision."
"Through this vote, we are calling on the Lithuanian parliamentary representatives to pull themselves together and reject this text, which signals a return to a past that, personally speaking, I condemn."
"in writing. - This is an explanation of vote on behalf of the Fine Gael Delegation to the European Parliament."
"The Fine Gael MEPs abstained on the votes on Lithuania as the legislative/legal processes have not yet been completed there."
"When the Lithuanian legal process has been finalised the question as to whether it conflicts with EU Treaties can be examined."
"This is the normal and correct procedure."
"We also note that the resolution sets one form of discrimination above others and is in itself a form of discrimination."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted against the resolution, which could set a dangerous precedent for the European Union."
"In my opinion, its contents and subject matter are incompatible with the principle of subsidiarity."
"These kinds of resolutions may foster euroscepticism, as they are proof of the EU's tendency to become involved in the internal affairs of EU Member States."
"The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of EU Member States is not an absolute principle, but there is nothing happening in Lithuania that would force us to take action."
"Those who want to see a better Europe should vote against this resolution."
"That is the reason for my decision. Thank you very much."
"The Lithuanian Parliament has approved amendments to the Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information."
"This law aims to prevent the dissemination of public information 'that agitates for homosexual ... relations' or that 'defies family values'."
"For this reason, the Lithuanian authorities should amend the law, or repeal it, and should refrain from adopting the amendments to the penal and administrative codes, so as to ensure that laws are compatible with human rights and fundamental freedoms as enshrined in international and European law."
"It was a step in the right direction when the new President of Lithuania asked the Lithuanian Parliament to reconsider the law to ensure that it complies with the constitutional principles of the rule of law, legal certainty, and legal clarity and that it does not contravene the guarantees of an open society and pluralistic democracy."
"For these reasons, and due to the urgent need to revise this law, I voted for the joint motion for a resolution of the European Parliament."
"I voted against this resolution, which sets a dangerous precedent in that the points of view expressed do not abide by the principle of subsidiarity and are a form of intervention in the sovereign actions of the parliament of a Member State, at a time when the law in question has not even entered into force."
"I endorsed and voted in favour of Amendment 28 to this resolution asking the Commission and the Member States to immediately adopt additional measures to intervene in the current level of Community production by means of a temporary freeze on quota increases, which were decided during the last common agricultural policy reforms, because this amendment addressed the interests of all Portuguese milk producers and especially won the support of milk producers in the Azores."
"I therefore regret that this amendment did not gain the support of the majority of Members of the European Parliament."
"in writing. - I voted for this joint resolution because, contrary to the European Commission's prognosis on the substantial increase in the prices of dairy products, the dairy market is witnessing a dramatic deterioration, with falling milk prices despite intervention and export subsidies."
"The economies of many Member States are heavily dependent on agriculture and farming."
"Unfortunately, there is now a big difference between the prices paid by consumers for agricultural products in the supermarkets and the money received by producers."
"Many EU dairy farmers are now at serious risk and are forced to sell dairy products below their production costs."
"The Commission must take adequate measures in both the short and long term to overcome this crisis and to save the EU dairy market."
"In this regard, I very much support the request to create an EU Diary Fund to aid producers and to support farm investments."
"If we want to have a well-functioning diary market we must support farm investments in modernisations, small producers and young farmers."
"And most importantly, to ensure that farmers receive a fair and adequate price for their production."
"in writing. - The past 12 months have seen the deterioration of the dairy market with prices of milk falling below 21 cents per litre and leaving many farmers with no alternative but to sell dairy products at a loss."
"This is an extremely serious situation and therefore I have voted in favour of this resolution."
"in writing. - (DA) We have voted against the proposals for increased agricultural aid to the dairy farming sector."
"Our group votes consistently in favour of reducing agricultural aid and continuing to reform the EU's agricultural policy. In connection with the decision in this regard, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament voted against Amendments 16, 17 and 19, because, despite having a favourable content, these amendments were not relevant to the discussion in question."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a joint resolution on the crisis in the dairy farming sector since I believe urgent measures are needed to resolve the serious crisis that the sector is experiencing, particularly by stimulating demand so as to restore market balance."
"It is regrettable, however, that the compromise reached in Parliament does not include the temporary suspension of quota increases or other measures to reduce production, which would be very important in helping European farmers to face this crisis."
"The serious crisis affecting the dairy farming sector makes it urgent to adopt more effective measures for supporting producers and to consider the usefulness of eliminating milk quotas in 2015."
"Stabilisation of the milk and dairy market will not be achieved just through one or two odd measures, such as not increasing quotas, designed to mitigate the immediate, temporary effects of the crisis."
"On the contrary, medium- to long-term solutions will have to be considered, and the reasons why this market is not working properly must be assessed, together with the best ways to maintain sustainable production, not forgetting the consumers' right to a fair price."
"In this respect, I must point out the particularly fragile competitive status of those outermost regions that depend heavily on dairy production, such as the Azores."
"I regret a certain insensitivity on the part of the European Commission and, at a national level, the poor management of this process by the Portuguese Government."
"Our leaders' ability to take action and support national interests is particularly important in times of crisis."
"Regrettably, that has not been the case."
"On the positive side, I note the success of the amendments of which I am a co-author, which support an increase in de minimis payments."
"It is not an ideal solution, but it helps."
"I am voting in favour of this resolution, although it does not go far enough."
"To stabilise prices now, the bonus of 2% of the annual increase beyond the quota must be withdrawn urgently."
"The milk quota system will still need to continue after 2015 or be replaced with another regulatory mechanism."
"It is vital to adjust milk production to European domestic demand so as to guarantee producers a fair price."
"Market transparency is essential, and in that respect I suggest setting up a European observatory to help monitor and regulate the market from production to distribution."
"The adopted resolution contains positive measures that are necessary in the current context of the severe crisis affecting the sector."
"That is why we voted in favour."
"These are just one-off measures, however, which do not solve the basic problems of the sector, particularly those of small and medium-sized producers, for whom the situation is likely to get worse in future, given the intention that has been announced to abolish milk quotas."
"The battle that milk producers have been fighting, which goes beyond their immediate aims - to sell their produce at prices that ensure their survival - also has a broader meaning and importance that have to do with the kind of agriculture that we want in the future."
"The neoliberal model of agriculture, which promotes flooding the market with products from countries with greater productive capacity and promotes intensive production in some countries and the abandonment of farming and food dependency in others, must be replaced with a model based on the concept of food sovereignty and food security - the right of each country to produce in a sustainable way."
"In this model, public mechanisms for controlling production - quotas, adapted to each country's needs - are essential."
"When a policy drives farmers to suicide, when it leads men to deliberately destroy the fruits of their labours because that is no worse than what the policy is offering them, it is time to change the policy."
"The liberalisation of agriculture, in general, and of the dairy sector, in particular, has been a disaster."
"How many times must it be said in this House that, because it nourishes people, because it helps to make the countryside more attractive and to keep populations in rural areas, agriculture cannot be considered as an economic activity like any other?"
"Foodstuffs are not products on which one can speculate on markets disconnected from any form of reality."
"It is absurd to encourage the importing of products that do not even satisfy the quality criteria that our farmers have to meet."
"It is scandalous to leave these farmers at the mercy of processors and predators from the large central buying offices, which make profits at the expense of both producers and consumers."
"The timid, vague proposals in the text are neither sufficient nor wholly satisfactory, but at least they exist."
"That is why we have voted in favour."
"The state of the dairy market has worsened considerably over the last 12 months: the price of milk has fallen by 30% in a year, which is the sharpest fall seen in the last 20 years."
"We therefore urgently need to introduce new forms of regulation at European level to ensure that the dairy sector is not just dependent on the rules of the market but can actually prove a match for them."
"Currently, the instability in producers' incomes does not allow the best allocation to be made of resources that are vital for future investments in the sector."
"Therefore, the European Commission has a duty to facilitate contractual relations within the agri-food chain, so as to balance the relations between the various operators in the sector, stabilise the markets and prevent market risks."
"It must also encourage better organisation within the sectors."
"In addition, consideration should be given to whether an increase in milk quotas might have a positive impact on producer prices."
"Europe must act now."
"We can wait no longer."
"If we do not act, we will run the risk of seeing the European dairy sector suffer lasting damage, thus depriving our fragile rural areas of the hub of their economies."
"The milk strike is growing in size in the countries of Europe, with its striking images of milk poured away into the fields."
"In the face of the concerns of dairy producers, the European Parliament has adopted a position."
"In this context, I voted for the creation of a EUR 600 million fund in the budget planned by the EU for 2010 to provide assistance to milk producers, who are currently experiencing a serious crisis, unprecedented within their sector, and are wrestling with the laws of supply and demand on the world dairy market."
"My socialist colleagues and I have also tabled an amendment calling for the suspension of dairy quotas as currently in force, with a view to bringing about a rise in prices."
"We ought also to adopt cyclical measures, in addition to the market management measures already taken, as the latter have proved to be ineffective in the face of price volatility."
"in writing. - (DE) The dairy sector is currently in the midst of a crisis on an unprecedented scale: producer prices have fallen dramatically, consumer prices have risen and many farms in the EU are fighting for survival."
"The Commission has stood by and watched this development for far too long."
"In our motion for a resolution, which is supported by nearly all the groups, we make it clear that the decisions made in November 2008 in connection with the health check are not sufficient for the current situation."
"The comprehensive agricultural reform that we have adopted is too little."
"If the basic conditions have changed, the Commission must seize the initiative and implement a measure that will help the farmers of the EU."
"In our resolution we call for comprehensive measures: market stabilisation, sales promotion, a comprehensive school milk programme, increase of the maximum amount of minimum payments from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 for all areas of agricultural production, an early retirement scheme/quota buy-back scheme, the strengthening of producer organisations, proper labelling of dairy products, export credit insurance similar to that which exists in the US and, for particular measures, the dairy fund."
"With this resolution, we are ready to take responsibility for European agriculture."
"That is why I voted in favour of the present resolution."
"The dairy sector is in danger."
"For months now, dairy producers have been producing at a loss whilst the price of milk has not fallen for consumers: large distributors have been the ones to benefit."
"Thousands of small French producers are under threat of bankruptcy."
"The general dairy strike, which is the last step by the producers to try to make themselves heard, and not to die amid public indifference, is currently spreading in many European countries, correspondingly jeopardising many jobs in other branches of the dairy sector."
"There is an urgent need to find effective solutions for this key sector of French and European agriculture, and to make a radical policy change, since - let us not beat around the bush - it is the European Commission, the Council, the European Parliament and their ultra-liberalism that hold sole responsibility for this tragedy."
"We need to take urgent action: to maintain the quotas principle after 2015; to bring in an immediate reduction in these quotas in order to end the slump in the price of milk; to set prices in line with the costs actually incurred by independent producers; and to establish full transparency in the setting of prices by large distributors."
"Farmers expect strong action."
"in writing. - (DE) We saved the banks, because we had to."
"That was recognised and accepted by all responsible politicians."
"Now we are faced with a situation in the agricultural industry where we need to prevent the imminent bankruptcy of farmers, particularly in the dairy sector, because prices no longer cover production costs."
"However, we need to ensure that our production potential is sufficient to supply European citizens with high quality foodstuffs."
"I belong to a generation that experienced food rationing and the need to hoard food in order to have enough to eat."
"Hopefully, things will never get that bad again."
"However, those who have never experienced hunger do not understand how important a strong common agricultural policy is for Europe."
"We need security of supply and not just in the energy sector."
"I would ask you to consider the fact that, if too many farms in too many regions are forced to cease operating because we are not able or prepared to take the necessary short-term measures that are called for in our resolution, the cost to the EU and the Member States would be many times greater than the cost of taking appropriate short-term measures within the framework of the common agricultural policy."
"The army of unemployed is large enough."
"Allowing farms to go bust would be irresponsible on social, economic and environmental grounds."
"I hope that our warning will be heeded."
"I voted for the joint motion for a resolution, despite regarding it as inadequate."
"The proposal to end the milk quota scheme in 2015, and until then to increase the quota by 1% per year, will, in practical terms, legalise the surpluses which already exist in certain countries, which are being produced above their quotas and which are then exported at very low prices, pushing down market prices, in many countries below the cost of production."
"The measures which the Commission is trying to apply have the ultimate objective of deregulation, and therefore liberalisation of the dairy farming sector in Europe."
"We are totally against these measures as they serve the interests of the large companies, in the same way as the common agricultural policy reforms, to the detriment of small-scale producers."
"We support measures to regulate the dairy farming sector."
"in writing. - (DE) In recent months a situation has developed on the dairy markets that is threatening the existence of many dairy farmers."
"The price of their products has fallen rapidly."
"Small and medium-sized farms have been particularly hard hit and they are having to draw on their reserves in order to survive."
"For this reason, rapid action by the EU is sought."
"The Commission has previously been far too tentative in its attempts to get to grips with the crisis, for which is it partly responsible because of its decision to increase the delivery quotas."
"Parliament's initiatives, most of which are also referred to in this motion for a resolution, are therefore even more welcome."
"These include, first and foremost, the creation of a milk fund to which EUR 600 million will be allocated, measures for increasing demand for dairy products, greater quality control and precise labelling obligations."
"With a view to supporting our farmers, it was therefore a foregone conclusion for me to vote in favour of the proposed motion for a resolution and the measures it contains."
"A warning bell: that is the essence of our resolution; it calls upon the Commission and the Council to take emergency measures in order to find a way out of the crisis, the full force of which is being felt by milk producers."
"In Belgium yesterday this crisis took on a new dimension when over 2 000 producers poured away 3 million litres of milk in Ciney."
"Ascribing sole responsibility for this to the removal of quotas is a way of cutting the debate short."
"That is why I opposed Amendment 28, calling for a freeze in quotas, as too simplistic."
"The main causes lie elsewhere: a fall in demand, fierce competition worldwide, and above all, the unacceptable profit margins of the distribution companies, which have been criticised by many consumer associations."
"That is what led me, in paragraphs 17 and 18, of which I am the author, to ask the Commission for an enquiry to determine whether there are any cartels operating."
"The credibility of the Commission is at stake."
"On the other hand, I supported Amendment 1, which extends the initiative taken by 16 Member States and calls for a balance to be re-established between the various operators in the sector."
"Personally, I support the fixing of a minimum price for milk in each country."
"Looking ahead to the vote on the resolution on the crisis in the dairy farming sector, I had tabled and endorsed some amendments for short-term regulation of the dairy market, specifically through a freeze in the increase of quotas, or a temporary reduction in quotas (of 3% to 5%)."
"However, all these measures have been rejected by the European Parliament."
"Producers have a right to expect Parliament to put forward the radical measures they need."
"Despite certain positive elements, this resolution does not meet these expectations: that is why I abstained from the final vote."
"Europe is highly dependent on imported energy."
"To reduce our energy dependency, we must take action on energy efficiency, the diversification of energy sources through the increasing use of renewables, and the diversification of countries of origin and transit."
"Consolidation of the internal energy market throughout Europe is also very important for increasing energy security."
"Gas pipeline and electricity grids covering the whole of Europe must be given priority."
"In this respect, two of the projects included in the economic recovery plan are highly important for Portugal: the electricity grid link between Portugal and Spain, which will help to consolidate the Iberian electricity market; and the link between Spain and France, to prevent the Iberian Peninsula from becoming an energy island."
"The Commission and the Council are called on to make every effort to ensure that the development of renewable energy projects in the countries of southern Europe with a high potential for renewable energy is encouraged."
"Large areas of the Alentejo region have the highest solar potential in the whole of Europe, as shown by solar radiation distribution maps."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament's resolution on external aspects of energy security because I believe the creation of a genuine common energy policy will be decisive for ensuring the security of energy supplies in the European Union."
"Nonetheless, a properly functioning internal energy market and the diversification of energy sources will also be extremely important in preventing future crises and interruptions in energy supply."
"In this respect, I think increasing investment in renewable energies and energy efficiency should be a core element of European policies."
"The European Union's energy dependence, the strategic need to reduce it and the threats to the EU's stability caused by such fragility are well known and have been widely debated."
"In that respect, my country has levels of dependence that far exceed the European average, revealing the absolute failure of successive governments in this area and raising considerable fears about a possible crisis in the energy markets."
"In view of the difficult relations with some of our main suppliers, the limits to the diversity of energy sources and the inadequacy of supply capacity, I feel it is important for all the Member States that the European Union should act en bloc to protect its common interests and show that it can impose them in a very demanding negotiating context."
"Similarly, I believe the Member States must not shirk their responsibilities but should decide on varied energy baskets, in which all the main alternatives, including nuclear, should be examined, evaluated without bias and put into practice when they are found to be useful, with priority for those that can be produced most efficiently, safely and cleanly."
"Europe will not be able, at least in the short term, to rid itself of its dependence on countries outside Europe for its energy supplies."
"It is true that in order to reduce these constraints, we need to diversify the forms of our dependence, from the viewpoint both of energy sources and of supplier countries."
"To be honest, however, I do not see the point in placing ourselves in the clutches of Turkey, in a move motivated more, it seems, by hostility to Russia than by energy concerns."
"Turkey is the necessary point of transit for this famous Nabucco gas pipeline of yours, which has systematically received priority over other projects."
"This would give the country a significant means of applying pressure."
"With regard to Desertec, here too I fail to see the point in becoming dependent upon what is, for the moment, a project which is part of a private initiative."
"In fact, I believe that it is contradictory to want to conduct a centralised energy policy, in the hands of the Commission, and at the same time to hand the European energy sector over to private operators, entailing a rise in prices and a reduction in services, and adversely affecting energy choices."
"Above all, I believe that energy is too crucial an issue to be left to Commission officials to deal with, or to be abandoned to the profit motive of a few companies."
"in writing. - (DE) This joint motion for a resolution on external aspects of energy security contains important options for Europe's future energy policy."
"In particular, I consider the significant increase in the proportion of renewable energy sources in the current energy mix to be particularly important and I am therefore also in favour of the Desertec project planned by a private group of investors."
"This is not least intended to reduce the dependence of the EU on individual states from which we have hitherto acquired our fossil fuels."
"The planned Nabucco project will not, unfortunately, contribute to this, since, it will leave the EU open to blackmail with regard to the planned accession of Turkey to the EU."
"Given the direct influence of the Islamic regime in Turkey, the project in its current form is therefore to be rejected."
"For this reason, despite numerous positive elements in this text, I abstained from voting on the text as a whole in the final vote."
"in writing. - We recognise the different concerns of our various allies."
"However, from a British perspective, efforts to achieve a more coherent EU approach to energy security do not require the Lisbon Treaty or the extension of European Commission competence."
"Sufficient mechanisms are already in place which would enable EU Member States to speak with one voice in dealing with Russia, should we so wish."
"The references in this resolution to the Lisbon Treaty are highly detrimental."
"British Conservatives are vehemently opposed to the ratification of this Treaty and to further attempts at EU political integration."
"I regret also the failure to make any reference to nuclear energy among the mix of sustainable and diverse energy supply sources that will be required in the coming years."
"Energy security is first and foremost the responsibility of our own governments."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes"
"Situation in Taiwan following the recent typhoon (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission's statement on the situation in Taiwan following the recent typhoon."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, let me express my sympathy to the people of Taiwan who suffered as result of Typhoon Morakot and its consequences."
"The European Community Mechanism for Civil Protection made a contribution to the overall relief effort and showed Europe's solidarity with the population of Taiwan."
"On 7 August 2009 Taiwan was hit by Typhoon Morakot, causing major flooding and mudslides."
"Over 150 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced."
"Transport infrastructure, including roads and bridges, was damaged and communication networks were interrupted."
"Around 700 000 homes were left without drinking water."
"Taiwan requested international assistance on 12 August 2009."
"In response the European Commission activated the Community Civil Protection Mechanism."
"The mechanism facilitates and coordinates Member States' in-kind assistance during major emergencies."
"The European Commission deployed a coordination and assessment team to Taiwan to assess the needs and to assist the Government in its relief efforts."
"The team undertook several assessment missions to the affected regions, sharing its findings and recommendations with the local authorities and international partners."
"The mechanism team also facilitated the delivery of in-kind assistance such as water purification equipment donated by Sweden and Poland, which was delivered to the most affected areas in Taiwan."
"The rapid delivery of this assistance ensured a tangible expression of European solidarity."
"The presence of the European team on the ground was also received positively."
"The Community Civil Protection Mechanism is a very visible sign of European solidarity with countries worldwide, and I am convinced that it will continue to grow in strength and effectiveness."
"Natural disasters can affect any country in the world."
"They often carry a heavy human, economic and environmental cost."
"In the future, climate change makes it likely that we will face more disasters."
"In this regard, solidarity with other countries hit by disaster remains one of the pillars of the European disaster-management policy."
"I look forward to continuing to work with the European Parliament to make sure our European emergency-management tools are fit for purpose."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Republic of Taiwan was shaken to its foundations on 8 August."
"Typhoon Morakot swept across the island with unbridled force, leaving more than 750 people dead."
"Thousands lost their belongings and large areas of land were laid waste."
"The damage amounts to more than EUR 2.5 billion."
"The reconstruction of an infrastructure that has been widely damaged will take months."
"As a token of our solidarity, we Europeans wished to support the Taiwanese people by providing disaster relief."
"Mrs Kuneva, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) supports the initiatives that the European Commission has instigated."
"It is all the more surprising that the Taiwanese embassies were instructed to refuse all foreign aid."
"That led to strong criticism and on 13 August to much needed adjustments to a completely abortive crisis management programme."
"Shortly after that, Prime Minister Liu Chao-shiuan resigned."
"Another cause of irritation was the visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama over several days in September."
"He merely wanted to pray for the victims with the survivors."
"Sympathy has long been the message of the much-acclaimed speeches and books of the Dalai Lama."
"Once again the Chinese government made loud protests and brought a huge amount of pressure to bear."
"It is outrageous that Peking has once again made a political issue out of a purely humanitarian act by the Dalai Lama."
"Taiwan must ask itself whose side it is actually on."
"President Ma Ying-jeou only allowed the Nobel Peace Prize winner to enter the country after strong protests from his own people."
"Commissioner, we need to intensify our dialogue with Taiwan - on humanitarian issues, but also on the issue of our fundamental values."
"Democracy, human rights and solidarity are inseparable, even in this emerging Asiatic country."
"on behalf of the S-D Group. - Mr President, first of all, please let me express my sincere sorrow for the huge tragedy that hit Taiwan on 8 August and in particular for all the people that were killed by the incredible energy of the devastation from this major disaster."
"Morakot was the deadliest typhoon to hit Taiwan in nearly 50 years, ravaging the island in early August and leaving about 700 people dead or missing, forcing the evacuation of thousands and burying hundreds of village homes in mudslides."
"On this occasion China showed great sensitivity by sending immediate aid to help Taiwanese victims."
"Not only was the Chinese Government ready to assist the island, but also private companies and organisations of different kinds including the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits and the mainland Red Cross Society."
"Also, the Chinese population afforded help with fundraising events organised to relieve the island from the disaster."
"According to the last figures, the Chinese mainland has so far donated to the typhoon victims about a CNY 1 billion, which is the equivalent of nearly USD 150 million."
"An important role in this situation was played by the several hundreds of prefabricated houses that were sent from China to Taiwan in order to put a roof over those who had lost their dwellings."
"I would like to underline the fact that the European Union, attached to the One China policy, welcomes the help that China offered Taiwan on this tragic occasion because this shows an improvement in the relations between the two territories, and it is clear that an improvement in such relations can lead to greater stability in this region."
"I also think, and with this I conclude, that, given the dimension of the disaster, the European Union should make use of one of its core values - solidarity - and offer Taiwan additional material and financial assistance in order to help with the massive task of reconstruction."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the scenes of devastation and destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot will remain in our minds for a long time, but many people in Taiwan will be living with the consequences of this tragedy for years to come."
"Over 700 people lost their lives and thousands of others have faced major disruption."
"The Taiwanese Government under President Ma responded promptly by deploying soldiers to the worst-affected communities and areas, and requesting assistance from the international community."
"The Swedish EU Presidency and the Commission should be congratulated on their work in activating the Community Civil Protection Mechanism."
"I do hope now that the Commission will commit to longer-term assistance to Taiwan to enable full recovery of its people and economy and the rebuilding of the infrastructure."
"I have no doubt of the gratitude of the people and Government of Taiwan for the solidarity and support shown by the EU."
"Furthermore, as chairman of the EP Taiwan Friendship Group, I look forward to finding out the latest situation when I lead a delegation of MEPs to Taiwan next month."
"The calamity that has affected Taiwan may well become more commonplace, both in Taiwan and around the world, as a result of climate change."
"It is therefore essential that Taiwan, as an island vulnerable to such meteorological phenomena and as a major global industrial power, is enabled to participate meaningfully and with dignity in appropriate international organisations, not least those related to weather and climate change."
"In particular, Taiwan should be allowed to participate in the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organisation."
"Both the Council and the Commission support Taiwan's meaningful participation in United Nations bodies now, and I hope they will use the opportunity, arising from this disaster, that has now been presented to Taiwan to promote Taiwan's involvement in these structures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as well as offering my condolences and support to the people of Taiwan, I would like to emphasise the timeliness of the European Union's humanitarian effort in this disaster."
"The Commission has played its part, and many Member States have sent aid or teams of experts."
"The People's Republic of China itself has helped the Taiwanese authorities, and this is a gesture that I consider to be very significant."
"However, if we want to provide the Taiwanese authorities and the countries of the region with structural help to cope with threats of this kind in the future, the European Union should support Taiwan's admission as an observer to the World Meteorological Organisation and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"Taiwan's admission as an observer has already yielded some good results in other international sectoral organisations such as the WTO, and, in this case, too, Taiwan's admission could be a practical form of prevention and could in future limit the risks for the 23 million inhabitants of the island and for the region as a whole."
"(FR) Mr President, Taiwan is just now emerging from a dreadful natural disaster, unprecedented in the country over the last 50 years."
"It is our duty not only to express our solidarity but also to play an active part in the reconstruction of the parts of the island that have been devastated."
"Happily, after typhoon Morakot hit, the Commission and the Council indicated their willingness to help."
"I urge them now to provide the concrete aid that the government and the people of that country need, because there is an enormous amount to be done."
"Appropriate instruments exist at European Union level."
"They should be put to full use."
"This disaster once again poses the issue, as already mentioned by some of my fellow Members, of Taiwan's participation in the various agencies of the United Nations."
"In principle, the EU institutions encourage this, but it is high time for action to be taken to change things."
"The Taiwanese authorities did not have access to meteorological information indicating how serious the typhoon was."
"This is unacceptable."
"It is absolutely vital that Taiwan accedes to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and is thus in a position to avoid the worst, since there is no doubt at all that there will be further climatic depressions in the future."
"I am the chairman of the Taiwan-Luxembourg association, and I really must say that we should no longer be pressurised by the blackmailing of Communist China, with regard to our relations with Taiwan."
"Crystal-clear support from the Commission and the Council on this issue is absolutely vital."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my deep sorrow about the humanitarian tragedy in Taiwan and to say that, as the European Union, we must help in any way we can."
"We now know that 640 people were killed by Typhoon Morakot and over 192 people are missing."
"One mudslide wiped an entire village off the map and killed hundreds."
"However, none of this happened by accident."
"It was preceded by a prolonged drought, which reduced the capacity of the soil to absorb the rain."
"Droughts, floods and a rapid increase in extreme weather are gradually increasing due to climate change."
"A typhoon is caused in sea areas with a surface temperature of 27 οC."
"The increase in temperature will considerably increase both the number of typhoons and their intensity."
"To date, 120 million people are living in areas affected by typhoons."
"Between 1980 and 2000, there were 250 000 typhoon victims."
"For all these reasons, our heart must be in Copenhagen, where we shall decide in December if each of our countries will separately defend its own temporary, short-term interests or if we shall all fight for the planet, our home, in a fight to reverse climate change."
"So will the developed and developing world stop contributing to disasters such as the disaster in Taiwan?"
"If so, action is needed."
"We need to pledge to making the necessary commitments for the necessary reduction, in order to prevent the temperature rising above 2 οC."
"We also need to put our hand in our pocket to provide financial assistance to the developing world, so that it becomes part of the solution and helps to combat climate change."
"We are the developing world that caused climate change."
"We are the polluters and, according to the 'polluter pays' principle which we ourselves adopted, we must pay."
"We must pay by giving financial support to developing countries."
"(NL) Mr President, this was a disaster on an unprecedented scale for Taiwan."
"There is great tragedy in the mountains."
"Whole villages have disappeared and there are a thousand people thought dead or missing."
"Thousands of survivors, if not more, are being put up in military camps for the time being."
"This is how Menno Goedhart, the highest representative in Taiwan from my home country, the Netherlands, depicts the devastating effects of typhoon Morakot."
"First and foremost, I would like to express my sympathies, from this Parliament, to the government and citizens of Taiwan."
"In addition to the practical assistance that Menno Goedhart is currently offering his Taiwanese friends, and also whilst appreciating what has already been done from the European side, I would nonetheless like to ask a couple of questions of the Commission in relation to the strengthening of European-Taiwanese relations."
"First of all, the Commission will be putting forward a proposal next month to relax the visa regime for Taiwanese citizens."
"The United Kingdom and Ireland have already set a good example in this regard."
"Secondly, a recent European report demonstrated very clearly that there would be enormous benefits for both Taiwan and the European Union in agreeing trade enhancing measures (TEM)."
"Does the Commission agree with this urgent conclusion?"
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to lend my full support to those of my fellow Members who have already argued for the ending of Taiwan's incredible international isolation."
"Such isolation is truly intolerable, certainly when it comes to people's lives, wherever they may be."
"(FI) Mr President, Taiwan met with human disaster on a huge scale on 8 August."
"The incident took a heavy toll and the economic damage was immense."
"Now it is time for us to help."
"It is time for us to show solidarity with the citizens of Taiwan."
"We have to show compassion, but, in addition, we have to give financial support, and, as the Commissioner said here, we have to adopt crisis management tools now."
"We now have to provide the Taiwanese with all the help that is humanly possible."
"I also wish to express my support for the idea of longer-term assistance to Taiwan as proposed by Mr Tannock, for the best possible results, and so that we can show that they too are human beings and, above all, they are our friends."
"(PL) I would like to thank the Commissioner for this information."
"However, my question is of a slightly different nature."
"Taiwan has most recently been struck by tragedy."
"However, we are fully aware of the fact that many disasters of this kind have occurred in the past, and that many more will occur in the future."
"Therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner the following question."
"Does the European Union, and the Commission in particular, have any standard procedures in place for dealing with this kind of situation?"
"Is there an emergency action package or provisions for specific countries?"
"Is there also a long-term plan of action?"
"I think it would be unfortunate if we reacted to these tragedies in different ways, depending on the situation in different countries."
"I think that, as is the case in the military forces, we have to establish certain standard procedures in crisis situations."
"That is what I wanted to ask the Commissioner."
"(NL) Mr President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, like many groups in this House, sympathises with the population of Taiwan and we are pleased that the Commission reacted as it did."
"The Commission must continue in this vein."
"The big problem, however, alongside this human catastrophe, is, of course, Taiwan's isolation."
"It is quite possible to maintain a one-China policy whilst at the same time establishing good working relations with Taiwan."
"Taiwan could easily play its part in the World Health Organization as an observer."
"The same applies to the World Meteorological Organization and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"All of this is possible and is no obstacle to the one-China policy."
"I agree with Mr Belder when it comes to relaxing the visa regime and I also concur with the good things he had to say about Mr Goedhart, the Dutch representative in Taipei."
"I think, therefore, that there is no need for us to continue isolating Taiwan."
"Working relations, that is what it is about."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to express my deep condolences to the families of those who died during the Morakot typhoon."
"It is regrettable that hundreds have died, others lost their loved ones, and many more were injured."
"As many observers have noted, the number of victims could have been lower if the Government had reacted in a more coordinated manner to the typhoon."
"The Government failed to predict the seriousness of the tropical storm approaching the island."
"At the same time, we know that Taiwan has a highly developed high-tech sector and is one of the largest manufacturers of GPS systems in the world."
"Part of the blame should be attributed to the fact that Taiwan is not yet a member of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), as has already been mentioned by some colleagues."
"Taiwan could have been better pre-warned if the WMO provided it with timely information."
"I am therefore convinced that the time is right again to raise the issue of Taiwan's membership in the WMO, not only for political reasons but also for humanitarian ones."
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, the typhoon which struck Taiwan has affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed tens of thousands of dwellings."
"The humanitarian aid provided by the European Union must be unconditional."
"The aim is to help victims as quickly as possible."
"The European Union is an active donor, working with non-governmental organisations and the United Nations' specialist agencies to provide funds for medical treatment, logistical support and the reconstruction of devastated areas."
"The Copenhagen Conference will have a great deal to discuss, and we are preparing to take some measures aimed at a future post-Kyoto agreement on reducing polluting emissions."
"Therefore, we are mostly discussing measures for reducing the causes that lead to climate change."
"As part of the Copenhagen Conference, I would like to call for particular attention to be focused as well on adaptation measures, as we will continually have to deal with powerful storms, flooding, prolonged drought or forest fires."
"I also urge the European Union to provide humanitarian support to Taiwan, along with support for reconstruction and, in particular, for the population."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will take the questions in order."
"First of all, on the assistance which the Commission is providing to Taiwan to meet the ongoing needs of its people, which was the main point of the question by Mr Mann: Taiwan has been informed of the Commission's post-disaster needs-assessment mechanism, but we have not received any requests so far."
"If such a request comes, we will take it into consideration."
"Then, on the Commission position regarding the current state of cross-Strait relations, which was the question from Mr Boştinaru, the Commission welcomes the rapprochement between Taiwan and China during the last year."
"This has made it possible to improve cross-Strait relations, reducing tensions between the two, and to promote bilateral issues such as direct air and sea links."
"We strongly support the bilateral discussions between the two parties that may allow further progress."
"We also welcome the Chinese assistance."
"On the question concerning the participation of Taiwan in the World Meteorological Organisation from Mrs Lulling and Mrs Andrikienė, and also from Mr van Baalen and Mr Tannock: in line with the position expressed by the European Union in a statement issued in September 2008 and the EU's One China policy, the European Commission supports, where appropriate, the meaningful participation of Taiwan in international organisations."
"We will continue to do so."
"On the questions from Mrs Lulling and Mr Mann, as to the assistance provided, the Community's Civil Protection Mechanism provided assistance from Sweden and Poland."
"This help was received with gratitude which was acknowledged by President Ma to Commission President Barroso."
"On the question concerning the visit by the Dalai Lama to Taiwan in the aftermath of the typhoon, the visit by the Dalai Lama was a decision taken by the Taiwanese authorities, and the European Commission has no comment on it."
"On the question raised by Mr Belder, about the Commission position on granting visa-free access to Taiwanese visiting the EU: the Commission is considering, within the framework of the revision of the appropriate legislation, the possibility of updating the list of countries and entities which may not be subject to visa requirements in respect of visits to the European Union, especially the Schengen Area, and in this context it will also consider the case of Taiwan."
"Coming to the question by Mr Zemke on the issue of standard procedures in the event of disasters and how we will proceed in future in such cases, the Commission focuses on two priorities: the first is continuing work on preparedness and response, and the second is the prevention of disasters."
"First, we deem it important to ensure the availability of EU assistance at all times."
"With Parliament's support, in 2008 we launched a pilot project and a preparatory action on the EU rapid-response capability."
"From this initial experience, if appropriate, the Commission will present further proposals for the development of the EU rapid-response capability, funded from national resources earmarked for EU operations."
"Second, we aim to have a comprehensive approach to disaster prevention at EU level."
"In February 2009 the Commission published a communication on a Community approach to the prevention of natural and man-made disasters."
"We would welcome Parliament's feedback on this communication."
"The debate is closed."
"1."
"Murder of human rights activists in Russia"
"I have received six motions for a resolution concerning the murders of human rights lawyers in Russia (Rule 122)."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, we really ought to spare a thought here for the human rights activists who were recently murdered in the North Caucasus and light a candle in memory of them."
"We have to remember that Natalia Estemirova, Zarema Sadulayeva, Alik Dzhabrailov and many others who have suffered and lost their lives in their defence of human rights deserve the support of all of us."
"Unfortunately, we were not able to support them enough while they were alive."
"It is alarming that Russia has not been able to conduct criminal investigations rigorous enough to solve these murders and bring the guilty to justice."
"I have noted that the European Union has communicated with Russia officially on the subject."
"Quite obviously, however, our efforts are insufficient, and we will have to consider seriously how we can make the rule of law work in Russia and how we can raise this issue's profile a lot higher when we negotiate the new partnership and cooperation agreement with that country ."
"We also need to think about how we might support human rights defenders in Russia better than we do now."
"We should discuss whether we could offer protection to those in danger and whether the EU institutions can arrange visas for them promptly, so that they can escape from Russia, where they and their lives are at risk."
"In the opinion of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is important that the European Parliament should have a centre which disseminates information on the situation of human rights activists whose lives are in danger and which endeavours to help them in collaboration with the other institutions."
"There is much we can do."
"Anna Politkovskaya once said that the West can do so much, but the West does so little."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I am going to use the brief amount of time I have to clarify the position of my group, which did not sign the joint declaration and which is tabling a separate resolution."
"I would like to tell you, firstly, that we are fully in agreement with the joint resolution with regard to Natalia Estemirova, Zarema Sadulayeva and Alik Dzhabrailov."
"We have been shocked by these new assassinations which, in fact, are just a sample of the assassinations of human rights activists in Chechnya."
"In our resolution, we have called for exactly the same thing as the joint resolution calls for: we condemn the attack, we call for an enquiry, and we express our concern over the deterioration of human rights for militants in Russia."
"Where our position diverges is with regard to the additional reference in the joint resolution to all human rights defenders and to the situation in the North Caucasus region in general."
"We think that there may be other places in which to make these points - and I undertake to do so - particularly in the resolution that will precede the summit between the European Union and Russia."
"We would like this agenda on human rights activists and the protection of these activists to form part of that resolution, but also of all the negotiations that we have in the future with Russia."
"So, the problem here, I would add, is simply one of time and of place."
"This is a political issue that should be dealt with politically and not just here, when we are dealing with urgent cases."
"That is why we have decided to make the distinction but, of course, on the substance of the problem, we are fully in agreement with the other groups."
"author. - Mr President, allow me to present the Chamber with a few facts."
"Only this year in January, Stanislav Markelov, the human rights lawyer who represented the assassinated journalist Anna Politkovskaya, was gunned down in the middle of the afternoon in downtown Moscow."
"On the same occasion, Anastasia Baburova, a journalist who tried to protect him, was also shot and died."
"In July, Natalia Estemirova, a well-known Russian human rights activist and journalist, was found dead in Ingushetia after being abducted by armed men in neighbouring Chechnya."
"Less than a month later, another non-governmental activist, Zarema Sadulayeva, and her husband were abducted and killed."
"In August, journalist Malik Akhmedilov was shot dead shortly after leaving his home in Dagestan."
"Six outstanding journalists and human rights activists dead in less than eight months."
"These abductions and murders are only the peak of what results from the deterioration of the human rights situation in Russia, where independent voices, including lawyers, journalists and other activists, face increasing violence, threats and unjustified prosecution."
"Human rights violations in Russia, and especially in North Caucasus, can no longer be ignored."
"We cannot be so naive as to believe that super-powerful Russia, with one of the strongest intelligence services in the world, is not capable of finding the perpetrators and bringing them to justice."
"We all, regardless of our political colour, have to understand that impunity for attacks against human rights defenders will contribute to more violence and a growing culture of lawlessness."
"The Russian authorities must ensure the physical safety and freedom of movement and expression of human rights defenders, in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on human rights defenders."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, our former Oldest Member, Otto von Habsburg, was once asked whether he regretted being an MEP rather than an emperor."
"He said no, because if he was an emperor he would have to call a fool 'Your Excellency' but as an MEP he could call a fool a fool."
"I am reminded of this story when human rights issues come up."
"We are not a diplomatic body; we are a political parliamentary body."
"We can speak the truth."
"There is a saying that goes 'the fish stinks from the head down'."
"It is not the case - and I would like to thank Mrs Weber for giving such a clear speech - that these incidents and murders in the Caucasus are in any way random or the work of some dark force, but rather, since Mr Putin came to power, which is linked to the matter of Chechnya and the mysterious explosion of houses in Moscow, there has been a trail of blood there for years that always leads back to Chechnya and affects innocent people: civilians and, in particular, human rights activists who, like those mentioned - and many of these people were known to us personally - not only work for the human rights of Chechens but also for a democratic Russia, for an understanding between the peoples of Chechnya and Russia and for peace in the Caucasus."
"These people are being murdered one after the other."
"Mrs De Keyser, this is why it was necessary to hold an emergency debate."
"We will make ourselves a laughing stock if a woman who received praise in this House and who visited us in Strasbourg on account of her commitment to human rights is murdered in front of our eyes and we then postpone the debate on the subject to some later date."
"Russia is watching closely to see whether we are in a position to respond immediately - and we must respond immediately by saying very clearly: put an end to the murders, to the violation of human rights and grant freedom to Chechnya and Russia, but above all put an end to the systematic violation of human rights and murders in mysterious circumstances."
"author. - (PL) Once again, the issue of human rights violations in Russia has appeared on the European Parliament's agenda."
"In addition to the systematic persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, human rights activists are regularly being murdered."
"Journalists and NGO workers in Russia risk their lives every day in the course of their work."
"Threats, kidnappings, torture, arbitrary detentions and murders are becoming commonplace."
"The fact that the Russian authorities are not actively investigating these crimes, that no real results have been achieved and that the perpetrators remain at large, not only proves the complete ineffectiveness of the authorities' actions, but also their tacit consent and indifference."
"Respect for human rights should be a key issue in relations between the European Union and Russia."
"It is our duty to demand that Russia ensures that proper and effective investigations are implemented, that the perpetrators are punished and that it puts an end to these horrific murders."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a new MEP, let me start by saying that human rights issues are also extremely important to my party, the German Left, and that we condemn any violation of human rights - irrespective of where or by whom they are committed."
"That has nothing to do with interfering in national affairs."
"I have for years been genuinely concerned and outraged by the fact that, time and again, human rights activists involved with the situation in Chechnya are being murdered."
"Natalia Estemirova, Stanislav Markelov, Zarema Sadulayeva, these are examples of murders that are truly shocking."
"It is therefore important that we in this House concern ourselves with this issue."
"I am concerned that cases like the murder of Anna Politkovskaya are not investigated."
"If this process is now re-opened, I most sincerely hope that the perpetrators are found and arrested, because otherwise there is a risk of more bloodshed and it will be seen as a licence to commit acts of this kind. What we expect is simply for an immediate and full investigation to be carried out into these murders and for this matter to be dealt with ruthlessly, for Russia not to wait any longer but to take up the fight to protect human rights itself."
"It must not be the case that protecting human rights somehow condemns people to death."
"I also believe that the forthcoming EU-Russia summit needs to tackle these issues as a matter of urgency, and not merely as side issues, but with the prominence that they deserve."
"Personally, I also expect human rights issues to be discussed honestly in this House."
"I would have preferred not to debate issues such as these on Thursday afternoon and I believe this topic should also concern us even if it was about enterprise and trade."
"Such issues are often given secondary priority."
"That is what we want to change and that is also something I wanted to say here."
"Mr President, in a country with a high crime rate, one could put forward the theory that the deaths of human rights activists are a coincidence."
"They are coincidental because, generally speaking, many people fall victim to crime in these countries."
"Today, on 17 September, I have to remind you all of a sad anniversary, namely the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland."
"Following this invasion, Soviet troops shot at least 21 768 Polish citizens."
"Why have I mentioned this fact?"
"It is because the Russians now claim that this was an ordinary crime, in the same way that the murders of human rights activists are 'ordinary crimes'."
"The scale on which human rights activists are being murdered in Russia is such that to interpret this phenomenon as the result of 'ordinary crime' is utterly reckless."
"The theory that these murders are 'coincidental' is not a viable one."
"The systematic nature of these killings means that there has to be something in the political and social climate in Russia that has caused such frequent killings."
"The moral crisis in that country, a tendency to trivialise death, dehumanisation, relativism and vanishing values are to blame for the fact that this problem is not taken seriously."
"I think that our resolution is well-balanced and will help the Russians resolve this matter."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (LT) The Social Democrat Group cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia."
"The deaths of Anna Politkovskaya, Natalya Estemirova, Zarema Sadulayeva, Andrei Kulagin must not remain meaningless."
"We condemn utterly the perpetrators of these barbarous actions and the fact that sadly in some regions of Russia there is an atmosphere of impunity and political murders are not investigated."
"Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has promised that the perpetrators of the murders will be found and punished."
"His reaction was stronger than the previous president's, but so far these are only words."
"Time will tell if the Russian authorities are able to carry through the commitments made, so important to the country's citizens and the international community."
"In our opinion, evaluation in the proposed resolution of Russian actions in the Northern Caucasus has exceeded the resolution's area of application, therefore the social democrats have decided to adopt their own separate document."
"The social democrats are convinced that the human rights situation in Russia would really improve if EU-Russia human rights consultations were stepped up."
"The European Parliament, the State Duma, civil, social and human rights organisations in the EU and Russia should make an active contribution to these consultations."
"We stress that the protection of human rights must be discussed at length at the next meeting of the leaders of the EU and Russia."
"This matter is becoming an inherent part of the new agreement between the EU and Russia."
"(LT) This debate and the European Parliament resolution on the murder of human rights activists in Russia is particularly important, especially now as we hear one news report after another on the murders in Russia of the human rights defenders Natalya Estemirova, Alik Jabrailov, Zarema Sadulayeva and others."
"The European Union cannot remain indifferent to the brutal killing of human rights activists."
"In our relations with Russia we must underline and we do underline that investigations into these murders take too long and as a rule end without establishing who was guilty."
"Such an unacceptable practice is becoming the norm in Russia, especially in the case of crimes in Chechnya, where impunity is thriving."
"One of our fundamental values is respect for human rights, human dignity and human life, and no pragmatic interests can be above these values."
"I think that as a matter of honour Russian President Dmitry Medvedev should ensure that everything is done to fully investigate the kidnapping and murder cases involving human rights defenders, and to bring those who are guilty to justice."
"Mr President, the human rights situation in Russia has changed for the worse."
"We now call on the Russian authorities to do everything in their power to ensure the protection of human rights defenders."
"We know that the crucial thing that is lacking is a will to do that 'everything'."
"It can be done, as the Kremlin exercises a decisive influence on Russia's power structures and judiciary."
"Because of this, the failure of the Russian judiciary to protect human rights defenders makes one assume the complicity of the regime in these crimes."
"Our message today should be addressed to the EU governments and the Commission."
"As long as the Kremlin assumes that worries about the fate of human rights defenders remain on the level of declarations, with no consequences on economic relations, Mr Putin and Mr Medvedev can conclude that the EU has not been able to draw lessons from the blatant murder of Anna Politkovskaya."
"(PL) We are indeed discussing human rights violations in Russia on a day of significant symbolic value."
"Exactly 70 years ago, on 17 September 1939, the Red Army - in collusion with Hitler - occupied one third of Poland, which was then fighting against the German invasion."
"Stalin's forces murdered thousands of Poles, and hundreds of thousands were taken away to Soviet labour camps."
"In Katyń, thousands of Polish officers were murdered on Stalin's orders."
"To us, 17 September will forever remain a day of shame for Stalin's Russia."
"Today's Russia is not brave enough to face this horrific truth."
"Its current government is providing unconvincing justifications for their former alliance with Hitler."
"To this day, Moscow is refusing to grant access to the archives on the Katyń massacre."
"The histories of many countries contain horrific events."
"It is a measure of the maturity of a nation when it is able to confront its past and denounce that which needs to be denounced in its history."
"Today's Germany is an example of such an attitude."
"It is only then that the past will cease to be a burden for today's Russia and will allow it to enter the community of free and democratic nations with its head held high."
"Only then will Russia be able, once and for all, to drop the millstone of its Stalinist past from around its neck, and to stop fighting against its own citizens, who are currently risking their lives to defend fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"We honour the victims of those murders."
"We will remember you all."
"(PT) Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen."
"The murder of Natalia Estemirova prompted great sadness in all of us in this House, since we learnt of her abduction on the very day when we gathered here for the first time, and heard of her murder just a few hours later."
"That is something that cannot fail to move anyone, wherever in the world they may be."
"As my colleague Mrs Ernst has already said, I firmly believe that the left must defend human rights and the defenders of human rights everywhere, regardless of the country they are in."
"These attacks, this onslaught against human rights activists in Russia, have had very worrying effects."
"They work as intimidation and will certainly be extremely traumatic for all those who want to defend human rights in Russia."
"They are therefore the first layer in an offensive that will later result in the deterioration of the whole human rights situation, not to mention the human rights of the activists themselves."
"The effects of these murders are therefore unpredictable and worrying."
"Without a swift and effective judicial investigation and with no guarantee that the safety of human rights activists will be respected, the situation may in fact become extremely worrying."
"That is why I shall take great pleasure in voting in favour of this resolution and in following up its appeals to the Russian authorities to protect human rights activists."
"I come from Portugal, from the other end of Europe, and next week I shall be going to Russia."
"In fact, I am going to the Russian embassy tomorrow to get my visa."
"I believe that the relations between Europe and Russia are of the greatest importance and that Europe owes much to Russia."
"The first thing that Europe owes Russia is sincerity and clarity in the protection of the human rights and freedoms of our Russian fellow citizens of Europe."
"(FI) Mr President, your language is so beautiful that I decided to try to thank you in Hungarian: köszönöm."
"Mr Tavares, I would like to respond to your comments."
"Work on behalf of human rights is not just the concern of the left; it also concerns us on the centre-right, and let us hope this will encourage us to cooperate."
"Mrs Ernst mentioned something that is absolutely right."
"We are discussing this here, while in plenary most Members are already on their way home, and we have to work together to make this a political priority."
"I was once a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and when the Subcommittee on Human Rights was set up I was a member of that too."
"When I tabled amendments, sometimes I submitted them to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and my colleagues would ask why I was still tabling amendments on human rights there, as we had a Subcommittee on Human Rights for that."
"At the time I thought that something was wrong if our Subcommittee on Human Rights was to become a ghetto or human rights were to become the preserve of such a body."
"Let us work together to prevent this from happening to human rights."
"(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Posselt's statement has annoyed me."
"I would like to underline that Mrs De Keyser's achievements in defending human rights cannot be brought into question in a discussion of this nature. She has proven herself as a key person working on this issue in this House."
"I will not under any circumstances allow, and do not believe it is right for us to question the commitment of the S&D Group to the protection of human rights, because we also did this when your group, Mr Posselt, was attempting to trivialise the crimes at Guantanamo and the treatment of prisoners in Iraq by US troops."
"On the subject of human rights in Russia, there is indeed a serious problem, which we acknowledge, and the resolution which we are submitting is sufficiently tough and incisive."
"However, we do think this Parliament needs to focus on the issues, and not simply to come up every time with a long list of problems in our relations with Russia, when these have no effect over there."
"What we are doing in this respect is continuing to send a delegation from the S&D Group to talks in Moscow next week, where this particular issue will be raised."
"Do not use human rights emergencies like this one to produce a long list of issues."
"This is not the purpose of today's debate."
"(SK) I would like to express my sadness and profound disquiet over the events which took place in June this year in the Russian Federation."
"I feel shaken by the brutal murders of Russian activists such as Natalia Estemirova and Andrei Kulagin and others who were involved in supporting human rights and who advocated truth and justice."
"Every effort must be made to detain and punish the murderers."
"I welcome and support measures which must be taken in order to solve these murders."
"There was also a breach of international agreements in August 2008 when, during the conflict between Russia and Georgia, Russian armed forces attacked inhabited areas and failed to protect the civilian population from a violation of their rights by armed fighters from South Ossetia on territory which de facto came under Russian control."
"The Russian Government must state unequivocally that human rights violations will not be tolerated."
"Mr President, a culture of criminal impunity is developing in Russia with regard to the abuse of human rights activists."
"Journalists who dare to challenge the official view of things are harassed; ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from violent crime, which seems to go unsolved; campaigners for greater freedoms are at best marginalised and at worst forcibly silenced."
"It is hard to see precisely where the threat to human rights defenders in Russia comes from, but time and again we see wanton abuses going unpunished and a lackadaisical approach from the judicial authorities."
"Russia has got used to the equivocation of the EU."
"This is clear from the way the Union has reacted to Russia's bullying of Ukraine or Russia's invasion and occupation of sovereign Georgian territory last summer."
"Clearly there are vital strategic questions at stake in the EU having good relations with Russia, but we cannot allow these questions to erase our obligation to speak out for our fundamental freedoms and shared European common values, freedoms and values the Russian people themselves should be enabled to share fully in peace and security."
"(HU) I have been involved professionally for 25 years in protecting human rights."
"This is why, in particular as a lawyer, I feel a deep sense of sympathy when I think of my colleagues who have lost their lives in connection with this quite wonderful profession."
"I would also like, on this note, to express my sincere sympathy to their families and loved ones."
"What would be the right course of action at a time like this?"
"To call for an immediate, thorough investigation carried out by the relevant state agencies."
"I would like this Parliament to have the confidence and moral authority to do this."
"However, I am afraid this is not the case."
"Why?"
"Because such demands are only made of states outside the European Union."
"However, things are different when it comes to human rights being grossly violated in a European Union Member State, as happened in my country, Hungary, where people were shot in the eye at a mass gathering of several thousand people staged by the party of the man currently presiding this session, Vice-President Pál Schmitt, to commemorate the anniversary of the 1956 revolution and fight for freedom."
"This Parliament has not had any investigation conducted into this case and the crisis situation which has continued since then."
"I am afraid that as long as this does not happen and as long as someone who was a member of the government which sanctioned shooting at people can be Vice-Chairwoman of Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, , we cannot have any real confidence and the moral authority in another country, to ask for this kind of investigation to be carried out in a country outside the European Union."
"I would therefore ask you to propose and demand an immediate investigation into human rights violations in Hungary. Thank you."
"(RO) I wanted to say, first of all, that I am disappointed that, when the dairy crisis was being discussed, the chamber was full, and now, when human rights are being discussed, I do not think that there are any more than 40 of us left in the chamber."
"It is a pity that this is how things are."
"I am not saying that the dairy crisis is not important, but a problem such as human rights is of paramount political importance to each one of us."
"I would also like to say that I find unacceptable the whole idea that this year when, as is well known, many countries in Central and Eastern Europe are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the collapse of Communism, a power right on our doorstep, which was the originator of these Communist regimes, demonstrates such indifference to crimes perpetrated against human rights activists."
"I believe that the break with totalitarianism must be clearly affirmed by every one of us."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, today's debate on the situation of human rights defenders in Russia is timely and very appropriate."
"The recent wave of violence against human rights defenders has put the spotlight on the grave dangers they run in the course of their work."
"Many have paid the ultimate price for bringing to light violations of human rights."
"We pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives and to those who continue their work in such an environment."
"Much of the violence against human rights defenders has taken place in the North Caucasus, against the background of growing instability."
"The Commission knows many of them."
"They are highly respected partners in the implementation of human rights projects."
"Innocent civilians, law enforcement personnel and government officials have lost their lives in the ongoing struggle in the region."
"Violence against human rights defenders is not restricted to the North Caucasus."
"There are reports of activists, lawyers and independent journalists across the Russian Federation facing violence, harassment and intimidation."
"The EU must continue to speak out against this violence and insist that Russia uphold the commitments it has entered into as a member of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"It is crucial that the attacks and violent deaths of civil society activists are properly investigated and that the perpetrators are promptly identified and punished."
"It is only through the effective and lawful prosecution of these killings that the climate of fear and impunity can be dissipated."
"President Medvedev has spoken out against what he has termed the 'legal nihilism' prevailing in Russia."
"The EU stands ready to support Russia in its continuing reform of the judicial system."
"The EU highly values the opportunity it has to discuss its concerns on human rights with the Russian authorities."
"We welcome the more open attitude President Medvedev has taken to discussions with the EU on these issues."
"The next EU-Russia summit is another opportunity to continue these discussions."
"This must be complemented by exchanges among experts."
"The regular EU-Russia human rights consultations offer an opportunity to broaden the scope of these discussions and the range of interlocutors with whom we discuss human rights issues."
"The safety of human rights defenders must be the first concern."
"We urge the Russian authorities to make every possible effort to ensure that those who work on shedding light on violations of human rights are able to do so without fear of violence or intimidation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."

"Kazakhstan: the case of Yevgeny Zhovtis"
"I have received five motions for a resolution concerning Kazakhstan: the Yevgeny Zhovtis case (Rule 122)."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to make a final comment on the debate we have just had and say that, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I recently sent a letter to the Conference of Committee Chairs, asking it to consider bringing these discussions forward, so that Parliament may be fully attended and also so that the Council can have a more prominent role here in the discussion."
"I hope that my fellow Members in the various groups will discuss this matter with their groups' chairmen, as Parliament's authority is continually being gnawed away at because there are so few of us here at any one time."
"Now let us turn to the Zhovtis case."
"Kazakhstan is an important Central Asian country, and it will assume the Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe next year."
"It is therefore not a matter of indifference how crimes are judged in a country that will be at the head of the democratic aspirations of all countries over a vast area of Europe."
"Accordingly, we should focus attention on the case of human rights defender Yevgeny Zhovtis."
"He was found guilty of manslaughter in very suspicious circumstances and sentenced to four years in an open prison for running over a pedestrian in July this year."
"We have to take into account the fact that the OSCE has been wondering whether the procedure to which Zhovtis was subjected was possibly in violation of the principle of a fair trial, which is guaranteed in Kazakhstan's constitution."
"The European Parliament also needs to keep this debate going with the Council and the Commission, so that they might raise the issue of this case and demand a fair trial."
"Mr President, the European Parliament can have a powerful influence on the extent to which the countries of Central Asia endorse the principle of the rule of law by keeping a record of these individual cases, and the case of Yevgeny Zhovtis is without a doubt one of these."
"author. - (LT) As the time approaches when it will chair the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, sadly Kazakhstan is distancing itself from commitments on alignment with European standards."
"Unjustifiably underlining its unique and special nature, the country shows no regard for the OSCE's recommendations on electoral laws and freedom of the press."
"Repeated violations of human rights and the direct persecution of human rights defenders increasingly raise doubts as to whether this state is suitable to head an organisation which fights for the implementation of democratic principles."
"We urge Astana to make concrete progress in the areas of democratisation, the protection of human rights, the rule of law and freedom of the press."
"Kazakh laws which are based on international law must be applied appropriately and transparently in legal proceedings against the human rights activists Yevgeny Zhovtis, Yesingepov and Dubanov."
"We must hope and demand that judgments are impartial and that the prisoners' involvement in the human rights movement does not influence the verdict."
"We urge the Council to raise the matter of these human rights defenders' cases at the next EU-Kazakhstan Human Rights Dialogue Meeting in October."
"We call on the European Commission to offer intensive assistance to Kazakhstan as it prepares to chair the OSCE, to ensure that this important international organisation is not compromised."
"author. - Mr President, first of all I would like to express my sympathy to the family of the victims of the car accident in which Mr Yevgeny Zhovtis was involved."
"A human tragedy which unfortunately occurred where a man lost his life."
"At the same time, please allow me to express my concern in relation to the current situation of Mr Yevgeny Zhovtis."
"Indisputably every person who commits a criminal offence must accept that legal sanctions will be applied undiscriminatingly and Mr Zhovtis, as an outstanding human rights lawyer, knows this better than anybody."
"But at the same time we want to make sure that the Kazakh authorities do not use this unfortunate situation to punish Mr Zhovtis for anything else other than the car accident in which he was involved."
"Mr Zhovtis must not be punished for his human rights activity and for being a very critical voice of the Kazakh Government."
"Therefore, I think it is of the utmost importance that the Kazakh judicial authorities carry out immediately, and with full respect for transparency and the rule of law, a second full and fair investigation into the circumstances related to the incident and to a review of Mr Zhovtis' conviction and sentence."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that my group was somewhat surprised to see the judicial evaluation of a dramatic car accident on the agenda as an urgent resolution on human rights issues."
"For the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) it is therefore important to establish that we do not in principle wish to question the judgments made by an independent court, unless we are talking about an obvious show trial that does not comply with any principles of law."
"We have already seen this in Iran."
"There must be a clear line drawn here."
"As far as we are concerned, an independent judicial system is the key element of any democratic order."
"That being the case, we must first take account of the judgment handed down."
"We must also acknowledge the fact that a person has been killed in a car accident - and we should be saddened by that, indeed we are saddened by that - but also that a judicial review has been carried out."
"The fact that Yevgeny Zhovtis, a well-known civil rights activist, is involved in this case has brought it to the attention of the world and has prompted the response, as a result of which we are discussing this here today."
"The PPE Group acknowledges Kazakhstan's efforts and progress towards democracy and the rule of law."
"We would like to assure Kazakhstan of our explicit support and encourage this country to continue resolutely along this path."
"With regard to this particular case, we urge the Kazakh authorities, in their own interests, to provide the public with as much information as possible and to present their view on these events, and to enable a fair appeal or review procedure to be carried out for Mr Zhovtis under the rule of law."
"Kazakhstan is to chair the OSCE."
"That will be quite a challenge!"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I have to agree with Mrs Jeggle."
"I am utterly astonished that, in front of the whole Parliament here in Strasbourg, we are having an urgent debate on a traffic accident in Kazakhstan, albeit an accident where somebody was tragically killed and where the driver of the car happens to a human rights activist who has been duly sentenced in a court of law to four years in prison - but even in a low-security prison, which has suddenly become, in the terms of the resolution, 'a labour camp'."
"I am afraid that bringing this kind of matter before this House really brings the reputation of this House into disrepute and it means that the good work that we try to do in human rights is devalued, when we start talking about traffic accidents."
"Are we seriously suggesting the Kazakh Government threw a civilian under the car wheels of a human rights activist?"
"Are we seriously suggesting that the sentence is too harsh for somebody who was convicted of manslaughter?"
"We cannot go on traducing a country like Kazakhstan, simply because of political motivation, to try and bring down their reputation before they chair the OSCE next year."
"This is politically motivated, and it is a disgrace that it is on the agenda."
"I hope the House will throw out these resolutions and support the amendments."
"(PL) Mr President, I have similar doubts to the previous speaker, Mr Stevenson."
"Kazakhstan is an important country."
"It is making a lot of effort in terms of its progress towards democracy."
"Of course, at the moment, it is not a model of democratic freedoms, but the civil rights situation in that country - and I know Kazakhstan a little, as I have visited it on a number of occasions - is considerably better than in most of the neighbouring countries in the region, and it fortunately does not have the sort of problems that exist in Russia, for example, and which we have just been discussing."
"I share Mr Stevenson's view that the European Parliament should not use all its authority to state its position on a single, dramatic court case."
"It may be the case that some clarification is needed in this instance, but certainly not a European Parliament resolution."
"This would undermine the value of the resolution, and people will stop listening to the voice of the European Parliament if it becomes distracted by issues that do not deserve a general debate or a parliamentary resolution."
"(FI) Mr President, Kazakhstan has an important role to play in Central Asia both economically and in terms of security policy, and the country's cooperation with the European Union has grown."
"It was pleasing to hear Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Marat Tashin promise last year in anticipation of the Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and again in May this year, improvements to the country's human rights situation."
"Despite the international attention, however, there has been tighter control of the media and there are poor standards of freedom of religion."
"In addition, we have heard of several cases of the arbitrary arrest of human rights activists."
"The sentence handed down to the human rights activist Yevgeny Zhovtis also makes one wonder, and it is in the Government of Kazakhstan's own interests to lay these doubts to rest in every respect, and that is unquestionably the case in view of its forthcoming term of office chairing the OSCE."
"We hope for the best and look forward to seeing these matters cleared up."
"(DE) Mr President, first of all I would like to say that I am pleased to see Mrs Hautala back here."
"However, she has not been here for a few years and during this time we have had the Council on Thursday afternoons."
"The Czech and the German Presidencies were here on Thursdays."
"I do not think that we should move the debate, as we cannot get through everything on Wednesday, so we need to be here and we need to force the Council to be here on Thursday afternoons as well."
"That is the solution, not condensing the whole agenda into Wednesday."
"This is actually a very difficult case."
"However, precisely because we cannot yet fully trust the Government of Kazakhstan in respect of the rule of law, we must insist that the case is investigated in an objective manner."
"In this regard, I fully support Mrs Jeggle."
"We have therefore signed the resolution."
"This matter must be investigated objectively and nothing must be covered up or glossed over."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission has noted with concern reports of procedural violations during the trial of Kazakh human rights defender Mr Yevgeny Zhovtis, who has been convicted of manslaughter following a fatal road accident."
"As you are aware, the Kazakh authorities have rejected claims that the judgment against Mr Zhovtis was politically motivated."
"The Commission fully supports the EU Presidency statement on this case at the OSCE Permanent Council of 10 September."
"Given the seriousness of the alleged flaws in the investigations and the court trial, we call on Kazakhstan, which is the incoming chair of the OSCE, to ensure that the appeal is handled with full respect for national law and international standards."
"The Commission will continue to follow this case closely."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"3."
"Syria: the case of Muhannad Al Hassani"
"I have received six motions for a resolution concerning Syria: the Muhannad Al Hassani case (Rule 122)."
"author. - Mr President, I would like to present the case of Mr Muhannad Al Hassani."
"He has been imprisoned because he defends the human rights of his compatriots in Syria."
"He played a very important role because he observed all trials before the Supreme State Security Court and made regular evaluations of detention conditions in Syria."
"He is now himself detained and imprisoned."
"With regard to Syria, we ask that it fulfil its obligations and therefore comply with the international covenant on civil and political rights and with the UN Convention against torture, to which Syria is actually a party; that Syria reverse its policy of repression against human rights defenders and their families; and that it release the human rights defenders, prisoners of conscience and peace activists who are in prison."
"We also have a request with regard to the EU."
"With respect to the signature of an association agreement we, the Greens and EFA, have proposed the adoption of a road map prior to the signature of the Association Agreement which would articulate our objectives in terms of improvements to be made in the human rights field."
"International law sets a series of obligations that states have to respect, and it is also our responsibility, and in particular of the entire EU, to ensure that respect thereof enters the association agreement as a way to enforce that further."
"We will work in that direction."
"Thank you for your support for the resolution."
"Mr President, I admit that I am both confused and also quite sad and disappointed."
"I am confused because, undoubtedly, in terms of international relations, Syria has made great progress over the past two years."
"It has joined the Union for the Mediterranean."
"It has, on various occasions, acted as a mediator in difficult international situations, including very recently when a young French woman was arrested in Iran."
"I would say that the fact that the association agreement - which is not yet signed, Mrs Brantner, but which could be fairly soon - the fact that this association agreement has been relaunched is, at the same time, a very positive sign."
"On the domestic front, it is true that there are also some very positive developments in Syria."
"Syrians have taken in 1.5 million Iraqi refugees, and they are looking after them, they have a high level of education, and they have freedom of religion, which is important."
"However, in terms of political freedom and political plurality, there has been absolutely no progress."
"To my enormous regret, we continue to see instances of repression and imprisonment of human rights activists and defenders, and we have intervened on several occasions over the last few years to request the release of political prisoners."
"On two occasions, we have succeeded in obtaining a release."
"Syrian prisons still contain, however, people such as Dr Al Labwani, Dr Al Bunni and, now, Mr Al Hassani."
"I would therefore like to address a message to Syria: we are here and we would like to help Syria to escape the isolation in which it has been placed at some point."
"We think that it is an important figure on the international stage, and particularly for peace in the Middle East."
"Please, though, for your own image - and I think that you are strong enough to allow political plurality and human rights defenders in your country - please, release the political prisoners, and, as we have said, please abide by the convention against torture and degrading treatment!"
"This is in Syria's own interests and in the interests of peace throughout the world, and particularly of peace in the Middle East."
"author. - Mr President, Muhannad Al Hassani is another human rights defender arbitrarily detained by the Syrian authorities."
"He is another Syrian political prisoner whose only guilt was his wish to protect the right of the people to freely express themselves, their right to engage in political activities and their right to a fair trial."
"For more than five years he was forbidden to travel."
"His office telephone communications and e-mails were under constant surveillance by Syrian security forces."
"After weeks of increasing harassment over his role in monitoring the practices of Syria's Supreme State Security Court, he was in the end arrested by the Syrian state security and later charged with several criminal offences, all referring to his right to free speech."
"On the topic of arbitrary detention, let us not forget Mr al-Labwani, the outstanding human rights defender, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for what the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention considered to be 'the peaceful expression of his political views'."
"The Syrian Government must free Mr Al Hassani, Mr al-Labwani and the other political prisoners immediately and unconditionally and guarantee their physical and psychological integrity in all circumstances."
"The Syrian authorities must put an end to all forms of harassment against Syrian human rights defenders and civil society activists, in accordance with the provisions of the 1998 UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders."
"author. - Mr President, Syria is an important country in the Middle East and has a vital role to play in reducing the ability of Iran to support terrorist actions, via its proxies Hezbollah and Hamas, against Israel."
"Syria also has a habit of fomenting unrest in Lebanon, which Syria still regards as barely sovereign and within its sphere of influence."
"Syria is also a secular regime."
"In fact, it remains the only vestige now of the once powerful Ba'athist Party which ruled Iraq as well, so things like women's rights are advanced."
"However, overall it remains a brutal one-party dictatorship."
"The detention of Muhannad Al Hassani as a leading human rights defender is alarming."
"If Syria really wants us to support an EU association agreement, it should please release Mr Al Hassani immediately and end the persecution of human rights defenders such as Mr Al Hassani."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, I am pleased that we have had the courage to put the spotlight on the human rights situation in Syria at this point in time."
"The finishing touches are being put to an EU-Syria association agreement within the framework of Mediterranean cooperation, and because one of the fundamental pillars of cooperation consists specifically of the promotion of human rights and democracy, I think that the EU should call more loudly for improvements in this area."
"It is not enough just to focus cooperation on improving the economic situation."
"As we have heard, the leading Syrian human rights lawyer, Muhannad Al Hassani, was imprisoned at the end of July without any proper trial."
"He was charged with weakening national sentiments and spreading false news."
"The case is not the first of its kind. We in Parliament last intervened in a similar one in 2007."
"Kamal Abwani, whose cause we were pleading then, is still in jail, although in March the UN investigation team reached the conclusion that it had been an arbitrary arrest."
"Syria has a very long way to go when it comes to freedom of speech and of association."
"The work of NGOs in the country is problematic and thus virtually nonexistent."
"It will be highly regrettable if we in the EU do not have the courage to set clear criteria for a basis for cooperation with Syria."
"In my opinion, the onus is very much on us to demand the release of political prisoners and compliance with international human rights agreements before we can move on with the EU -Syria association agreement."
"Human rights in the world are not just a lot of solitary islands: they are a fabric, in which everything has an impact on everything else, and if we tolerate neglect and turn a blind eye, that will eat away at our own rights here before very long."
"It is our important duty to nurture them and ensure that they are implemented always and everywhere."
"Only in that way can we make human life worthwhile."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PL) In July, Mr Muhannad Al Hassani, one of the most prominent Syrian human rights activists, was arrested."
"During a trial held behind closed doors, to which lawyers were not granted access, he was accused of weakening national sentiments and disseminating false information."
"He had previously already been interrogated on a number of occasions in connection with his activities in the field of human rights and efforts to defend people arrested for political reasons."
"He was also denied the right to leave the country."
"Mr Muhannad Al Hassani took part in monitoring the Supreme Court's proceedings as, in the view of Human Rights Watch, the conditions under which these proceedings take place do not meet international standards."
"We are concerned that human rights activists are being repressed in Syria, especially in view of the lack of progress the Syrian authorities are making in the field of human rights."
"We need to insist that Syria respects the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment."
"In view of existing political, economic and cultural ties between Syria and the European Union, and the significant role that this country has in terms of fostering stability in the Middle East, I am sure that Syria can make progress in this field, thereby also contributing to the democratisation of the whole region."
"(DE) Mr President, this motion for a resolution is essentially absolutely right, as it is, of course, our duty, particularly in view of the planned association agreement, to state our views clearly, including with regard to the protection of the family, relatives and fellow fighters of Muhannad Al Hassani and also to insist on the demands of Article 2 of the agreement, not least because we Europeans know from the painful experiences of our past what it means for human rights to be trampled underfoot."
"It was only two decades ago that a communist terrorist regime collapsed in central and south-eastern Europe."
"In this regard, however, I would warn against turning a blind eye if in Turkey, which is in the same area as Syria, human rights are not respected in the way they should be."
"This is even more important given that Turkey is a candidate for accession to the EU with significant shortcomings in the areas of the administration of justice, the penal system, the protection of minorities and religious freedom, even if a biased report from an allegedly independent Commission or the Ahtisaari report give a different impression."
"(DE) Mr President, I believe that we should, of course, be very critical of the human rights situation in Syria."
"It is a dictatorship and a police state."
"Mr Al Hassani must be released."
"However, we must also take note of the fact that President Assad - who is becoming more open and opening up his country - and also his father, as Alevites, have, for example, supported the coexistence of Muslims and Christians in such a way that a leading Syrian Christian, Cardinal Daud, told me that Christians in Syria feel safer than they do in Iraq, which is protected by Western troops."
"We should therefore be discriminating in our dealings with Syria, denounce the violations of human rights and not give in and stop supporting the country along its path towards rapprochement and openness."
"Of course we should be critical, but we should also acknowledge that there are the beginnings of something here that we should encourage."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament with regard to the human rights situation in Syria."
"Our assessment is that the situation has deteriorated over recent months, with more arbitrary detentions, harassment of human rights defenders and travel bans."
"The arrest on 28 August of Mr Muhannad Al Hassani - a well known lawyer, President of the National Organisation for Human Rights in Syria and a member of the Damascus Bar Association for 15 years - is the most recent example."
"Mr Al Hassani is a human rights defender and one might suspect that his arrest is politically motivated."
"The EU has already expressed its concerns to the Syrian authorities."
"Syria must observe its international commitments, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Syria is a state party."
"The Commission, through its delegation in Damascus, together with Member States' embassies, are discussing how to more effectively and efficiently act in defence of human rights' defenders."
"Clearly, we have to continue calling for actions to protect human rights defenders and to ensure the observation of trials at the Supreme State Security Court."
"We must continue to support the civil society through our instruments, such as the non-state actors and the European instrument for democracy and human rights budget lines, and give moral support to the families."
"Despite being important, these actions are, nevertheless, insufficient."
"We believe the EU would have a stronger leverage on Syria if the association agreement was signed."
"I am glad that the Presidency is contemplating its signature in the coming weeks."
"With this agreement we will establish a regular dialogue to advise on these issues and achieve better results."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law(debate)"

"Murder of human rights activists in Russia (vote)"
"(CS) I am very sorry, Mr President, I would just like it to go on record that I voted from another seat by mistake - my seat is 107 and I voted from 67, in other words with another Member's card."
"That apart, I am in favour."
"I simply sat by mistake in the seat of another Member who has an inserted card and I voted from his card, which is against our rules of procedure, so please could it go on record that I am in favour of the motion and that the vote of my fellow Member is invalid."
"Thank you."

"Statements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, in opening today's plenary session, I should like to say a few words about the referendum which took place last Friday."
"I am very pleased with the result."
"It was a great day for Ireland and a great day for Europe."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to say that when the result was announced, I was at the other end of Europe, in Sicily, and there the result was received just as you have received it - with applause."
"In many other places throughout Europe, people were also delighted with the Irish result."
"The Irish have sent a clear signal that they want to continue to be at the heart of a united continent."
"Míle buíochas do mhuintir na hÉireann."
"A thousand thanks, and congratulations on the result of the referendum."
"I said it in Irish, perhaps not very accurately, but that is more or less how it sounds."
"The European Union has demonstrated that it can listen to the justified fears of its citizens and respond appropriately."
"The guarantees given to Ireland proved to be satisfactory, and convinced the voters that the Treaty of Lisbon will benefit their country."
"It was a victory for civil society, and is a good argument in the continuing debate in other Member States."
"I would like to underline the large role played by employers, trades unions, farmers' and fishermen's organisations, and also by the Church and social leaders."
"This helped to win the referendum."
"I would also like to congratulate the Irish Government and opposition, and also one of my predecessors, Pat Cox, who led the 'Ireland for Europe' campaign."
"Congratulations to Pat Cox!"
"(Applause)"
"I am confident that the process of ratification will be continued and will end with success in the two remaining Member States."
"I have received an assurance from the President of Poland, that now, when the Irish referendum has returned a positive result, he will sign the Treaty of Lisbon without delay."
"(Applause)"
"I hope that President Václav Klaus will do the same as soon as the Czech Constitutional Court resolves all remaining doubts."
"The objective of the Treaty of Lisbon is to prepare the European Union for the challenges of the 21st century."
"We have to face up to the fears of our citizens about energy issues, rising unemployment, immigration and climate change."
"We will have to act together, just as we have done many times in the past, and we must not forget that the key to success is the principle of European solidarity."
"There is much work before us, but we now have the essential tools, so let us not hesitate to use them."
"I would like to make one more important comment on the Irish referendum."
"We cannot forget those who voted 'No'."
"It has become our tradition to think about all Europeans, respecting their views and their right to a different opinion."
"Those who voted 'No' also want to tell us something."
"They want to convince us of something, and, most important of all, they want to warn us about something."
"We take that warning on board, and we will also take their vote into account, but we are extremely pleased that the decided majority of the Irish people said 'Yes', and that they support a common Europe."
"I myself am determined to work hard at helping you to feel that our common Europe is also your Europe - and we will write the story of Europe's future together."
"I would like to move on to two other matters."
"They are sad matters."
"I should like to recall a great tragedy, and in this way commemorate the victims of the mudslides in the vicinity of Messina in Sicily."
"I have already issued a statement on behalf of the European Parliament, expressing our condolences to the families and friends."
"I was in Italy at the time, and offered condolences publicly to our friends, partners and all Italians."
"Before we begin, I would also like to recall the fact that today marks the third anniversary of the death of the Russian human rights campaigner, journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Her murderers have still not been brought to justice."
"Anna is not, however, the only victim."
"Let us, on this occasion, also remember other social activists who have been murdered in the last three years."
"Mr President, when you spoke to us presenting your candidacy as President of the European Parliament, you said that you were going to be a very objective figure and an objective chair."
"I have to say that you have just made a speech on the Irish referendum - I did stand up when you were speaking, but you were locked into your text - that was one of the most subjective, partisan speeches I have ever heard, and inappropriate from an objective chairman."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"You probably did not listen to the whole of my speech!"

"Order of business"
"The final version of the draft order of business as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 17 September 2009 pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Mrs Bauer's report on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities has been rejected following a vote in committee."
"In addition, the following reports were not received in time:"
"Mr Böge's reports"
"on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund: Italy, the Abruzzo earthquake and"
"on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: Germany - telecommunications sector, and"
"Mrs Haug's report - Draft amending budget 9/2009: earthquake in Italy."
"These four reports have, therefore, been removed from the order of business."
"Mr President, as regards the two reports on the use of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the benefit of the telecommunications industry in Germany and the Solidarity Fund for the tragedy which occurred in Abruzzo in Italy, the Committee on Budgets adopted the four reports at the beginning of the week, but not in time for translations to be prepared."
"I merely wished to correct what you said: these reports have been adopted in committee."
"There is no legal obstacle."
"They were even adopted unanimously."
"Thank you for that comment."
"It is a pertinent comment."
"Nonetheless, these reports are not on the order of business, because they have not yet been translated."
"There was not enough time."
"I share your opinion entirely."
"I am sorry. I went too far in what I said."
"Before Mr Lamassoure's statement, I made two proposals for changes."
"The first was for the Council statement on the situation in Guinea to be placed on the agenda as the second item."
"The second was about voting on motions for resolutions on passenger compensation."
"I would like to ask if there are any motions on these matters?"
"We do not want to confuse items."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, and also speaking on behalf of Mr La Via, I would like to take the floor briefly just to express our disappointment over the postponement of the vote on mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for the Abruzzo region."
"The vote has been postponed by two weeks and will take place during the part-session in Strasbourg."
"Although we realise that there are technical reasons for it, we also understand that some people are still living in tents - and L'Aquila and its region, Abruzzo, are some of the coldest areas in Italy."
"We simply wish to emphasise the importance of changing and streamlining the procedures for mobilising this fund."
"We must act in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"It was difficult to do the translations in such a short time, and the rule which we apply in such a case is deferral of the matter."
"I am also very sorry about this, but I would like us to proceed and work through our agendas item by item, because otherwise we will end up with enormous confusion."
"A moment ago, I asked about two things: the Council statement on the situation in Guinea, and voting on motions for resolutions on passenger compensation."
"Are there any questions about this?"
"There are no questions."
"The discussion is closed."
"(Parliament accepted these proposals)"
"(IT) Mr President, my apologies for going back to the subject of Abruzzo."
"It is true that we all have respect for people who have suffered an earthquake, but we cannot celebrate only when things happen and not respond when it is within our means to do so."
"I agree with Mrs Matera and call on the Chamber, which remains sovereign, to approve the release of the Solidarity Fund, without translation if necessary."
"I do not believe that problems of this type should exist when we have tragic situations to deal with."
"(Applause)"
"Colleagues, those remarks were very important."
"We must overcome these difficulties."
"I will ask the services whether it is possible to deliver some crucial translations by tomorrow, and then we can vote tomorrow as well."
"It is a very urgent decision."
"(Applause)"
"It is, of course, against our rules, but I think this time we should do it, so it will be organised."
"In connection with the Commission statement on freedom of information in Italy, I have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for this item to be withdrawn from the order of business."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I call for Parliament to make a statement on the withdrawal of the debate on freedom of the press in Italy and then on the vote on a resolution on the same subject."
"Every person of good faith knows that my group, the PPE, is deeply attached to the defence of freedom of expression and the freedom of the press."
"(Protests)"
"(Applause)"
"Please respect my freedom of speech."
"I have always respected it in this House and I have always respected my fellow citizens here in Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"That is why we did everything we could for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to become binding under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, the debate scheduled for tomorrow only targets one country and does not cover the question - on which we are prepared to have an in-depth debate - of freedom of the press in Europe."
"The PPE refuses to allow this Parliament to become a place in which purely national political accounts are settled, which is what we shall witness tomorrow if this debate goes ahead."
"(Protests)"
"(Applause)"
"So yes to the defence of the liberty of the press in Europe, but no to this Parliament being used for purely partisan and national ends."
"I shall repeat tomorrow, as you will see, what was said by President Napolitano, who is a man for whom I have a great deal of respect, because I have worked a lot with him, as you will see tomorrow."
"Mr President, I do not have much to add to the proposal made by Mr Daul in his speech."
"We all love freedom in its various forms, including freedom of expression and press freedom in the broadest sense, in other words, not only the written press but also television and other media."
"It is therefore right that we defend it and support it."
"It is not right, however, to exploit the situation by pointing the finger at just one set of circumstances, because anyone in Italy who logs on to the Internet, goes to a news-stand or watches the TV, can see that freedom of the press is under no threat whatsoever."
"To sum up, if you really wish to accuse someone, use Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure and Article 7 of the Treaties and have the courage to follow it through to the end."
"Mr President, Mr Daul is quite right in what he has just said."
"Yes, it is true that Mr Daul is someone who respects all aspects of the freedom of expression."
"He is well-known for this."
"However, there are clearly some people in Europe who do not respect the freedom of expression to the same extent as Mr Daul does, but instead have a different understanding of the freedom of expression."
"That is why we need this debate."
"We therefore believe it to be appropriate, given the debate that is going on in one of the Member States, namely Italy, although not only on account of the Italian situation, but on account of the question of whether, as a result of the concentration of economic, political and media power to an extent the like of which we have not known in Europe before, freedom of expression poses a risk to democratic development in Europe."
"That is precisely the point that we want to discuss."
"We should therefore do that and reject the motion proposed by Mr Daul."
"(Applause)"
"The Commission statement on freedom of information in Italy shall remain on the order of business."
"I have received another request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) that the debate not be wound up with the tabling of motions for resolutions."
"Mr President, Mr Daul, we are a parliament that should, quite rightly, vote on and take responsibility for providing money for the people in Abruzzo as quickly as possible."
"We are also a parliament with a responsibility."
"When we debate something, we must subsequently vote on a resolution so that the debate serves a purpose."
"We are therefore in favour of adopting a resolution after this debate."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I wish to speak in support of the motion for there not to be a resolution because I heard Mr Schulz say something which, in my view, is very important: if we really want this debate to encompass 'Europe' and not just Italy, there is no point then voting on a resolution entitled 'Freedom of information in Italy'."
"Let us, in any case, have the debate tomorrow: subsequently, we will find the time and the means to address the issue in the context of Europe and vote on a resolution on the freedom of information in Europe."
"1."
"Proposal for a decision ("
"(FR) Mr President, we wish the following phrase to be added to point A:"
"'as well as on the developing countries', so that this reads 'to analyse and evaluate the extent of the social, economic and financial crisis, its impact on the Union and its Member States, as well as on the developing countries'."
"Mr President, we also want to include a reference to 'development cooperation' so the sentence reads: 'To analyse and evaluate the current implementation of Community legislation in all the areas concerned, including development cooperation'."
"We thought that the developing countries' point of view was not reflected within the mandate."
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Written explanations of vote:"
"in writing. - The Governor of the Bank of England (Mervyn King) has stated, and I believe correctly, 'Banks are international in life but national in death...'."
"It is national governments and national taxpayers who pay when banks have to be bailed out."
"It follows therefore that banking supervision must be carried out on a national basis and not via the EU."
"This is why I voted against the setting-up of an EU special committee on the financial and economic crisis."
"Setting up the special committee on the financial and economic crisis as a body to analyse and evaluate the coordination of the measures taken by the Member States to support sustainable qualitative growth is crucial."
"It is essential to analyse and evaluate the extent of the social, economic and financial crisis, but also to propose appropriate measures for the long-term reconstruction of sound, stable financial markets able to support sustainable economic growth which can combat unemployment and respond to demographic and climate challenges."
"It is crucial to support the involvement of universities, representatives of the scientific community and researchers as strategic partners."
"This partnership must be promoted, since it will be decisive for us to be able to tackle both the economic crisis and unemployment problems in the short term, as well as to find long-term solutions to deal with the problem of climate change, by developing and using clean forms of energy."
"Setting up the special committee on the financial and economic crisis may prove to be crucial in preparing for the future of the EU."
"This future could not be achieved by discussing and proposing measures alone, but also by devising mechanisms that can be implemented to avoid us facing a similar situation in the not too distant future."
"It is therefore vital to learn the lessons of this crisis by examining its causes and consequences."
"It is also important to correct the failings of the financial system that led to the current situation by adopting better legislation that is duly justified."
"We cannot run the risk of creating a regulatory environment that is so strict that it could result in recovery being delayed further, or the EU turning into an unattractive financial market, in a climate of strong competition."
"This committee could also continue longer than the planned 12 months so as to be able to monitor and assess the measures that will be adopted in the current crisis."
"I support this measure and I am fully confident that this committee will conduct an appropriate analysis of the scope of the financial crisis which has affected every Member State, and that it will put forward expert recommendations contributing to the European Union's economic recovery."
"However, I was unable to vote on this proposal as I had a problem with my voting card."
"Overcoming the current financial crisis and its impact on EU Member States' economies and, ultimately, social areas, requires intensive joint efforts."
"The decision of the Conference of Presidents of 17 September 2009 to use a special committee to carry out a structured analysis and to draw up proposals for appropriate measures for the maintenance of sustainable, crisis-resistant financial markets is worthy of support."
"However, on a critical note, it must be said that more than 12 months have now passed since the appearance of the first symptoms of the crisis last year and the onset of the crisis itself at the start of this year."
"The measures that have since been introduced must be seen primarily as symptom control and emergency measures for safeguarding jobs."
"In support of this motion, it has to be said that particular attention has to be paid to coordinated and targeted measures as, with all due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, individual solutions will ultimately lead once again to distortions of competition."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Outcome of the referendum in Ireland (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the referendum in Ireland."
"I should like to welcome the Prime Minister of Sweden to the House today, who is representing the Swedish Presidency."
"We are very happy to have you with us, but there was a problem of formalities. I am very sorry about that."
"President Barroso, it is great that you, too, are with us at such an important moment for our European Union."
"Thank you very much."
"You can see how difficult it is sometimes to go through all the formalities, but we are a very democratic institution, as you can see."
"It is always necessary to go through everything in order."
"Then everything is OK and we can agree."
"We shall now go to the main item on this afternoon's agenda."
"It is very important for us to have you in the Chamber to discuss such an important topic."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I am very grateful to be here today and to have the opportunity to address the European Parliament so soon after the positive result in the referendum in Ireland."
"I pay tribute to Brian Cowen and his associates;"
"I also say to all of those who have been engaged in the campaign, whatever their party or background, who contributed to this successful outcome: thank you for all your efforts."
"This was a good decision for Ireland; it is a good decision for Europe."
"I think that we can say that Europe has listened to the criticism;"
"I know that the legal guarantees offered by the European Council were decisive in the referendum campaign."
"I can also say that the French and the Czech Presidencies made efforts that were crucial to find a way to meet the concerns of the Irish people."
"I think we should also say that it was very positive to have the very strong majority that was shown in the referendum, a convincing majority of 67.1% and with a high turnout, as high as 59%."
"So, all of this is very good news for Europe."
"And, of course, I do not have to explain to this Parliament the need to put the Lisbon Treaty in place."
"It will allow you to be more democratic, to be more efficient, and to be more transparent."
"It will, in fact, increase the influence of the EU in the international arena and make us stronger in meeting global challenges, and I know that you in this Parliament will also be given a more significant role in the overall decision-making process."
"I welcome this development."
"Therefore, it is very important to put this Lisbon Treaty into force."
"The European Council is united in its wish for the Treaty to enter into force by the end of this year and the end of the Swedish Presidency."
"With the number of countries that have ratified it - we are now at 24 with full ratification - country number 25 might actually be Poland, given the signals that we are now getting from the Polish President."
"I spoke on Saturday, after the referendum result from Ireland was known, with the Taoiseach Brian Cowen, who said they would need a couple of weeks to secure full parliamentary ratification, and therefore we can also say that country number 26 will finally be Ireland."
"That leaves us just the Czech Republic to have the full 27 ratifications."
"To that end, we have had a meeting with the three institutions here in Brussels today: the Presidency, the head of the Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, and the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek."
"The Czech Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, was also with us and we tried to asses this situation."
"You might know that 17 senators have appealed to the Constitutional Court in the Czech Republic with a complaint concerning the Lisbon Treaty, to see if it is in accordance with the Czech Constitution."
"Jan Fischer told us that this is an independent court which is now working quickly to take the decision whether or not to bring up this petition."
"We do not foresee today an exact date when they will give this decision, and we are, of course, awaiting that signal."
"We hope to see it in just a week or a couple of weeks."
"That is the message from the Czech Republic today: an independent court taking a decision in maybe a week's time, or it may be two weeks before we know how they will proceed."
"As President of the European Council, I am responsible for moving the work of the Union forward."
"I strongly feel that we have no time to lose."
"Therefore, I have decided that while awaiting the clarifications in the Czech Republic, firstly we will continue the preparations for the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and secondly, when there is clarity on when the Lisbon Treaty will come into force, when there is clarity, I will begin consultations on the nominations of the new President of the European Council and the High Representative and Secretary-General of the Council."
"Preparing this will not only be a matter for the Presidency: this is a matter for three institutions at the same time."
"I will therefore say that it is very important for us to work closely and constructively together with the Commission and the European Parliament in this process."
"I will again renew my offer to this Parliament to cooperate when we are making our efforts to get the Lisbon Treaty finally in place."
"Let us also remember that despite these institutional matters, this Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is, of course, very much influenced by the need to move on climate change, the need to move on the financial crisis, the worry in Europe that we need a policy for job creation - a lot of important matters that need to be addressed."
"That sums up for us the need to be active, to put in place the Lisbon Treaty, as I have just said, and to stay active as a Presidency on these very important matters for our voters."
"Prime Minister, thank you for your very clear message regarding all that is going on after the vote in Ireland, and also for the very clear message on cooperation between the European Parliament and the Presidency of the European Council."
"We have just started discussions with Mrs Malmström, a former Member of the European Parliament, whom we remember very well."
"Thank you very much for your proposal and very clear message."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Irish people took a very important and historic decision last weekend: a very important decision for Ireland; a very important decision for Europe."
"The Irish people, by a resounding majority, recognised the importance of the Lisbon Treaty, a Treaty that offers a more democratic and effective Europe, a Treaty that gives us the right platform to deliver the modern, successful European Union our citizens wish to see."
"The Treaty now has the democratic endorsement of all 27 Member States."
"All the Member States of the European Union, by parliament or by popular vote, have approved the Treaty."
"This is indeed a major achievement."
"It shows how the enlarged Europe is able to share a vision for our future and a determination to move forward."
"It was decided democratically."
"Now what we need is the ratification procedures to be concluded."
"I am pleased to see that President Kaczyński of Poland will be signing very soon."
"As he has always said to me, he will be ready to do it when the Irish have voted 'yes'."
"This is indeed very good news."
"Of course, we have to see the completion of the process in the Czech Republic."
"We need to respect the constitutional proceedings in that country, as we have done in other countries, but once these procedures are concluded, I see no reason why proceedings cannot be concluded swiftly."
"This is important for Europe as a whole, but it is particularly important for the Commission."
"I want to see the new Commission in place, a Commission in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, and I want to see it in office as quickly as possible."
"A long period with a caretaker Commission is in nobody's interest."
"I am ready to start the formation of the next Commission as soon as the Council is ready to clarify the legal basis definitively, and also to nominate the High Representative who will become Vice-President of the Commission."
"I appreciate all the efforts made by the Swedish Presidency, and personally by Prime Minister Reinfeldt, to reach a swift conclusion to all these processes."
"The initiative that Prime Minister Reinfeldt took today at a meeting with me and with you, President Buzek, and the video conference with Prime Minister Fischer, was a very good and useful initiative."
"I also know that this Parliament has worked tirelessly to promote the Lisbon Treaty."
"Parliament and Commission have worked hand in hand to explain why it is the right treaty for Europe."
"I am proud of the role that the Commission played in giving the Irish people the information they needed to make up their minds."
"Now that we have a real probability of having the Lisbon Treaty finally ratified and the whole process completed, we can turn our attention to the work to implement the Treaty."
"I would like to take this occasion to highlight four areas where we are working hard to ensure that we can hit the ground running when the Treaty comes into force."
"One of the most important and the most complex has to be the innovations regarding the European External Action Service."
"We have been working hard to think through some of the practical details of how we can make the European External Action Service a real success."
"This work will now accelerate and, in the same spirit as the remarks made just now by the Swedish Presidency, I want to state the European Commission's determination to work with Parliament to achieve that objective."
"I know that Elmar Brok has been leading on this subject here in Parliament."
"I understand that you will debate this at the next plenary."
"This is excellent timing since this will take place shortly before the same question is discussed at the European Council."
"I think that report is an excellent basis for discussions between our institutions, and I welcome the strong Community spirit that inspires the report."
"This is exactly the spirit that I will uphold in the preparation for the important innovation that is the European External Service."
"Another point is comitology."
"It is an important aspect of how the European Union does its business."
"The Treaty of Lisbon introduces new rules making the system more rational and transparent."
"We need to fix exactly how the new system should work."
"But let me be clear: many of these decisions are of great political importance and deserve proper democratic scrutiny and real political ownership."
"So we need to maintain the strong role played by Parliament today."
"Another important democratic element is the new mechanisms to allow national parliaments a direct say on subsidiarity."
"We need to put these mechanisms in the broader context of the excellent relations with national parliaments built up by the Commission, and indeed the European Parliament, over the last few years."
"Finally, I would like to mention the European Citizens' Initiative."
"This is one of the most striking innovations on the Treaty's democratic agenda and one on which this Parliament has already worked in detail."
"Margot Wallström has been leading our work in developing a green paper to launch a consultation as soon as possible, with the goal of seeing this opportunity in citizens' hands within a year of entry into force."
"When I spoke to this Parliament last month, I set out what I saw as the greatest challenges and the great opportunities facing Europe today."
"With the Lisbon Treaty, we will have the right springboard to help us make those goals a reality, and I am sure that with this constructive partnership between our institutions, we will make it a success."
"That is the commitment of the European Commission."
"President Barroso, thank you for your speech, and for your readiness to cooperate in the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The cooperation between Parliament and the Council during the videoconference with Prime Minister Jan Fischer of the Czech Republic was also excellent, so thank you once again, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, for organising that video conference."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with their frank and resounding 'yes' last Friday, the Irish not only said 'yes' to the Treaty of Lisbon; above all, they said 'yes' to Europe as an area of solidarity and shared values."
"They expressed their deep attachment to a Europe that influences globalisation without suffering it, a Europe that shares with its partners its choice of society and its choice of a social market economy."
"On behalf of the PPE, I am delighted at this vote, which shows that, when a nation is consulted on what really matters, such as the principle of belonging to the European Union, it replies to the question put to it and does so with conviction."
"On Friday, our Irish friends answered the question of whether they were in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon and, if not, whether they were prepared to question their country's membership of the European Union."
"They gave an unequivocal and resounding yes to this question."
"That proves just one thing: that Europe is seen for what it is, namely a protective element, a reassuring zone of stability, peace and the rule of law."
"I believe that the Irish vote will have an important impact on the way in which we build Europe, especially in the months to come, inasmuch as it proves the deep attachment of our peoples to the values which Europe represents."
"The Irish vote encourages us in our European action and, at the same time, it links us."
"It encourages us, because this is the first time in a long time that a European nation has expressed with such force its will to participate in the European adventure despite - or rather because of - the crisis."
"It also links us, inasmuch as we have an obligation to satisfy the demand for solidarity which was largely behind the Irish 'yes'."
"This is precisely, to come back to the European institutions, what the Treaty of Lisbon will allow us to do."
"This treaty will allow Europe to be more efficient by making the unanimous vote, which is often paralysing, the exception, and the majority vote the rule."
"It will allow it to be more identifiable by creating a standing Presidency of the Council to replace the current revolving Presidency and will give greater weight to our High Representative for foreign policy."
"Europe needs one face, both for our fellow citizens and for our international partners."
"Finally, the Treaty of Lisbon will make Europe more democratic, by giving far greater weight to this Parliament and also by giving the national parliaments and the citizens a greater say in European affairs."
"On Friday, the Irish were the last nation to express a positive view on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"All the other nations have already done so, either directly or via their respective parliaments, including in Poland and the Czech Republic."
"I therefore call on the presidents of these two countries to proceed without delay with formal signature of the Treaty, so that the 27 can move forward and implement it by no later than the start of 2010."
"May I say in particular to President Klaus that the 67% Irish vote should encourage him to sign the treaty when the time comes."
"On behalf of the PPE, I call on him to behave responsibly, as I am sure he will."
"The time has come for Europe to set institutional questions aside and dedicate itself to what really matters to the 500 million Europeans: the social market economy, energy, the climate and security."
"My thanks to Mr Reinfeldt and Mr Barroso for their proposals."
"You can count on the PPE to help work progress quickly."
"Mr President, we are discussing the result of this referendum."
"A great deal has been said about the institutional aspects and I have nothing to add to what Prime Minister Reinfeldt said."
"I think it is a good thing that he is not going to act hastily but has said that we are waiting, as we are not at the finishing line yet; we still need to go through the final stages of this ratification process before we can answer institutional questions."
"Like the rest of us, Mr Barroso, you were very pleased."
"Your joy must have been a little dampened on Sunday evening, as the 382 votes that you received included 55 votes from members of a group whose objective it is to prevent the Treaty of Lisbon entering into force."
"When you are rejoicing over Lisbon, you need to bear in mind that you were supported by people who want precisely the opposite of what you are striving to achieve."
"Think about that, and let us base your majority on a pro-European majority in this House."
"(Heckling)"
"When we talk about the result of this referendum, Mr President, it is, however, about something quite different."
"It is not about institutional games that are now to be played."
"It is not about how majorities in this Parliament are made up, but about something much more fundamental and that is what we need to say to the President of the Czech Republic."
"The 27 Member States of the European Union have a total of 500 million inhabitants."
"China has 1.3 billion inhabitants."
"India has 1.1 billion. These two countries together represent a third of the world's population!"
"These countries now sit round the table in the G20 talks."
"The largest EU Member State involved in the G20 sits there representing an economic potential of only 82 million people."
"There are two options open to us."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is not - as Mr Klaus has claimed - about making the Union a strong force against the Member States, but about something completely different."
"It is about making the Union a strong global partner in order to strengthen the individual Member States."
"That is the explicit goal of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This treaty, on the contrary, serves the interests of the small Member States of the EU in particular."
"A country with a population of 10 million - let us take your country for example, Mr Barroso - compared with Brazil, Portugal no longer has the position it had in the 19th century."
"It is clear that, in the 21st century, Brazil is the stronger country."
"Like all European states, Portugal needs the Union so that we can be strong together."
"When it comes to climate change, the financial crisis, global disease control, when it comes to combating hunger in the world, securing peace, preventing wars over resources, then Europe will only be able to endure as a unified bloc and it will founder if it splits into its individual parts."
"That is why the question that we must put to President Klaus is this: in weighing up the responsibility that he is taking on, is it possible for an individual - who admittedly is making use of his constitutional right, that I cannot argue with - to be able to shoulder this responsibility alone when all of the other governments and parliaments, and now also 67% of the people of Ireland who have said 'yes', are of a different opinion?"
"We need to ask Mr Klaus a question."
"Is he fully aware that this continent has reached a crucial turning point, in other words, it is decision time with regard to whether unity makes us strong or whether going it alone will weaken us all."
"That is the crucial question."
"So, yes, it was a good day for Europe, and the day on which this treaty is finally ratified will be an even better day."
"Mr Klaus should accept his historic responsibility and sign this treaty."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, last Friday was a really historic step: 67% of the votes."
"You can change all the constitutions in Europe with a two-thirds majority;"
"I think a two-thirds majority is also necessary in Sweden."
"We have to thank Brian Cowen."
"I also especially thank Pat Cox, who did a great job, and all pro-Lisbon Irish MEPs because they conducted a tremendous campaign in favour of the Treaty."
"So I am happy."
"The reason is that we started this whole exercise in the aftermath of the Nice Treaty, with a declaration in Laeken, and it has taken eight years - so I promise not to restart this whole process, Mr President."
"With this Irish 'yes', all the citizens of Europe, directly or indirectly, by a referendum or by their parliaments, have said 'yes' to the Lisbon Treaty."
"That was also a message to the Eurosceptics who were always saying 'no - the people are against Europe, against the European institutions'."
"Sixty-seven per cent of the Irish population: what we saw on Friday is a clear message to the Eurosceptics."
"We have to ask everyone to take his or her responsibility so the Lisbon Treaty can enter into force as quickly as possible."
"Now is the time to bring this process finally to an end."
"With this Irish 'yes', we know that the Lisbon Treaty will be brought into effect; we know that, because it was the last hurdle."
"However, we do not know when it will come into effect, and I think that is the problem we have to discuss this afternoon."
"What do we do in the meantime?"
"We know that we have to wait until the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic has spoken."
"As you said yesterday in Le Monde, in the worst case scenario, we still have a few months to wait and I think that nobody in this House can tolerate the fact that the Union will be a lame duck in the months to come."
"We can accept that the Commission will be dealing with current affairs because after 31 October, it should be dealing with current affairs."
"We need action and we need action urgently."
"Therefore, Mr Reinfeldt, President of the Council, my invitation to you is to initiate, as fast as possible, the procedure for the nomination of the Commission."
"Three weeks ago, we voted for the President of the Commission with the argument that the current crisis does not allow us to postpone a decision."
"That was your argument."
"So the same argument applies now to the nomination of the Commission."
"It is not necessary to wait: a new Commission is possible with the present treaty, with the present status for the High Representative and then, once the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, you can smoothly install a High Representative with another statute and a President of the Council."
"There is really no reason to wait to proceed with the Commission."
"This was also the aim of the President of the Commission if I understood him correctly when he spoke a few minutes ago."
"I fear that I hear you saying 'No, I am waiting;"
"I am waiting because I want a global package, a global package including the President of the Council'."
"I say that is not a problem: prepare your global package."
"Prepare it now, and the decision on the Council President can be as political as the decision that you took on Mr Barroso the first time."
"You presented him as a candidate by a political decision, not a formal decision, because we asked to formalise it afterwards."
"You can do exactly the same with the President of the Council and then, once the Treaty is ratified, you can formalise the whole package."
"Then you change the statute of the High Representative: he becomes Vice-President of the Commission."
"At the same time, the political decision that you take on the President of the Council now can be put into practice; you can then formalise it."
"That is the best way, the best pressure that you can put on those other countries that have to sign: formalise it, because they know that we want to go forward."
"And we still do not have to wait for several weeks and months."
"In any case, you have said that there is no time to waste."
"I agree with you: there is no time to waste with this current economic and financial crisis."
"Put the Commission together now, as fast as possible."
"Convince your colleagues in the Council and take your decision on the High Representative on the basis of the present Treaty."
"Pick one of the candidates - I have seen there are enough candidates - for the President of the Council and go forward with it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have to learn a clear lesson from what happened in Ireland."
"The Irish, as Guy Verhofstadt said, returned a 67% vote, which is a large majority, because reality caused them to see clearly."
"The reality of the crisis, first of all, in which they felt that they needed Europe."
"However, they also felt that this vote actually implied - as Joseph Daul rightly said - that either they said yes or they started an exit process."
"What needs to be understood is that referendums in Europe only make sense if they have consequences."
"If it is a game, a whim, you can say no, but it is business as usual."
"So you react depending on your mood."
"I believe that the debate on Europe needs to continue."
"We need to arrive at a European referendum, where all Europeans vote on the basis of a qualified majority and those who say no need to say if they respect the vote and are staying in or if they are out."
"If the English believe that this remark is directed at them, they are not wrong, because we need to put a stop once and for all to a Europe which can be the victim of blackmail."
"A democratic space cannot live with blackmail and if we do not manage to resolve this problem, I think that the European democratic space will not work."
"The second thing which we need to understand clearly is the situation we are in."
"Guy Verhofstadt said two or three things on this subject, but what frightens me is that, for Mr Barroso, there has been a public debate."
"We did not win, we lost, that is life, but there was a real public debate."
"Then there was a confrontation and the majority won."
"Mr Schulz, you should not always point the finger at others."
"If all the socialists had voted with us against Mr Barroso, there would have been no majority."
"That too needs to be said; you cannot just say one thing or the other."
"That is life; that is how it is."
"Yes, it is true, Martin, you like blaming others, but once in a while, the social democrats should take responsibility for their defeats, otherwise we shall never win."
"I should like to say something now about the process and here I disagree with you, Mr Reinfeldt."
"We are going to have a President of the European Council."
"I do not want this to be a coup d'état."
"All of a sudden, at the last minute, you are going to propose someone and, within a week, the decision will have been taken."
"I think that Europe is entitled to a public debate, that all the states should be entitled to give an opinion on your proposals."
"Be it Mr Blair, Mr Balkenende, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker or Mr Guy Verhofstadt, I think that we are entitled to a public debate."
"It should not be the governments which decide on the President of Europe, behind closed doors, at the last minute."
"The reason I say this is because everyone knows that, today, public opinion is not in favour of Mr Blair, everyone knows that it is unfair for Jean-Claude Juncker not to have a chance simply because Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are against him."
"That is not a public democratic debate."
"We need to put everything on the table and then you decide."
"The same thing applies to the High Representative."
"Put your proposals on the table."
"I have one thing to say to you."
"Mr Barroso is correct and Mr Verhofstadt is correct in this instance."
"You made us elect Mr Barroso by saying that it was urgent and now you are going to have a 'lame duck' Commission which will just keep going until a decision can be taken."
"It all depends on the Czechs."
"However, there is another consideration."
"We proposed extending the entire Commission, including Mr Barroso, precisely so that it would be able to conduct the negotiations for Copenhagen on a full-time basis."
"I think it unacceptable not to launch the Commission procedure straight away, by putting the names on the table."
"Mr Verhofstadt made a good proposal: if the Czechs do not state their position, then the Czechs will have no commissioner, because under the Treaty of Nice, the number of commissioners will have to be reduced."
"If the Czechs state their position before the end, things will be done within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon and they will have a commissioner."
"Everything needs to be put on the table."
"To close, I should simply like to say one thing."
"We should continue the debate after the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is not the end of the story."
"The constitutionalisation of Europe cannot stop with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"If we do not have the courage to continue this debate once the Treaty of Lisbon is in place, I think that we shall miss a serious rendezvous with history, Europe's rendezvous."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I spent most of my early political years fighting against dangerous individuals like Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"I really was quite alarmed a moment ago that I was actually agreeing with one or two bits of his speech, and I was only saved by the fact that in his final remarks I was able to be totally opposed to him again."
"I want to be quite consistent about my position, speaking as leader of the British Conservatives in the European Parliament."
"For those of us who support the principle of the nation states coming together to cooperate freely in Europe, the progress of the Lisbon Treaty perhaps should not be such a cause for celebration today."
"The tragedy of our Union is that, through too many people's eyes, it has become an elitist project, pushing its ideology onto an increasingly sceptical public, according to Eurostat information."
"You lose one referendum so you call another to get the result you want."
"If the term 'constitution' proves unpopular and unacceptable, it is given a fresh wrapping so that past rejections can be ignored."
"If the promised referendum looks unwinnable it is cancelled without apparent shame or embarrassment."
"In the UK, all political parties, including a government in office, pledged the British people that they would be consulted on the future of Europe."
"The Socialists and the Liberals reneged on their promise."
"Such political tricks may secure short-term advantages but we should regret the fact that the peoples of Europe have hardly had their faith in their politicians enhanced by such cynical manoeuvres."
"We in the ECR want a Europe built on the secure foundations of popular support and the democratic legitimacy offered by the institutions of its nation states."
"But the Lisbon Treaty is, in our view, still a step in the wrong direction."
"By opening the door to a supranational foreign and security policy, by giving more power to European institutions and abolishing national vetoes in policy areas crucial to our states, the Treaty takes a dramatic step towards the superstate feared by many."
"The peoples of Europe do not want a Union of ever closer centralisation, a Union that increases its powers at the expense of its Member States, a Union which is remote from their daily concerns."
"However, they do want a Europe of diversity, a Europe where the different cultures and ways of life combine, where added value can be achieved."
"They want a reformed Union, a more accountable, transparent, democratic Union which delivers value for money in those areas in which it has delegated responsibility, a Europe closer and more relevant to the people."
"The Lisbon Treaty has therefore been a missed opportunity."
"I served in the Convention following the Laeken Declaration, which I much supported, a Convention which drafted the original constitutional text."
"I know the details well, the good points as well as the bad."
"The UK Conservatives have been consistent."
"We believe that the Treaty as it has turned out will not take things forward in the interests of the people."
"And we in the ECR will continue to fight for our vision of the European Union, a vision in tune with the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of Europe."
"We will continue to argue for a European Union fit for the purposes of the future, not the past, and for a European Union which rests securely on the support of its peoples and not only the priorities of any elite."
"We should all reflect on that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group has always advocated mandatory referendums on the Reform Treaty throughout Europe."
"Voters in Ireland were the only ones with the opportunity to make their decision directly a year and a half ago."
"If we want the people to decide, then we must accept the result, even if we do not like it."
"The government in Ireland went against the principle of democracy and conducted a second referendum, partly as a result of pressure from other Member States."
"Now they have the result they wanted."
"We on the Left abide by the principle of democracy, but our concern over the political orientation of the EU remains."
"The number of 'no' votes in Ireland indicates that we are not the only ones with this concern."
"Our three main points of criticism are, firstly, that the previous policy of liberalising the financial markets, tax competition, decoupling of financial policy from economic policy and the dismantling of the social state contributed to the economic and financial crisis."
"As a result, this policy has led to an increase in poverty and inequality in Europe."
"Other than declarations of intent, very little has happened so far in terms of the regulation of the financial markets."
"On the contrary, while the unemployment figures are rising, the big banks are once again expecting large profits."
"The Treaty of Lisbon will continue this market economy policy with free competition."
"This is something that we cannot support."
"Instead, we call for a fundamentally different approach to tackling social challenges."
"Our aim is the introduction of a social progress clause with minimum wages applying throughout the EU - the same pay for the same work in the same place."
"We must combat wage dumping."
"Our second point of criticism is that the call for the Member States to gradually improve their military capabilities is incompatible with the aims of the Left, as is the entrenchment of a European armaments agency in primary European law."
"We will not support global military missions in order to assert our own interests."
"We do not want this kind of treaty; we want a treaty of disarmament rather than armament."
"It is paradoxical to be referred to as an opponent of Europe for this reason."
"Anyone in Europe who is in favour of armament is classed as a friend of Europe, but anyone in Europe who is in favour of disarmament is classed as an enemy of Europe."
"That is politically absurd!"
"So, the referendum in Ireland has taken place and, even if it did not turn out exactly as we would have wanted, we on the Left will continue to work to achieve more direct democracy in Europe."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, well, it is all terribly simple really, isn't it?"
"We have had one vote against the Treaty in Ireland and one vote for the Treaty in Ireland, so if we have any sort of sporting sense, we ought to make this the best of three; but the difference is that with a third referendum, let's make it a free and a fair referendum."
"Because what has happened in Ireland most certainly is not that!"
"In fact, I hope you are all very proud of yourselves because what you have done is you have taken the littlest boy in the playground, got him into the corner and given him a good kicking."
"This is a victory for the bully boys; it is a victory for big money and a victory for bureaucrats."
"The whole thing was a travesty!"
"(Heckling)"
"Oh, so you respect this vote, do you?"
"You did not respect the last vote, did you?"
"The European Commission poured in millions of pounds of taxpayers' money - well, pounds or euros, it doesn't matter, though it does in our case because we have still got the pound, thank God! - you poured in millions."
"Something like a factor of between 10:1 and 20:1 was the outspending of the 'yes' side to the 'no' side."
"The Referendum Commission in Ireland did not do its job, did not tell the Irish people that of course, the Lisbon constitutional treaty has profound impacts on their own constitution; and, perhaps worst of all, the Broadcasting Commission in Ireland changed the rules, so there was not equal coverage for the 'yes' and the 'no' sides."
"The whole thing was an outrage."
"But what they did campaign on, what you all campaigned on, was 'Vote 'yes' for jobs'."
"That was what it was all about."
"Well, hot off the press, folks: Aer Lingus have laid people off today and Intel, the people who put EUR 400 000 into the 'yes' campaign, have laid off 300 people today."
"One thousand, five hundred and fifty jobs have gone since Saturday; the only jobs that were preserved by the 'yes' vote were the jobs of the political class."
"I suspect that it is all over."
"I suspect that for Ireland, their period of independence will be a very brief one in their history."
"I do not think that President Klaus will be able to hold out, I hope that he does; he is a fine and brave man."
"But it looks like we have got the victory of bureaucracy over national democracy."
"In historical terms, I think Britain now finds herself very alone, perhaps as she was back in 1940, but..."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"...there is a real debate, there is a real debate here."
"What is the point of having a Conservative Prime Minister if Mr Blair becomes the overlord?"
"What is the point of a Foreign Secretary if we have got an EU foreign secretary with his own diplomatic service?"
"What is the point of any of it?"
"As far as I am concerned, this Irish referendum begins the real debate."
"There is no more pretending: if you want national democracy, you cannot remain a member of this European Union, and we will campaign for Britain to leave and to leave as soon possible."
"Mr President, yesterday I asked Mrs Wallström, the Vice-President of the Commission, whether the Lisbon Treaty was essentially the same as the Constitutional Treaty that it replaced."
"She said the changes were those required by the British Government and they involved changes in names and symbols."
"She did not use the word 'only' but she might easily have done."
"The Constitutional Treaty had already been rejected by the electorates of France and the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom was due to hold its referendum."
"It would certainly have resulted in a rejection."
"It is clear that the replacement of the Constitutional Treaty by the European Reform Treaty was carried out at the request of the British Government to enable them to renege on their pledge to hold a referendum."
"The substance would remain the same, but the names and symbols would be changed as part of a thoroughly dishonest claim that the treaties were different and a referendum would not be necessary."
"How can anybody dare to call this trickery and this dishonesty any kind of democracy?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the group leaders for their comments."
"I see that many of them want to see some haste in this process, and I can understand that."
"I think we should be clear that we are moving into more or less unknown territory."
"If you look at the legal ground, it was actually foreseen that the Lisbon Treaty should already have been in place from 1 January this year."
"We are now trying to act flexibly in a new situation arising from the situation in Ireland but also in other countries."
"It is often true in Swedish debates that when you make your point you make a reference to democracy."
"That is good."
"That is also what I am trying to achieve here."
"If a new Treaty is to come into force, it is very clear that it has to be ratified by the 27 Member States."
"That is what we need to have in place and that is why I am so precise in saying that we are now at number 24."
"There are three countries still outstanding, and the longest wait will probably be for the Czech Republic."
"Once the 27th country has ratified, we will move on."
"Ireland has not ratified."
"It needs parliamentary ratification before the process is complete."
"You might say this is easy but you have to be thorough, so you never know."
"When we have all 27, then the package is clear and we will move over to the Lisbon Treaty."
"In doing so, it is also very important to say that all the Treaties we have been discussing have come about by balancing different views, and it is pretty clear that I and others present here need to follow these Treaties."
"It happens very often that you do something else that is not in line with the Treaties."
"That is what we are trying to achieve here with the Swedish Presidency."
"That is why I am telling you we will try to act quickly on a situation which, at the moment, actually lies in the hands of a Constitutional Court in Prague, Czech Republic."
"When they give their say as to whether they are going to take up this complaint or not, that is when the Swedish Presidency will give its next reaction to this process."
"That is democracy at work, because we are following the Treaties precisely and the reactions from these different countries."
"My message to you is that with this clear majority, we have to get the Lisbon Treaty in as soon as possible because we believe this will get us a better functioning Europe, but I will do this thoroughly."
"I will follow the Treaties and also respect the fact that all 27 Member States must ratify before we can make that move."
"Thank you very much for your comments, and thank you for your support."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I will just make some comments on the comments made by the group leaders, and I thank all of them for their contributions."
"These institutional issues of transitions between two treaties are very difficult from a legal and political point of view, and they require wisdom from all institutions."
"Of course, we would like to have the new Treaty approved as soon as possible."
"The majority of Members of this Parliament want it, all the governments want it, and the Commission certainly wants it."
"The point is, as the Prime Minister has just pointed out, that the Treaty will not be approved before the end of the mandate of this Commission."
"The Commission's mandate lasts until the end of this month, so we will inevitably have a period where the Commission is a 'caretaker' Commission."
"That is why I think Parliament took the right decision some time ago in already deciding on the President of the Commission, because that gives the President of the Commission the authority, the political authority, to represent the Commission in very important international obligations."
"That was a wise decision of the European Parliament."
"The important point now is to see how to deal with this transition."
"Today we have discussed this in the Commission, and our opinion in the College is that we should, if possible, already bring in the new Commission under the Lisbon Treaty."
"That is our opinion because this is the Treaty we want; this is the Treaty which gives you, Parliament, more rights in terms of the formation of the Commission itself."
"For instance, the High Representative will be Vice-President of the Commission, and so you will vote on the High Representative."
"That will not happen if we implement the Nice Treaty, and so it is our opinion that we should, if possible, bring in the new Commission under the Lisbon rules."
"But that, of course, is a question of wisdom and of timing as well."
"We have, in the past, namely in the first Commission that I took part in, also started with a prolongation of the previous Commission for three weeks."
"So the question is: how long does it take?"
"And that is why I stated very quickly - and Prime Minister Reinfeldt knows what I think about it - that it is one thing to wait for some weeks and another thing to be waiting we do not know until when."
"That is a question of judgment, political judgment, and I hope the European Council will take the right decisions based on the information we get from our Czech partners."
"This is the question which has to be decided in the European Council at the end of this month."
"Certainly we do not want - I think it is in nobody's interests - to have a Commission that is without full legal competences."
"It is not in the interests of the Commission and I am sure it is also not in the interests of the European Parliament."
"That is why I have said I am ready: I am ready to start the formation of the new Commission as soon as we have the legal clarity and the European Council starts the process."
"For that, I need the Council to take some decisions."
"I need the European Council to propose a High Representative because the High Representative, according to the Lisbon Treaty, has to be approved by the President of the Commission as Vice-President of the Commission."
"Regarding some comments, I want to underline certain points, and to reassure some Members of Parliament."
"Some of you said that there will be a 'President of Europe'."
"I am sorry: there will not be a 'President of Europe'."
"If we have the Lisbon Treaty, there will be a President of the European Council: it is different."
"There is a President of Parliament, there is a President of the Commission, and there will be a President of the European Council."
"It is important to underline that point because sometimes, I think there are ideas about certain dérives institutionnelles, and I will not accept, and the European Commission will not accept, the idea that the President of the European Council is the President of Europe, because it is not in the Treaties."
"(Applause)"
"It is not in the Treaties and we will have to respect the Treaties."
"We have to respect the institutions."
"There is a President of the European Parliament; there is President of the Commission."
"If we have Lisbon, there will be a President of the European Council."
"It is very important to understand that all our decisions have to be taken in the framework of the current treaties."
"That is why I now believe that, as soon as the Czechs verify their situation, we should move forward."
"That is why I think we should work on those points I made before, from the Citizens' Initiative to the External Services, with that spirit of cooperation between all institutions so that, when the decisions are formally taken, we can implement with determination everything that the Lisbon Treaty brings, which I believe is more accountability, more democracy and more efficiency for our Union."
"Mr President, as the first Irish person to speak in this debate, may I thank colleagues for their kind comments about the Irish electorate."
"I also note the people who have been thanked here so far."
"I would like to point out that two people who played a stalwart part in this campaign in the 'yes' vote and put their countries' interest before their own party political interests - Mr Enda Kenny TD, leader of Fine Gael, and Mr Eamon Gilmore TD, leader of the Labour Party - have not been thanked."
"They did more than anybody else selflessly to ensure that this campaign was carried and I want that acknowledged on the record here today."
"The Lisbon Treaty process in Ireland demonstrates that when we make the effort to bring people with us, they are prepared to respond to leadership."
"The European project remains the best hope for the people of Europe and elsewhere for a peaceful and prosperous future."
"We cannot assume that people will appreciate its benefits."
"We have to be as open and as inclusive as possible while explaining these benefits to them."
"Enlargement has not blunted the project."
"Rather, it has enabled us to let others share in its benefits."
"There is indeed unity in diversity."
"Some people in Ireland were unsure of the contents of the Treaty; others were concerned about abortion being forced on a Member State, about neutrality, about the loss of the Commissioner and about the potential for the country to lose control over its own direct taxation policy."
"The Irish Parliament, through a special committee, identified the concerns of the people following the first referendum and the government got guarantees on these matters from our partners and, crucially, the change in relation to the future composition of the Commission."
"That was democracy in action at every level."
"The reason the Irish Parliament had a right and a duty to do what they did is that the sovereign people of Ireland gave them that right and duty."
"From the high turnout and overwhelming 'yes' vote, it is clear that the democratic will of the people was served."
"Mr President, I support what you said about concerns among some of our peoples."
"Let me now raise one issue which I feel needs to be raised."
"Some people in Ireland and elsewhere believe that the EU is becoming a cold place for Christianity in particular, and religion in general."
"I have to say that I personally have experienced disrespect from people here who see themselves as fair-minded and liberal, but who are anything but that when it comes to trying to see things from the point of view of people who have religious belief."
"I respect those who do not have religious belief, but I fully expect them to reciprocate that respect."
"That is what the whole EU project is about."
"I repeat: unity in diversity."
"The second Irish referendum shows what can be achieved when we are truly inclusive."
"I put these words out there for those who have ears to hear, and for posterity."
"Let us now move to complete the ratification and then to deliver on the promises that Lisbon contains of greater democracy and transparency, a coherent role in the world, applying the same tolerant and inclusive principles in our dealings with other regions of the world, especially the poorest parts, as we must apply internally."
"Mr President, when we last debated this issue, I predicted that the Irish electorate would reject the political circus comprising Gerry Adams, Nigel Farage and Joe Higgins."
"I am happy to say that I called it correctly."
"The Nigel Farage bombast, it has to be said, did add to the gaiety of the Irish nation for a while, but of course the contempt that he holds for Irish democracy oozed from every pore of his body here today."
"His manoeuvrings to get the Irish electorate to get Britain to leave the EU demonstrated, I believe, his poor grasp of the shared British and Irish history."
"More importantly, the Irish electorate have overwhelmingly declared that our future is with Europe, that Europe is good for Ireland and that Ireland has a positive contribution to make to the development of the Union."
"I am hopeful that all Member States will have ratified the Treaty within a short while and that the institutional and democratic and social reforms can be implemented without further delay."
"The world needs a more effective Union to ensure that we can vigorously pursue the objectives of sustainable development - economically, environmentally and socially."
"I want to make it clear to you, President Barroso, and to you, Mr President-in-Office, that the peoples of Europe are demanding action from the Union."
"They no longer need to be persuaded that we need global as well as domestic solutions to the problems we face."
"What they want to see is the action to actually begin to deal with these crises."
"They want tangible action, not rhetoric."
"I do hope that we get a Commission which is effective, which is able, and capable, in particular, of shaking off the dead economic ideology which has brought us to the brink of disaster in Europe and, indeed, around the rest of the world."
"We must put in place the objective that we have outlined in the Lisbon Treaty: a social market economy which will bring jobs, which will bring prosperity, and which will bring a decent standard of living to all of our peoples."
"Mr President, last week, the Irish people, by a victory of 619 000 votes, gave a resounding vote of confidence in the European Union project."
"I would like to thank the other 26 governments in Europe and the political groups in this Parliament who worked very closely with the Irish Government over the past 15 months so that the concerns expressed by the Irish people in the Lisbon Treaty I were comprehensively addressed."
"This was a victory for the Irish people, not necessarily for the government or political parties."
"The Irish people overwhelmingly said that Ireland's place lies at the heart of the European Union."
"(GA) The political parties that were in favour of the treaty worked together this time round to a greater extent than during the last referendum."
"Civic groups such as Ireland for Europe and We Belong played a central role in showing the public that it was not just the political system that wanted the people of Ireland to vote yes in the referendum."
"Farming groups were strongly in favour of the treaty and they were very active in this campaign."
"This is a major change from the last referendum, and it was clear to be seen."
"The legally binding guarantees for Ireland in the policy areas of taxation, neutrality and socio-ethical issues clarified key concerns of the Irish people."
"I hope that the Treaty will now be ratified shortly, and I am pleased to hear the news from you, Mr President, about your country."
"But I would have to say that the remarks made here this afternoon by Mr Farage from the UKIP party were insulting to the Irish people and we will not accept that."
"The Irish people are an intelligent, discerning electorate and they knew the difference between the last Treaty and this Treaty, that the protocols have legally binding agreement."
"Mr Farage, you and your colleagues will be pleased to know that your intervention in the Treaty meant about 3 or 4% extra for the 'yes' side."
"That is the respect that the Irish people have for you and your group."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, was very pleased and relieved on Saturday that the Irish people voted 'yes' with a two-thirds majority and thus, clearly no longer believe the erroneous statements and horror stories about a minimum wage of EUR 1.84, for example, and that they said 'yes' to this common Europe."
"At last, there is a chance to work together in our foreign policy to achieve greater conflict prevention, greater protection of human rights and more democracy in all parts of the world, in other words, to have a stronger sense of the global responsibility that the European Union has."
"However, for this to actually enter into force - and some people have already said this - we need the support of all of the European Heads of State or Government in order to persuade President Klaus, too, to sign the treaty."
"And I mean all of them."
"I was outraged this morning to hear that one Head of Government, namely the Austrian Chancellor, Werner Faymann, had declared in an interview that, if President Klaus does not sign the treaty, he sees an opportunity for Austria, too, to hold another referendum."
"That demonstrates a lack of responsibility with regard to European policy."
"In this regard, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to make it clear to the Austrian Head of Government that we need to assume a common European responsibility."
"I would also ask the social democratic Members to make that clear."
"We need everyone who is in favour of this common Europe to make it clear that President Klaus, too, must sign the treaty and that we do not need anything to undermine the process leading to the realisation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"So let us have no 'Spompanadln' as we say in Austrian, in other words, let us not rashly pick up on something simply because it might be popular with the people."
"I consider that to be very irresponsible in terms of European policy and I hope that the Austrian Head of Government will retract his statement in this regard."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, it is not my intention to meddle in the internal affairs of Ireland and I acknowledge the right of Irish politicians to allow as many votes on this treaty as they see fit and, of course, I also respect the result of this referendum, just as I respected the result of last year's referendum, which produced an opposite result."
"I do not know which result has greater value or greater validity, and perhaps my Irish colleagues could advise me on this, but nonetheless, one thing that I can weigh up is how it looks from the outside and how the whole atmosphere surrounding ratification of the Lisbon Treaty looks from the outside and unfortunately, I have to say that the image is appalling."
"I lived the first 26 years of my life under a regime which did not allow free elections, where it was not possible to have free elections, and where there could be only one possible election result."
"I am very much afraid that the only possible or conceivable result regarding Lisbon Treaty ratification was and is 'yes' in the minds of many people in this chamber and elsewhere in the EU and they will not accept or allow any other result."
"I also wonder why there is so much uproar and so much political pressure over the Lisbon Treaty since the EU would not fall apart or collapse without it, after all, but would carry on operating on the basis of existing agreements."
"In this case, I would say that we are witnessing a full-blown example of realpolitik or power politics which has little to do with a more democratic Europe or a better-functioning or more transparent EU and a lot to do with the new redrawn power relations in the EU."
"I say this without bitterness because I have been in politics long enough to know what realpolitik is, but let us at least not lie to ourselves."
"Who will benefit from the Lisbon Treaty?"
"It will be the European Commission, so I am not surprised that the Commission is a major backer."
"It will be the European Parliament, so I am not surprised that many in this chamber back the treaty."
"It will also be several of the powerful states in the EU and federalists in all of the groupings, be it the European People's Party, the Party of European Socialists or the Party of European Liberals."
"My biggest fear, however, is that an approach such as this, embodying as it does the principle of 'the end justifies the means', will turn against us all and that we will witness a counter-reaction in the years ahead and that the pressure to approve the Lisbon Treaty will provoke a backlash in the form of rising support for the real anti-Europeans, for extremists, xenophobes and anti-European forces, and that this will be a Pyrrhic victory."
"(HU) I would like to ask my fellow Member a brief question, which is as follows: Do you think the fact that the Irish Government can call a referendum as many times as it wants is part of the democratic process?"
"What is your view then on the news that the Austrian Head of Government is thinking of calling a referendum now on this issue for the first time?"
"Do you also accept this as a sign of democracy or would you call it an abuse of power, as the speaker before you described it?"
"Please could you answer this?"
"(CS) I did not come here to weigh up the actions of the Irish Government, the Austrian Government or any other government."
"I have not done that, I am not doing that and I will not do that under any circumstances."
"(GA) Mr President, the people of Ireland have spoken."
"I accept that."
"Those who say that this vote was a 'Yes' to Europe claim that last year's vote was a 'No' to Europe."
"It was not."
"Ireland's support for Europe was not in question last year or this year."
"The European Commission decided to spend a large amount of resources on a propaganda campaign about the advantages of the European Union directly before the referendum."
"This added to the belief that the vote was one of 'Yes' or 'No' to Europe rather than 'Yes' or 'No' to the Lisbon Treaty."
"I find this regrettable."
"Every person in this room must now face the clear, tough challenge ahead, that is, to recognise that many of the concerns that came to light during the referendum campaign still need to be dealt with."
"People are particularly worried about salaries, about workers' rights and about public services, as well as about non-militarisation and the voice of the smaller states."
"This time round, the people of Ireland were told that if they voted 'No' for a second time, Ireland would be left alone, isolated in the face of the economic crisis."
"Those who supported the Treaty as a treaty for jobs and for investment should now provide the jobs and the recovery."
"The promises which were made should not be forgotten as soon as the result requested by the Irish Government and by EU leaders was achieved."
"(DA) Mr President, if you can tell one thing from the referendum that has taken place in Ireland, it is that, if you have a sufficiently substantial lack of balance between the 'yes' and the 'no' camps, if there is a sufficiently substantial lack of balance in the media coverage of an issue and if you ask the question enough times, it is absolutely possible to get a 'yes' result."
"If one of these preconditions is lacking, though, you will not get Europeans to give up more sovereignty to these institutions that we currently find ourselves in."
"That is the reality that we all have to base our positions on."
"Another element of the reality - which, at least for those who support the treaty, must be a very uncomfortable element - is the method by which this treaty is becoming reality, and it is the only feasible method by which that is possible, namely in a climate of fear."
"A climate of fear of a new situation arising in the United Kingdom that would lead to the question being put to the British people."
"It must be uncomfortable to only be able to realise your visions in a climate of fear that the people of yet another country might be asked their view - that democracy might be allowed to speak again."
"We heard the President tell Parliament earlier that the 'no' side will be respected."
"In all honesty, though, it is very difficult to see any respect for the 'no' side."
"We have heard that the symbols would be removed from the treaty - yet this whole Parliament is plastered in flags."
"We have heard that the anthem would be taken out of the treaty - yet the new Parliament was celebrated by playing Beethoven's 9th symphony."
"There is not much confidence being engendered for the guarantees that were given to the Irish electorate or to us, the sceptics."
"We would like to have confidence, but it is in very short supply."
"Mr President, I would appeal to those who do not like the outcome of the Irish referendum to stop questioning the democratic procedures in Ireland."
"Ireland is a democratic state."
"It is an independent democratic state."
"The Parliament of the Irish Republic made a decision to hold a referendum; that referendum has been held."
"It was supported by 95% of the elected representatives in the Irish Parliament."
"So, please, you can have your criticisms of the European Union, but you have no right to question the democracy of my State."
"Under the 'blue card' rule you must ask a question, not make a statement."
"The wording is very strict, and it is very important that this rule is respected."
"(DA) Mr President, democracy, for me, means posing a question and then getting an answer."
"Democracy does not mean continuing to ask a question until you get the answer you had anticipated beforehand."
"If the Members of this Parliament, and if the members of the Commission and the Council are not, in fact, so afraid of the populace, why is it that there was only one country where attempts to prevent the holding of a referendum did not succeed?"
"The governments and the institutions of the EU succeeded in preventing the holding of referendums in the other 26 Member States."
"That is not democracy."
"(ES) Mr President, this Parliament is the palace of the imagination, the palace of dreams."
"With their very strong vote, the people of Ireland are giving us the spirit and the strength to continue to prosper and to build a strong and, above all, federal Europe."
"It is only by doing this that we will deserve the title of legitimate heirs of the fathers of Europe, through whose efforts we are all here today."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the majority is happy and relieved."
"I expect the minority to accept the outcome."
"The majority in 27 nations and in the European Parliament has repeatedly said 'yes' to the further development of the European Union."
"We can see a democratic majority and a blocking minority."
"This 'yes' of the democratic majority was the 'yes' of common sense, a 'yes' to a more democratic, more transparent European Union that is closer to its citizens, the 'yes' of positive pro-European thinkers and actors, a 'yes' to the strengthening of the European Union's position in the world and an important step in the right direction."
"We still have a long way to go, because we need a common foreign and security policy in order to be a global player."
"We need to continue to further democracy, for example, by allowing the possibility of a European referendum, a uniform European right to vote and many other things."
"We have work to do now and we must not waste any time."
"I expect the Commission to expedite the reform of the dossier and to begin talks with the Member States regarding the commissioners."
"I expect the Council to provide clarity with regard to its position on this outcome."
"I also expect us, in Parliament, to improve our communications and dialogue with citizens and to provide them with better information."
"We have clearly seen that the better the information, communication and dialogue, the larger the majority."
"Politicians who do not believe themselves capable of this are in the wrong place, as are politicians who hide behind referendums because they do not want to approach the citizens themselves and take any responsibility."
"The more the debate was focused on Europe, the larger the majority was."
"We say 'no' to the nationalisation of European policy and 'no' to national referendums on European matters, except with regard to the accession of one's own country."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Zahradil asked who will benefit from this."
"He thinks it is we parliamentarians."
"That may be the case, and it is not such a bad thing if, in a parliamentary democracy, the parliaments - it is, of course, not only about the European Parliament, but the national parliaments as well - benefit to some degree."
"However, it is, in fact, the citizens who will benefit if we are able to represent their interests in a stronger and better way."
"Mr Schulz has already pointed out that we live in a changing world, a world in which China is strong, India is growing in strength, Brazil is growing in strength and the United States of America is still as strong as ever."
"If we look at Washington today, we see that even the new administration is asking what Europe has to say about various issues, from Afghanistan to other matters."
"Do we have a clear statement and a clear language in this regard?"
"If not, we will not be taken seriously."
"Russia is always trying to play the EU Member States off against one another because that is, of course, more satisfying for our partners."
"To anyone who today is still fighting this treaty in the erroneous belief that it is a treaty that strengthens the European Union, I would say: those who fight this treaty are, in actual fact, strengthening our so-called partners or, if you like, our opponents."
"It has already been said that, yes, we still have a few institutional issues to resolve, in particular in connection with the External Action Service."
"However, let us not attempt to conduct further institutional debates now."
"Our citizens want a clear and substantive answer."
"They want us to speak forcefully on matters to do with climate protection, security issues, financial regulation."
"In every single case, we can show that Lisbon brings improvement."
"However, our arguments must have substance so that people do not feel that the European Union is only concerned about itself, but can see that it is concerned about the interests of its citizens."
"(DE) Mr President, I also had a question for Mr Karas that I will perhaps still raise."
"I will direct my question to Mr Swoboda - since Mrs Lunacek has already criticised our Chancellor, Mr Faymann, and his party colleagues."
"What is his position, as a social democrat, with regard to the suggestion by his national party leader and Federal Chancellor to hold a referendum in Austria?"
"(DE) Mr President, I do not think that we should be conducting an internal Austrian debate here, but one thing is perfectly clear and that is that there will be no referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon in Austria either."
"That is absolutely clear."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified and must enter into force as soon as possible."
"That is my, and our, opinion."
"Thank you for answering the question, but, colleagues, I will read you the Rule because we must know about it."
"'The President may give the floor to Members who indicate, by raising a blue card, their wish to put to another Member, during that Member's speech' - not later - 'a question of no longer than half a minute's duration' - a question only - 'where the speaker agrees and where the President is satisfied that this will not lead to a disruption of the debate.'"
"If blue cards are raised too often, then I will not give you the floor because it will lead to disruption of our debate."
"You must be aware of that."
"Raise your card in time and only for questions that take half a minute; answers must not exceed one minute."
"These are our rules, and we must keep to them very strictly."
"(DE) Mr President, one thing has not yet been properly appreciated here today and that is the fact that the positive referendum in Ireland was hardly the first positive referendum relating to the constitutional process that Mr Verhofstadt mentioned."
"We had positive referendums in Luxembourg and in Spain."
"This one was therefore by no means the first."
"It is always amusing to listen to Mr Farage."
"Today, however, it was not amusing."
"The eurosceptics are indeed poor losers."
"The shock of a two-thirds majority really cuts to the quick."
"Today, for once, it was not entertaining to listen to you."
"It was also interesting to see how Mr Kirkhope turned in his seat, because the Tories are so close to this peculiar party in their views on European policy."
"I very much hope that at some point, that will change."
"We have seen that there is democratic support in Ireland for the European integration process."
"Is there enough democracy in Europe?"
"Is the democracy in Europe perfect?"
"By no means, but it was a good day for democracy in Europe."
"Now some people are complaining that Ireland was pressurised."
"Mr de Rossa said quite clearly that it was a sovereign decision by Ireland to hold another referendum."
"Let us remember how the European Union tried to boycott Austria when Jörg Haider came into power."
"That simply did not work."
"We cannot pressurise our Member States."
"They have the sovereign right to decide on these matters."
"Others are complaining that Ireland only said 'yes' because of the crisis."
"Ireland experienced European solidarity during the crisis."
"That is a positive thing!"
"We also expect European solidarity if homes stay cold in Bulgaria or Hungary because Russia and Ukraine are arguing about gas again."
"European solidarity is a good thing."
"When this is the result, I think it is a very good thing."
"The treaty opens up new opportunities."
"There are a number of policy areas involved here - budgetary policy, policy in the judicial sphere, in relation to internal affairs - but the most important one for me is foreign policy."
"Even though Mr Swoboda said that we should not have any institutional debates, we need to have a serious debate on the European External Action Service."
"We must speak with one voice."
"This Parliament - and I would make this clear to the Commission, but also to the Council - wants a strong High Representative and an efficient European External Action Service."
"We want an EEAS with a broad basis, we want it to be close to the Commission and we want it to have access to all services, including the services of the Council Secretariat."
"That will be the litmus test - including in the Commission hearings."
"It will also be a litmus test for the future of European foreign policy in the 21st century, to ensure we are able to speak with one voice."
"(FR) Mr President, something very simple is going to happen for our European Parliament with the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon; we are going to have another 18 MEPs from 12 Member States of the European Union."
"We have been prudent because, in March of this year, the European Parliament asked all the Member States to anticipate this result by stating, as the method of appointment, that the elections on 7 June would be the democratic basis for sending these additional eighteen MEPs."
"Some Member States did so, like Spain and your country, Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"Other countries, which nonetheless state that they are very content, as am I, with the result of the Irish referendum and are keen to see the Treaty of Lisbon implemented, have still not done their duty, as far as their own will is concerned, by stating their method of appointment."
"Can we count on you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to ask each Member State at the European Council on 29 and 30 October to state the method of appointment of these additional MEPs under the Treaty of Lisbon?"
"The second thing that really shocks me is that everyone is talking about the grand ambitions of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it imposes an obligation on us in connection with one very simple thing: equality between men and women."
"This is a binding objective of the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I understand that, for the additional two posts which remain to be filled, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission and the President of the Council, only men's names are being circulated."
"Your country, Sweden is a fairly exemplary country on this question."
"I expect you to take this extremely seriously."
"It is not possible for us to only have men in the four major positions of responsibility in Europe."
"It is not worthy of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is not worthy of Europe."
"I am counting on you to ensure that equality between men and women is respected at this level also."
"(NL) Mr President, as Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff once said, all advantages have their disadvantages."
"The advantage of the Treaty of Lisbon is that it gives Member States rather more say and national parliaments more influence."
"The disadvantage is that it shifts the centre of power further towards Europe."
"Mr President, this is a disadvantage that must not be underestimated in this Parliament in particular."
"After all, over the last 30 years, we have seen power in Europe increasing in inverse proportion to the turnout of our citizens in the European Parliament elections."
"The transfer of more power to Brussels has gone hand in hand with a lower turnout in the European elections."
"If Lisbon enters into force, Europe must draw the following lesson: let the Union act pragmatically and let it repeatedly prove its added value."
"Only then can we gain the support of the European electorate."
"Mr President, I oppose the Lisbon Treaty from a Left and Socialist perspective and reject the intervention of xenophobes and right-wing forces."
"What happened in Ireland in the referendum was not a victory for democracy."
"The Irish people were threatened by a major coalition - the political establishment, big business, most of the capitalist press and the EU Commission - that if they voted 'no', they would be economically isolated, they would be punished by the European Union and there would be a flight of capital and investment, and they were told that if they voted 'yes', there would be jobs, investment and recovery."
"All falsehoods."
"The Irish Government's duplicity was shown by the fact that it asked the management of Aer Lingus to postpone until today, after the referendum, the announcement of 700 savage job cuts in Aer Lingus."
"The EU Commission intervened continually: interfered in the process."
"The three Presidents are not here, but I want their representatives to ask them for a reaction to the following scandal."
"Mr Tajani, EU Commissioner for Transport, spent a full day travelling around Ireland on a Ryanair jet with the Chief Executive of that multinational, campaigning for a 'yes' vote."
"He is the regulator of transport, supposed to protect consumers and workers."
"He is hopelessly compromised by going around with the chief executive of one of the biggest corporations supplying transport."
"What is your answer to that?"
"Finally, there is speculation that Mr Tony Blair will be the new President of the EU Council."
"Let us be clear."
"Mr Tony Blair is a war criminal."
"Under no circumstances can he be -"
"(The President urged the speaker to conclude as he had exceeded his speaking time)"
"I was interrupted unnecessarily, Mr President."
"I think you are in the chair, not the honourable Member here."
"The point I wanted to finish with was that Mr Blair must not be appointed as the President of the EU."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I can see a blue card."
"I would like to point out to the Member raising the card that every time you raise a blue card, you prevent a Member whose name is on the list of speakers from speaking."
"At the Bureau meeting, I am going to try to change this provision, because we cannot permit a situation where Members whose names are on the list of speakers are prevented from speaking because other Members interrupt with questions - at the moment, a legitimate practice."
"Mr President, I should like to ask Mr Higgins what would have enabled him to support the Treaty."
"Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty provides for an intensification of the neoliberal economic agenda that has caused economic disaster throughout Europe with 21 million unemployed, an intensification of militarisation and the armaments industry, and more pressure for privatisation."
"There is nothing in the Treaty in that sense that a committed socialist could support."
"We will support genuine initiatives that will stand for workers' rights within Europe, but when the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights itself in fact institutionalise the judgments of the European Court of Justice whereby they find in favour of the exploitation of migrant workers by contractors supplying businesses across borders, how can we support that?"
"(FI) Mr President, I spent my childhood and my youth living next door to a communist dictatorship, the Soviet Union, and fear was ever-present."
"Finland, a small country, was right there."
"Nevertheless, we coped; we were independent."
"Now I am flabbergasted that only one end result is allowed in the European Union."
"Opinions can be expressed, there can even be disagreement, even eurosceptics are allowed, but the end result must be the same."
"If you win by foul means, you have already lost."
"To use a football reference, let us remember Diego Maradona's handball incident."
"Who remembers the match between Argentina and England and what the result was at the end?"
"It was won by foul means, was it not?"
"Look where Maradona is now, he who won by foul means."
"Finally, I want to say to Sweden, the country to hold the presidency, that you continue to respect the decision of the Swedish people, who voted against the euro."
"You did not reconsider the matter after a year, or two or even five years."
"In this case, however, it was just a year later."
"This is EU democracy and it will one day reap its just deserts."
"(FI) Mr President, I too have lived in a small country, and still do."
"I would like to ask Mr Soini whether he does not agree that this is a case where Ireland showed its great strength as a small country, as it brought virtually the whole of Europe to its knees."
"This time, after a lengthy debate, Ireland, a small country just like Finland, sought protection in the European Union, and it wants to help strengthen the EU."
"Are the European Union and the Treaty of Lisbon not all about the protection of small countries?"
"(FI) Mr President, this is a bad agreement for small countries."
"It will weaken Ireland's voice, Denmark's voice and Finland's voice in the Council of Ministers."
"The big countries will gain in strength."
"I love Ireland;"
"I have been there 20 times."
"I became a Catholic in Ireland."
"It is not about that."
"I am just sorry to see such a massive landslide."
"First there were 53% against and 47% in favour."
"This time the result was 67% in favour and 33% against."
"What happened and why?"
"I maintain that it was fear."
"I wish Ireland and the Irish every success and may God bless them."
"(Liisa Jaakonsaari commented without using the microphone)"
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the people of Ireland, especially every one of the 600 000 brave Irish people who rejected the dictatorial Treaty of Lisbon and joined the battle for democracy in Europe."
"Anyone who is pleased with the outcome of this repeated referendum will also be pleased with the death of democracy and the dictatorship of globalism."
"European politicians should not be supporting the dictatorship of globalism, but be dealing with the real issues: how to eradicate unemployment, halt mass immigration, and have the discriminatory and inhumane Beneš Decrees and the Slovak language law repealed."
"I also call on every colleague and fellow Member to support the aspirations for autonomy of the largest disenfranchised minority in Europe, the Hungarians living outside Hungary's borders."
"Jobbik's representatives can only support a European Union founded on national traditions."
"Thank you very much."
"(RO) We are delighted that the referendum held in Ireland has confirmed a resounding victory for the supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We must congratulate, while also thanking, those who campaigned for the 'yes' vote in Ireland."
"This vote represents the decision of Ireland's citizens to continue the process of developing the European Union."
"They have made it possible for us to envisage in the future a time when the European Union will speak with a strong voice in any discussions with major global powers."
"This voice will be speaking on behalf of the 27 or more Member States."
"The subject of a new basic treaty was first discussed in 2002."
"Last Friday marked the end of the process for adopting the new treaty."
"My reason for saying that it marked the end of the process is because I believe that Europe's citizens have expressed their opinion, either directly or indirectly."
"Poland announced that it is going to ratify the Treaty immediately."
"There is still just one person left who believes that ratification of this Treaty must be blocked, even when the parliament of the country he is leader of has ratified it."
"I hope that the president will take into account the wishes of the citizens of all 27 Member States, including the Czech Republic, and sign the ratification of the Treaty."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the future implementation of the Treaty will entail new responsibilities for the European Parliament."
"Parliament needs to make the relevant preparations to be able to fulfil these responsibilities as quickly as possible, without causing any delay in the legislative process."
"We have one definite example of this today with the removal from the agenda of the two reports on the Solidarity Fund in connection with the earthquake in Italy."
"Even the problem today with the blue cards is another example of this."
"I hope that the administrative services will focus at least the same attention on this aspect as they have given to the Statute for Members."
"I would like to explain once again to you that, firstly, the Rules of Procedure say that the President 'may give the floor'."
"Therefore, 'may give the floor' means that he may decide either to give the floor or not to give the floor to a Member."
"This President prefers to give the floor to Members who are on the list rather than give the floor to Members who take speaking time and thus prevent Members from speaking who are on the list according to the speaking time allotted to each political group."
"Secondly, what the Rules of Procedure say is that the blue card should be raised during the speech of the Member to whom the question is to be put, and not afterwards."
"(ES) Mr President, first of all I would like to say that I am alarmed by this debate, because what ought to be a day of celebration for Europe is turning into a debate in which we have come to the point of questioning the way that the President of Parliament welcomed the results."
"There have been more than ten speeches that have openly criticised not just Europe - which could be legitimate - but the democratic result of the referendum in Ireland."
"I believe that the time has come to say in this House that here, where the sovereignty of European citizens has its home, nine out of ten citizens represented here are in favour of Europe, and that the underlying beliefs of the major democratic parties of Europe are in favour of Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to point out that the Treaty of Lisbon is a prerequisite for making more Europe, for making Europe more united and stronger, but that unfortunately, it is not sufficient in itself."
"I would like to tell you all that if, 60 years ago, the founding fathers probably thought that Europe was the need to construct a common area of peace after the tragedy of the war, following the attempt by some to impose political ideas or hegemonies on others in Europe, today Europe has a different justification."
"Today we have the leadership of the world before us, and either we are there, or we are not."
"The debate has echoes of Shakespeare: to be or not to be for Europe."
"Just a few days ago, I had the opportunity to speak with people who were in Pittsburgh, and their perspective was that the world is not looking at Europe, but at Asia."
"Europe must be united and strong in order to be a real presence at the tables of the world's leadership."
"If we are not there, then we will count for nothing, and will carry no influence."
"That is why Lisbon is a road, but it is a road that we still have to travel."
"Mr President, frankly we should thank Mr Farage for his contribution to the Irish campaign."
"His singular style of post-colonial jingoism certainly served to recruit several of the Irish republicans to the pro-Treaty cause."
"Stranger still, though, is the complete absence from that campaign of the British Tory Party, who were skulking behind the petticoats of Declan Ganley and President Klaus."
"The fact is that the Conservative Party stands all on its own as a prospective party of government that is still opposing this great qualitative step forward in European integration."
"Consider the absurdity of the Eurosceptics, because opposing Lisbon means sticking with the current Treaty of Nice and the present rather clumsy and opaque - and too often ineffective - Union that fails to respond to public demand and to global challenges."
"Britain deserves much better than the Conservative Party, and Europe certainly needs more."
"(DE) Mr President, like many who have already spoken today, I am pleased about the Irish 'yes' vote and I would like to congratulate all those who fought for this, particularly the Irish Greens in the Comhaontas Glas."
"However, if it is true that it is a day of celebration, then it is, in any case, a hard-won day of celebration."
"It would be wrong of us now to simply return, full of self satisfaction, to the usual routine institutional processes as if nothing much had really happened."
"The President of Parliament referred, in his first statement on the subject, to the fact that we should also listen clearly to the 'no' votes."
"To this I would add that we should also listen to the voices that are barely audible, the ones who, during the European elections in June, thought it unnecessary to take part in the election and play their part in supporting this process."
"What I mean by that is that we must take account of the fact that a committed way forward can only be successful if we make a more serious effort than we have done so far to involve the citizens."
"We have certainly lost time."
"We have lost years."
"Europe has fallen behind in international terms."
"We only need to look at the G20 meetings to see that."
"However, Europe will only become more dynamic if it has a stronger involvement on the part of its citizens."
"I do not think that the people of the Czech Republic should be pressurised, due to the disruptive stance of their President, by means of an announcement that, if there is any doubt, they will not get a commissioner."
"However, there is something that is even more important and that is that it would be a serious mistake to decide on Tony Blair, or any other possible candidate for the office of President of the Council, behind closed doors."
"Instead, this needs to be discussed openly with the people of Europe."
"I propose that we have a hearing in Parliament for all the candidates for this office."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I was elected in June to represent the South West of England and Gibraltar and during the election campaign, I was saddened by the large number of people I met who no longer support Britain's membership of the EU."
"It saddened me because I believe that the EU has been a force for good in the world."
"It has promoted peace and reconciliation amongst the peoples of Europe."
"I hope it will continue to do so."
"The single market promotes trade and prosperity; world-leading companies such as Airbus in my constituency have shown what we can achieve when we pool our industrial resources."
"When I was a student, I lived in France for 12 months and I came home a Francophile."
"I want Britain to enjoy warm and friendly relationships with all our European neighbours."
"My concern is that the current march towards political union without the support of the peoples of Europe threatens to undermine the good work that the EU has done."
"I respect the fact that the Irish people have now voted in favour of the Lisbon Treaty, though I think it disgraceful that they were pressurised into holding a second vote by countries which had not even held one referendum."
"The conduct of Gordon Brown is particularly reprehensible."
"His legacy to Britain will be not only to leave us bankrupt but also to deny the British people a vote on this latest transfer of power from Westminster to Brussels."
"Breaking his promise to hold a referendum threatens to undermine British support for the EU and I deeply regret that."
"I cannot understand why those in favour of political union seem determined to build this structure on the worst possible foundations."
"Do they not understand that a political union built without popular support is likely to end in failure?"
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I see many expressions of satisfaction and even joy in this chamber over the result of the repeat Irish referendum."
"Notwithstanding that the ratification process for the Lisbon Treaty has yet to be completed, I would like to suggest that we put our satisfaction and joy on hold until the citizens of Europe have confirmed, for example, in future elections to the European Parliament, that the Lisbon Treaty was first and foremost to their benefit, that it has improved social conditions, reduced dangerous armed conflicts and made a major contribution to a modern democratic Europe."
"I admit that the result of the repeat Irish referendum was no surprise to me."
"We all witnessed the pronounced interest of the European organisations, which verged on the coercion of Ireland, and which was backed up with corresponding levels of funding."
"I was a committed federalist even in the period when the Czechs and Slovaks shared the same state."
"I am, and I will remain, a federalist in the best sense of the word."
"However, it bothers me - and I am not alone in this - that EU citizens were not allowed to decide on such an important document in a referendum covering all of the states."
"I consider it an error to push through a document which creates the possibility of a stronger role for financial institutions with no regard for social Europe."
"In my opinion, the repeat referendum in Ireland sets a dangerous precedent for the whole European community."
"Time will be the judge and I believe that it will show the result of the second Irish referendum to be a Pyrrhic victory."
"I would like to request that the constitutional arrangements of the Czech Republic be respected and that no pressure be brought to bear on the Czech authorities and particularly on the President in deciding ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but as well as the lifts being out of order, the button that the President has to cut off a speaker who has exceeded his speaking time and is stealing time from fellow Members who are on the list to speak is also out of order."
"Please stop speaking when I ask you to do so, otherwise, since we in the chair do not have a button for cutting off the microphone, half of those Members who are on the list of speakers in this extremely important debate will not be able to speak, which seems to me a miserably uncooperative state of affairs."
"(IT) Mr President, I will try to stay within my speaking time."
"The Lega Nord, the party I represent, voted for the Treaty in the Italian Parliament and I personally was the rapporteur."
"With regard to the referendum, we were very respectful of Ireland's opposition to the Treaty, and we are equally respectful of its approval to the tune of 67%, a sizeable number."
"The will of the people expressed through a referendum is direct and unequivocal."
"I welcomed this morning's speech by the President of Parliament when he said that we should also listen to the reasons of those who voted 'no' and, above all, ask ourselves why a large number did not even vote."
"I think that this is an intelligent and perceptive consideration since European democracy is not built on decisions made on high, but on political awareness and the growth of political awareness among the peoples of Europe."
"I believe that the peoples wish to see greater democracy ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, in all of the debates we have had over the past few years on the Treaty of Lisbon, even its supporters have always said that this treaty is not as good as it could be, that it has a lot of shortcomings, and that it is, in fact, a not particularly successful compromise."
"Now these supporters are happy because this treaty is close to being implemented, and that is fair enough."
"However, when we now hear these supporters say that the majority has given its opinion in a democratic way and the minority will simply have to accept that, they are indeed right, but I would have expected to hear that statement after the first referendum in Ireland, too."
"After all, one thing is clear: we do not know whether this treaty will be beneficial for the European Union or whether - as I believe - it will be disastrous."
"I believe that it will result in a centralised superstate."
"One thing is clear, however: this Europe will only be a good Europe if it is a democratic one."
"A democracy in which voting takes place until the establishment obtains the result it wants is not a democracy."
"I hope therefore that we will not now attempt to put pressure on the Czech President in order to finish the job as quickly as possible."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, I am very sorry that those who, during the first referendum, spread lies during the Irish campaign now have to admit that the parliaments of 26 countries have ratified the treaty, that Ireland has ratified the treaty in a referendum and that so far, all decisions by the constitutional courts regarding the Treaty of Lisbon have been positive."
"They cannot get away from this fact."
"Secondly, compared to the Treaty of Nice, the Treaty of Lisbon is a treaty of the parliaments and the citizens and therefore, a treaty for more democracy."
"Thirdly, I would like to thank the Irish Members, the Irish people and also their opposition leader, Enda Kenny, who should be included in the list mentioned."
"Finally, I would like to say that I am convinced that the ratification process will continue, as all parliaments have ratified it."
"I cannot believe that the Czech President would rather adhere to the letter-borne requests of the opposition leader of a country that has already ratified the treaty than the views of his own parliament and his own constitutional court."
"It would be like a French opposition leader writing to the British Queen and asking her not to sign a law passed by the House of Commons."
"One last thing: Mrs Malmström, I would ask you to take seriously the views that we expressed yesterday in the committees regarding the European External Action Service."
"The papers that I have so far ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the Irish, the Irish people that is, on the successful implementation of the Lisbon Treaty referendum."
"The clear Irish 'yes' is good news for Ireland and good news for the whole of Europe."
"Following its historic enlargement, the EU needs a new and strengthened constitutional foundation."
"Only in this way will Europe, in a period of global economic crisis and global competition from all quarters, be able to overcome the challenges and pitfalls of the 21st century."
"The Czechs have also said 'yes' to the Lisbon Treaty."
"Both chambers of the Czech Parliament, by a clear constitutional majority, have backed the Lisbon Treaty."
"The Czech public endorse the Lisbon Treaty, just as a clear majority of them endorsed accession to the European Union in the referendum of 2003."
"The Czechs are well aware that a nation of ten million people, just like Europe as a whole, can achieve freedom, independence, security and economic and social prosperity only through the existence of a democratic, strong and efficient European Union."
"The Czech Republic is a parliamentary democracy."
"The authority of its president depends on the will of Parliament."
"The Czech President is not an absolute monarch, nor is he a supreme representative as in the political system of the former Soviet Union."
"I would therefore like to call on Václav Klaus to respect the will of the Czech people and, following clarification of the situation in the Czech Constitutional Court, to sign the Lisbon Treaty without delay."
"In my opinion, prevarication and obstruction bring no dignity to the role and position of the Czech President."
"(SV) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, for the vast majority of pro-Europeans, the Irish result was good news."
"As many have said, we will now have a more democratic and open EU."
"The Irish people have now played their part in bringing the EU out of a constitutional crisis."
"It is now up to the rest of us."
"I think there were several points that were in the EU's favour this time."
"You are not in a strong position if you are alone when storms are raging in the world."
"I think we can all agree about that."
"The doubts surrounding the treaty have been eliminated, but I also believe that there was an old, historical argument involved here."
"Ireland does not want to be associated with British euroscepticism."
"Dublin is not London!"
"Some people have said that a referendum cannot be carried out more than once."
"That is like saying that elections cannot be held more than once."
"For most of us here, it is a good thing that people - and perhaps even some of the Members here - can change their opinion if the circumstances change."
"This is why we have democracy and why we vote several times."
"Now it is the turn of Poland and the Czech Republic to ratify the treaty."
"Poland should not be a problem."
"It may be more difficult with Mr Klaus in Prague - he appears to be stubborn."
"He was very earnest, if not scathing, in expressing his mistrust of the Treaty of Lisbon here in this Chamber in the spring."
"We now know that this is a very sensitive issue in the United Kingdom."
"If there is a change of government in London next spring - and there is a good chance that there will be - and if the Czech process takes longer or if they want a referendum, there is a risk that the EU will face renewed problems with regard to the ratification of this treaty."
"I had intended to address the Swedish Prime Minister, but he is not here."
"He has a good relationship with David Cameron."
"I hope that he will utilise this relationship to ensure that we have a better EU debate, not only in Europe, but in the United Kingdom, too."
"We need a strong..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, the double referendum in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty has created a dangerous precedent."
"There were signs that if Ireland did not accept the document, it would have to keep voting until the required outcome was achieved."
"During the campaign, a full range of pressure tactics was employed, from concessions such as guarantees that the EU will not interfere with internal legislation on ethics, religion and economics, through threats like the loss of their Commissioner, to the blackmail that Ireland would be marginalised and thrown out of EU structures."
"All of these measures, in the context of fears fuelled by the crisis, led to the notorious result."
"Using enormous financial means, many EU agitators even promised jobs in exchange for accepting the Treaty, and did not concentrate on the key issues."
"Political commentators have drawn attention to the undemocratic methods and arrogance of the EU political elite."
"In view of the double standards employed, I appeal for another, third referendum to be held in Ireland, and for the possibility of a renewed vote on this document in the national parliaments of EU Member States."
"Mr President, an earlier speaker accused my colleague, Nigel Farage, of not respecting Irish democracy."
"Can I assure them that he does."
"What he has no respect for is the unfair and biased way in which the referendum campaign was conducted."
"Indeed, such is his and our party's respect for democracy that we would like to see referenda in the 26 countries that have so far been denied them."
"Another speaker said that it was not the first 'yes' vote that there had been and that there had been 'yes' votes in Luxembourg and Spain, but surely those referenda were on the Constitution and not the Lisbon Treaty?"
"We are told that Lisbon is different from the Constitution, so which is it?"
"Have we had the same referenda in six countries, or have we had referenda in four countries on the Constitution and referenda in two countries on Lisbon?"
"If it is the first case, then it is a 3-3 score draw."
"If it is the second case, it is a 2-2 score draw and a 1-1 score draw."
"Hardly a ringing endorsement for the Lisbon Treaty."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, it is a disgrace to democracy that the established politicians are denying their citizens a referendum in their own Member States while demanding two referendums in Ireland."
"It is also a disgrace that these politicians are demanding that we accept the outcome of the second referendum when they did not, in fact, accept the outcome of the first one."
"Irrespective of whether this Constitution Reform Treaty of Lisbon enters into force or not, we need a new basic treaty."
"This new basic treaty should include the genuine separation of powers, a truly independent court of justice for matters relating to subsidiarity, total transparency and economy and, most importantly, binding referendums."
"This way, we can still escape the Europe trap, and this is something that we should put all our efforts into doing."
"(IT) Mr President, there is no doubt about it: the victory of the 'yes' vote in Ireland's referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon is an extremely positive step for the revitalisation of the European Union and for the crucial political and institutional reforms provided for by the Treaty."
"I am delighted with the citizens of Ireland, who responsibly voted 'yes' and thus avoided full-blown paralysis of the European project."
"I hope that President Klaus and President Kaczyński can be convinced of this too, as it is to be hoped that Ireland's ratification via the referendum will contribute towards the efforts to enable the Treaty to come into force on 1 January 2010."
"The Irish 'yes' vote shows, however, that a united Europe is the only politically credible project which can bring benefits to the countries and, above all, to the citizens."
"Today, there is no politician in Ireland, or in any of the other Member States, capable of proposing a development strategy for their country if it left the European Union, or perhaps participated in it in a more restricted way."
"We now need to act promptly and with greater courage from the Commission through bold pilot initiatives on various fronts; for example, greater courage to issue Eurobonds, greater courage for the joint management of the immigration issue and greater courage to address energy matters."
"Above all, however, we must take account of the serious mistakes committed in recent years."
"The decline of the political project we call the 'European Union' can be attributed to a specific factor: it happened when we insisted that this project should no longer follow the wishes of the people but those of the bureaucrats."
"Therefore, when I say 'greater courage', I am referring first and foremost to greater courage on the part of the Commission leadership, so that we can achieve the goals which we have set ourselves."
"(PL) Mr President, the Irish people have said 'Yes' to the European Union."
"Now the time has come to remove the two greatest hindrances in Europe, which the Irish have in fact already discredited."
"To the Presidents of Poland and the Czech Republic: enough of this contempt for Europeans!"
"Let us not waste time, when we have so little of it, and when we have so much to do."
"I want to appeal to Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister of Poland, to adopt the Charter of Fundamental Rights in our country, for obvious reasons."
"Until now, we politicians have said that we do not have sufficient instruments and legislation to allow us to act."
"Now, in this chamber, we have before us a great task."
"Very soon, we will have a new treaty at our disposal, and we must get the European Union on track for a common and rapid departure from the crisis, for acting on behalf of the citizens and for strengthening the EU's position in the world."
"We must fight unequal pay, and for better and equal access to education, culture and health care."
"New legislation will help us to maintain diversity in the EU, but we must bring in greater equality, which EU citizens so much lack today."
"Our objective should be, in addition, to prove to all those who were against the Lisbon Treaty that we can also work for them, and that their 'No' was and is to us a greater motivation to work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am 35 years old and I expect greater dynamism in what we do."
"I expect us to communicate more quickly with the European Commission and the European Council on procedural and personal matters, and also on substantive matters."
"We are going to be presenting big European projects."
"I also ask the President of the European Parliament, the Conference of Presidents and Chairs of political groups: at what stage are our preparations?"
"Will we be ready to implement the Treaty of Lisbon and, if so, when?"
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the result of the Irish referendum was clear and was an excellent signal both for Europe and for Ireland."
"The Irish must be congratulated on this result for a host of different reasons."
"I myself, however, am especially pleased that the Irish referendum caused the European Union and its future to make the headlines once again."
"A genuine debate is needed, because attempts at a real vision of the EU's future have been fairly pathetic in recent years."
"It should also be remembered that the Treaty of Lisbon is a compromise on the previous EU draft constitution."
"If the Treaty had been rejected by the Irish this time, we would seriously have had to consider and discuss what direction we, as the European Union, are actually heading in."
"We would also have had to think about whether we had perhaps moved forwards perhaps a little too quickly in recent years, and with too few restraints."
"In my opinion, the problems that have arisen during the ratification process just go to show that the European Union is felt to be something that is somewhat distant and hard to control."
"To resolve this problem I, for my part, hope that the debate on the future of the EU will not just stop here, but that it will continue to be transparent with the Reform Treaty."
"We have to create a united Europe, and we cannot ignore the reasons that led to this Treaty originally being rejected either."
"I believe that in this sense, the Treaty of Lisbon and its implementation are absolutely the right way to go and a big step towards a more democratic Union, and one that shows greater solidarity."
"To do this, however, we will need to continue to have an open dialogue."
"I am also pleased that the Treaty of Lisbon will help boost cooperation between national parliaments and Brussels."
"It is now time to switch our attention from Ireland to the Czech Republic."
"I hope that Europe will no longer need to hold its breath."
"It is important that the Treaty of Lisbon quickly becomes a reality and that we ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the decision is made."
"Much as I regret that the first decision was not respected, we will have to wait and see what outgoings there will be from this decision."
"And it is now up to others to decide and I hope they are given the space to make that decision."
"I just hope that the high percentage that voted 'yes' in the Republic of Ireland do not live to regret it in the longer term."
"I wish to say no more about it."
"There is now a very heavy burden and responsibility on the shoulders of those who wish and desire an even deeper centralisation of the decision-making process here in Brussels."
"I urge them not to get so far in front of the people that the people have no idea where they are heading or what their destiny may ultimately be."
"I am not anti-European, but I do want a Europe content within itself and able to allow those who disagree the right to put forward an alternative view, and we do not always get that any more in this House."
"(NL) Any euphoria about the second referendum in Ireland is totally out of place."
"The victory of the 'yes' camp was a stolen victory, as the original referendum was conducted in a perfectly legal manner and in accordance with the rules."
"The majority of those who voted 'no' in 2008 understandably felt that official Europe would never heed their verdict if it did not suit the EU."
"Therefore, many voters stayed at home."
"EU democracy is a one-way street."
"There was no fair campaign."
"The dominance of the 'yes' camp in the media was further reinforced by the European Commission's quire of 16 pages in all the Sunday papers: an illegal use of taxpayers' money about which the last word has yet to be said."
"The voters were intimidated."
"The economic crisis was used as a lever to force people to vote 'yes'."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the European Commission, I can predict that your hocus-pocus propaganda will boomerang on you sooner or later."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us imagine that tonight, when this interminable debate finishes, we go out and we meet 27 fellow Members downstairs and we have to decide unanimously which restaurant we are going to."
"If we negotiate this obstacle, then imagine that the 27 of us have to choose the same thing to eat, and that the 27 of us also have to decide whether or not to have wine."
"Mr President, this metaphor, which comes from someone who is on a diet, provides a good illustration of the current situation of the European Union and what the Treaty of Lisbon brings in: in my view, it is the most important thing, namely eliminating the requirement for unanimity."
"If those of us who have spoken here all want the European Union to function properly, to be effective, to produce added value for the people, then the first thing that needs to be done is to replace the requirement for unanimity with a requirement for super-qualified majorities."
"That is the most significant achievement of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Opposing the Treaty of Lisbon means not wanting Europe to function properly or to have an important role in the world."
"Mr President, I do not understand, and it is a source of regret for me, how some fellow Members who have freely entered this Parliament can have more confidence in the Council of Ministers than in the European Parliament."
"In addition, these are people who will never be in the Council of Ministers."
"Why do they believe that their interests are better defended by the Council of Ministers than by this Parliament, where they are present and where they can vote?"
"Mr President, another thing I do not understand is why a certain fellow Member said that what they want is to take their country - and this is a legitimate view - out of the European Union."
"In that case, ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary to be in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, because the Treaty of Lisbon establishes, for the first time, an exit clause."
"Now, in truth, it is necessary to have the courage and the ambition to say to their people that it is necessary to leave the European Union."
"That is also something that I would like to see."
"Mr President, to sum up, I believe that through the result of the Irish referendum we are completing the process."
"Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Rouček and Mr Brok - who are concerned by the attitude of the President of the Czech Republic - that I have no doubts."
"I have no doubts because a person who refused to sign what had been adopted by the Chambers that elected him, a person who refused to sign the Treaty, would be like the Queen of England refusing to sign a law from Westminster."
"That is not possible."
"I am also certain that someone as patriotic as Mr Klaus would not want to see his country engulfed in an internal constitutional crisis."
"Mr President, I therefore believe that the time has come to join forces, for us to realise that the world is not waiting for us, the Europeans, and that either we Europeans must unite and maintain constructive positions regarding the problems that our citizens are experiencing at the moment, or else Europe, as a power, will disappear from the map."
"Mr President, that is what I believe that we must now do, in unity, as Europeans and as Parliament."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate colleagues from Ireland on such a fantastic result."
"In Britain we have the UKIP and the Tories who, as you will all know, have been arguing for a 'no' vote in the Irish referendum."
"UKIP constantly tells us that we should not interfere in national matters, but they certainly interfered in the vote in Ireland, there is no doubt about it."
"I would like to say thank you to Nigel Farage."
"I think he did a fantastic job because I understand that his interference actually helped the 'yes' campaign."
"That is what is known as unintended consequences, but we are grateful for his intervention."
"The Tories, on the other hand, are in total disarray."
"They have divisions over Europe and it is overshadowing their conference which is taking place this week in Manchester."
"David Cameron's position on the Lisbon Treaty is quite untenable."
"He keeps promising that if he wins a general election he is going to have a referendum if the Treaty has not been ratified by 27 Member States."
"At best, he can be accused of dithering."
"At worst, I think he can be accused of being less than honest with the British people, because I do not know how he is going to do that."
"And just when the major issues of the day need more cooperation, not less, issues such as climate change, how we tackle the financial crisis and how we deal with rising unemployment, just then the Tories have decided that Britain is going to be isolated and at the margins of the EU."
"They would like us spectating rather than influencing."
"And we have heard their plans this week: how they are going to cut public services and to increase pension ages, and how they will help the wealthy by cutting inheritance tax."
"Once again they are fighting like rats in a sack, as we say in the UK, over Europe."
"They pretend they have changed but they clearly have not."
"No, they are the same old Tories, still helping the privileged few at the expense of the many, still putting dogma before the interests of the British people."
"The people of Ireland have clearly voted for a more democratic, effective and dynamic EU and the EU is now a better place to deal with the real challenges of today."
"The British Tories now need to come clean and tell us if they are intent on putting the future of the British people in the EU at risk, with all the serious consequences that has for jobs and prosperity."
"So come on, Mr Cameron, come clean and tell us the truth."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mrs Wallström, rather than use lofty words - and I have the impression that there is an inflation of lofty words in the European Parliament - it is worth thinking about why the Irish people said 'Yes', when last year they said 'No'."
"I think those who are saying it was the crisis which pushed the Irish into the arms of the Lisbon Treaty are greatly simplifying the matter."
"It seems that the main reason why the Irish, the citizens of the Green Isle, supported the Treaty, is because of what they secured from the European Union in the meantime."
"Ireland has guaranteed itself and all Member States its own, national Commissioner."
"Ireland should be thanked for this."
"The EU has also guaranteed that it will not meddle with taxes in Ireland, and this thanks to Dublin."
"May this prove to be the final relinquishment of German and French plans to standardise taxation in the EU."
"Finally, Brussels has promised that it will not meddle with the legislation of the Republic of Ireland in areas of morals and social norms, including protection of the unborn child."
"The Irish Government and the Irish nation should be congratulated for their effective negotiating."
"By the way, it is amusing to see the rejoicing of those who are pleased with the result of the referendum in Ireland."
"In many cases, the very same people opposed the holding of referendums in their own Member States."
"As I have said on a previous occasion in this House, I stand before you as one keen to see a Europe of cooperating nations."
"I have consistently opposed the federalism of the Lisbon Treaty and the ceding of powers from nation states."
"The result of the second referendum in the Irish Republic on the Lisbon Treaty changes nothing for the United Kingdom."
"A document harmful to British national interests on 2 October 2009 is equally as harmful on 2 October 2010."
"Ratification in Poland will not change that; ratification in the Czech Republic will not change that; the date of the UK general election will not change that; and therefore I want to use this opportunity in this House to call for the British people to be given a referendum, just as each and every European nation should be, on the full and complete text of the Lisbon Treaty."
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to express our delight at the result of the referendum in Ireland, not just on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), as has already been done by many Members, but particularly on behalf of the Portuguese Members of the PPE Group."
"I believe that this clearly strengthens the development and growth prospects of the European Union, and that it sets the stage for a new phase."
"We would like, of course, to congratulate all those who contributed to the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular, the Commission and the Commissioner here today and also, of course, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, which played a very important role in this."
"I would therefore also like to say that we are glad to see that, despite all these difficulties and the fact that we are still eagerly awaiting the position of the Czech Republic, the Portuguese people will be very happy to see the name of its capital associated with a decisive step in the development of the European Union."
"In this regard, I would also like to say that we will also be able to count on another flag, which will also always be a flag of the Portuguese Members of the PPE Group, which is the flag of national parliaments."
"I believe that the Treaty of Lisbon is a decisive step towards involving national parliaments in European democracy."
"I therefore believe that this aspect, which is the most important aspect of democracy, namely representation and not, as we have sometimes heard in this House, referenda, is what is vital and essential in democracy, which is to say, representation and not direct voting."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is also a major step towards increasing the involvement of national representative democracies in the European process."
"We are therefore very pleased with the Irish people's decision."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall certainly repeat things which have already been said and welcome, in any case, the result of the Irish vote on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I should simply like to draw the attention of the Members remaining in the House to the reasons for the change, because we are satisfied with the 'yes' but, a year ago, it was a 'no'."
"What has changed?"
"The text?"
"Very little."
"The context?"
"A lot."
"That is what matters."
"We can discuss institutional questions here. What the citizens are waiting for are political answers from Europe."
"That, to my mind, is the analysis that we need to make of this double vote."
"There is not just one vote, there are two."
"The 'no' to start with and then the 'yes'."
"The Irish said that they needed Europe in the crisis and this needs to be heavily emphasised, because they are asking Europe to protect them and that is important."
"I shall repeat what numerous members have said. I think that we need to proceed quickly now."
"So we are turning to the Swedish Presidency of the Council and we are turning to the Commission."
"If we want to reply to the demand by the people of Ireland, we need to give concrete replies."
"The economic crisis: is Europe capable of stimulating growth on a European scale?"
"The social crisis: is Europe capable of having an employment policy?"
"For me, these are the subjects at the heart of the debate and I am satisfied with another thing which the Treaty of Lisbon gives us and that is that Parliament will have enhanced powers and, in the political debate, I think that it has an essential role to play and that is to show that there are various options and to debate those options."
"However, now, if this is to be a democratic debate and if Europe is to manage to provide replies, we quickly need to designate a Commission and to ensure that the Czechs ratify as quickly as possible so that Europe can get back on the road to growth and hope."
"(MT) I too, welcome the result of the Irish referendum with pleasure."
"Allow me to make an observation."
"Those following from home will probably think: 'How is this result going to affect me?'"
"I want to give a few concrete examples of how this result will affect these citizens, quoting a few examples from my field, which is that of justice and home affairs."
"The Charter of Human Rights is one in which we should take pride, not merely as citizens of our individual countries, but as citizens of the European Union."
"Our civil rights, as citizens, are to be strengthened by this Treaty."
"This includes areas such as personal data protection."
"Safety and security shall also be reinforced, because the European Union intends to step up the fight against terrorism and criminality, thanks to the Treaty."
"Our legal rights will be bolstered, such as in court cases involving international adoption, or maintenance issues having international implications."
"Moreover, our interests in the particularly sensitive area of immigration will be consolidated when addressing the concept of widespread solidarity."
"This means that the Treaty will, in a concrete manner, affect the citizens."
"Why might this be?"
"It is because the government is going to bestow more powers onto this Parliament and this Parliament will see to it that these powers are wielded responsibly yet enthusiastically, and made to work to the citizens' advantage."
"In all of this, as representatives of the citizens, we must always remain on their side."
"Mr President, the overwhelming Irish 'yes' was not due only to a better understanding of the Lisbon Treaty, but also to the understanding of the fact that true respect must be mutual and compassionate."
"Our Irish fellow citizens also realised that the European train does not wait indefinitely for those who miss their appointment with history."
"The Czech case is a different one."
"The Czech people signalled in an appropriate way its support for a more political and social, more efficient and more democratic Europe."
"The government also supported the ratification of the Treaty, and Parliament ratified the Treaty."
"It is therefore not for us to show respect for the Czech people, but for the President of the Czech Republic to show respect for his people and its Parliament."
"For us, it is important to draw the right line between what is right and what is abuse and to proceed in such a way as to show, and to prove, that for us the right ends where and when the abuse starts."
"We cannot accept being prisoners of filibusters."
"We should acknowledge that the Lisbon Treaty was duly ratified by all Member States and start the establishment of the institutions on that basis."
"Parliament should be fully involved in this process."
"(IT) Mr President, I was also told I had three minutes, but I will try to stay within two minutes."
"I would like to join many of my fellow Members in expressing my satisfaction."
"I think that it is now time to put into effect, to implement the Treaty of Lisbon as soon as the ratifications take place, something which we hope will happen imminently."
"The committee which I chair has been doing everything in its power for some time now but, above all, it is important for Parliament to be aware of its new responsibilities: it must not allow the de facto loss of any aspect of its wider legislative functions."
"I would, however, like to highlight one issue which I do not think has been raised so far: there were many reasons why the Irish people previously rejected the Treaty, but one was the fear, among some voters, that the European legal system could violate, in Ireland. certain fundamental values concerning the right to life and the notion of family."
"These fears were allayed through declarations adopted by the European Councils of December 2008 and June 2009."
"I think this is important not just for Ireland, but for the whole of Europe."
"It was clarified, in fact, that the acquis communautaire does not concern the area relating to the right to life and the family."
"This clarification does not apply solely to Ireland, but to all the Member States."
"In reality, there was no need to clarify this because in various judgments involving France, the United Kingdom and Poland, the European Court of Human Rights had already ruled that in the areas of life, the value of life, respect for life and the family, it must be left up to the Member States to decide according to their history, tradition and culture."
"However, Ireland's attention to detail had the merit of formally clarifying this point which, as I was saying, now applies to the entire European Union."
"I believe that this is a good thing, which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile."
"Naturally, we know full well that European culture consists of the sum of the cultures of all of the countries that make it up, and we all want Europe to be not just an economic area but also, and above all, a community of values."
"I therefore think it proper that we show Ireland both our satisfaction and our gratitude for everything that it offers Europe in terms of its history and its ideals."
"Europe needed Ireland, not only for technical reasons relating to its mechanisms and organisational structure, but also for Ireland's contribution to what we are all seeking: the essence of Europe."
"(PT) The 'yes' vote in Ireland is good news for Europe and for me personally, as a Portuguese citizen and a committed pro-European."
"It represents a victory for common sense and reason against demagogy and manipulation."
"The Irish people have clearly stated that they believe in the European project."
"With the 'yes' vote, the main obstacle to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has been overcome."
"President Klaus now has no excuse and has to respect democracy and the parliament which elected him, and which has already approved the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Treaty of Lisbon marks the beginning of a new era."
"The European Union will make decisions more efficiently and will be more effective in its external relations."
"It will be more democratic and more transparent, closer to the public and less dependent on governments."
"With the new Treaty, the European Union will be better equipped to fight climate change and to meet the challenges of globalisation."
"Mr President, it has been a long debate but not very dramatic."
"Can you imagine if it had been 'no', this Chamber would be full and heaving with emotion and I suppose the fact that it was 'yes' and we are now very calm here in the European Union speaks volumes."
"Of course, I welcome the outcome of the referendum in Ireland along with my Fine Gael colleagues here in Parliament."
"I worked very hard to achieve that 'yes' and I would say that the Irish people rose above national problems and other domestic issues and looked at the European question and the Lisbon Treaty and at the past and our associations with the European Union and overwhelmingly said 'yes' to the European Union, and that is a fantastic result."
"On the other hand, Commissioner Wallström, who very kindly came to Ireland on a number of occasions, will have picked up a strong undercurrent, which I believe exists in all Member States, of people who are disconnected from what the European Union is about."
"I think we are all of us to blame for that."
"I believe that we do not speak enough about the project, about the European Union, about solidarity, about what it really means; we speak more of what we can get or what we give and what is wrong with a directive or what is bad about a regulation."
"So in our politics, we need perhaps to rise above some of those issues because when you are at the referendum stage, as we were, it involves explaining to people on the streets and in shops and in schools about what Europe is, how it works, what I do, what the Commission does, and that is a great exercise."
"It really is a very powerful exercise to talk to people directly about the European Union."
"People in Ireland know it better now than they did for the last while because we have engaged so well with them."
"So I would urge us all here in this House to do more of that at home in our own countries and to avoid knocking the European Union where it is not appropriate."
"Criticise by all means where it is needed, and to those, like Nigel Farage, who worry about the Irish being bullied, I would say: we are not easily bullied."
"It did not happen."
"It will never happen."
"And can I say, Commissioner, that if I am not here for the end of this debate, it is not out of any disrespect to you or to the President or to the Presidency; it is other commitments, but thank you all for your support throughout the last while."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, as an MEP from Hungary, the first country to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, I welcome the outcome of the Irish referendum."
"However, I would very much like us to look beyond the ratification process and talk about how we should implement the Treaty of Lisbon, which is a huge step towards political union and the creation of a community of values."
"It will greatly extend social rights and will protect them with the legally binding enforcement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It will also make linguistic and cultural diversity an EU norm."
"However, the Treaty of Lisbon also has an extremely important new provision."
"For the first time in EU history, the rights of persons belonging to minorities are mentioned."
"National and ethnic minorities, as well as immigrant minorities, account for 15% of the EU's population."
"We can now finally embark on creating an EU structure for protecting minorities. Thank you for your attention."
"(PL) Mr President, adoption of the Lisbon Treaty ends the historic process of the major enlargement of the European Union by 10 new Member States."
"This process began in the 1990s and is ending with agreement on institutional changes which adapt the EU to the new reality."
"Adoption of the Treaty means a new phase and an opportunity for the EU to make a step forward."
"The institutions which we will be able to establish are only an opportunity, and it is up to us how we make use of that chance."
"It is also a good moment to demonstrate to those citizens who are sceptical about the European project that the EU is alive, is changing and, above all, that it responds to people's problems."
"It would, therefore, seem most important to propose a new policy, one which responds to the challenges which are before us."
"There is, however, a fear that, instead of concentrating on this, we will be dominated by discussion on formal and personal matters: who should be chosen for which position?"
"We must not now allow national egoism, which may intensify at a time of crisis, to undermine the chance which the EU currently has."
"Above all, we need to convince the citizens that the EU is not only the elite, with jobs and an excessive bureaucracy, but that it also means new and more effective ways of solving their problems."
"Mr President, I stand here today as a proud Irish MEP."
"It took the blood, sweat and tears of public representatives, athletes, business groups, farmers and trade unionists to secure a historic 'yes' vote."
"I am also proud that last Friday, I was in my home area of Tipperary, watching a landslide victory come through, which showed something that I have always believed in, that Ireland is a huge supporter of Europe, and we fully intend to play our role in the future."
"Now I know that the leprechauns in UKIP, who attended the House last year following the previous referendum, have disappeared."
"Many of you will be glad to know that I firmly believe that the Irish people have banished them forever from here."
"The Lisbon Treaty verdict was a victory for truth over the damned lies and myths perpetrated in some cases by extremists on the 'no' side who tried to take advantage of people's genuine concerns."
"Those extremists met their match last Friday."
"However, it is a lesson we have to learn."
"All of us who support progressive politics and a progressive Europe need collectively to provide citizens with a greater incentive to engage with our European institutions."
"We can never take them for granted."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Irish people have clearly chosen to place themselves at the heart of Europe by approving the Treaty of Lisbon by a very large majority."
"As the youngest of the French MEPs, I welcome this choice, which allows us at long last to turn our attention to our citizens' specific concerns."
"I should like, however, to make two comments."
"The first is that no one should overlook the fact that it is basically the crisis that turned the Irish into Europhiles and that this Irish 'yes' therefore translates a real need for Europe, for a political Europe that protects and proposes, the need for a Europe which is capable of responding to the crisis and which ensures that its citizens have the security which they demand."
"Secondly, the failure of the first referendum in Ireland should serve as an example and a lesson to us."
"We cannot, every time we want to move Europe forward, find ourselves at the mercy of procedures which are inappropriate in the Europe of the 27."
"With the current system, it is sometimes ultimately more in the interest of a Member State to say no to a treaty than to say yes."
"This bonus in saying no should encourage us to put a real procedure in place at Community level which prevents debates from being hijacked nationally."
"Today, the European dynamic is again under way and we MEPs shall finally get to address issues as sensitive as the crisis in the dairy sector or even last winter's gas crisis."
"May I draw the House's attention just for a moment to what will be the sole concern in the Community budget for 2010, namely financing for the second phase of the European recovery plan to the tune of EUR 2 billion."
"I am one of those who think that we should ensure that this plan is not financed solely through agricultural appropriations, because that would be the wrong signal to our farmers in the context of this crisis and would also represent a risk to the future of our food security and our lands."
"To close, I should like once again to thank our Irish friends and to send them my warmest and heartiest congratulations on their clearly European choice."
"I now call on our Polish and Czech friends to take action to ensure that Europe has this toolbox which will allow it to meet the challenges of globalisation over coming decades."
"(ES) Mr President, briefly, I have three messages."
"Firstly, like many of the previous speakers, I welcome the convincing 'yes' expressed in the Irish referendum."
"Secondly, as Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I would emphasise the importance of the probability of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in reinforcing the legitimacy of the project of European integration, since it has to do with citizenship, rights, freedoms and our capacity to jointly combat organised crime and terrorism and, within the scope of the Schengen Treaty, to be effective in dealing with delicate subjects such as asylum, immigration, the status of foreigners and control of the EU's external borders."
"Thirdly, however, I would like to point out, as previous speakers have done, that this is not the end of the story."
"This is true not only because the Czech Republic still has to ratify the treaty, but because we must learn lessons from the difficulties we have experienced in achieving ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It has not been easy; there have been 10 years of debates and this will make us much more demanding, not only with ourselves, but also for future enlargements, in requiring loyalty, cooperation and the assumption of responsibility from all those who sign up to the new rules that will be in operation from the time the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force."
"(FR) Mr President, a few days after the positive referendum in Ireland, I really feel that we can say that we are more European today than we were before."
"I am really and truly, quietly, delighted about this."
"Unfortunately, we are still largely dependent on the decision of the Constitutional Court, as well as on the good will of the Czech President."
"We must now send out a clear signal in terms of accountability to those who hold in their hands the future of this key treaty for the Union, for our institutions and for the 500 million Europeans that we represent."
"We can no longer be held hostage by a few people whose sole aim is to work against the general European interest."
"If it is legitimate that some do not wish to go further down the path of European integration, if it is legitimate to voice one's misgivings, then it is also legitimate to let those who want more European integration to progress."
"Generally, the processes for ratifying European treaties too often look like sagas or Pyrrhic victories."
"Must we constantly be forced to exert such pressure to guarantee the entry into force of a treaty and its institutional reforms?"
"We must learn from this chaotic ratification process and also, obviously, from this commitment to hold negotiations on the organisation of a second referendum in Ireland, as if it were normal to make a population that has taken a sovereign decision vote again, and as if it were normal for agreement to a treaty to be used as a bargaining chip."
"The institutional coherence and balance of the European project is at stake."
"Ratifying a treaty is a minimum requirement in terms of loyalty and cohesion from the moment one chooses that one's country should join the European Union."
"We wanted to send out a strong message to the citizens by ensuring that the treaty was ratified for the European elections of June 2009."
"What do you believe the citizens think today about the Treaty of Lisbon and, moreover, about our internal coherence and our legitimacy?"
"(SL) The Irish's unambiguous yes to the Treaty of Lisbon is an important step towards a united Europe and a minor blow for the eurosceptics."
"This decision is all the more important because it was made by the people, voting in a referendum, and by a nation which had been given a year to consider whether or not its initial no would be of any real benefit to Ireland."
"Along with the Czech Republic, the spotlight will now fall on the credibility of the United Kingdom, an EU Member State where the leader of the opposition, Mr David Cameron, has promised to hold a referendum on the Treaty, if he wins the 2010 election."
"He has made that promise, regardless of the fact that both houses of the UK Parliament ratified the Treaty of Lisbon in mid-2008."
"What will become of the credibility of the decisions and international commitments of the United Kingdom, one of our Member States, which has already ratified the Treaty, but is now threatening to suspend its decisions and commitments, two years after adopting them?"
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, when almost 84% of Hungary's citizens voted in spring 2003 in favour of our country joining the European Union, they felt as if they were returning to where they belonged, among the united family of European peoples from which they were excluded by Communist dictatorship spanning more than 40 years."
"The Hungarians therefore regarded the European Union not only as a structure for economic cooperation based on regulations, but also as a community operating on the basis of values."
"We are delighted that Ireland has approved the Treaty of Lisbon because this action gives our values their rightful place in the founding treaty, and these values definitely also include recognition of the rights of persons belonging to minorities."
"This is why, Mr President, I was first to raise my blue card when Mr Szegedi made his remarks."
"I would have liked to ask him then whether he has read the Treaty of Lisbon because, if he has read it, he would probably be familiar with the article on minorities which I have just mentioned."
"Hungary's citizens are confident that, once the Treaty comes into force, the EU will become more sensitive to minority-related issues so that measures similar to the Slovak language law will become unacceptable once and for all."
"This means that everyone must not only observe the letter of the law, but they must also respect the attitude being conveyed by the European Union."
"In other words, every European citizen shares the responsibility of ensuring that minorities can freely use their mother tongue without any restrictions and that they feel at home in the land of their birth."
"I firmly believe that the Treaty of Lisbon will also greatly help us make the EU's institutions understand better that we must protect our values within the EU as well, and that we must take immediate action if they are violated."
"Fellow Members from the socialist, liberal and non-attached groups, we simply cannot have double standards."
"In other words, we refer to these values if this is dictated by our interests, but we forget about them if this suits us better."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) does not wish to see such a Europe."
"(ET) Mr President, I was in Ireland last week, supporting my friends in the Irish Labour Party."
"I am glad that Ireland gave a strong 'yes' vote, because this is a very important decision for both Ireland and the European Union."
"As a farmer, I am particularly happy that this time, Irish farmers supported the referendum campaign right from the beginning."
"That was a very good decision, because when the treaty enters into force, the European Parliament will obtain equal powers with the Council in agricultural matters, including the codecision procedure in the common agricultural policy, which is definitely good news for European farmers."
"(GA) Mr President, as a newly-elected Member, I would like to say that I am proud of the positive result voted for by the people of Ireland in the Referendum on the Lisbon Treaty last Friday."
"I am also proud of the lively debate which is taking place here today."
"People have asked why Ireland changed its mind."
"There were perhaps four key factors."
"One, I think, was the fact that we gained a commissioner; two, the guarantees; three was that we had a proper debate and people were properly informed this time, not like the last time."
"Also, the economic crisis was a factor, but the key one was that the 'yes' campaign got mobilised this time and it did not last time."
"Civil groups and politicians got together and, for the first time that I could recall, political parties - mainstream political parties - put their differences aside and campaigned for the good of Ireland."
"The Irish people responded."
"The 'no' campaign was also well organised and everyone had their say, including the United Kingdom Independence Party, who ensured that this document - The truth about the Treaty: Stop the EU bulldozer - was distributed widely in Ireland."
"Well, the Irish people decided that they much preferred to be on the EU train than the UKIP bulldozer."
"Last weekend was a triumph for communication."
"You have often heard about communication deficit."
"This was a triumph for communication and if we continue in this way, we will bring Europe closer to the people."
"Now it is up to the Czech President to sign the agreement and bring it into being because, if he does not do so, it would be, I think, the greatest act of dictatorship in the history of the world and a complete negation of democracy."
"Thank you very much for all your support, and we look forward to being positive Europeans from Ireland long into the future."
"(DE) Mr President, after eight years and many debates and negotiations, there is a real chance now that this Reform Treaty will enter into force, thanks also to the hard work of many people in this House who were committed to this project from beginning to end in the Convention and later in the intergovernmental conferences."
"I believe that Parliament has played a constructive part in this Reform Treaty."
"I think that, if the constitutional court in Prague in the Czech Republic gives a positive ruling, there will no longer be any legal grounds for President Klaus to block the EU any further. The other constitutional bodies in the Czech Republic will also find ways to overcome any such illegal blockade."
"We are, of course, hearing that there is a new threat of trouble from the United Kingdom."
"However, if a British Government were to allow a referendum, then it would not be on the Treaty of Lisbon but on whether the British people are in favour of the EU or whether they want to pull out of Europe."
"That would have to be the subject of the referendum and not a treaty that has been ratified."
"That would be totally unacceptable."
"I think we need to learn something from this, and that is that our citizens need more information."
"I therefore hope that, in the new Commission, we will also get a vice-president for communication and for information and perhaps even a commissioner for European citizenship."
"That would be the answer to these controversies on European policy."
"(PL) Mr President, thanks to the Lisbon Treaty, Europe can take up challenges which extend far beyond the internal problems of Member States."
"Will Europe be ready to do so?"
"It is still hard to say."
"It is certain that in this matter, much will depend on the citizens of Europe."
"However, as well as the Treaty, the EU must also have the will to act and to have a world presence."
"It must have a feeling of responsibility for the world, for its stability and development."
"The EU's own security and development also depend on this."
"We must resist the common metaphor of Europe as a safe, prosperous and democratic country which cherishes human rights, but which is taken up with its own internal affairs and has turned its back on the world."
"The Treaty of Lisbon compels us to have a better understanding of the challenges which are before us."
"Following the Irish 'Yes', a united Europe is now looking at Poland and the Czech Republic."
"I do not have the slightest doubt that the Lisbon Treaty will soon come into force."
"While we await the signatures of President Kaczyński and President Klaus, however, let us think about how the discussion progressed during the present reform, and let us draw conclusions from what happened."
"We should prepare for the future."
"We should prepare for further reforms, because the wonderful design we are creating - the European Union - is an idea which is not yet finished."
"Finally, I would like to say one more thing - thank you, Ireland."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2 October was a great day for Europe thanks to the Irish who voted in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The entry into force of codecision will be a veritable democratic revolution for the common agricultural policy in particular."
"Parliament will finally have decision-making powers equal to those of the Council of Agricultural Ministers, thanks to the agreement of the Irish and the favourable votes received in the national parliaments, including the Czech Parliament."
"Any delay would create problems for farmers throughout the Member States."
"In fact, the agricultural sector is going through one of its most delicate and difficult times of recent years, with a fall in the prices of most products, and not just of dairy products, as we have seen these last few days."
"As we await the formal entry into force of the Treaty, we expect the Council and the Commission, Mr President, to give careful consideration as from today to the decisions taken by Parliament - which was democratically elected by all European citizens - regarding agricultural matters too, starting with measures to address the crisis in the dairy sector."
"(RO) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am also delighted that the Irish have finally approved the Treaty of Lisbon as I regard this document as being important for European integration."
"We need a new treaty to provide the European Union with modern instruments and improved working methods enabling us to tackle the challenges of the modern world effectively."
"This Treaty is, first of all, a step forward in terms of making the decision-making process at EU level more democratic, allowing those of us in the European Parliament to be among the first to enjoy the positive exchanges of opinion provided for under this Treaty."
"The extension of the codecision procedure will put the European Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in terms of legislative powers for 95% of Community legislation."
"For example, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which I am a member of, we will extend the codecision procedure from 40 to 80 areas of expertise, thereby increasing the democratic legitimacy of EU legislation."
"I think that the new legal basis will help accelerate the economic development process and adapt Member States' legal systems."
"I also firmly believe that this measure will then allow us to achieve more easily one of the European Union's main objectives, which is to create economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"I await with great interest the completion of the ratification process and I am eager for us to get its implementation under way."
"(PT) Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the resounding 'yes' expressed by the Irish people last Sunday in the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Let us hope that the arduous process of ratifying this Treaty has finally come to an end."
"I am sure that the Treaty will also be ratified by the Czech Republic."
"It would, I believe, be incomprehensible and unacceptable were the future of Europe to be held back, were it to be blocked by a personal opinion that totally disregards and stands at odds with the majority of the relevant parliament."
"We all want the institutional impasse we have faced for almost 10 years to finally come to an end."
"I therefore thank the Irish people, since the will they have shown gives us hope for a stronger, more prosperous Europe that is more unified and enlarged, while giving all European institutions the duty and obligation to act in such a way as not to betray this will. Moreover, this will is shared by the vast majority of European citizens."
"I hope that we are all worthy of a Europe that is increasingly prominent, is more cohesive and which promotes democratic values, social and fundamental rights and economic growth across the world, while also promoting environmental protection."
"(PT) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say a few words to applaud the historic and far-reaching result of the referendum in Ireland and to highlight the decisive role played by Fine Gael and its leader, the next Prime Minister of Ireland, Enda Kenny, in leading this process."
"During this process, it was very clear that the European Union needs to be brought closer to its citizens."
"It is those citizens, and indeed all of us, who are the principal beneficiaries of all the actions of the Union."
"It is vital that everyone is aware of the impact and of the benefits that Europe has in our everyday lives."
"Europe is our home."
"What is good for Europe is good for each Member State and is good for their citizens."
"This is certainly true of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This Treaty makes it much clearer that people can be both proud and loyal national citizens, and committed supporters of the European project."
"Having reached the end of an excessively long debate on its organisation and functioning, the European Union will be able to focus much more, and with new, more effective instruments, on the real problems faced by Europeans: competitiveness, growth and employment."
"I will conclude, Mr President, Minister, with a suggestion for future generations."
"In view of the lack of information concerning the values, powers, objectives and modus operandi of the European Union, Parliament should propose, at the end of compulsory schooling in each Member State, a new compulsory system of European studies."
"Young Europeans will effectively learn about our principles, who we are, what we do and where we want to go, in an objective, genuine and real way."
"By learning it at a young age, they will understand, throughout their life, the potential and enormous usefulness of the European identity created by this unique project to voluntarily share sovereignty on a continental scale."
"(MT) Yes, this is indeed an historic moment, not only because the Irish have accepted the Treaty with a strong vote in favour, but because today Poland has declared it will ratify the Treaty."
"This treaty has come a very long way."
"I have only been here for five years, yet there are delegates here who have been working towards this historic moment for a long time."
"Amongst them is a colleague of mine, Méndez de Vigo."
"This momentous occasion will now place greater responsibilities on our shoulders, as politicians, and this also goes for the President of the Czech Republic."
"His personal opinion does count; however, one cannot hold a whole country, as well as the whole of the European Union, hostage because of a personal political opinion."
"As politicians, we have to shoulder huge responsibilities."
"We have to provide answers and we have to answer only to the citizens of the European Union, because ultimately we are representing them."
"Europe is facing tough challenges on issues such as the financial crisis, climate change, immigration problems, and the creation of more jobs in Europe."
"For this reason, the opinion of the President of the Czech Republic cannot hold Europe back from working to achieve the standards we have set."
"I agree with the previous speaker who said that the Commission needs to be appointed."
"We have a President and therefore I do not see why we should wait for the ruling of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic before a Commission is established."
"A great deal of work needs to be done and the Commission needs to get down to business immediately in order to guarantee that this work is carried out."
"(HU) I add my sentiments to those of the numerous fellow Members before me who welcomed the decision made by the Irish electorate to vote in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We can now look forward optimistically to finalising ratification."
"However, this is nothing more than a first step along a path where, in my view, we have three objectives to fulfil."
"We must deepen the new Member States' integration, we must dismantle those barriers which have introduced a two-speed Europe, and we must continue the process of the EU's expansion towards the Balkans."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is based on European solidarity, and I hope that this solidarity will work in practice and not simply remain a declaration of intent expressed at the European institutions' various forums."
"I think that the economic crisis also shows that solidarity is the only means of responding to the challenges we face, and that a strong EU will enable all of us to be important players on the global stage."
"Our journey thus far has been long and arduous."
"We cannot allow ourselves to weaken the foundations of European integration."
"I firmly believe that reality will prove to the Eurosceptics that together we are stronger, not to mention that we cannot gain anything by going back to the geopolitical situation of the early 20th century."
"(PT) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, with last Friday's result, I hope that Europe can move on from a crisis concerning the Treaties and that it will therefore be possible to have a stable institutional body that is suited to an organisation with 27 Member States, and which is different from that based on the Treaty of Nice."
"Mr President, a treaty is not really a work of art, a legal work, which only exists to be admired."
"It has to be useful and it has to be effective."
"That is why, as important as it is from a political perspective to hold a discussion on, for example, who is going to be President of the Council, it is more important for the ratification process to end for the Treaty to enter into force, not least because, with this result in Ireland, it is clear that Europe cannot be built against the will of the people."
"Whether by representation or by referenda, this coming together is real."
"It is also important to point out that a 'no' vote is as democratic as a 'yes' vote."
"Some people appear to be confused on this point."
"I hope that, with ratification in Ireland, the Czech Republic and Poland, a situation of de facto solidarity can be established among Member States."
"I also hope that we move towards a situation in which this large step is accompanied by the pattern of Schuman's Europe: a Europe built by small steps, day by day and, crucially, by the promotion of European ideals."
"(HU) Mr President, the successful outcome of the Irish referendum is a triumph for the whole European concept."
"What can this be attributed to?"
"One reason is that the Irish were given a guarantee."
"In other words, the majority took into consideration the wishes of the minority."
"Real democracy is not only about the opinion of the majority winning the vote, but about taking into account the wishes of the minority as well."
"This is what would also be needed to protect Europe's minorities."
"The second reason for the successful outcome is that those in favour of the Treaty ran a better campaign than the last time when the referendum was rejected."
"The European Union is a union which says 'yes' rather than 'no'."
"Last but not least, the economic crisis also had a role to play in the electoral success."
"The same fate that met Iceland, which is not part of the EU, would have awaited Ireland."
"A crisis highlights that together we are stronger, and that cooperation and solidarity are better than having tense relations between us."
"Mr President, the new Irish vote, this time approving the Lisbon Treaty, is indeed very good news."
"However, there are at least two aspects that require caution."
"The first is that the Treaty still needs the signature of President Klaus, whom we have only embittered with our reaction to his open scepticism and anti-Europeanism when he spoke in this Chamber last spring."
"I only wish that we were smarter than that."
"The second aspect where caution is required is the high expectation we place on the restart of integration, including enlargement, once the Lisbon Treaty is in place."
"The truth is that if we slow down, it is not because of the absence of the Lisbon Treaty, which is only an alibi for it, but because of the negative effects of the current crisis, encouraging renationalisation of certain Community policies and the centrifugal tendencies within the Union."
"Those have to be dealt with separately and properly if we want the Lisbon Treaty to be what we expect it to be."
"(ES) Mr President, I believe that one of the conclusions of this debate is that when things are explained, when there is discussion with people, when there is communication, when lies are denied, then greater participation and greater backing for the European project are achieved."
"Therefore, I venture, along the lines of what many speakers have said, to make a positive, constructive contribution, and to ask the European Commission to consider whether, in the make-up of the new Commission, the duties of the Commissioner for Human Rights should not be included within a wider portfolio such as the Commissioner for Citizenship, to include communication, which is vitally necessary in order to be able to communicate well, to explain well, and to be able to begin a genuine dialogue on our European project."
"Mr President, the result of the referendum in Ireland at the weekend on the Lisbon Treaty is living proof that this Parliament is not democratic, honest or accountable."
"But who in here really cares?"
"Well, I do."
"The fact that the Irish were made to vote twice proves that the EU has now become a dictatorship."
"If the vote does not go the way of the EU dictators, then they simply vote again and again until the right result is achieved."
"This is not fair and is, in my view, morally wrong."
"The Lisbon fanatics in this Parliament will now go full steam ahead to create a new European superstate of 500 million people."
"The injustice is that people in my country, the United Kingdom, were promised a referendum but denied one."
"The irony is that under the Lisbon Treaty there will be a full-time President."
"It is quite likely to be Tony Blair."
"The new President of the EU will be the Head of State."
"You cannot have two Heads of State and, since the EU takes precedence over national bodies, the EU President - perhaps Tony Blair - will take precedence over our Queen."
"The people of my country will not accept an unelected failure or anybody else taking precedence over our Queen."
"God save our Queen!"
"(RO) As you are well aware, Romania is currently going through an unprecedented political crisis, on top of the economic and social crisis."
"Preparations are under way at the moment for a major electoral fraud."
"I am referring to the Romanian presidential elections which are due to take place on 22 November."
"All the elections in Romania have been rigged, but the scale of the fraud which is currently being planned is incredible."
"I am not accusing anyone in particular, but mechanisms have been created and honed for committing this type of fraud which are absolutely outrageous."
"They include false opinion polls, electoral tourism, additional lists, votes cancelled for actual voters and valid votes cast for dead people, huge sums of money and amounts of consumer goods used to bribe poor people, persuading parents by bribing schoolchildren, computer fraud and many other illegal acts."
"Please help save Romania."
"I am making an SOS appeal on behalf of the Romanian people."
"The institutions of the European Council, including primarily the European Parliament, have a moral duty to help a Member State remain civilised."
"Do not allow the Balkan mafia to wreck the European Union's noble project."
"I am sounding this alarm bell because the European Union's institutions are the Romanian people's last hope."
"(HU) The supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon are celebrating not just a victory, but a victory for democracy itself on the pretext of the current 'yes' vote in an imposed referendum."
"However, the actual result is 3-1 in favour of the Treaty's opponents."
"Let us not forget that the people in both France and the Netherlands said 'no' to the Constitutional Treaty containing completely identical provisions."
"The creative, but cynical idea was then devised that, if the people of Europe do not accept this constitution, let us call it the Reform Treaty and political leaders will vote for it in the various parliaments."
"Unfortunately, the Hungarian Parliament was the first to do this."
"I recognise that many people think that the Treaty of Lisbon is the path to happiness for Europe's peoples, but this still does not give them any legal basis at all to say that this is what Europe's peoples wanted."
"(RO) I simply wanted the floor to remind Mr Vadim Tudor that the topic of debate at the moment is the referendum in Ireland and that the completely false statements he has made have nothing to do with this subject."
"At the same time, I would like to welcome the victory won by the pro-Europe camp in Ireland."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I see that the debate from the Irish referendum still lives in this plenary and there is a lot to say about democracy."
"Is it democratic to let the Irish people vote once again?"
"Well yes, it is."
"It is very democratic."
"If you listen to the people, you ask them: Why did you vote 'no'?"
"You clarify these things by giving legal guarantees to the Irish people on taxation, on neutrality, on certain ethical issues and also making a guarantee that all Member States, including Ireland, will have a commissioner when the new Treaty comes into force."
"With this clarification you have a new referendum."
"The people answered 'yes' with a two-thirds majority and with a higher turnout than last time."
"This is democratic, and I think we should rejoice and congratulate the Irish people for this."
"I also see that there is a clear domestic debate from the UK in here; it would be tempting to go into that, but I will not do so."
"I just want to say that, independently of who is in Downing Street next year, Britain needs Europe and Europe does need Britain."
"I also sense a certain frustration in here about the timetable now."
"I can understand that and I share it, but I want to assure the House that we move as swiftly as we can."
"We have guarantees or promises that the Polish President will sign within a few days."
"The timetable in Prague is still a little bit unclear."
"I will go there tonight, if I catch the plane, and will meet with lots of people tomorrow in order to get a clearer picture of the different scenarios, the different timetables that we can expect."
"We need a few days to grasp and to assess the situation in the Constitutional Court."
"The Treaty is in the Constitutional Court and, until it has left there, the President cannot sign."
"I am quite optimistic: I think this will be ready within a short time, but we need to wait a few days for this clarification."
"Meanwhile, the Presidency is working, of course."
"There are lots of working groups going on in order to prepare for the full implementation of the Treaty."
"There are discussions going on with the European Parliament, with the Commission, in order to put everything in place that we need to do so that the Treaty can enter into force very swiftly."
"I received a question from Madame Flautre about the extra MEPs; that is an issue that will have to be dealt with as soon as the Treaty enters into force, and I want to assure her, if she is listening now, that we are doing whatever we can to ensure that the decision can be made as soon as possible."
"I want to thank Parliament for having decided to give these MEPs observer status while we wait for the formalities once the Treaty is adopted."
"She also named many men who are being mentioned for the top jobs, but those are men named in the media, in the press; there are no official candidates from the Council yet."
"There will be."
"But all those names mentioned are named in the media."
"I would very much welcome if one of those top jobs could go to a woman."
"I cannot guarantee you that we will succeed with that because a Presidency has to listen to all the capitals and find candidates who can achieve a consensus among the 27 Member States, but I would very much welcome the candidacy of a woman; it would make Europe much more representative than today."
"I also feel, Mr President, a very strong sensation in this House that Europe should move on to be a stronger, bigger player in the world and to show resolve when it comes to the economy, the fight against unemployment, tackling the challenges of globalisation and the climate issue."
"We need to do that."
"The Lisbon Treaty is an important tool for us to do so; but we also need to move on independently of what Treaty we have, to show concrete results and to deliver."
"Only when we do that, when we deliver what the citizens expect of us - and this goes for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament - will we gain legitimacy and the confidence of our citizens."
"I can assure you that the Presidency is doing everything it can to move the processes on on all these issues, with the help of the European Parliament."
"Thank you very much for an interesting debate, Mr President."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, it has been an interesting debate, which I am sure, to some extent, repeats the discussions that have been held in Ireland and elsewhere."
"Could I just start with some facts."
"It is the Member States' governments who decide on the method for ratification."
"There is no way that the EU institutions can force a Member State to choose either a referendum or a parliamentary ratification."
"I think it is very important to say this."
"It is interesting that those who speak very strongly in favour of independent nation states are also the ones who would be willing to impose a referendum on all other Member States, which I find a bit strange."
"Now Ireland decided to carry out a second referendum."
"Let us be very honest; this always carries a political risk, but it was the Irish Government which decided that they were willing to do so."
"And why did they do that?"
"Incidentally, it is not unusual to repeat referenda: that has been done previously on domestic issues, and in certain Member States you can come back several times on a domestic issue too, so let us be intellectually honest about this whole procedure."
"I think we have heard a very good analysis from the Irish MEPs themselves, from Mr Kelly, from Mary MacDonald, from Mr De Rossa: they offered an explanation on why there was a change among the Irish population, on why they moved towards a 'yes' vote, and I think we have had good answers."
"I think some MEPs have a very strange way of looking at democracy as very static and absolute."
"They maybe prefer to forget that this is a discussion about a reform."
"It is a process that started in Laeken many years ago and has involved different democratic bodies and discussions over the years to try to find a common way of taking decisions in a more modern, more democratic and efficient way."
"Member States and their leaders have, of course, invested a lot of time and energy in this procedure and this is why it is not static: it cannot be compared with a football match."
"I am sorry, you cannot count scores in the same way as in a football match, because we also have to listen to each other."
"And this is what was done."
"The concerns of the Irish people were listened to and they did it themselves in Ireland."
"Why do we have to explain?"
"The Irish themselves, their national parliament, debated in a subcommittee the reasons why there was a 'no' vote - because this came as a surprise to many there."
"So they looked at the reasons."
"I was there myself."
"I was at the fashion fair in Dublin, I was at the fish market in Cork, I was at the public meeting in Donegal, and what many people said first of all was: Well, we have not actually read the full text of the Treaty, it is a very complex legal text and it is difficult to understand exactly what this is all about."
"Some said they were very afraid that what was on the posters might be true, that the EU will decide on a minimum wage which is EUR 1.48: can that really be true?"
"Or is it true that the EU will impose conscription to a European army and send very young people to Afghanistan in a European army: can this be true?"
"What kind of statements are these?"
"Should I believe in them?"
"So there were a lot of worries and a lot of real concerns and mainly, I would say, a lack of information and a need for their concerns to be taken seriously."
"This is what happened."
"Civil society also engaged, as I think Mr Kelly explained very well."
"I am not ashamed of the fact that we made a citizens' summary of the Lisbon Treaty which was then published in the big newspapers - uncontested by anybody I may add - so that citizens could themselves read a summary in understandable language of the full Treaty, so that they could judge by themselves what was in there, what was true or not."
"I think the legal guarantees helped, because then it was clarified that they did not have to worry about neutrality or abortion or any of the other concerns."
"So this was clarified and they got legal guarantees and they got a Commissioner - and thank you, Ireland, because it means that there will be a Swedish Commissioner also from now on, also a German one, and one from Greece etc., so I think we also have to thank the Irish for setting that straight."
"Of course, we do not debate these things in a political vacuum."
"The reality will also influence how we think about these issues, and there is nothing wrong with that, but I think we should always, in the analysis that follows after a referendum, think very carefully about any fear factors on both sides, because fear is a very strong emotion and it might be misused."
"So I think that the debate that will follow in Ireland should also address how to avoid using or misusing any fear factor."
"But the reality showed that the Irish people believe that they have a place in the centre of Europe, and that they will be helped by belonging fully to Europe and not being questioned about whether this is true or not."
"I also hope that the Commission can continue to play this role of providing factual objective information, but the debate will go on because, remember, the upside of a referendum is that you have to engage with citizens."
"You have to provide information and a debate and a discussion."
"The downside is that it also divides the population."
"You are forced to say 'yes' or 'no' and that can stay for a long time in the hearts and minds of the Irish as well."
"We have a duty, an obligation democratically, to also take the concerns of the 'no' side seriously, to continue the debate and make sure that the EU issues are integrated into the normal political debate, including by civil society in Ireland from now on, and in the rest of Europe in the same way."
"This is part of the reason why we did not have a higher voter turnout: that it is not part of the daily discussions about politics in each and every Member State."
"That has to be done and I hope that there will be a Commissioner responsible for both citizenship and communication from now on, and hopefully under the new Lisbon Treaty."
"Thank you, Commissioner, and my thanks to all of you who took part in this very important debate on the outcome of the Irish referendum."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Irish vote is a definite vote in favour of Europe."
"When the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force, this will break the stalemate which Europe has been in for some years."
"A great deal has been mentioned about the lack of democracy which Europe is suffering from and about the gulf between the European Union and its citizens."
"Some members also speak about the inability of European institutions even to cope with the realities of a disparate Europe, made up of 27 Member States, in which many of the countries that have recently joined have a different level of development and type of economy."
"The inadequacy of the Community's institutional structure, the need to increase the EU's legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens and to have specific instruments to enable the EU to assume global responsibilities in a difficult economic climate justify the determination of Member States to support the shift towards a more democratic Europe."
"When the Treaty comes into force, this will pave the way for reforming the European Union, providing the institutional capability to take action."
"However, political will is needed to tackle these challenges."
"Consequently, the successful implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon has a crucial role to play."
"The European Union is fast approaching the moment of carrying out the most important reform in its history: the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Ireland said 'yes' to the Treaty 16 months after its resounding 'no' which generated equal concern among all the governments in Europe."
"The EU is now waiting on the Polish President to ratify the Treaty quickly, as he promised, and for the Constitutional Court in the Czech Republic to do what the Czech President is refusing to do."
"This will make the EU more flexible and quicker to respond, but this is not all."
"The Treaty will also rekindle the aspirations of the states wishing to become members of the Community."
"The Western Balkan states have enthusiastically welcomed Ireland's ratification of the Treaty."
"This will give the EU a stronger voice globally, once its institutions have been set up and reformed."
"The EU will then no longer be only a common market, but also a power in the sphere of international relations."
"Its strength is provided by the 27 Member States, which could increase in number in the not too distant future."
"2010 is the year when we hope the Treaty will come into force."
"It could also be a year of renewal for the EU, which has managed to reinvent itself continually throughout its history."
"The result of the referendum in Ireland on the Treaty of Lisbon is a vital step in European integration and in strengthening the role of Europe."
"The Treaty of Lisbon enables the EU to step up Europe's role in policies on energy, climate change, science and cooperation with developing countries."
"The Treaty of Lisbon makes the fight against climate change a specific objective of EU environmental policy, acknowledging that it has a leading role, internationally, in the fight against climate change."
"For the first time, a chapter will be included on energy, giving EU policy the objectives of achieving energy security, promoting energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources."
"The Treaty of Lisbon lays the foundations for creating the European Research Area, strengthening European action in an area that is vital for economic growth and employment."
"The Treaty of Lisbon introduces, for the first time, a specific legal basis for humanitarian aid, and states that the reduction and the eradication of poverty in developing countries is the primary objective of the Union's development cooperation policy."
"The result of the second referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, held in Ireland, does not change the anti-democratic nature of a process that has disregarded the will of the people from the very beginning."
"We will not allow the 'no' of the French and Dutch peoples to the Constitutional Treaty to be forgotten, nor the deception that its transformation into the Treaty of Lisbon constituted."
"The disregarding of the Irish people's 'no' in the first referendum, and the unacceptable blackmail and interference that followed it, culminating in an enormous campaign that included the shameless use of the resources of the Irish State and of the European Union, will also go down in history."
"Neither the ratification process, nor the content of this Treaty, legitimise the continuation of policies that are at the root of the serious economic and social crisis we are experiencing in the EU, particularly in Portugal, and which this Treaty will make worse."
"For our part, we will continue, with unshakable determination, to fight neoliberalism, federalism and militarism within the European Union."
"We will continue, with great belief, to fight for another Europe - a Europe of workers and the people - and against the renewed threats to social and labour rights, democracy, sovereignty, peace and cooperation, which we are now facing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, who are we laughing at?"
"The rather contemptuous satisfaction shown here regarding the 'yes' extracted from the Irish after months of harassment, guilt campaigns, lies and half-truths is a disgrace to democracy and an insult to the will of the people."
"As far as justice is concerned, confessions obtained by coercion are worthless: it should be the same for these rigged ratifications where there can be only one possible answer, which we are ready to obtain by making citizens vote and vote again ad nauseam, when we do not actually bypass them altogether by taking the parliamentary route."
"Today, Václav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic, is the only person left to try to resist this liberticidal text that is the Treaty of Lisbon."
"All of the patriots of Europe, all those who reject the European superstate, all those who think that the people have the right to determine their own future, must today demonstrate their support for him and help him to stand up to the pressure he is being put under and will be put under even more in the near future."
"I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the outcome of the Irish referendum, which paves the way for the Treaty of Lisbon to come into force, thereby creating a European Union promoting greater democracy and solidarity."
"I would like to highlight that, on the one hand, the Treaty gives national parliaments greater influence and, on the other, it is based on the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, thus maintaining and consolidating the binding force of this document setting out human and minorities' rights."
"This is particularly important to Hungary as the ban stipulated by the Charter on discrimination against persons belonging to a national minority is an extremely important gesture from the point of view of both the Hungarians living outside Hungary and the minorities living inside Hungary."
"During the current global economic downturn, it is important to recognise that effective and efficient European cooperation can provide a medium-sized country, like Ireland or Hungary, with a way of emerging from the crisis."
"When the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force, it will make legislative procedures much simpler."
"The most significant progress in this respect will be the increase in the number of areas where decisions are adopted by the EU Council by qualified majority (rather than unanimously), as well as the increase in the number of areas where the European Parliament will have the role of colegislator, along with the EU Council."
"These new features will greatly facilitate the procedure for adopting decisions at EU level, especially in areas such as the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund, which are extremely important to Romania which needs this money to continue its development."
"I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament will receive wider powers, for instance, with regard to agricultural funds, an area so severely affected by the economic crisis we are going through, while also being an area where specific measures are needed, capable of producing rapid results, in order to improve farmers' lives and ensure food security for our citizens."
"President Lech Kaczyński, despite a publicly made promise, has still not signed the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The delay has now lasted for over one and a half years."
"This is unjustified, reprehensible, and even illegal."
"On 1 April 2008, the President was commissioned by the Polish Parliament to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, the President is obliged to sign."
"It is not a question of his good will or his inclination - it is an obligation."
"In not fulfilling this obligation, he is breaking the law."
"By making his signing of the Treaty dependent on the decision of the citizens of another country, President Kaczyński has placed Poland in the role of a country which is not capable of making a sovereign decision, and has offended the patriotic feelings of Poles."
"In Ireland, the winners were the supporters of a strong and united European Union."
"In Poland, the President stands in the way of victory, and he now has almost no support from society."
"Could it be that he has procrastinated for personal reasons, for fear of losing an inflexible anti-EU electorate, including that associated with Radio Maryja?"
"If so, it is high time to initiate the procedure for impeachment."
"In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, there are two possible ways."
"The Tribunal of State, or application of Article 131, paragraph 2, subparagraph 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland - 'a declaration by the National Assembly of the President's permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health'."
"The Polish people do not want to hinder development of the European Union."
"On the contrary, they want to initiate beneficial changes in Europe."
"President Kaczyński does not have the right to interfere with this."
"Despite the fact that the European Union and its institutions function efficiently on a day-to-day basis without the Lisbon Treaty, failure to adopt it would create an image of a Community which is not able to reach and adopt important decisions."
"The Lisbon Treaty introduces new principles of voting, in which the voting power of a country is clearly dependent on the number of its people."
"In comparison with the present system of voting under Nice, large countries, including Germany, are better off, whereas medium-sized countries, including Poland, lose out."
"The share of votes allocated to Poland under Nice was very advantageous."
"Certain fears concerning the division of competences have been aroused by the establishment of a new institution - the President of the European Council, commonly known as the President of the EU."
"Let us remember that we already have a President of the European Commission and a President of Parliament, there is also the leader of the country which heads the EU or has what is called the Presidency, and in addition we await the appointment of a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"Apart from introducing the position of High Representative, also known as the EU Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Lisbon Treaty strengthens EU foreign policy by establishing common diplomacy."
"Furthermore, the possibility of leaving the EU has been set down, the European Citizens' Initiative has been created, and the treaty also speaks of the need to create an EU energy policy, which is very important for the future of Europe."
"We wait with hope for the final ratifications of the treaty."
"in writing. - (RO) The Treaty of Lisbon will allow national parliaments to put Europe-related subjects on the agenda for national debate."
"Virtually every legislative proposal from the European Commission will be examined by national parliaments in order to confirm compliance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"If one third of the national parliaments inform the Commission that this principle has been breached, the Commission is obliged to revise its proposal."
"If half of the national parliaments believe that the principle of subsidiarity has been breached, the European Parliament and Council are obliged to make a statement as to whether this principle has been complied with or breached."
"After a piece of European legislation has been adopted, national parliaments can request the European Court of Justice to repeal it within two months of its publication."
"Given the duration of the legislative process at European level, the inclusion of Europe-related subjects on the agenda for national debates will allow Member States to receive on time the pointers and guidelines for development and to devise their own at the same time as the EU."
"The Treaty of Lisbon reaffirms that the EU's economy is a social market economy and grants the EU new powers in areas such as climate change and energy policy."
"These powers will be of particular importance, especially against the background of the EU's energy dependency on third countries."
"in writing. - An Irish 'yes' to the Lisbon Treaty is good news for Europe."
"There is no doubt that the Treaty will serve for the benefit of the European Union by simplifying its decision-making process and creating a better field for its effectiveness."
"Contrary to what its opponents say, the Treaty does not bring any major revolution."
"Never before, however, has so much depended on the process of implementation."
"The devil is in the detail."
"With its innovations, the Treaty can increase, for instance, the EU's visibility on the international scene."
"Much depends, however, on the final arrangements that will determine the character of the new instruments, like the European External Action Service."
"It is therefore essential that the European Parliament takes its due role in the process of creating new institutional setting foreseen by the Lisbon Treaty, wherever possible."
"It will make this process more transparent, increase its legitimacy and finally it will serve, I believe, for its better outcome."
"Situation in Guinea (debate)"
"The next item is the Council statement on the situation in Guinea."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, we move from one item to the next."
"This is a very serious and important subject which the honourable Members have raised and chosen to put on the agenda."
"On Monday, 28 September, more than 100 people were killed in Conakry, Guinea, when members of the Guinean security forces shot into crowds of demonstrators."
"Guinean citizens had gathered in a stadium in the capital to demonstrate against the presumed intention of the Guinean military interim leader, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, to run for President."
"The final death toll is still unknown, as the soldiers also collected the bodies rather than allow them to be counted at public morgues."
"At this stage, we do not know the real dimension of these tragic events."
"The number of injured people is said to be at least 1 200, and eye witnesses have reported that soldiers raped women on the streets of Conakry."
"During the violent repression, several opposition leaders were wounded and temporarily arrested."
"The number of protestors still under detention is also unknown; the houses of opposition leaders were ransacked and shops looted by uniformed men."
"In a TV statement the following day, Captain Camara expressed his condolences with the families of those killed and visited some of the injured."
"He proclaimed two days of national mourning and pledged to investigate the violence."
"He distanced himself from the killings by saying that he was not in control of the elements of the military responsible for the atrocities."
"The European Union immediately and forcefully condemned these brutal and shocking events."
"A Presidency declaration, a statement by High Representative Solana and a statement by EU Commissioner De Gucht were issued the following day."
"We will have to insist on the liberation of the arrested prisoners and a thorough investigation of the events."
"The violence in Guinea received worldwide condemnation."
"The UN Security Council was briefed last Wednesday on the situation in the country."
"The African Union condemned the events and decided to prepare a report on possible measures to be taken."
"The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) called for a full international inquiry into the matter."
"Parliament, as you know, condemned the unconstitutional change of power, and in its resolution of 15 January 2009, called for respect for human rights and a rapid return to constitutional order."
"The EU decided to open consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and EU development aid - apart from humanitarian aid and support for democratic transition - was frozen."
"We have not been alone."
"Our international partners have acted in line with us."
"The African Union and ECOWAS decided to suspend Guinea until it established a democratically elected parliament or government."
"An international contact group on Guinea co-chaired by the African Union and ECOWAS, and with participation by the European Union, was put into place."
"In March, the military junta agreed with the opposition to have elections before the end of 2009, which gave reasonable hope for a peaceful and democratic transition."
"Captain Camara gave his assurances that none of the coup leaders would stand for political office."
"A national transitional council was to guide the transition process and prepare the necessary modification of the constitution in order to help elections."
"What can we do, then, to prevent further violence, and how can we help the people of Guinea in their legitimate desire for democracy, the rule of law, peace and development?"
"Well, there are three main areas of action."
"First of all, we should maintain and reinforce political pressure on the regime in Conakry, notably in the context of the international group."
"Captain Camara's decision not to run could allow calm to return."
"The nomination of the President of Burkina Faso, Mr Blaise Compaoré, as facilitator in the crisis on behalf of ECOWAS and the International Contact Group, is a very positive sign, and the European Union has welcomed this appointment via the Presidency."
"We hope that his mediation will contribute to a secure, peaceful and lasting solution to the situation in Guinea."
"Secondly, the option of targeted sanctions against individuals responsible for violence could be further explored."
"We will need to coordinate this approach with the African Union and other international and bilateral partners."
"The upcoming EU-African Ministerial Troika in Addis Ababa and the meeting on Guinea on 12 October in Abuja will be important in this respect."
"Thirdly, we should continue to provide humanitarian aid to the civilian population and support the democratic transition process."
"The latter will nevertheless depend on the credible willingness of the transitional authorities of Guinea to re-engage in a peaceful and constructive dialogue with a clear commitment to refraining from further violence and to respecting the human rights and political freedoms of its citizens."
"We will spare no efforts to help the people of Guinea in this critical moment and we are determined to support a return to civilian, constitutional and democratic government through free and transparent elections."
"We encourage all stakeholders in Guinea to refrain from violence and to make a peaceful and democratic transition."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, the crisis in Guinea is, in my opinion, symptomatic of a wider problem which occurs, unfortunately, in many African countries."
"That problem is the weakness of democratic institutions and the underdevelopment and sometimes even the lack of mechanisms characteristic of mature civil societies."
"This is important for Europe not only because we are bound to our values - it is also important for purely pragmatic reasons."
"We discuss the effectiveness of development cooperation fairly often."
"This is not unusual, because we are the largest donor of this aid, and we must be interested in its effective use."
"However, we do have to face the fact that we will not achieve progress in effectiveness if the countries which make use of this development cooperation are not in a position to give minimum guarantees on the good use of this aid."
"Yet it so happens that it is hard to build such guarantees without democracy and civil society."
"Yesterday, Mr Camara accused France of humiliating Africans by breaking off relations with Guinea."
"This is not true."
"France has not humiliated Africans."
"It is Mr Camara himself who has humiliated his compatriots and Africans."
"He has humiliated them, because he has allowed killings, he has allowed rapes."
"The reaction of France and the French Government was justified and proper, and our position should be equally resolute and severe."
"It is a paradox, but the situation is fairly simple."
"We cannot fail to react to the brutal action which has been seen in Guinea."
"We must demand a halt to the use of violence."
"With Mrs Malmström, I think the mission of the President of Burkina Faso is a very good thing, and I wish him success."
"Let us hope that it will be effective."
"We should also support the African Union, which has announced the imposition of sanctions if civilian rule is not restored."
"We know about the commitment of Sweden to the process of building democracy."
"We know that just this is a real priority of the Presidency in the area of development policy."
"We know, too, that the Swedish Government has both experience and a record of success in this area."
"I want, therefore, to hope and believe that this commitment, in a case so difficult and extreme as Guinea, will be effective and will produce good fruit."
"Mr President, the worrying developments concerning the political situation and security in Guinea require a firm response by the European Union."
"Indeed, as you know, on 28 September 2009, troops under the Guinean Government carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration uniting all of the opposition parties, causing 157 deaths and injuring more than a thousand people, some of whom suffered particularly vile instances of rape and mutilation."
"The Republic of Guinea is a country that has experienced only two dictatorial regimes since its independence in 1958."
"It is time for this infernal spiral to come to an end."
"The European Union, its Member States and its institutions had already condemned Moussa Dadis Camara's coup d'état on 28 December 2008."
"As is procedure, the Council then applied Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to establish a road map with the Guinean authorities, to be used as a framework for democratic transition."
"This list of measures included, in particular, the organisation of free and transparent elections within a year and the commitment that members of the CNDD, notably Moussa Dadis Camara, would not stand in these elections."
"Captain Camara's decision to postpone the organisation of elections until spring 2010 and his refusal to raise the issue of whether he would stand for the Guinean Presidency were a sign of what was to come, with the current escalation."
"Thus, the demonstration that was bloodily repressed on 28 September was aimed precisely at calling on the junta to honour its commitments."
"The reaction of the government in office in Conakry shows its true intentions quite clearly: to eliminate all forms of democratic opposition in order to remain in power."
"In response, the international community has unanimously condemned these violent actions and the Guinean regime."
"Outraged by these massacres, our Parliament's Committee on Fisheries recently refused, quite rightly, to vote for the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Guinea."
"Today, and in light of the latest events, the European Parliament would like to know the decisions the Council intends to take to address this situation."
"First of all, does the Council intend to push for the creation of an international commission of inquiry on the events of 28 September?"
"How does the Council intend to act to ensure that the CNDD respects its commitments, namely to organise free and transparent elections as soon as possible, without the participation of Moussa Dadis Camara or another member of the CNDD?"
"With regard to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, what measures does the Council intend to take against the Guinean junta?"
"Finally, what concrete commitments has the Council made to support the different initiatives run by ECOWAS, the African Union and the International Contact Group on Guinea?"
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I wish to extend every sympathy to the Conakry victims on behalf of both the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the 30 African parliamentarians in the ACP-EU Liberal Democrat Network whom we met last week to discuss, among other things, the situation in Guinea, together with the chairman of Guinea's liberal party, a party which, unfortunately, has been directly affected by the violence."
"As for what needs to be done, with regard to certain areas already mentioned by the Swedish Presidency, our requests are as follows: firstly, that together with our African Union partners, we demand the release of the prisoners and political leaders still being detained."
"Secondly, we must demand that free and democratic elections are held, without the participation of members of the National Council for Democracy and Development."
"Thirdly, I call for targeted sanctions to be adopted without too much pussyfooting around, since we must, in any case, send out a very clear message, in view of the atrocities which have been committed."
"Fourthly, we too wish to raise the issue of the fisheries agreement: we in the ALDE Group voted against it in the Committee on Fisheries, thereby helping secure the majority necessary to block the agreement, as far as possible."
"We believe that this is another important decision that the Council must take."
"The fifth point is that we must establish targeted programmes to assist the victims, especially the women who were raped and who certainly need special dedicated help."
"Lastly, there is the question of justice."
"For us, it is vital to have not only an international commission of inquiry, but also the full involvement of the International Criminal Court."
"We believe that if there is a lesson to be learnt from the Conakry victims, it is to confirm once again that justice must be done and that people who commit crimes of this nature in Africa or anywhere else cannot get off scot-free."
"Presidents, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot remain silent in the face of the tragic events which took place last week in Guinea."
"The violence that was used against the opponents and, in particular, women, is utterly appalling and unacceptable."
"I wish to express my support for the victims as well as their families, some of whom are still waiting for the return of their loved ones' remains, which were taken away by the junta in order to cover up the traces of a true massacre."
"In addition to the current measures being initiated by the Council and the Commission, the parliamentary situation today allows us to react to these violent acts and to send out a strong message to the Guinean Government by rejecting the Report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Guinea, which we will vote on during the next plenary session."
"The Committee on Development already unanimously rejected, in September, this fisheries agreement between the European Union and Guinea, expressing doubts over the use of the funds allocated by the European Union."
"Aside from the fact that it seems inappropriate to allocate funds on the basis of fish catches made by European boats without taking into account either fishery resources or the effects on the local population, the recent events make us fear that these funds will be used for military purposes against the Guinean population."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament cannot endorse the fisheries agreements with Guinea while the victims' wounds are still fresh."
"Doing so would send out the wrong message to the Guinean Government."
"It would be a scandal which I cannot bring myself to endorse."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many other new MEPs here, I was struck by the attention given to human rights in the debates held in this House, and particularly in those of our President Buzek."
"I subscribe to this completely because, if I am here, if I headed a list during the European elections in France, it is above all because I am a campaigner for associations and, specifically, a human rights campaigner."
"As such, I cannot be indifferent to the events in Guinea, as these were human rights campaigners, and more generally representatives of civil society, who were arrested, raped, in the case of women, and massacred on 28 September: more than 150 people were killed and more than 1 250 people were injured - as you said, Minister - in a single day."
"The repression continued in the days that followed and is still continuing, despite the fact that these people - as has also been said - came peacefully to remind Mr Camara of his own commitments."
"There is no doubt, according to the witness statements flooding in, that, contrary to the declarations made by the captain, these violent acts were carried out by forces close to the government."
"The situation there is confused, but having regrouped within the Guinean National Council of Civil Society Organisations, civil society organisations are appealing to the international community for help."
"In the last few months, this National Council has set an example in these countries of Africa by organising a major process for the Guinean people on the basis of the commitments made by Mr Camara."
"The news reaching us from Guinea is alarming."
"We cannot just make do with speeches here, in the European Parliament."
"This debate is taking place at our request, at the request of the Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, but we must go further."
"We call for the explicit condemnation of the repression of the demonstration."
"You have talked to us about targeted sanctions, Minister."
"Could you tell us more about this?"
"On the matter of calling an immediate halt to persecution, of releasing all those arrested and of establishing an international commission of inquiry on these events, I believed, Minister, that we were moving in the right direction."
"However, could you give us some more information about this too?"
"You also told us that all aid had been frozen, except for humanitarian and food aid."
"To us, that seems a minimum, but in practical terms, how can we support the transition to democracy?"
"Mr President, we want a resolution to be voted on in the next Strasbourg part-session so that the European Parliament does not just limit itself to speeches, but acts by taking a decision, as it was able to do last January."
"I will say it once again: this is a matter of urgency."
"The organisations on the ground are warning us of the risk of ethnic conflict."
"We must not wait for a new Rwanda before we react; human rights must be defended in Africa just as they must be defended everywhere else in the world."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Malmström described the situation in Guinea perfectly."
"For several weeks, Guinea has been the scene of violent clashes during which free citizens demonstrating in the streets in the name of their political beliefs have been subjected to unprecedented violence."
"The Guinean Government is persecuting and killing anyone whose political beliefs differ from those of their leaders, thereby depriving the people of any kind of freedom which, as we well know, is obviously an inviolable right for every human being."
"The umpteenth massacre is taking place and is in danger of turning into genocide if we do not urgently adopt immediate, tangible measures."
"Last week, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am Vice-Chairman, decided to adopt a resolution condemning the use of force by the Guinean authorities and demanding that the local government immediately complies with the rule of law and upholds fundamental rights."
"Following the deaths of 157 people in street clashes, and the attempts of Moussa Dadis Camara to cover this up, members of the opposition turned to the international community in the hope of receiving help and greater protection."
"On 5 October, however, Captain Camara opposed the presence of a foreign peacekeeping force in the country, rejecting any kind of foreign interference in internal affairs."
"I therefore feel that in addition to expressing our condemnation, we need to respond by taking immediate, concrete action, as my fellow Member Mr Rinaldi just said."
"In the face of violations and denials of the right to life - with women and children paying the price once again - we cannot fail to act and demand a return to the rule of law."
"Therefore, by calling upon you, my fellow Members and representatives of the institutions, I hope that we can reach unanimous agreement - and I stress unanimous - to adopt immediate measures enabling the people of Guinea to re-establish fundamental and inalienable rights, such as democracy and freedom, in their country."
"Naturally, I also wish to personally express my support for all the families affected by these tragic events."
"(SV) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, I am a member of the Committee on Fisheries and I visited Guinea myself last December, so I have followed this matter very closely."
"First of all, I find it remarkable that the European Union is maintaining its fisheries agreement with Guinea, as the agreement was entered into with the previous regime two weeks before the coup."
"We have, in fact, stuck to an agreement that we entered into with a lawful regime, but now there is a military dictatorship."
"We have stuck to this all year."
"Yesterday, the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, openly urged Moussa Dadis Camara and his regime to step down."
"I can only agree with this minimum demand and would also like to point out that it would be a disgrace for the European Parliament if, in two weeks' time, we were to vote in favour of a fisheries agreement with Guinea that would provide this regime with more than EUR 1 million at the end of November."
"The fisheries agreement relates to tuna fishing for 25 European boats."
"I believe that these boats will quite clearly have to look for other waters to fish in, because the EU cannot do business with dictatorships that slaughter their own people openly on the streets."
"The argument put to the Committee on Development and the Committee on Fisheries by the Commission that the money from the fisheries agreement will benefit the people is completely wrong."
"It reflects the Commission's evaluation of the previous agreement."
"We have no idea where the money from these fisheries agreements will end up."
"They related to the previous regime."
"I hardly think it likely that the present regime will use the money better."
"I wonder, therefore, what the Council is intending to do about the fisheries agreement."
"Does the EU intend to join with the US and demand that the regime steps down?"
"(RO) I also would like to say that I regard the acts of violence committed in Guinea as absolutely appalling."
"I see that two hours ago, the French Foreign Minister stated that Dadis Camara is assumed to have been involved in the decision to carry out the massacre, which is an extremely serious state of affairs."
"The source of the tensions, quite apart from the acts of violence which are appalling, undoubtedly lies in the fact that Dadis Camara wishes to become Guinea's leader permanently and is reluctant to keep his promise not to have any involvement whatsoever in the country's political life."
"I believe, too, that the international pressure exerted in connection with this must be very clear."
"On the other hand, I welcome that the President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaoré, who has a great deal of experience in conducting negotiations and mediation in African conflicts, has been appointed as a mediator in this case."
"I believe that he must be supported by our diplomatic efforts."
"Mr President, I must correct Mrs Joly when she said that the Committee on Fisheries voted unanimously to reject this proposed partnership agreement with Guinea."
"In fact, it voted by just one vote to do so."
"Quite astonishingly, the PPE Group voted solidly to retain the agreement."
"This is an agreement which puts some hundreds of thousands of euros into the hands of this regime in order that we can take tuna from the coast."
"Like many of these agreements, it is a shabby deal at the best of times and, in the present circumstances, it is utterly unacceptable."
"The Minister mentioned possible sanctions to be taken against Guinea."
"Will she now add this to her list and give us an undertaking that she will fight to try and ensure that this partnership agreement is suspended?"
"Mr President, as a human rights lawyer with almost a quarter of a century of experience internationally and at home in Hungary, I take every opportunity to emphasise the need for the European Union to defend human rights, preferably across the world."
"But it is extremely important to do it in a credible way and, in order to do so, we have to defend human rights within our borders as well, within the European Union system."
"As I have mentioned to you several times during the last three months, Mrs Kinga Göncz, a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in this Parliament, used to be a member of a government which we call in Hungary the 'eye-shooter' government, who were shooting at people on the streets of Budapest on 23 October 2006."
"Ever since then, there has been a human rights crisis in Hungary, and this European Union does not do anything about it."
"We have a Vice-Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties who was a member of the government at that time."
"Until we look seriously into this matter, nobody will think that anything we do in the human rights fields is credible."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, again my thanks to the European Parliament for putting this on the agenda."
"It is a very serious subject and, as I hope you understood from my introduction, we share your concerns about the horrible breach of human rights that has happened in Conakry."
"There are concerns and worries about people still being detained, and we have asked for a complete investigation of what has happened and the release of the prisoners."
"I think we can say that the European Union has been extremely clear."
"The events have been condemned by Mr Solana, Mr De Gucht, the Presidency and now, as I know, also by a declaration of the ACP Group in the European Parliament."
"It is very good that the European Union is unanimous, concrete and concise in its condemnation of these horrible events."
"We are also acting in very close cooperation with other actors in this, so that the international community can condemn and act in a very coherent way."
"That is the only way we can really exercise pressure."
"We have the international contact group."
"There has been the appointment of the mediator, the President of Burkina Faso, which is very good, and he is a member of the contact group."
"Together with the contact group, of which the EU and the US are members, we have - in answer to your question, Mrs Lövin - called for Captain Camara's resignation."
"The whole world community has asked for that to happen."
"We are also open to answering other questions and to discuss sanctions."
"We think it will have more effect if we do it together with the international community."
"There are different options on how you can target individuals and so on in this, and we need, in the coming days, to further discuss with international actors how we can coordinate those sanctions in order for them to have the maximum effect: with the African Union, with the contact group, with the US, etc."
"We have also, as I said, opened consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and we have frozen all EU development aid, apart from the humanitarian aid and the assistance to the democratic transition."
"On fisheries - whether that can be part of it or not - I hear very clearly what you say."
"I can only encourage you to continue the discussions with the Commission."
"It is the Commission which is responsible for EU fishery policy."
"We are also discussing this with the Commission, and I am sorry they are not here right now."
"But you can be assured that we will keep on working with the international community to continue with the pressure and to push for a full investigation and, hopefully, also one day for free and fair elections in Guinea. My thanks to you and to the Members for this debate."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Malmström."
"You have had so much patience spending the whole afternoon and part of the evening here."
"One can see that not so long ago, you were a Member of this House and so you like this environment very much!"
"The debate is closed."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(RO) We welcome the signing of the Nabucco project agreement on 13 July in Ankara."
"However, gas is not the only energy resource available to European states."
"We must adopt the same approach with regard to supplying Europe with crude oil by promoting a southern corridor."
"A project has been tabled before us which may assume the same strategic importance as Nabucco."
"I am talking about the pan-European Constanţa - Trieste oil pipeline."
"This pipeline will transport the oil resources in the Caspian Sea via the Georgian terminal at Supsa, continuing along a pipeline via the port of Constanţa right to Trieste."
"We can only guarantee energy security for our states and citizens through the diversification of the supply sources and routes for oil and gas."
"With this in mind, Romania has embarked on developing a port terminal in Constanţa, capable of receiving liquefied natural gas which it will then distribute to other consumers in Europe."
"(FR) Mr President I will use the one minute of speaking time that we have been allotted to draw attention to the positive consequences - as everyone in this House knows - of the Irish people's positive vote on the constitutional treaty."
"This vote will mean that, particularly in a committee like that on agriculture, as well as in this Parliament, in plenary, we will have codecision."
"Parliament will therefore be on an equal footing with the Council which, in democratic terms, obviously represents huge progress."
"I would like to use this opportunity to point out that, since an overwhelming majority of our Irish friends said 'yes' today to the constitutional treaty and the Polish President - according to what the President of our Parliament said just now - is also about to sign the treaty, all that is needed is a 'yes' from the Czech President."
"I would therefore like all our fellow Members from different political groups to be able, within the context of our respective competences, to try to convey to their Czech counterparts the message that this treaty really must be signed, all the more so since the Czech Parliament has already said 'yes'."
"All that is left for the President to do is to sign this parchment and thus take the democratic way forward in his country, so as to advance our democracy in Europe."
"(IT) Mr President, I would like to talk about the tragedy in Messina - which the President of the European Parliament has recalled today - and its dozens of casualties."
"So another tragedy has been reported in Italy: the Italian Prime Minister has even claimed that it was a foreseeable tragedy."
"It may have been foreseeable, but nothing was done to prevent it."
"Nothing was done because the area is ruled by concrete, by the concrete mafia, by the forest mafia, with their forest fires."
"However, what the European Parliament should focus on above all is the way in which public money and also the aid allocated by the European Union can be invested in a different form of regional development, to ensure that construction work is carried out properly and the severe environmental damage that has been done can be rectified."
"More often than not, these public funds end up being pocketed by criminal societies, corrupt politicians and the Mafia."
"This legislative term must therefore focus on what happens to public funds, which should really be used to restore nature, to protect natural resources, to generate eco-friendly economic development and to create jobs."
"There must be no more horrific tragedies like the one in Messina."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to speak in defence of the Polish minority in Lithuania, which recently has been subjected to discrimination."
"There is a painful paradox here, in that Poles in Lithuania, who in some regions constitute the majority of citizens, were in a better situation before the accession of Lithuania to the European Union than now, when Lithuania is a member of the EU."
"The self-government of the Salcininkai region has been given until 14 October to remove Polish street name signs, which is against European standards and the European Charter of Local Self-Government."
"In March 2008, freedom of activity of the Polish school system was restricted, on the strength of Lithuanian law."
"In the space of one and a half years, four schools, with a total of 45 classes, were closed, and a further 107 classes are threatened with closure."
"Changes are being forced on Polish surnames, so that they look like Lithuanian ones. Finally, many Poles have still not been returned property which was seized by the communists, by the Soviet Union, after 1939 or after 1944."
"I appeal to the European Parliament to defend Poles in Lithuania, in accordance with European standards of human rights and the rights of minorities."
"(PT) Mr President, optimistic proclamations are being made concerning the announcement of the beginning of the end of the crisis."
"Unfortunately, these declarations are contradicted by reality on a daily basis."
"The situation in northern Portugal is an illustration of this. In the District of Braga alone, at least 10 companies have closed in recent weeks, leaving more than 300 workers unemployed."
"Many others are at risk of closing."
"The situation is particularly serious in the textile and clothing sector: one of the sectors of the European Union to be worst affected by the increasing liberalisation of world trade."
"In this tragic situation, there is an urgent need for solutions that are different from the political guidelines that caused it."
"It is vital to implement safeguard measures, in particular, in sectors to be indicated by the Member States, in order to be able to sustain and promote jobs and the continued operation of these companies, as well as to move forward with the creation - an issue that has already been the subject of a resolution by this Parliament - of a Community programme to support the textile sector, with adequate resources specifically targeted at the least favoured regions that are dependent on this sector."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the underhand and undemocratic way in which the incandescent light bulb has been banned across the European Union."
"The initial directive handed implementing measures to the European Commission which, in effect, meant that the regulation was allowed to pass without the consent of this farce of an Assembly or of my real parliament at Westminster."
"The ban was a stitch-up by the political elite and was done on a nod and a wink."
"The people have been bypassed, but then the European Union is very good at bypassing the people."
"Just take a look at what has happened with the Lisbon Treaty."
"It was allowed to happen, unfortunately with the collusion of the British Conservative Party, who are the Jekyll and Hyde of British politics when it comes to the European issue."
"They say one thing in Britain and they come out here and they do completely the opposite in committee."
"To conclude, on the eve of World War I, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, feared that the lights would go out all over Europe."
"Well done to the European Union, because, with your obsession with the unscientific cult of man-made climate change, what you are doing is proving Sir Edward's unfortunate prophecy to be correct."
"Mr President, there was a lot of talk today about the Lisbon Treaty and how it strengthens solidarity among Europeans."
"On behalf of the Hungarian people, I would like to call for your solidarity now because, according to reliable information from human-rights-sensitive, high-ranking members of the Hungarian police, on the third anniversary of so-called Bloody Monday in 2006 (23 October), the Hungarian police will again use massive violence against the Hungarian people during our demonstrations or commemorations."
"I would like to call on Members of the European Parliament to come to our aid and to come to Budapest on that day as human rights observers."
"I would like your constituencies to ask you to do that, too."
"Please do your research on the Internet about the human rights abuses and mass police brutalities in Hungary and make sure that it can never happen again."
"Please come and exercise the solidarity that has so often been mentioned today."
"(HU) I would like to mention the Slovak language law, which has raised grave concerns ever since its approval."
"The past few weeks have shown that these concerns were justified because, although the penalties prescribed in this law have not yet been applied, government employees have been ordered to speak only Slovak."
"This means that during working hours, postal workers, fire fighters and police officers whose mother tongue is Hungarian are not allowed to use their own language."
"Therefore, if I speak Hungarian to a policeman in Slovakia, he is obliged to answer me in Slovak, even if Hungarian is his mother tongue, and regardless of the fact that I do not understand his reply."
"Incidentally, the situation is the same if I try to speak in English."
"I would like to suggest a new advertising message for the Slovak hospitality sector: we love having foreign tourists in Slovakia, provided that they learn Slovak before they set foot in our country."
"Welcome to Absurdistan!"
"(SK) I anticipated or expected more of these attacks on the Slovak Republic, since the institution of one-minute speeches provides an ideal opportunity for colleagues from Hungary or colleagues of Hungarian nationality to attack the Slovak Republic."
"I have to say that this worries me greatly, because I expect the European Parliament actually to solve the problems confronting the European Union."
"We have extended the hand of friendship several times to fellow MEPs from Fidesz and other parties in plenary sessions here in the European Parliament, wanting to discuss unresolved problems or issues with them."
"This is what we did in the case of the language law and I must say that I am very disappointed, Mr President, that none of our fellow MEPs from Hungary or of Hungarian ethnicity responded to the offer and my colleagues from the SMK (which is a party from the Slovak Republic) even preferred to walk out of such a session when we raised the topic."
"I have also accessed the website of the Parliament of the Slovak Republic, where it is possible to read through this law in full, and the law does not in any way threaten the right of ethnic minorities to use their own languages."
"Mr President, the Spanish Government has decided that the Barcelona to Perpignan high-speed train line should run just under the Sagrada Família Cathedral, putting at risk a monument that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984 and was visited by three million tourists last year."
"The construction of a new tunnel extremely close to the foundation of the Sagrada Família Cathedral may lead to irreparable damage to that building."
"The Spanish Government says that there is no problem, but this year the tunnelling machines of a new metro line in Barcelona have experienced multiple incidents in similar land conditions."
"One tunnelling machine has been blocked near the Llobregat River for some months without anyone knowing how to solve the situation."
"I wish to report the risk of the collapse of the Sagrada Família to the European institutions."
"To preserve this European masterpiece of general interest, please examine the matter, stop the work being carried out by the Spanish Government and change the route of the tunnel."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the problem of hold-ups regarding the invitation to the Autonomous Train Drivers' Unions of Europe (ALE) to join the railways section of the Committee for Social Dialogue."
"Since 2005, this body has brought together more than 100 000 members from 16 European member organisations of train drivers and has sought to be recognised as a fully-fledged social partner in the section of social dialogue dealing with railways."
"Despite lengthy negotiations with the European Transport Workers' Federation, which is currently the sole representative of employee interests on this committee, it has not yet been possible to find a compromise that would give ALE the possibility of directly defending its members' interests."
"In my opinion, this is a very unfortunate state of affairs."
"Social dialogue, as approved by the European Parliament, should, in my view, allow pluralism."
"I firmly believe that no organisation, not even one that represents 80% of employees in the European rail sector, has the right to a monopoly and I therefore call on all parties, including the European Commission, to clear the way for further negotiations."
"Mr President, the directives of the European Union and the laws in the Member States on the eight-hour day and reactionary restructurings in general are creating mediaeval working conditions, provoking anger among and demonstrations by the workers."
"The European Commission is flooded daily with protests by angry farmers and indignant workers."
"For example, the working times for airline cabin crews and pilots, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1899/2006, exceed 14 hours' work a day, thereby endangering the lives of workers and passengers, as proven by numerous scientific studies."
"The European Union refuses to take account of the scientific studies, because it is obeying the orders of the monopoly business groups which refuse to sacrifice even a single euro of their profits for the health of workers and in-flight safety."
"We are calling for airline pilots' and cabin crews' working times to be reduced and for workers' just demands to be satisfied."
"Moreover, the European Commission has a commitment both towards the European Parliament and towards the workers."
"(DE) Mr President, the whole ratification process for the Constitution Reform Treaty of Lisbon was a tragedy for democracy and also for the European Union."
"Perhaps you would allow me, as a new, young MEP, to say that, through referendums for all citizens in the European Union, we had the opportunity, historically, to unite the very elitist drawing board project of the European Union with the people of Europe."
"You had the opportunity to use referendums to breathe life and spirit into the emotional wreck of the European Union."
"However, you did not utilise this opportunity."
"On the contrary, you quite simply said 'no' to more direct democracy and 'no' to citizen participation."
"All I can say to that is that this is not what I call democracy."
"Democracy requires the separation of powers and a clear line between opposition and government."
"That is what we stand for and that is what we are fighting for."
"(HU) Let me begin, Mr President, by saying that what Mrs Beňová said is not true."
"Five young Hungarians have already spent five years in prison in Serbia following a drunken brawl in the southern town of Temerin."
"They were handed down sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years."
"They were sentenced to a total of 61 years and their case was used by nationalists as election propaganda."
"Not even those who committed war crimes during the Balkan War have been given such stiff sentences."
"During the same period, around 300 Hungarians were beaten in Serbia without any legal repercussions."
"This gives a ratio of 300 to 1."
"The European Parliament sent a fact-finding delegation to Serbia in January 2005."
"However, we have been waiting since then for the Subcommittee on Human Rights to discuss the report on the investigation into the brutal beating of Hungarians."
"I call on Parliament and President Jerzy Buzek to have the young men from Temerin released from prison."
"The EU must stipulate as a prerequisite for Serbia's accession that it should run its judicial system without discrimination and that, instead of delivering intimidating, prejudiced verdicts, it should catch the real villains, Serbian war criminals."
"Mr President, my country, Lithuania, is very similar to Ireland in many ways and the yes of its people for the Lisbon Treaty has clearly demonstrated the will of all our citizens for a stronger and more effective Europe."
"It has clearly shown that we are unable to act on our own in times of crisis and to ensure prosperity for our people."
"More than ever, the Community must speak with one voice, and solidarity among the Member States is the basis for that."
"Europe is undergoing difficult times, and the reforms proposed by the Lisbon Treaty will give an impetus for a more effective institutional structure which will undoubtedly lead to more coherent policies in many areas."
"It is indeed a great achievement, both for Europe and for every one of us."
"Once again I congratulate the Irish people for their determination to have a better and more prosperous Union."
"(FR) Mr President, on Monday - and this will not have escaped anyone's attention - milk producers from the four corners of Europe once again demonstrated in Brussels to state, to proclaim their despair and their distress faced with the collapse of milk prices, which is preventing them from carrying out their work. Even more than that, it is their future that is at stake here."
"The call for a new form of regulation is today supported by a large majority of the Member States, the dairy G20, as we will call it from now on."
"I think that, now more than ever, the time has come to take decisions, and certainly at the next Council - a formal one this time - of the Ministers for Agriculture, which will take place on 19 October in Luxembourg."
"This is extremely urgent."
"A crisis of this magnitude must not become the subject of a commission study, as happened two days ago."
"Very briefly, I have two questions for President Buzek, which I trust you will pass on to him."
"I understand that this morning he met Cecilia Malmström, the Swedish Minister for European Affairs, and I would like to know if she was able to confirm to him the Presidency's commitment to find an urgent solution to this crisis, along the lines of the resolution that we voted for in Strasbourg at the last part-session."
"Finally, I come to this high-level group, this think tank that was launched the day before yesterday."
"Before and as from the next entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we know our Parliament will become a joint decision maker, a colegislator."
"I think that it would make sense for us to be included in the work of this high-level group."
"(LT) In August, Marijus Ivanilovas, a 35-year-old Lithuanian national and director of the printing house of the daily newspaper 'Respublika', i.e. a person with a permanent job and income, was detained in Belarus, not far from Minsk, and has already been held for two months without trial or proof of his guilt in a prison in the Belarusian city of Zhodin."
"A few days ago, the term for detaining Mr Ivanilovas was extended, as in two months, the regime's authorities were unable to find any proof of his guilt."
"It is also important to point out that from childhood, Mr Ivanilovas has suffered from bronchial asthma."
"To his parents' knowledge, he is held in a cell where there are 26 prisoners, but only 6 beds and people smoke in the cell constantly."
"Marijus has asthma attacks, but he is not allowed to receive his medicine, nor is he allowed to meet loved ones or even the Lithuanian consul."
"Mr President, this is happening in a country in our neighbourhood."
"This is how the citizen of an EU Member State - Lithuania - is being treated!"
"I call on you to take measures within your powers to ensure the immediate release of Marijus Ivanilovas, as there is no proof of his guilt and the charge is unfounded."
"Mr Ivanilovas must be allowed to return to Lithuania."
"He needs immediate medical attention."
"(RO) Last December, the European Union made an historic commitment to reduce carbon emissions, thereby confirming its leading position in terms of efforts to combat climate change."
"We can be proud of the role that the European Parliament has played in adopting legislation which contains not only provisions for reducing the pollution level, but also specific measures to enable us to fulfil these commitments, which will help determine the rise in global temperature."
"During the negotiations in Copenhagen this December, we must obtain firm commitments in terms of reducing emissions and the level of financial support granted to developing countries to enable them to alleviate the impact of, and adapt to, climate change."
"However, climate change legislation cannot be adopted in the United States prior to the Copenhagen conference, although the Obama administration will endeavour to conduct the negotiations, but without a clear mandate."
"The European Union's common position must not be wasted."
"It is vital for us to speak with a single voice and encourage the other countries to follow our example in the task of reducing emissions."
"(SK) The Hungarian representatives are misleading European public opinion with many untruths."
"They claim, for example, that citizens can be fined for using a minority language, that doctors of Hungarian nationality will be able to work only in the official Slovak language, or that religious services can be conducted only in the official language."
"We have now heard Hungarian MEPs talking nonsense about policemen not being allowed to respond to tourists in Hungarian or English."
"None of this is true."
"On the contrary, the amended law increases the possibilities for using ethnic minority languages compared to the situation previously."
"The amendment does not interfere with private communications between citizens and does not enable fines to be imposed on individuals."
"The conformity of the amended law to international standards has been confirmed by the European authorities in the area of minorities - OSCE High Commissioner Knut Vollebæk and EU Commissioner Leonard Orban."
"In my opinion, the Hungarian community is exploiting this cause in an attempt to conceal growing extremism and the murder of Roma people in Hungary."
"(PL) Mr President, I regret to inform you that the rights of people who leave the Catholic Church in Poland are being broken."
"Against the will of the apostates, their personal details are not removed from parish archives."
"On the contrary, they continue to be used."
"This is the instruction concerning the protection of personal data in the activity of the Catholic Church in Poland."
"The part of the instruction we are talking about is not based on the prevailing Personal Data Protection Act, but - and listen carefully - on the provisions of the Code of Canon Law."
"How is it that in Poland, which claims to uphold the rule of law, canon law has precedence over law made by the national Parliament?"
"Why does the Code of Canon Law govern the rights of citizens who are not Catholics?"
"How is it possible that the Inspector General for Personal Data Protection does not have any authority to inspect church archives?"
"There is only one explanation: Poland is a church state."
"The European Parliament should react to this."
"(RO) The subject of my speech today is linked to the most important event that has taken place recently in the European Union, namely the successful outcome of the referendum organised by Ireland to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I also wish to share the sentiments of my fellow Members who have had the opportunity today to congratulate the Irish people on giving this very clear signal of their decision to opt to continue the process of European integration at a political level."
"They have not succumbed to the populist declarations which drew attention to some of the adverse consequences because this Treaty will quite obviously make European institutions operate more efficiently and democratically."
"I also think that it is the duty of the Czech President to respect the undertakings made when this Treaty was negotiated and not to impede without justification its implementation."
"We need this Treaty to close the institutional chapter in the EU's development, at least for a while, so that we can become more involved with the EU's policies."
"The last two states, Poland and the Czech Republic, must ratify the Treaty as soon as possible so that the appointments can be made to the new posts provided for by the Treaty, both in the Commission and at Council level."
"(HU) A great deal was said about the Slovak language law during the last parliamentary sitting, as is the case today."
"This is no coincidence."
"This law limits the extent to which minorities can use their own language, contrary to the various statements made, although it is true that minority languages can also be used in a very small area of public life."
"However, it is not true that we are avoiding debate on this matter because, if someone tries to agree in five minutes on this subject in front of 10 journalists, they will probably fail."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that as this law has been poorly drafted in bad faith, it is creating fresh legal uncertainty because in two days, the Slovak Ministry of Culture has provided three different explanations for some of the articles in the law."
"It has instilled fear in people."
"We are already aware of several instances where employers are ordering their employees to speak Slovak."
"I deeply regret the need to raise this matter in this chamber."
"I hope that the Treaty of Lisbon will provide us with the chance to deal properly with human rights and minority rights."
"(ES) Mr President, piracy is a problem of concern to this Parliament, the Member States and, naturally, Spain, because we currently have a Spanish fishing boat that has been seized in the waters of the Indian Ocean, with 36 crew members on board."
"The first thing that I would like to do is to express my sympathy for the crew and their families, and naturally, give my support to the Spanish Government in securing its speedy release."
"We are not, however, talking about a problem affecting Spain's tuna fleet specifically, but one that affects three countries - France, Italy and Spain - that are fishing in international waters, outside Somalia's exclusive area."
"In view of that, an international reply and joint European preventive and response measures will be required."
"That means more resources devoted to an improved Operation Atlanta, which already exists and which has been successful in terms of a reduction in the number of vessels seized in 2009 as compared with 2008."
"Finally, I would like to touch upon the support that we should offer for an international summit on piracy in Somalia, because we must improve international relations in order to iron out these problems on the ground, and because we need to improve international dialogue."
"Mr President, many in the House have today congratulated the Irish people on their good sense in rejecting the appeals of Nigel Farage and the UK Independence Party and voting overwhelmingly in favour of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Members should perhaps also commiserate with the British people, because we have to put up with Mr Farage on a daily basis."
"He calls a two-to-one majority in Ireland a 'victory for bully boys'."
"I am afraid his words are all too typical of a man who uses distortions and deceit, and sometimes downright lies, about the European Union."
"All too often, those words are unchallenged by journalists."
"However, hyperbole can turn to insanity."
"Now he is comparing the campaign in Ireland with the brutality of the latest elections in Zimbabwe."
"He describes the Treaty that gives every Member State the right to withdraw from the Union as an end of independence."
"Nevertheless, we should be compassionate."
"Parliament has a medical service."
"Mr President, I invite you to ask the men in white coats to offer their services to our colleague."
"Nonsense about Europe may pour from his lips but at least they can help ensure that he does not choke on it."
"(PL) I would like here, in the European Parliament, to refer to the statement made by Polish and German bishops on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II."
"At this particular time, when the thoughts of many people turn to those traumatic events, it has been pointed out to us that we should take special care of the young generation, so that they will be able to learn the truth about history appropriately and thoroughly and, on that truth, to build a common future."
"It is impossible not to recall here the first letter from the Polish bishops to the German bishops in 1965 which encouraged reconciliation and the establishment of partnership relations between our countries."
"Today, as then, we care about building trust and friendly relations between our nations."
"However, although we are on this common road of reconciliation, we are, today, in a different place."
"Let us create a common Europe together, a Europe of cooperation and friendship, a Europe of values which are based on Christian roots, and which were the basis for the creation of Europe by the founding fathers of the European Community."
"In the interest, therefore, of the good of our common future, we should take careful note of the warnings and recommendations which are found in the joint statement of the Polish and German bishops."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has already been said today about minority issues."
"I would like to give you a positive example in this area."
"Serbia has adopted a law on cultural autonomy which is unique throughout the whole of Europe, and which is positive not only for the whole of the European Union, but for the whole of Europe too."
"According to this law, 13 minorities, including Slovaks, Romanians, Hungarians and other peoples, can directly elect their own national councils."
"These national councils are financed out of the budget and can, under this cultural autonomy, handle and control the relevant institutions."
"The other lesson to be learnt is that the minorities were involved in drafting this law."
"Therefore, Serbia can set an example for many EU countries, such as France, Slovakia and others, in terms of how to guarantee the rights of minorities in law."
"This has also helped Serbia take a major step on the road to European integration."
"Mr President, being a Hungarian MEP coming from Romania, I will not speak today about the Slovak language, even though I am afraid I would have good reason to do so."
"Instead, I want to speak about our decision today to set up a special committee on the economic crisis."
"This decision proves the responsibility of our Parliament in the biggest challenge currently confronting Europe."
"The special committee will reaffirm the European Union position concerning the new global financial governance, but will also interact with the Member States, aiming at best implementation of Community measures meant to generate sustainable economic growth."
"It is vital for the new Member States in the central and eastern part of Europe to receive necessary support for economic recovery."
"Coordination of recovery efforts should be more efficient, and enhanced coordination is not only the responsibility of the governments but also the responsibility of Brussels."
"We are facing a most complicated economic perspective accompanied by the imminence of serious social unrest."
"That is why the European Union has to put forward the most efficient response to the deteriorating situation in the region and this House must show leadership on this issue."
"(ES) Mr President, a few days ago, 36 people were kidnapped while they were fishing in waters of the Indian Ocean under the aegis of an agreement approved by the European Commission."
"On 15 September, I condemned the risky situation and the helplessness and defencelessness of these workers."
"I put forward certain concrete measures, but nothing was done."
"Unfortunately, we are therefore now in the position of speaking about those who have been kidnapped and are being held by the pirates."
"I therefore ask the European Commission to be forceful and to recommend to the Member States that soldiers be posted on fishing vessels, and I ask it to address this recommendation to the Spanish Government, because it has been an effective measure."
"France is taking this action and we can see the results."
"This Parliament has acknowledged, in a resolution, that the fisheries sector is defenceless because priority has been given to the merchant navy."
"The European Commission official also acknowledged this on the eve of the seizure and we therefore ask that this protection be extended to fishing vessels."
"I also call upon the President to express and pass on our sympathy and support to those who have been kidnapped, and their families, and for him to invite the skipper of the vessel, once he has been freed, to Parliament."
"(HU) There has been much talk earlier about minorities."
"I would also like to draw attention to the 50 million people with disabilities who live within the European Union."
"I regard them as the biggest minority."
"The financial crisis is hitting them hardest."
"I want to emphasise that these people are always the first to lose their jobs, see a fall in their incomes, have few opportunities for a livelihood and experience a drop in their standard of living, not to mention the ever-dwindling support given to the social organisations representing them."
"The biggest lesson from the current crisis is that it is worthwhile investing in people, including on an individual basis, even instead of other types of investment."
"Political and economic decision makers have a responsibility to take heed of people with disabilities."
"I ask you therefore to do everything you can for them so that they receive fairer treatment from you."
"I am stressing this point because 50 million people can have a huge amount of clout within the European Union, and it is in our interest to ensure equal opportunities in society."
"Mr President, of course I am delighted that the Lisbon Treaty has passed in my country."
"However, it has been seen this afternoon that the debate on the Reform Treaty has been poised between a reality and a distraction, and we must not stand still in its wake."
"The reality is that the world has changed fundamentally over recent decades, as a much greater proportion of it is now competing with us in a global market."
"Quite simply, Europe must behave more coherently if it is to prosper."
"The Treaty now obliges the European institutions to be more democratic and more responsive to individual European people."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights insists on this."
"We do not have the luxury of acting only in the interests of our own nations; we need to strengthen the Union which every one of us represents."
"As we did in our referendum, we need to continue to communicate who and what we are."
"(RO) During the current economic crisis the European funds are key instruments for the less developed regions in Member States in terms of helping them achieve convergence objectives."
"A long and not exactly simple process is involved between the time these objectives are specified and the funds actually being taken up by the beneficiaries, which is also hampered by a series of bureaucratic EU regulations."
"At a time when we MEPs are highlighting the effects of the economic crisis and are adopting measures to speed up the process and simplify the regulations for accessing these funds, Member States are only benefiting slowly from these measures and not to the full extent."
"On this point, I wish to mention a specific example from Romania."
"Projects financed by the European Social Fund, aimed at improving workers' conditions and increasing the number of employees in certain companies, are still encountering problems during their implementation."
"I would like to call for the measures aimed at simplifying the procedures for accessing the funds to be speeded up in order to facilitate job creation in Europe's regions."
"Mr President, it is with extreme urgency that I call on Parliament to see that the EUR 14.8 million promised to the workers in the mid-west of Ireland in areas like Limerick, Kerry and Tipperary who worked for Dell Computers and its suppliers is allocated as soon as possible."
"This money was promised by the Commission President under the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in a recent visit to Limerick."
"There is no going back on it and, whatever the issues relating to protocol and how this Fund is administered may be, these need to be overcome immediately."
"Parliament should not delay this money, which would give the region a much-needed economic stimulus."
"It was estimated at one stage that Dell and its suppliers employed one in every five people throughout the mid-west of Ireland, so this area has been hard hit."
"That is why I urge the Commission to review the rules on State aid support."
"These were drawn up in 2006 before the massive shock that the loss of Dell and the other industries created."
"I urge the Commission to include the mid-west of Ireland as an area of serious unemployment in the review of State aid rules next year, so that it can qualify for the now much-needed EU funding."
"(HU) Mr President, the role of the European Parliament - and I quote its President - is to mediate between disputing parties and countries, if necessary."
"Parliament should not only get involved in fire fighting, but should contribute to preventing the fire as well."
"Parliament should adopt, for instance, a minority framework law that guarantees minorities' rights."
"Minorities are entitled to feel safe."
"Such a framework law will help ensure that minorities are not at the mercy of governments, extremist organisations and such actions as the Slovak language law which punishes minorities for using their mother tongue."
"It is unacceptable that within the European Union, minority organisations are banned, bilingual place name signs are painted over and extremist organisations stage provocative anti-minority demonstrations."
"Part of the European Parliament's role is to implement legislation which protects human rights, prevents discrimination and guarantees that minorities can live as fully valued human beings in the land of their birth."
"(ES) Mr President, in the face of the hijacking of the Spanish fishing vessel Alakrana by pirates in the Indian Ocean, I want to point to the firm resolve of the Spanish Government, with the support of the European Union, to free the 36 crew members - 16 of them Spaniards - to bring them back safe and sound, and to bring the hijackers to justice."
"Thanks to Atalanta, the European operation, which was begun in December 2008 at the initiative of France and Spain, joined by other European Union countries, we now have a significant deployment of forces in the area."
"The expansion of the protection area does not, however, extend as far as the location where the fishermen are fishing, and that is why we are issuing a call to the ship operators, asking them not to go outside the security area, and we are urging the European Union and its Member States to grant an extension to the south of the coverage of Atalanta and more resources to guarantee the free movement of the 20 000 vessels crossing an ocean whose surface is three times greater than that of the Mediterranean."
"Although the deployment has guaranteed access for the merchant ships that carried 227 000 tonnes for the United Nations Food Programme to Somalia, now we must make an effort to cover the work of the dozens of European fishing vessels fishing in the area."
"Lastly, we urge the Member States to mobilise their information and intelligence services in order to look for and arrest the intermediaries that give tip-offs to the pirates and get paid for rescues, operating from European soil."
"Mr President, there has been much talk in the last two hours and the last couple of weeks in Ireland about a communications deficit and the need to bring Europe closer to the people."
"I have a suggestion to make: I think that we should discuss this at some future time in this Parliament, particularly to get the views of MEPs on how the Commission and the MEPs themselves can be involved in this whole area, because national governments have proven reluctant in the past to give credit to the European Union for what it does and, as a result, the people are not aware of it."
"We now, with our increased powers and increased opportunities, should take that opportunity to discuss this issue here in Parliament and come up with ways and proposals on how we can actually help to clear that deficit and bring Europe closer to its people."
"It would be an exercise well worth doing."
"(RO) In June 2009, the European Council called on the European Commission to draw up and present a strategy for the Danube region by the end of 2010."
"The European Commission and Member States should adopt a common European strategy which will combine current Danube initiatives and boost the importance of this river as part of the European Union's policies."
"The Danube region strategy should focus on common objectives and projects in the areas of transport, energy, the environment and cultural cooperation."
"Last year, the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism organised a delegation to the Danube region to find out about and promote the potential offered by this river as part of EU policies."
"One of the main conclusions reached by this delegation was to create in the European Parliament an intergroup to promote the River Danube."
"The creation of this intergroup helps the European Parliament reaffirm its commitment to be involved in and actively support both the drafting of a strategy for the Danube region and its implementation."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to call the attention of this House to the fact that 27 September was the thirtieth World Tourism Day, held under the slogan 'Tourism - Celebrating Diversity', at a time when we are all hoping for the rapid entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which incorporates tourism as a new sphere of action for the European Union."
"One of the sector's challenges is to improve the range of tourism experiences on offer for the whole world without discrimination."
"As pointed out by the Montreal Declaration, access to tourist leisure for the whole world necessarily means being involved in the struggle against inequality and the exclusion of the culturally different, those of limited means or abilities, or those who live in developing countries."
"Parliament has translated this ambition into a pilot project on social tourism which the Commission will develop this year."
"Another reason for its actions is that social tourism helps the employment rate by combating seasonality - one of the sector's major problems - and creates greater equality, more jobs and jobs which last for longer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is our objective."
"(ES) Mr President, just a few hours ago, Cristo Ancor Cabello was killed in Herat in Afghanistan."
"He was a Spanish soldier belonging to the International Security Assistance Force, the force deployed under a mandate from the United Nations in which soldiers of many different nationalities carry out a very difficult task, deserving of our gratitude, to improve the living conditions and the security of the Afghan civilian population."
"Mr President, I ask you to pass on the condolences of the European Parliament to his family, as well as our support and sympathy to his fellow soldiers, among whom there are five wounded."
"Mr President, I would also like to add that the Spanish Government is maintaining its firm undertaking to ensure the security of all troops on peace missions deployed abroad, not just in Afghanistan, but also in other locations around the world."
"(RO) The last two rounds of enlargement of the European Union have brought numerous benefits to old and new Member States alike, while also posing a number of challenges."
"Two years after its accession to the European Union, Romania is one of the countries with the lowest success rates in terms of accessing European funds."
"The procedure for accessing European money is fairly complicated and impenetrable."
"The Structural and Cohesion Funds provide financial leverage which may facilitate economic recovery, particularly during the current crisis."
"Against this background, I feel that we need simple rules for accessing the Structural Funds so that European money can reach beneficiaries as quickly as possible."
"Particular attention must be focused on removing all those difficulties that hamper access to Community funds and discourage people from obtaining EU financial support."
"We must encourage efforts at European level aimed at simplifying the procedures for accessing the funds earmarked for Romania in order to accelerate their allocation and rapid absorption."
"That concludes the item."
"(The sitting was suspended at 20.40 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Composition of Parliament: see Minutes"
"Appointments to the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis (tabling deadlines): see Minutes"
"Prevention and settlement of conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Renate Weber, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic and of the Kingdom of Sweden for adoption of a Council framework decision 2009/.../JHA on prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings (08535/2009 - C7-0205/2009 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, as this is the first time that I have spoken before this new Parliament, I would like to congratulate you on being elected to the Vice-Presidency."
"As far as the Weber report is concerned, I speak on behalf of Vice-President Barrot and I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the excellent quality of their work."
"The Commission welcomes the report and supports some of the proposed amendments."
"The Commission is, by and large, in favour of the proposal presented by five Member States, although the text is not as ambitious as it would have wished."
"More specifically, the Commission deplores the fact that the scope of the framework decision has been limited to cases where the same person is subject to parallel criminal proceedings for the same offence."
"The Commission also regrets the fact that the obligation to refer to Eurojust cases where there is a conflict of jurisdiction has been limited and that the list of criteria which must be taken into account to determine the most appropriate jurisdiction has been removed from the operative part of the text."
"These amendments have weakened the text of the proposal, taking away most of its added value."
"From the Commission's point of view, the proposal should be considered only as a first step towards the prevention and settlement of conflicts of jurisdiction in the framework of criminal proceedings and should subsequently be replaced with a more exhaustive proposal."
"The Commission will also consider this in the light of the changes made in this area by the Treaty of Lisbon, which I hope will enter into force as soon as possible."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, the positive result of the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty brings us one step closer to that moment in time when the European Parliament will not only be consulted by the Council, but will have codecision powers on matters which are now under the third pillar."
"The question then is: why is the Council so keen to adopt legislation a few months before that date when, moreover, that legislation does not represent a step forward in establishing a genuine European area of freedom, security and justice?"
"The truth is that this proposal does not help prevent any conflicts of jurisdiction, and does not provide for any settlement when such situations arise."
"This could be done, for example, by reducing multiple jurisdiction and by allocating jurisdiction to Member States, as was done through various regulations on civil law, with the obligation to mutually recognise the decisions that followed from that allocation of jurisdiction."
"Instead, this Framework Decision is limited to a duty of Member States to inform one another and to enter into direct consultation in order to reach 'consensus on any effective solution aimed at avoiding the adverse consequences arriving from parallel proceedings'."
"That is why I was not surprised when, during the exchange of views in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs a few weeks ago, the Commission - although supporting the current proposal - mentioned it would come up with a new proposal at a later stage."
"That is also why I am not surprised by what the Commissioner has said this evening."
"I thank the Commission for being so honest about the proposal, but have to say that I consider this proposal and the entire procedure for its adoption a good example of how we should not legislate within the European Union."
"I strongly believe that what is important is to protect our citizens' rights and not just to tick boxes."
"By the way, the Council is not present today, although the Presidency was one of the initiators of the proposal."
"I have to stress that within the European Parliament, we took our work very seriously."
"We worked in good faith during the last mandate and this one, and would hope to be sending a message on our views on having more effective legislation."
"What I welcome about this proposal is that the current text explicitly refers to the principle of ne bis in idem."
"This was due to the exchange of views we had with the Council and the Commission, as the original text proposed did not mention it at all."
"The report I drafted pays particular attention to three aspects."
"Firstly, I believe that the protection of persons formally charged must receive the highest attention and consistent procedural safeguards have to be provided for."
"These should include the right of the formally charged person to receive enough information for him or her to have a basis upon which to challenge any solution which does not appear to be reasonable."
"Secondly, with regard to the details concerning the person formally charged, which national authorities exchange through the notifications, I support the idea that it is important to ensure an adequate level of data protection and that it should be specified in this Framework Decision what kind of personal data is exchanged."
"Last but not least, I strongly believe that the involvement of Eurojust in the decision on the choice of jurisdiction is of the utmost importance."
"In my opinion, Eurojust should be involved from the earliest stage because of its coordinating role and because of its more and more relevant tasks."
"I am among those who consider that we created this Agency not only to show that we are concerned with combating transborder crime, but because we need strong instruments."
"Eurojust has already proved in the years since its establishment that it deserves our trust."
"That is why I am surprised by the reluctance shown by the Council and by some colleagues in the European Parliament."
"Having said that, I would like to call on the European Commission to present at the earliest opportunity a proposal completing this Framework Decision on the conflicts of jurisdiction."
"I will finish by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for the way they worked on this report."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur for the very good cooperation we have had in this matter."
"As the shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group, I would like to present the PPE position on the Framework Decision as it is and, of course, on the amendments."
"The PPE position differs from that of the rapporteur on two matters."
"The first is the degree of involvement of Eurojust in direct communication between the domestic authorities."
"While the rapporteur asks for mandatory involvement of Eurojust in every case from the initial stage of communication, we believe that the referral to Eurojust should only take place when national authorities fail to reach consensus because, after all, as it is now, this initiative is about direct communication."
"We, too, would like to strengthen Eurojust and its part in the judicial cooperation."
"Our position on this matter only seeks to prevent bureaucracy."
"If there is a possibility of the two parties reaching consensus, why introduce another body and procedure?"
"We do believe and agree that Eurojust must play a role when the parties fail to reach consensus, but where there is not a problem, we give the national authorities the flexibility to have direct bilateral contacts, which also boosts public trust."
"The second matter relates to another proposed amendment which extends the competence of Eurojust beyond that provided in Article 4 of the Eurojust decision."
"We believe that this matter, if it is to be discussed, should be approached in relation to the Eurojust decision via the main door."
"This is why we will vote against these amendments."
"However, there are no key points, so we will vote for the report as we want to encourage the exchange of information between national authorities."
"We also support the oral amendment tabled today."
"Finally I would like to stress that the PPE is keen to see judicial cooperation enhanced, and supports a European policy which should help citizens have the same guarantees and procedures in all Member States."
"A criminal law policy which secures the fundamental human rights of persons involved in criminal proceedings is one of the priorities of the European Community."
"The draft framework decision arose from an initiative of the Czech Presidency and it provides a legal framework for protecting persons involved in criminal proceedings and particularly for strengthening adherence to the principle of ne bis in idem."
"In my opinion, the adoption of this legislative proposal is therefore essential, not only to protect persons involved in criminal proceedings, but also to increase legal certainty for EU Member State citizens."
"The mechanism for resolving conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction should provide a way of eliminating situations where a number of Member States mount criminal prosecutions against one and the same person for one and the same crime."
"It should also rule out the possibility of multiple decisions being issued in respect of one and the same case."
"The framework decision imposes an obligation on Member States to inform each other about the existence of parallel criminal proceedings, but it does not establish a comprehensive legal mechanism for resolving them."
"I see shortcomings mainly in the vagueness of the legal text, which, in most cases, does not specify any deadlines for fulfilling the stated obligations."
"At the same time, the role of Eurojust is unclear and there is also a failure to exploit the potential of this institution for resolving conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction."
"It is essential to put the emphasis particularly on upholding the fundamental human rights of persons involved, in other words suspects and defendants, at all stages of criminal proceedings and, at the same time, also to ensure a corresponding level of personal data protection."
"We must consequently turn our attention to the Commission's legislative initiative entitled 'Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters', which will apparently solve this problem much more comprehensively."
"It is essential to support this draft, even though there are practical problems in solving conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings."
"The progressive alliance of socialists and democrats therefore supports the draft, although we are insisting on the provision of sufficient protection for persons involved in criminal proceedings and, at the same time, a stronger role for Eurojust and greater efficiency for the mechanism as a whole."
"(NL) Madam President, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) sees no good in this proposal."
"The Netherlands, and the Netherlands alone, should be taking decisions on the exercise of jurisdiction."
"It appears that more and more proposals are being made that ultimately boil down to harmonisation of the criminal law of the Member States."
"Examples are accreditation of forensic laboratories, harmonisation of the policy on interpreters and the transfer of criminal records."
"The PVV asks itself where this is all heading."
"We cannot support a European penal code or a European code of criminal procedure."
"This looks like salami tactics, where you keep having small slices rammed down your throat until you end up having eaten the whole sausage."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating my friend, Mrs Weber, on the fine work she has accomplished in this report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, judicial cooperation is to become part of the legislative areas of responsibility of the European Parliament in the very near future."
"The Irish people has now given its view through a referendum and, in my view, its decision has been positive and correct."
"European citizens hope that the area of freedom, security and justice will be a reality in which their procedural rights are equally respected and guaranteed, regardless of the part of Community territory in which they find themselves."
"Our duty is therefore to ensure that these procedural guarantees are abided by in all Member States."
"When there is a 'positive' conflict of jurisdiction between different Member States, this must be resolved as swiftly as possible, in order to protect citizens and avoid any risk of infringing the legal principle of ne bis in idem."
"In order to do this, it is crucial for the judicial bodies involved in the conflict of jurisdictions to cooperate and communicate."
"The report also contains a debate on what role Eurojust has and what role it should have when such conflicts of jurisdiction arise."
"The rapporteur argues that Eurojust should be informed of any conflict that arises, even where it has been resolved bilaterally between the judicial bodies involved."
"In contrast, the shadow rapporteur from my group, Mrs Macovei, believes that, in the interests of reducing bureaucracy, Eurojust should only be informed in those cases where it has not been possible to reach an agreement between the courts involved."
"I believe that Mrs Macovei is right."
"Moving on to other issues, Mrs Weber also urges the Commission to put forward as soon as possible an additional proposal, complementing the framework decision, to establish rules for the resolution of 'negative' conflicts of jurisdiction."
"(RO) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur for the fine job she has done."
"I also wish to stress that joint actions at European level are vital in order to strengthen freedom, security and justice."
"I welcome this initiative intended to resolve the conflicts of jurisdiction because Member States are frequently faced with problems relating to mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters."
"There should be no procedural differences between Member States when it comes to protecting accused persons."
"In fact, we should adopt measures which will ensure that any accused person can enjoy sound procedural guarantees, anywhere in Europe."
"With regard to exchanging information between countries, consideration must be given to the need to protect personal data and to clearly establish the type of data that can be transferred."
"I wish to emphasise the importance of direct consultations between the authorities in European Union countries in order to do away with parallel proceedings and avoid situations where the relevant institutions in a particular state have to subjectively determine sentences for charges brought against citizens, in most cases, due to a lack of information."
"We should also propose in the future a reinforcement of the role played by Eurojust in resolving any conflicts and establish closer cooperation between Member States, also for the benefit of EU citizens."
"(RO) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and co-rapporteurs for the fine job they have done."
"I would like to use my speech to highlight two of the issues mentioned by the shadow rapporteur from my political group, Mrs Macovei."
"The first issue concerns public confidence in the justice system, which seems extremely important to me, at a time when our democracies, the democracies of the Member States, cannot be envisaged without this confidence in the justice system."
"I believe that everything possible must be done to ensure that it is always a feature of our public life."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise the need to reduce the red tape involved in administering the justice system."
"The exchange of information between authorities is certainly important, but it is equally important that the act of administering justice does not become so bogged down in red tape that the level of protection which any individual freedom should enjoy is reduced."
"(RO) I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and the co-rapporteur for the fine job they have done."
"I welcome this initiative on a framework decision on prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings."
"I would also like to make one important remark."
"This proposal for a framework decision is intended to deal only with positive conflicts of jurisdiction."
"There is no provision intended to deal with negative conflicts of jurisdiction."
"I believe that Eurojust should only be involved where the parties fail to reach a common agreement."
"The basic principle of this directive is to initiate direct communication between the relevant authorities in the Member States."
"It is also in the interest of the person involved that the procedure is as short as possible to avoid an investigation into the same incident in two countries."
"Madam President, it is true, as I have already mentioned, that the proposal is not as ambitious as the Commission would have liked, a point which the rapporteur underlined quite clearly in her speech."
"However, the Commission supports it as a first stage in the prevention and settlement of conflicts of jurisdiction in the framework of criminal proceedings. For the time being, it is, of course, impossible to say when the second stage will be introduced."
"The decision will be taken in due course, according to developments concerning the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which I, of course, sincerely hope will take place."
"The contents of this potential new initiative will depend on the result of the impact study that the Commission will have to carry out."
"Of course, I will pass on all of your comments to Vice-President Barrot."
"I would like to thank you once more for holding this debate."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, the political groups in this House have made it pretty clear what their position is on this report and on the sensitive issues surrounding it, and particularly Eurojust."
"Indeed, it seems that the most important and most sensitive issue concerns where we stand on Eurojust."
"However, I feel much more confident now about the future of this Framework Decision after hearing Commissioner Tajani speaking, on his own behalf and on behalf of Vice-President Barrot, about providing us with something more powerful that would clearly address not only positive conflicts of jurisdiction but also negative conflicts of jurisdiction."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 8 October 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - The Hague Programme addresses the case of conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal matters."
"This is important when a cross-border criminal activity takes place."
"Four EU Member States tabled specific proposals with the aim of preventing and settling conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings."
"The issue relates to when the same person or persons are subject to criminal proceedings in different Member States in respect of the same facts."
"This may lead to the infringement of the judicial principle ne bis in idem (a person cannot be tried again if he has already been tried)."
"The measures proposed are commendable and consist of:"
"a procedure for establishing contacts between the competent authorities of the Member States."
"This will confirm or otherwise the existence of parallel criminal proceedings;"
"rules governing the exchange of information between the authorities of the Member States conducting such criminal proceedings;"
"avoiding adverse consequences by reaching consensus between the Member States."
"This Framework Decision should not lead to undue bureaucracy in cases where, for the problems addressed, more suitable options are readily available."
"Thus, in situations where more flexible instruments or arrangements are in place between Member States, those should prevail over this Framework Decision provided that they do not lower the protection afforded to the suspected or accused person."
"In cases where the suspected or accused person is held in provisional detention or custody, direct consultations shall aim to reach consensus as a matter of urgency."
"At all consultation stages, protection of the data of the suspected or accused person must comply with the principles established in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"Passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to the Commission on passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy-B7-0210/2009)."
"author. - Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani for being with us this evening."
"This question was submitted by me on behalf of Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism, as Members had become very concerned over the summer months by the collapse of SkyEurope airline, and approached me to take this initiative on their behalf."
"It is worth noting that we have had 77 airline bankruptcies in the European Union since 2000 and, in the sad but likely event that some more may follow in this tough economic climate, we believe it is imperative that we use this question tonight to at least open up the debate now about how we can best protect consumers and air travellers in the European Union."
"In the case of SkyEurope, it was an airline based in Slovakia."
"We saw passengers being left stranded at destinations, without accommodation or even a flight home."
"We also had the problem that many of those people were told that compensation, or even refunds, would not be possible as they had not purchased their ticket with a credit card or booked through a travel agent."
"These were passengers who had booked online through their own accounts, a practice that has been increasing over many years."
"It is not an isolated case."
"We saw similar scenes in my home country, the United Kingdom, last year when Excel Airways went bankrupt, leaving over 200 000 people out of pocket, without compensation and stranded at a whole host of airports throughout Europe, with it costing them even more money to find accommodation and flights home."
"Many of these people are not regular business flyers or regular flyers like ourselves, and they do not have the financial means to deal with this sort of upheaval."
"They are normally from those families who spend their savings on a family holiday, only to see their hard-earned money go down the drain through little fault of their own."
"The status quo here is clearly not acceptable."
"Here in the European Union and the European Parliament, we should be proud of our record on passenger rights."
"We have seen the introduction of denied boarding compensation - although we know there are still issues to resolve with that."
"We have seen the introduction of rights to assistance and tougher laws on ticket pricing transparency, as well as tough compensation measures in the package travel directive."
"In fact, I believe we have covered most of the bases when it comes to consumer protection in aviation, but there is clearly a loophole here that needs to be closed."
"If you book a charter with a holiday company you are covered by the package travel directive."
"If you book with a scheduled airline, you are covered by their system, but if you book online your seat only - the airline flight - then you are not covered."
"It is an anomaly."
"It is a loophole which Parliament, with the assistance of the Commission, is seeking to close."
"In this question we have also floated the idea of establishing a reserve compensation fund, but this must not be seen as a demand on our part or by the Commission."
"We merely wish to open up the debate as to what mechanisms might be possible to help us best solve this problem, so the idea of the question is to start the dialogue with the Commission in the hope that we can close this loophole and find a solution to what is a serious problem, particularly for those people who find themselves victims of an airline insolvency."
"I look forward to working with the Commission to try and find a solution to this problem with my committee, and to hearing the views of the other Members."
"Madam President, I am grateful to Mr Simpson and to the entire Committee on Transport and Tourism for bringing such a sensitive issue to the attention of Parliament."
"This question gives me an opportunity to reiterate formally what has been said in recent weeks following the hardships faced by many European citizens, by many passengers, as a result of the bankruptcy of certain airlines."
"As this Parliament knows, the protection of passengers in all transport sectors is a genuine priority for me."
"I said it during the hearing, when Parliament gave me its vote of confidence, and I wish to repeat it this evening."
"I believe that we must all take action to come up with a specific legal solution, not least to prevent - as Mr Simpson said - passengers who have purchased an ordinary flight ticket from an airline that subsequently goes bankrupt being treated differently from passengers who have bought their ticket as part of a more comprehensive package holiday."
"I therefore believe that the first thing to do is to use the resources that we already have at our disposal."
"In other words, the public must use all the regulations in the most effective way possible, even if they are incomplete and also lead to disparities."
"With the same aim of optimising the resources available to us, when the airline SkyEurope went bankrupt, for example, the network of European consumer protection centres was called in to advise consumers about their rights and to collect claims."
"However, we also need to offer better protection to passengers when an airline goes bankrupt."
"Passengers with bookings that subsequently lapse must be entitled to reimbursement and, in some cases, to repatriation."
"This is a complicated problem, which means we need to carefully appraise the measures to be adopted."
"The Commission has already started work to come up with a practical response to these issues."
"At our request, a major study has already been conducted on the consequences of bankruptcy in the air transport sector, particularly those for passengers."
"This detailed study explains in practical terms the consequences of bankruptcies and their impact on the 700 million or more passengers transported every year throughout the European Union."
"The study offers various possible scenarios for defining the best solutions to the various problems raised by bankruptcies, particularly in terms of reimbursement and repatriation, as I just mentioned."
"As far as both reimbursement and repatriation are concerned, it has been possible to formulate various scenarios, ranging from the setting up of guarantee funds to the development of compulsory insurance schemes for passengers or airlines, and, ultimately, to the idea of introducing targeted changes in national bankruptcy laws."
"In February this year, I sent the study to Mr Costa, who chaired the Committee on Transport and Tourism at the time."
"The Commission is now continuing to analyse the various possible options on the basis of this study and is focusing in particular on the impact on consumers and on the air transport sector."
"During our analysis, we will take into account all aspects of the debate and will take advantage of contributions from all interested parties."
"Along the same lines, in the coming weeks, the Commission will set in motion a wide-ranging public consultation process on passenger rights in the air transport sector."
"Within this context, and without underestimating the differences and the specific features of package holidays, the Commission will also take into account the impact assessment currently being carried out on the review of Directive 90/314 relating precisely to package holidays."
"This is because one of the main aims of the public consultation process will be to determine the consequences for passengers of airlines going bankrupt and the possible solutions for remedying this."
"Obviously, as well as the public consultation, a study will be carried out - as I have already mentioned - to analyse the impact of the various possible solutions."
"Obviously, Parliament's contribution will be crucial as far as I am concerned and - in view also of the dedication with which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has worked together to come up with this oral question today - I believe that over the coming weeks, we will be able to cooperate usefully in order to identify together the best solution for meeting passengers' needs and for safeguarding their rights effectively should airlines go bankrupt."
"During the current global economic crisis, with fluctuating fuel prices and a tougher competitive environment, airline operators, particularly low-cost airlines, are going through very difficult times."
"Increasing ticket prices is not an option in the current situation, while the increase in service charges being applied by some low-cost companies may result in an even sharper drop in the number of passengers."
"The financial losses sustained by airlines in 2009 will amount to approximately USD 11 billion, a situation which is set to recover only in the next three years."
"Against this background, the situation has arisen, which no one wants to see, where airlines are going bankrupt."
"In the event of bankruptcy due to lack of adequate legislation, there is no practical means of recovering the equivalent value of the tickets or getting passengers left stranded abroad flown home."
"The support offered by European airlines at a cost, although a modest one, to passengers with a company which has gone bankrupt, as highlighted in the case of SkyEurope, is laudable in itself, but only provides a temporary solution to get through a particular crisis."
"On the other hand, we cannot always consider the economic crisis itself as an excuse for this predicament, as airlines went bankrupt even before this crisis was unleashed."
"Tighter controls on the airline carriers' financial situation, especially in the case of low-cost companies, a tighter control on mergers and takeovers, as well as setting up a sizeable guarantee fund, are a few of the solutions which could, in the long term, offer passengers protection in the event of airline bankruptcy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group has been pressing for a debate on the problem of the bankruptcies in the aviation sector, as it is true that we are no longer talking about an isolated case."
"As my colleague, Mr Simpson, the Chairman of our committee, has already mentioned, there have been 77 bankruptcies - mainly smaller companies, it is true - since 2000, which also means that many thousands of people have seen the money spent on their ticket go up in smoke in one way or another, or have just been left to fend for themselves somewhere."
"There is reason to fear that other bankruptcies may well follow, in these difficult economic times for the aviation sector."
"Hence, we must do something."
"It is true, of course, that Member States must also play a role in monitoring the creditworthiness and financial fitness of the airlines - this is right and proper - but it is for us to develop a protective mechanism at European level to ensure that the stranded passengers are not left out in the cold."
"Therefore, we call on the Commission to work faster towards presenting a specific proposal; particularly because, as you pointed out, systems are already in place thanks to all manner of other legislation - including for people booking package travel - in the form of a guarantee fund and so on."
"Thus, in a way, there is a disparity between those booking a flight via a tour operator and those booking their ticket online; and this, I believe, is another thing we need to resolve."
"I hear that you are in the process of consulting the interested parties."
"You intend to present a proposal over the next year."
"I think that we really do need to try to step up the pace of our action: instead of waiting until the end of next year, we should perhaps seek a solution somewhat sooner."
"Therefore, let us talk about a specific legislative proposal without delay, so that we can organise a discussion on the practical details of a kind of bankruptcy insurance."
"Finally, I should like to say that I am delighted to hear the Commissioner say we can expect a kind of general statement on passenger rights in the aviation sector."
"We know that the current legislation is not being applied fully, evenly or satisfactorily across the board, which is something that requires our attention, and I am sure that we shall be coming back to this."
"Madam President, thank you, Commissioner, for your response."
"I am also a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I think it is very important that we have this issue on the agenda now."
"Indeed, Mr Simpson has already presented it to us."
"As it stands, there is a gap in consumer protection where air passengers are concerned. This gap relates to the insolvency of airlines, as has already been discussed."
"In my opinion, it is extremely important to uphold consumer rights, and that is what we are doing."
"We are trying to protect consumers as far as possible."
"I would like to mention one other aspect from the point of view of our group which has not been a factor in this up to now, but which I think is also an important consideration."
"Of course, we want consumer rights to be protected, but we also want consumers to have choice."
"When considering how we can close this gap, it may well be the case that a proposal that you draw up in the Commission will result in over-regulation, which may then hinder innovation when it comes to the options offered in this area."
"Consumer law also means, of course, that there should be a choice between various different offers from airlines, for example."
"Thus, the trend now, for example, is for some very cheap flights to be on offer in place of some flat-rate journeys, something which is also very much welcomed by consumers."
"Please do not misunderstand me;"
"I do not want to diminish consumer rights in any way."
"Protection of these rights, too, is very important to me, and we do need an appropriate instrument to do this."
"However, we should consider the perspectives that we need to take into account to ensure that there indeed remains a large degree of choice when it comes to air travel and that new options can come onto the market, but that consumers are nevertheless protected and are not left with any sort of financial problems if an airline were to actually go bankrupt or has to file for bankruptcy."
"In this regard, I am pleased to hear you say that you are working on a solution. The direction was, of course, clear in that there may also be an aid fund."
"I am looking forward to the discussion in committee, which may perhaps even take place this year."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial preconditions for market access for airlines have, of course, already been discussed in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"The issue of guarantee funds was brought up then, but it was clearly not considered sufficiently important or significant by the majority at that time."
"Now we are seeing cases which indeed give us cause for consideration and for regulation, because we need regulation in this area."
"Firstly, we need to continually ensure that the passenger rights that we are adopting here for the protection of consumers are complied with."
"The issue of denied boarding and the many cases of this that we have unfortunately seen show that any existing loopholes are utilised immediately."
"That requires our attention and it requires regulation."
"We will probably have to resort to the solution of a guarantee fund or some sort of insurance in order to adequately protect passengers from such business practices."
"We only need to look closely at the last case: even on the final day, there were still announcements stating that everything was alright and many people believed that."
"For this sort of solution, however, it must be guaranteed that all parties involved pay their fair share and that it does not result in a few airlines, including low cost airlines, sitting back in comfort and letting others bear the risk."
"A fair market will not only protect passengers from unfair practices, it will protect the competitors, too."
"Madam President, over the last nine years, nearly 80 airlines have gone bankrupt in the European Union."
"We have heard here today how cut-price airline SkyEurope went bankrupt during the last holidays, leaving thousands of clients out of pocket."
"The situation is repeating itself."
"Of course, it is not the owners of private aircraft who suffer, but people who are often less well-off, who save for many months to buy a ticket to fly abroad."
"I think that, in this situation, the European Parliament, and I speak as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, must insist very strongly that the European Commission adopt principles for the legal protection of passengers and clients, and that also means financial protection."
"Creation of a special reserve for the compensation of passengers and clients of bankrupt airlines may prevent situations such as those we have seen in the last decade, when many thousands of people, at the very least, have lost their money once and for all."
"This is specific action which the citizens of Member States of the European Union expect of us."
"I would like to thank Brian Simpson for his excellent introduction to this issue."
"A number of airlines have recently gone bankrupt in rapid succession."
"The problem has not been restricted to low-cost carriers, although these have accounted for most of the failures."
"If we fail to discuss the hundreds of passengers stranded in destinations from which it is difficult to get back home, nothing fundamental will happen."
"Various sectors of the industry have problems from time to time and a solution is generally found in the end."
"In this case, there are thousands of people involved, often with small children and without the appropriate funds."
"It is therefore necessary to give a clear signal that we know the solution."
"It is a matter of capital adequacy and insurance for return journeys."
"I believe that the Commission and the EU Member States are capable of finding a rapid solution to passengers' problems."
"The problems of the airline companies will require a different solution, of course."
"The crisis in the sector requires appropriate instruments and I believe that these will be used."
"Companies are going bankrupt in the economic recession and airline companies are no exception."
"In Lithuania, the Lithuanian airline 'FlyLAL' also filed for bankruptcy this year."
"It is one of tens of European airlines which went into bankruptcy this year."
"Although legislation adopted by the European Parliament provides sufficient guarantees and compensation for passengers, if, due to the fault of the airline, they are unable to take off on time on the planned route or have problems with luggage, this can only be guaranteed if the airline is not experiencing financial difficulties."
"Once a company has filed for bankruptcy, passengers who have purchased tickets usually lose all their money."
"Therefore, as national government institutions observe and licence the activities of airlines and give authorisation for flights, the Commission has recommended that where an airline goes bankrupt, governments could and should immediately return money to the airline's passengers for tickets they have purchased, then later recoup this by subrogation from the bankrupt company."
"We should also debate the proposal presented by Mr Simpson on a reserve compensation fund."
"This urgent problem can be debated and the best solution found by complementing the regulation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on general rules covering the supply of air transport services."
"Thus, we would contribute to the security of passengers who use airlines' services."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the fact that the obligations of airlines to their passengers do not terminate even if the airline goes bankrupt is obvious, and should be taken as a starting point in this much needed discussion which Mr Simpson has initiated."
"Therefore, it was with amazement that I listened to the explanations of the SkyEurope spokesman."
"Ronald Schranz expressed regret at the inconvenience which had arisen for passengers."
"I stress the word 'inconvenience'."
"He also stated that clients of the bankrupt enterprise who were waiting at foreign airports would have to look themselves for alternative ways to get home."
"According to the spokesman, the matter concerned several thousand people, but he was not able to give their precise number."
"For the SkyEurope representative, this was only a statistic."
"He forgot, however, that included in that number were many thousands of personal dramas, of passengers who could not get home, to their family or to work."
"This example shows that it is necessary to regulate this matter as soon as possible."
"SkyEurope was a listed company, and so we had more information about it."
"In the case of other cut-price airlines, this is not always so."
"It may be that the recent Bratislava nightmare will be repeated at another European airport."
"At the moment, a heated discussion is in progress, in which different solutions to this important problem are being proposed."
"There is talk of a special fund created from a surcharge on air tickets, and also of bankruptcy insurance."
"These are valuable initiatives, but they are not without effect on the price of tickets."
"At a time of crisis we need a procedure which, on the one hand, will help passengers and, on the other, will not complicate the already difficult financial situation of airlines."
"I should like, therefore, to put a question and a proposal to the Commissioner: could a partial solution not be the idea of 'sky solidarity', which would incorporate the principle of joint responsibility of airlines for passengers?"
"Yes, solidarity, an idea which is, to me, as a Pole, especially dear."
"It should be an answer and a challenge which can be applied immediately."
"My proposal is based on the idea that passengers of a bankrupt airline who are stranded at an airport would be able to use the aircraft of another airline flying in the same direction, on condition, of course, that there are vacant seats on board."
"Any costs involved would be settled between the airlines concerned."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner for a reply."
"(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the collapse of the airline company SkyEurope has focused attention on the general problem of poor consumer protection for airline company passengers."
"This is no virtual problem - I have had the opportunity to meet a number of customers affected by the collapse of this airline company in person."
"They were, by coincidence, guests from the French twin town of Chateau d'Ain, who had come for a meeting in Kroměříž in the east of the Czech Republic, which is the town I represent."
"Their return journey was a very frustrating experience, involving an enforced one-day stopover at Prague airport."
"I mention this experience in order to emphasise that SkyEurope was not a normal low-cost airline."
"It offered its passengers similar services to those of a traditional airline and flew to major airports."
"Its services were used by a wide range of customers."
"For customers whose primary concern was not the date of the trip but rather the cost of the ticket, SkyEurope was the preferred choice in the Czech Republic."
"The SkyEurope company was also one the most important clients for Prague-Ruzyně, the Czech Republic's largest airport."
"The collapse of SkyEurope, however, affected not only people at airports, but also 280 000 other clients who had bought tickets."
"According to the information available, air tickets were being sold right up to the moment when bankruptcy was declared."
"People who did not purchase tickets with a credit card have practically no chance of recovering their money."
"Airline companies have no legal obligation to insure against a collapse and so some of them do not take out such insurance."
"Passengers must therefore make their claims in bankruptcy proceedings."
"The chances of getting money back in this way are negligible."
"It is therefore time to do something about this."
"I would like to thank the Committee on Transport for taking ownership of this issue and the Commission for promising to deal with it."
"I am confident that a solution will be put forward that will boost customer confidence in the air transport sector, which has been so dramatically affected by the global economic crisis."
"(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the large bankruptcies of airline companies this year force us to consider again whether the unified internal market for air transport is functioning properly."
"Although several major carriers have gone bust and the situation in the sector continues to deteriorate due to rising fuel costs and slower economic growth, there is definitely no reason for panic, in my opinion."
"Before we launch ourselves down the slippery slope of regulation, we should remember that the EU has seen a major expansion of low-cost carriers in air transport and fiercer competition between all EU airlines thanks to liberalisation measures."
"A formerly highly-regulated industry with costly air tickets has been transformed into a dynamic sector with services which, thanks to the affordable prices in the EU, are being used by ever greater numbers of passengers who, in former times, would not have been able to afford them."
"Let us therefore consider carefully how we can increase protection for consumers - in this case airline customers - without putting at risk an efficient air transport market."
"The idea of introducing compulsory insurance against bankruptcy for airlines has already been proposed in the European Parliament in the recent past."
"It is therefore right to consider how this proposal might be put into effect."
"(FR) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the oral question we are debating this evening reveals, as many have said, the existence of a real legal vacuum, which leaves passengers with no guarantee should an airline go bankrupt."
"Certainly, European legislation protects passengers who have purchased their ticket as part of a package holiday, but it does not protect those who buy their ticket on the Internet."
"As Mr El Khadraoui said, consumer behaviour has evolved with the development of the Internet, and the legislator must follow this evolution in order to protect our fellow European citizens."
"A large number of travellers now buy their flight tickets on the Internet."
"Given that low-cost companies sell their tickets almost exclusively online, it is young people and people on the lowest incomes who are particularly affected by this phenomenon."
"It is not acceptable that these passengers have no recourse if the airline they bought their ticket from goes bankrupt. All the more so because, in the last few months, the air transport sector has experienced an unprecedented crisis leading to a significant reduction in air travel."
"We all know that this crisis is worse that that which affected the sector after 11 September and that numerous airlines have gone bankrupt."
"It is therefore essential that the European Commission - and I know, Vice-President, that you are aware of this - presents us with genuine solutions, as soon as possible, so that we can protect passengers if the airline they were due to fly with goes bankrupt, regardless of the means by which they booked their ticket."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased with the question that we are debating today, but I think that it only covers one of the possible cases where a company ceases to operate: that of financial collapse or insolvency."
"There are, however, other kinds of situation in which airlines may stop operating or suspend their activities."
"I am referring to cases in which their licence is suspended for safety reasons, voluntary closure or closure for any reason other than a financial one."
"These situations bring with them identical problems to those that we are discussing today, where passengers are left helpless, since either the cost of their flights is not reimbursed or, if it is, in some cases this reimbursement involves significant costs."
"I think that the regulation on compensation for passengers in the event of delay or cancellation could be one of the instruments to be used, but I do not believe it is enough."
"In this context, I would like to ask the Commission to look at the possibility of putting forward legislative measures for other cases - the cases that I mentioned - which go beyond airline collapse and which are not covered by the Community legislation in force."
"Otherwise, we run the risk, despite all our good intentions, of falling short and only providing legal cover for one specific situation, while leaving out many passengers who may also suffer through the closure of an airline, even though the reason for its closure is not economic or financial."
"(RO) If we want to have an efficient internal market, we need to have a Community consumer protection policy."
"Over the years, the European Union has taken relevant actions in this area, and the measures adopted have ensured an increase in the level of consumer protection in areas such as package holiday services and passengers' rights."
"However, a large majority of the complaints received from European consumers relate to the violation of airline passengers' rights."
"Many of these complaints come from passengers whose flights have been cancelled due to the airlines or tour operators going bankrupt."
"In these cases, consumers become aware of the problems only when the flight is not operated as scheduled."
"Although European Union Council Directive 90/314/EEC on package holidays protects passengers if the tour operator goes into liquidation, it does not protect them for airline tickets sold on an individual basis."
"In addition, in the event of denied boarding, compensation is excluded in the case of extraordinary circumstances, which also includes airline bankruptcy."
"According to a recent survey, the number of airline bankruptcies in the European Union between 2000 and 2008 rose to 79."
"41% of the airlines which went bankrupt between 2005 and 2008 operated regional flights, while 17% were low-cost airlines."
"What kind of action could we take, therefore, to provide better protection to passengers in such circumstances?"
"Possible solutions include a passenger insurance scheme to cover these scenarios, a tighter system of supervision, as well as the drafting of legislative provisions guaranteeing compensation to passengers in such situations."
"Madam President, passengers' compensation in the case of airline bankruptcies is not only a question of money."
"It is related to even more serious issues such as safety, accessibility of services and competitiveness."
"In times of crisis, every economic field is in a precarious situation, and airline transport is no exception to that."
"It is crucial not to let people's confidence in the operators waver, because this would lead to a considerable decrease in demand and thus would weaken even more the financial situation of airlines."
"This may influence Europe's whole economic situation and competitiveness."
"Passengers' compensation is also in relation to the accessibility of services."
"I believe that every person in Europe must have the choice to travel by air if he or she so wishes."
"For this, you must admit that we need safe but low-cost airlines that are affordable for everyone."
"These airlines should have a stable financial background, because safety does not only mean safety in case of an accident but also implies that, if I purchase an air ticket, I should be confident that by the time of the trip, there will actually be an aeroplane to take me to my destination."
"All this gives our oral question its importance, and the fact that there have been almost 80 airline bankruptcies in Europe since 2000 gives it urgency."
"The need for a clear regulation in this field is evident."
"Therefore, I would kindly ask the Commissioner to seriously consider this matter and come up with a viable solution as soon as possible."
"(PL) Madam President, Mr Tajani, about a month ago, a budget airline became insolvent, and the airline - SkyEurope - presented a bankruptcy petition."
"Despite the fact that air industry analysts had been predicting this bankruptcy for a long time, SkyEurope was, nevertheless, still selling tickets for its flights the day before presentation of the bankruptcy petition."
"As a result, hundreds of the airline's passengers were denied not only the opportunity of making the journeys they had planned but, above all, they were exposed to significant financial losses caused by the airline's collapse."
"The firm simply informed its clients, in an official statement, that they would have to write off the money they had invested in their tickets."
"The example of SkyEurope demonstrates unambiguously that, in our common Europe, we have not yet succeeded in drafting legislation which would protect consumers of air services from the negative consequences of the collapse of an airline."
"This is a significant problem, which can be seen from the fact that 77 airlines have gone bankrupt around the world since 2000."
"For example, in 2004, the Polish airline Air Polonia went bankrupt."
"Therefore, I would like the Commission to present principles for the protection of consumers from the negative consequences of possible airline bankruptcies."
"Madam President, Mrs De Veyrac, Mr Vlasák and Mrs Gurmai focused attention on the cause of bankruptcy, in other words, the economic crisis and the difficulties currently faced by the air transport sector, by both low-cost airlines and major airlines."
"The European Parliament and the Commission have acted in unison to launch a set of initiatives in response to the crisis."
"I refer to the freezing of slots, supported by the vast majority of this Parliament, and the Single European Sky initiative, which is a large-scale reform of the air transport system that enables airlines to save on fuel costs because we have reduced the legs between one airport and another."
"Precisely in order to provide practical support to all European airlines, be they low-cost or non low-cost airlines, I have called on the 27 transport ministers in the European Union to introduce the Single European Sky reform ahead of schedule, because this is a good way to allow airlines to save fuel and therefore to prevent their balance sheets from being adversely affected."
"Preventing airlines from going bankrupt would not only protect passengers against loss but would, above all, be extraordinarily important when it comes to protecting jobs."
"We must not forget that this financial and economic crisis should not be allowed to become a full-blown social crisis."
"We know that the air transport sector is beset by problems at international level: we need only think of what happened to Japan Airlines a few weeks ago, when staff cuts were announced."
"It should be our duty not only to safeguard citizens but also act to ensure that good airlines can remain operational, thus safeguarding jobs."
"The European Commission - and please excuse me if I digress - and Parliament have worked to make this possible."
"I can state that, through our efforts, we have made it possible to create a new completely private airline model: examples include the case of Olympic Airways, the case of Alitalia and the case - which I hope will be resolved - of Austrian Airlines This means that there are no more state-controlled airlines that have to be bailed out by the public when they get into trouble."
"Instead, whoever makes the mistakes must pay for them."
"I would also like to respond to the question raised by Mrs Alvarez, who raised a topic that is certainly interesting: I think I can agree with her proposal adding, in the work we are carrying out, the suggestion that safeguards should also be given to the passengers of airlines that shut down not due to bankruptcy but because they do not comply with safety requirements."
"In this particular case, the passenger suffers the same loss as a passenger who bought a ticket from an airline that subsequently went bankrupt."
"The principle must remain that of safeguarding the travelling public when they suffer a loss, in other words, when they cannot board their flight."
"Moreover, this is the philosophy that underpins - and will continue to underpin - my efforts as long as I remain a Commissioner, so that passengers can be offered the same safeguards in all transport sectors."
"For this reason, at the Transport Council due to be held in Luxembourg tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, we will tackle the question of the rights of sea and river transport passengers."
"This is a choice made by the Commission, with the support of Parliament, which is aimed at safeguarding European citizens."
"If we really wish to win public confidence and obtain the sort of positive results that were achieved in Ireland, we must legislate to show citizens that the Community institutions are on their side, that they are not simply gravy trains, but places where work is done to safeguard and protect the rights of European citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on any motions for resolutions will take place during the next part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"As a result of changing travel habits, an ever-increasing number of people are making their own travel arrangements, without availing themselves of the services of travel agencies."
"Low-cost airlines have been the winners from this trend over the last decade, in terms of both revenue and market share."
"Fellow Members, the regular bankruptcy of travel agencies used to be a cause for concern in Hungary as well."
"We would regularly see on television pictures of families stranded abroad."
"We must not let the next wave of bankruptcies sweep away the low-cost firms, causing millions of euros of damage to the economy as well as to passengers, not to mention the safety risk, if a company does not have a secure financial basis to support its operation."
"This is precisely why we must focus on the following objectives."
"We must think about tightening the rules on setting up companies."
"In the case of airlines, further capital and structural guarantees must be required."
"We must think about tightening up the system for financial and operating accounts and about how frequently spot-checks should be carried out."
"The size of this sector warrants that regular European surveys should analyse the companies' flight policy, complaint-handling mechanism and the simplicity of the refund procedure."
"We must make it even easier to deal with cross-border complaints relating to similar matters in the future."
"If we really want to create a common market in Europe with the consumer's welfare at its heart, we must deal with cross-border complaints and compensation claims more efficiently."
"Report on the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European company (SE) (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the Commission on the report on the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European company (SE) - B7-0211/2009)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2001, the European Council reached a decision on the Statute for a European company."
"For various reasons, this Statute did not enter into force in this form until 8 October 2004."
"As is customary with European Union legislation, the Commission was asked, after a certain time, to submit a report on the application and implementation of the Statute in order to draw conclusions about whether there is a need for amendments to this legal act."
"The date I mentioned, 8 October 2004, was almost exactly five years ago."
"The deadline was five years, but there is no report from the European Commission."
"Since we all obey the law and the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, is particularly required to obey the law, this gave the Committee on Legal Affairs cause to ask why this report is not available and why it has not even been prepared."
"We quite simply want to give the Commission the opportunity to justify this to us."
"In any case, this will make it clear that Parliament, and the Committee on Legal Affairs in particular, is fulfilling in full its obligation to monitor the Commission."
"I will not use my five minutes' speaking time, but would be pleased if the Commission would now provide an answer on the basis of this short oral question that I have posed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, on behalf of Commissioner McCreevy, who I am standing in for this evening in this chamber, I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and its chairman Mr Lehne for raising these issues."
"On a personal note - because I was a Member of this House for nearly 15 years - I am delighted that Parliament is exercising its control function, because this is a suitable incentive for encouraging the Commission to work more effectively."
"As regards the first two issues that were raised, I am pleased to inform you that work on the preparation of the requested report is already at an advanced stage."
"The Commission has asked for an external study, which should be ready by the end of this year and will act as a solid factual basis for drawing up the report."
"The Commission will analyse this study in depth and will listen closely to the opinions of the interested parties."
"The report could therefore be published during the second half of next year and will be forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council."
"Obviously the exact timescales and contents will be decided by the next Commission."
"The report will contain an analysis of the four amendment alternatives specifically provided for by Article 69 of the Regulation and, at this stage, the Commission has not yet adopted a position either on this or on any other possible changes to the statute."
"We must await the results of the external study and further consultations and closely monitor each factor and, if necessary, the results of any negotiations on the Statute for a European Company."
"As far as the third question is concerned, the timescales and content of any further actions to be adopted in the future in the light of the results of the analysis carried out must be decided by the new Commission, which I am convinced will be very mindful and interested to hear Parliament's viewpoint before adopting any additional new measures."
"The concept of a European company dates way back to the 1950s and was revived after the Treaty of Rome came into force as part of the objective of a common market."
"The current Statute for a European company is of symbolic value to a European undertaking."
"It offers the benefit of a certain free rein in terms of establishing the company and its mobility."
"Many companies use the Statute for a European company to highlight the company's unique European character, making it, at the same time, a key instrument for companies looking to develop cross-border merger strategies."
"In fact, one of the main benefits of a European company is that its registered office can be transferred from the Member State where it was registered to another Member State without having to wind down the company or create a new legal entity."
"However, the European company is far removed from the initial objectives of an autonomous status governed by a single legislation."
"As a result, its practical operation is inadequate."
"The legislation is not applied consistently and relies on the specific provisions of the national legislations, while the European company's mobility is restricted by the provisions which ban the establishment of registered offices or head offices in different Member States."
"Indeed, this situation restricts one of the Community's basic freedoms, the free movement of companies."
"I think that the European Commission's report on the application of the regulation, as mentioned by the Commissioner, will need to include a survey on the possibility of locating a European company's central administration and registered office in different Member States."
"A review of the regulation will also need to be considered in order to move further towards creating an autonomous status for this type of company."
"Madam President, I listened carefully to the speeches by Mr Lehne and the other MEP who took part in the discussion."
"It is true that the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company is supplemented by a Directive on the involvement of employees and that the deadline for its transposition expired on 8 October 2004, the date on which the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company entered into force."
"However, only eight Member States adopted the necessary measures by the required deadline and transposition of the directive on employee involvement was completed in all the Member States only at the beginning of 2006."
"We were therefore obliged to postpone the report to ensure that the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company had actually been in force in all the Member States for long enough to make it possible to draw up an indicative report on its application."
"These are the reasons for the delay."
"For my part, I can only agree with Mr Lehne and hope that we can make up for lost time and provide practical responses to the European Union on the topic of the Statute for a European Company from the second half of next year, through specific guidelines that can really satisfy the requests not only from Parliament but also from the EU-wide economic and employment sector."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Efficient functioning of the internal market is dependent not only on the elimination of barriers to trade between states, but also on reorganisation of the structure of production at Community level."
"To this end, in the 1970s, the European Commission put forward a proposal to create a legal framework for a European company."
"In 2001, Council Regulation No 2157/2001 on the Statute for a European company was adopted."
"The idea has not produced the expected results, and to date, not many more than 100 firms have been transformed into a Societas Europaea."
"The idea has evolved, however, towards including small and medium-sized enterprises in the framework of the European company, the fruit of which is the Commission's proposal of March 2008 for a Council Regulation on the Statute for a European private company."
"In view of the negative experience with the Societas Europaea, it is very important that the Commission have permanent oversight of the application of Regulation No 2157/2001. It is for this reason that the regulation itself provides that, five years at the latest after its entry into force, the Commission shall present a report on its application."
"The regulation came into force in 2004."
"Therefore, I would like to ask when the Commission will present the appropriate report, and what action will it take on the basis of the analysis made?"

"Freedom of information in Italy (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on freedom of information in Italy."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, freedom of expression and freedom of information represent a foundation of a free, democratic and pluralistic society."
"That is my firm belief as a former journalist and it is also the firm belief of the European Union."
"That is why all the EU institutions - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - have signed up to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 11 of which states that: 'Everyone has the right to freedom of expression."
"This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers."
"The freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.'"
"I would like to recall that the EU Charter also states, in Article 51(1), where and when those fundamental rights apply."
"I quote again: 'The provisions of this charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States', but 'only when they are implementing Union law'."
"Within the EU's sphere of competence, which we have to respect, the European Commission has always stood up for freedom of the media, freedom of expression, freedom of information and freedom of the press, whether within the EU or in our external relations with third countries."
"I recall, in particular, the important role played by the EU's 'Television without Frontiers' Directive which, since 1989, has made sure that citizens in all EU Member States are free to receive, without restrictions, broadcasts from other EU countries; an EU directive which has substantially contributed to the free flow of information across borders and to a more pluralistic media landscape in all Member States."
"In this context, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having helped the Commission to get a modernised version of this directive which extends the freedom of information across borders, beyond broadcasting, to other audiovisual services and, particularly, those transmitted by Internet."
"This directive needs to be implemented by all EU Member States by the end of the year and will make important contributions to a pluralistic landscape when it also comes to the online environment."
"Let me also recall three other very important elements of this directive."
"Firstly, the promotion of independent TV productions."
"There is a rule in the directive that broadcasters need to reserve at least 10% of their transmission time or 10% of their programming budget to European works created by producers who are independent from the broadcasters."
"Secondly, the directive foresees in its modernised version the right of journalists and news organisations to access short extracts across the EU for the purpose of short reporting."
"Thirdly, and this is of utmost importance, there is a reference in the new directive to the need to have independent media authorities at national level."
"This is a reference which was proposed by the Commission and which could only be adopted in the end thanks to strong support by the European Parliament."
"Thus, for the broadcasting sector, the modernised Television Without Frontiers Directive can be seen as a charter for freedom of cross-border information in the EU."
"Now let me recall another important aspect in the EU's field of competence where this institution can act and has acted for the benefit of media pluralism."
"I mean radio spectrum policy."
"You all know that there cannot be broadcasting without access to radio spectrum, and it is the EU policy to ensure that all players on the market get non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum."
"National authorities are thus not entitled to freeze, by means of spectrum allocation, the competitive situation on the media market for the benefit of the operators already active on that market."
"The European Court of Justice, by the way, has confirmed this important principle, which directly results from the freedom to provide services, in its Centro Europa judgment."
"The Commission welcomed that ruling as a contribution to fair competition and as an important foundation for strengthening media pluralism."
"On that basis, the Commission has repeatedly acted against Member States where the system of spectrum management has appeared to be in contradiction with this principle."
"By way of example, I would like to recall the 2006 infringement proceedings on radio spectrum allocation in Italy, which my colleague Neelie Kroes and I opened."
"Under the pressure of this procedure, the Italian authorities are now changing their approach."
"The result of this will be a substantial market opening and a win for media pluralism."
"Spectrum policy is therefore a clear example of an area where the EU can act within its field of competences in order to enhance competition for the resources on which broadcasters depend, and thereby strengthen media pluralism."
"Concerning the written press, the competences of the EU are substantially more limited."
"The written press is one of those prime examples of national, or even regional, competences and its situation very often reflects the varying cultural traditions in our different Member States."
"There is thus no EU legislation specifically on the written press, nor can there be legislation under the treaties as they stand."
"Nevertheless, in the EU institutions and, in particular, the European Commission, we have always flanked the development of the written press across the EU."
"I recall that in my capacity as EU Media Commissioner, I had numerous meetings with editors-in-chief from all around Europe to discuss the current issues relating to media freedom and media pluralism."
"In June 2009, this led to the European Charter on Freedom of the Press, drafted by journalists across Europe."
"I fully endorsed that charter when the final outcome of this work was handed over to me."
"The Charter on the Freedom of the Press initiated by the European journalist community is an important reaffirmation of the basic values enshrined in fundamental legal texts such as the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is also a reminder for all policymakers in their field of competence that, in order to have effective freedom of the press, public authorities do indeed have a role to play: they must be ready to protect freedom of expression and foster its development."
"The charter is therefore an important step towards reinforcing these basic values and rights, allowing journalists to invoke them against governments or against political public authorities whenever they feel that the freedom of their work is unjustifiably threatened."
"The honourable Members will see that strong political commitment is being shown by the EU's institutions, and particularly by the Commission, to fundamental rights and freedom of information, of expression and of the media."
"We are using our competences to uphold those rights and freedoms in our work, on the basis of the Treaties, and will continue to do so."
"However, let me also touch on another important aspect, namely the fact that fundamental rights apply to EU policies does not make the EU competent for all matters relating to fundamental rights in one Member State or another."
"Let us not forget that the Member States have constitutions, many of them with long traditions, and that in all Member States, there are courts, appeal courts and constitutional courts which ensure that fundamental rights are respected and enforced whenever national authorities act."
"We had an example of this as recently as yesterday in Italy."
"This is the result of the fact that we have a division of labour, because Europe is not a superstate, but is comprised of 27 sovereign Member States and will continue to operate like this under the new Lisbon Treaty too."
"I would therefore call on you not to make use of the EU institutions to solve problems which should, under our Treaties, be solved at national level."
"We should not claim a role that we do not have, and we will not have it under the Lisbon Treaty either."
"Let us concentrate here on applying effectively the rules, principles, rights and freedoms in areas where the EU is competent."
"This can lead to very important progress, and I have mentioned several concrete examples of this in my speech."
"Let me add another example of where we could act."
"Paul Rübig, a Member of this House, recently proposed in a budgetary amendment a new EU programme called Erasmus for Journalists."
"Such a programme would, in difficult times for the written press, allow journalists to work for a limited time with editorial staff in other Member States."
"It would also allow journalists to discover the political, economic and social situation in other Member States and to write about it."
"It would allow journalists to compare the situation across Europe and to present that to the readers, including the situation with regard to freedom of the press."
"That is why I encourage the European Parliament to look very favourably on these proposals, which certainly have the support of the EU Media Commissioner."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every one of us is influenced by the circumstances in which we live, and you too will have been told before coming here to Brussels: 'remember that you have a big responsibility, that we have a big responsibility', that of making your country better."
"We know that our countries will be better if Europe is stronger and is able to respond with a sense of fairness to its citizens' expectations."
"We are obviously aware that this is possible if we all act together; if we are able to pool our most precious resources, our Constitutions, that set of values and of legal rules, of rights, that are Europe's true assets."
"So many controversies plague my country, but I would like straight away to reassure everyone that we are talking about a great democratic country, which has a great Constitution."
"Yesterday was a very important day for we Italians, because the Constitutional Court, faced with confusion and requests for impunity, reaffirmed a simple and time-honoured principle - that all citizens are equal before the law."
"However, we know that even great countries can go off course, can mix up public property with private interests."
"Nonetheless, we cannot allow the Member States to become weak."
"The right to independent information, without pressures or conditions on the part of government authorities, must be guaranteed, and this is a public good, a good for everyone, in every country."
"This good must be protected without hesitation by the Union."
"We must endeavour to provide common rules, to set limits beyond which information is no longer considered to be independent."
"There is an urgent need for the Union to intervene, to adopt a directive that lays down guidelines on pluralism and on the protection of a good that must be available to all."
"Mrs Reding, never forget that we are a Parliament and not a museum where things are left to moulder away."
"(PT) Three or four weeks ago in Portugal, Prisa - a Spanish company that is a known supporter of the Socialist Party and majority shareholder of the television channel TVI - ordered the cancelling of the evening programme Jornal Nacional de Sexta-Feira."
"Mr Sassoli, I would like to ask you whether the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has the same intention of studying what is going on in other countries, or if its intentions amount to nothing more than the political chicanery that we are witnessing here this morning."
"Thank you for your question, because it gives me the opportunity to explain myself."
"I did not have this opportunity in the time that was allocated to me."
"(The President asked the Members to allow the speaker to continue)"
"As I was saying, I am glad you asked me the question because it gives me the opportunity to say that the directive that we are requesting from the Commission must be for all Member States."
"This is not an Italian issue: this is a European issue."
"I would also say that we want the question that we are to submit at Strasbourg to be amended."
"We want it to cover the debate on pluralism in Italy and in Europe."
"Thank you very much for your question."
"Colleagues, if there is going to be such a discussion in the chamber, I shall not give permission for blue-card questions."
"It is my decision."
"I am sorry, but we must be much calmer about the whole issue, otherwise the rule will be no blue cards."
"I do not want the sitting to be disturbed."
"Please behave properly."
"Mr President, the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, is right to say that the European Parliament is not the place for settling disputes between political parties within Member States, or for opposing decisions taken by the national parliaments."
"The problem in Italy - and I believe that Mr Napolitano, the President of the Republic, is absolutely right - must first be settled in Italy."
"However - and this is the problem, Mr Daul - no one can deny that there is a problem in Europe and in Italy."
"The problem I have with your speech is that you are denying that there is a problem."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Napolitano is right."
"I think that you are right to also highlight what Mr Napolitano said, but it is not a good idea to say here, in this House, that there is not a problem."
"Why do I say that?"
"I say that because Freedom House has recently published a study in which the countries of the world are divided into three categories of press freedom: free, partly free and not free."
"It should be pointed out - and I believe that this is a huge problem - that three countries, not just one, not just Italy, but also Romania and Bulgaria, have been included in the 'partly free' category."
"We are all the more concerned, really concerned, because one of the founding countries of the European Union features among those countries."
"Given that we created this European Union in order to uphold, once and for all, our common values of democracy, peace and freedom, it is our duty to intervene."
"How?"
"I believe that we must ask the Commission, on the basis of our treaties - and, I repeat, this is a request that has already been made - to propose a directive to safeguard the pluralism of the media."
"This is what must happen, and it is a competence that can be implemented with the European Parliament pursuant to the treaties."
"This directive should guarantee that our constitutional provisions on freedom of the media are respected fully and harmoniously in all of the countries of the European Union, and certainly in all of the countries in question."
"I must also tell you, Mr President, and I will finish here, that I was very disappointed by the Commission's speech."
"The Member States can all do whatever they like as long as it is compatible with their national Constitutions."
"That is what we heard from the Commission."
"I completely disagree."
"I protest."
"There are values, there are freedoms that must be defended in this House beyond national interests, beyond national Constitutions."
"(Applause)"
"These are values and principles that really make the European Union what it is."
"I therefore call on the Commission to review its position and to propose a directive on the issue of media concentration as quickly as possible, and to do so for all of the countries of the European Union."
"(IT) Mr President, just to follow up the statements made by Mr Sassoli - who stated in this House that the text that we are to vote on in Strasbourg will be changed - I think it is pointless to debate a text that the proponents themselves have already declared they will change."
"Mrs Muscardini, that was not really a procedural request, so I would ask that we observe the rules of procedure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to give the floor to everyone who raises a blue card."
"I am entitled to do this, and we must move on with our discussion."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, people may think that I will speak in Italian, and people might want to make this an Italian debate, but I am Dutch."
"I am a Dutch Member of this Parliament and I am very frustrated by the idea that we are talking here as if the issue were an internal Italian debate."
"The point is not the way that things are going in Italy - the pressure on journalists, the self-censorship journalists are starting to apply in Italy."
"The point is that it is a disgrace for Europe."
"How are we going to tell new Member States, applicant Member States, that they have to have a plural media, that every voice has to be heard in their country, that there should be a debate between all colours and all political parties, if we are unwilling to tell Italy that they have to shape up, that it is wrong to push journalists to change their attitude, that it is wrong to have one person ruling both commercial television and public television."
"Mr Verhofstadt has asked for this and I will also ask for it."
"Mrs Reding, you said Europe is doing its best, fundamental rights are fundamental, but not when it comes to a Member State that is already a Member State."
"That cannot be true."
"This is one of the Copenhagen criteria."
"Everybody has to stick to the Copenhagen criteria."
"(Applause)"
"In order to ensure that this is not an Italian debate, I am also asking for a media concentration directive."
"The European Parliament has asked for this twice: when is the Commission going to deliver?"
"This heated debate we are having is one which the PPE Group even tried to take off the agenda with the argument that it would not be European."
"This heated debate shows that something is going on."
"People are shouting, people are being emotional about it - which is good, because freedom of speech, a plural press, is the key of our democracy."
"In Italy, 80% of the people get their daily information from television. If that television is not broadcasting all voices, then people do not get the chance to make their own decisions."
"That is fundamental to democracy."
"(Applause)"
"We are all educated people."
"We all have to learn to deal with various truths and make our own truth out of that, and people in Italy have the right to do so."
"People in Bulgaria, people in the Netherlands, have a right to do so, and I stand up for that right."
"I might be Dutch, I might not be Italian, but I do care for citizens throughout the whole of Europe."
"Trying to get this debate taken off this agenda, trying to say it is not our case, is something we should be ashamed of."
"The way things are going in Italy makes that country very vulnerable in its democracy."
"Let us get something going."
"Media concentration, please, Mrs Reding."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is not only Italy which is a great and wonderful country."
"The representatives of 27 wonderful countries sit in the European Parliament - if I can just add to what Mr Sassoli has said."
"I think it is somewhat of a paradox that I, an anticommunist opposition activist, who never supposed he could agree with anyone whose roots are in that camp, would have to agree with the President of Italy, who is warning against transferring internal disputes to the forum of the European Parliament."
"I am talking about double standards."
"There are certain matters which arouse the interest of some political groups in our Parliament."
"These groups force discussion of these matters in the forum of our Parliament, while other matters are swept under the carpet."
"Perhaps there have been similar situations in other countries."
"In Poland recently, a serving Minister did everything possible, using all available instruments, to keep the President of state television in his position."
"Ultimately, he was not successful but, at the time, I did not hear that any of the political groups had requested a debate on the matter."
"Similar situations have occurred in other countries."
"Therefore, if we do not want anyone to accuse us of those double standards, we should treat everyone equally."
"If there is a problem, then at such a time we should always talk about it."
"If we do not do this, it means there is some kind of political context to it, some kind of political manoeuvring."
"Mr Verhofstadt has announced here proposals to impose from above, as it were, certain formal, legal and legislative solutions on certain Member States."
"I think this is nothing other than introducing a far-reaching, excessive integration of Europe, by the back door as it were, and over the heads of the citizens."
"It would, in fact, be against the will of public opinion, as it is expressed in elections held to choose governments."
"The European Union is still a community based on nations, on nation states."
"Let us, however, avoid such a shortcut in which we, as it were, over the heads of nation states, establish certain legislation for them."
"Mr President, finally, I think it is an internal, Italian matter."
"It may also be a difficult matter, but the Italians should resolve it themselves."
"The European Parliament is not the place to resolve these problems."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of the press and of information is a fundamental and inalienable right, because it is part of human development."
"Moreover, it is, as you said, Mrs Reding, recognised by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights on pluralism and Article 51 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union on freedom of expression."
"It is on the basis both of this European law and of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and of the OSCE on freedom of the media that our Parliament believes that the President of the Council of Ministers of Italy, the head of what was, after all, a founder member of the European Community, is violating the principles of freedom and pluralism of the press in several ways."
"He has turned common public assets such as information and culture into true commodities for profit by building a media empire consisting of several television and radio channels, publishing houses, advertising agencies, insurance companies and banks."
"What is more, the President of the Italian Council has a say in who is appointed in the public sector of the media."
"This virtual monopoly on information and its financing allows him to dominate, control and direct not only the majority of the audiovisual press and publishing media, but also their content, to his sole advantage."
"Such a system of thought-policing is incompatible with fundamental democratic debate, which alone ensures that there is real pluralism of the press and of the media."
"Let us add that, since the same man and his family hold both the political power and the media power, we are faced with an obvious conflict of interest that is incompatible with a major democracy, a democracy that is modern and vibrant, thanks to its active citizens."
"Moreover, Mr Berlusconi wants to limit the publication of judicial information, sues and threatens journalists who criticise him, and sues Italian newspapers such as La Repubblica, L'Unità and even the daily Avvenire, published by Italian bishops."
"European newspapers, including the French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, are also threatened."
"Ultimately, the independent written press is being crippled financially in two ways: by the 'Tremonti' Decree of 6 August 2008, which reduces public aid for independent newspapers, and by advertising budget cuts."
"The Berlusconi thought police are now also targeting the constitutional court, the magistrates, the Federation of Independent Journalists and even the very parliament that Mr Berlusconi is bringing into disrepute."
"Under these circumstances, if, on all sides of this House, we are willing to take action to defend what we call the democratic values of the European Union, then we must issue a solemn warning and, Commissioner, we must enforce European law as you have worded it, and say, together with the thousands of Italian intellectuals, creators and journalists, that the freedom to inform and the freedom to be informed must be respected unconditionally in Italy as in the whole of the European Union."
"That is why I am proposing to our Parliament the creation of a European observatory on pluralism of the media and the press."
"This observatory would monitor respect for the principle of the separation of powers between political power and media power throughout the Union, the implementation of a maximum concentration threshold in the media, respect for journalists' rights to inform, and respect for publication rights for independent newspapers."
"It would link our Parliament to the national parliaments, to editors and producers, to journalists' associations, to readers and to television viewers."
"This observatory could prepare a draft directive against concentration and for pluralism."
"This would be one way, Mr President, of keeping democracy alive within our Europe."
"Mr President, the European Union is an area of freedom and of democracy: Italy is no exception, even where information is concerned."
"Were it not enough to consider the countless publications on sale in news-stands, or to see the wide range of television channels available, including local channels, one need only analyse the reports by independent bodies such as the Pavia Monitoring Unit, which established that the opposition has 60% of the airtime during public television news broadcasts and 49% of the airtime on the Mediaset networks."
"One should then consider that, of 455 judgments handed down by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on freedom of information, only seven concern Italy, compared with 29 for France and 28 for the United Kingdom."
"As for claiming that media outlets would be influenced by the fact that the Italian Prime Minister, exercising his constitutional right as a citizen, has brought legal proceedings against some of them, it is very important to recognise in this context that, in Italy, from the first instance rulings up to the final and definitive rulings, the judiciary certainly does not give in to the Head of Government; rather, at times the opposite seems true."
"Freedom of expression is guaranteed in Italy: whoever claims otherwise should have the courage not to submit general motions for resolutions from a purely political perspective, but to initiate the procedure referred to in Article 7 of the Treaty, which requires documentary evidence of the state of completely non-existent affairs."
"(DE) Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy."
"Mr President, would you be sitting here today if, in Western Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, Italian conditions had paved the way for Belusconi-isation?"
"What we are concurrently discovering, however, is that it is not only Italy that is a problem, but that a Belusconi-isation of Europe is taking place and that is very, very dangerous."
"As a member of the Convention to draft the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, I was able to witness how tough a struggle there was about this key issue of the concentration of the media."
"Unfortunately, due to the resistance of certain forces, we did not succeed at that point in making progress."
"Almost 10 years later, we are paying the price."
"This is a highly dangerous development."
"If I take a look just at a single country in which I worked for many years: what happened to the assault gun of democracy, as Spiegel magazine once called it, under the real conditions of the new economic concentration?"
"Why, moreover, have we not, under these conditions, where Europe really is required in this area of freedom of the press and expression which is so crucial, had the progress that so many Europeans have been waiting for, for which, in fact, some of them started revolutions?"
"Where is this directive?"
"Mrs Reding, what are you afraid of?"
"What forces are at work here?"
"Are those forces called Murdoch, or something else?"
"Turning now to public service television - in Austria, that is where 62% of the population get their information from."
"So, who controls it?"
"It is almost exclusively the governing political parties."
"When I look at the government apparatus in Germany, I can see that, there too, the wrong people are at the helm."
"We need freedom of the press - and not just in Italy!"
"(IT) Mr President, the television images of this empty Chamber will be the best judge of the contrivance and the sham that is this debate."
"In fact, in 2004, a debate was held in this House on freedom of information in Italy."
"We passed a resolution in which the proponents declared themselves to be alarmed by the situation in my country."
"There was a centre-right government, and there was a Prime Minister: Silvio Berlusconi."
"Following the victory of the left in 2006, the problem miraculously disappeared."
"There were no more of the dramatic debates within the European Parliament, no more of the international warnings and no more of the collecting of signatures so dear to champagne socialists."
"Suddenly, however, after yet another electoral win by Mr Berlusconi, the danger to the free movement of ideas has magically returned."
"In short, when the centre-right governs, the press is at risk, and when the centre-left governs, there are no problems."
"It is a pity, however, that the percentage of civil and criminal actions brought against journalists in my country by exponents of the left, such as Massimo D'Alema and Romano Prodi, is at an all-time high."
"Such sponsors account for up to 68% of these actions."
"Ultimately I wonder whether it is possible for freedom of the press to have been jeopardised by a single request for justice by Mr Berlusconi."
"This may perhaps be explained better than I have explained it by an interview with Mr Cohn-Bendit, which I quote word for word: 'It is absurd to compare Mr Berlusconi to a dictator: there are no prisons for dissidents, he has the support of the majority, and the centre-left has simply lost'."
"Simply lost."
"It is a very serious indignity for our beloved Italy to be subjected to a surreal and farcical debate by a handful of professional disinformers."
"Moreover, this indignity will cost dear, because once again they will lose the support of the Italians, who will vote in even higher numbers than today for Mr Berlusconi, not least because they believe he is committed to fighting for the well-being of Italy."
"You, on the other hand, ladies and gentlemen, seem intent - determined - to destroy our country's image."
"Yet the damage you are doing to Europe is perhaps greater than the damage done to Italy: because what you are offering the public is a caricature of Europe, where you delude yourselves that you are handing out popular mandates with the aim not of upholding people's rights, but of turning reality on its head in a Stalinist style that is today paradoxically characteristic of the exponents of a group that calls itself liberal."
"Indeed deny if you can - ladies and gentlemen from Antonio Di Pietro's party - that you are communists."
"Your history follows you and it is the history of those who have never given up using lies as a way of branding their political opponent as dangerous."
"However, the real threat to democracy is created by those who seek to take our future away from us by refusing to accept the verdict of free elections and conjuring up ghosts."
"We will not relinquish that future; thus, we will fight during this parliamentary term to prevent the European project, in which we passionately believe, from being distorted by the confusion between freedom of expression and misrepresentation, and between justice and the manipulation of powers."
"Know this, would-be liberals: you will not weaken our determination to contribute to the common good..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Mauro something."
"In preparing this debate, I spoke with him a number of times."
"He was in my office yesterday, and we have a very, very cooperative relationship."
"That is why I feel able to ask the following questions without a surge of emotions."
"Can you imagine that the reason for the complex debate in Italy is that Italy is, to my knowledge, the only democratic state in which the largest media operator is also the Head of Government?"
"Could it be that this combination of interests is precisely the reason that we are having this debate?"
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, I am most grateful to Mr Schulz."
"I would stress that, if there is one debate that we will not only not evade but would also happily take part in, so that we can also discuss the role played by Mr Murdoch, for example, it is the debate on media concentration in Europe."
"And, above all, of course, we want to ensure that this debate is not used deliberately to attack one country."
"Obviously I must stress that I have willingly responded to Mr Schulz, because I consider him to be Silvio Berlusconi's most important political creation."
"Mr President, as expressed by Martin Schulz just now, from the perspective of the Socialist and Democrat Group, this is a debate which is not just about Italy."
"I, too, am not an Italian speaker."
"Our group feels that media pluralism is not just an Italian issue."
"All Member States are involved, and all Member States of the European Union should guarantee these principles of media pluralism."
"This House has long been asking the Commission to take action to guarantee pluralism of the media."
"The Commission is committed to putting into place a three-step approach to define the indicators of pluralism, including a working document, an independent study and a communication."
"Commissioner Reding has not mentioned that two of these steps have already been taken."
"Within our group, we are waiting impatiently for the third step, a communication on pluralism, and for a set of legislative measures capable of guaranteeing this principle across the Union - across the whole of the Union and not just in Italy."
"Indeed, our perspective is based on the fact that the European Union has not only been an economic and monetary union, or a loose coalition of Member States, but a collection of values also."
"It is incredibly important in this debate to restate that perspective."
"One of these rights - freedom of information, defined by the EU Charter as the right to receive and communicate information without interference from public authorities - is vital."
"For Italy, and the particular position expressed by David Sassoli from my group, this is a genuine concern; but the wider concern for the European Union is a challenge for our group: for all Members, including those Members from Italy."
"This is an unprecedented situation in Italy, but it could be a dangerous situation for the whole of the European Union, and that is the perspective of our group."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to address the Commissioner, who maintained that it is not the job of this Parliament to resolve certain issues."
"I would point out, however, that it is the job of this Parliament to ensure that the Treaty and the Member States' constitutions are respected."
"A few months ago, the Italian Minister for Justice declared that he had arranged for the imminent closure of some parts of YouTube and the Internet."
"I would point out that only in China do such things happen."
"Article 21 of the Italian Constitution decrees that the press may not be subject to authorisation or censorship."
"As other Members have already confirmed, Italy is the only country in which the Head of Government has a monopoly on public, and now also private, television channels and in which, unfortunately, a law is being passed that will, in fact, prevent journalists from publishing even judicial reports."
"This is because, were they to be published, Italians would probably learn about Mr Berlusconi's part in the 1992 massacres, Mafia massacres in which Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino died."
"(The President called for order)"
"Mr President, I would ask you to ensure that we have order in this House, since we are not at a market."
"Mr President, in my opinion, freedom of the press in a country can only be properly assessed by considering every aspect of the question."
"This should include a thorough analysis of the markets, including the advertising markets, and of the habits of the population, like the average time spent watching TV, distribution of the printed press and levels of literacy, etc. We would notice certain spectacular differences in those factors in Italy compared to many other Member States."
"As long as these outstanding differences, for example, concentration of media ownership and party political power over the public media, are not openly discussed, the Italian pattern will insidiously convince many people."
"I would like to compare it to a virus - not dangerous enough to kill the bearer, but definitely weakening him and with the potential to infect others."
"Members of the European Parliament present should know that in Estonia, one centre-left party has recklessly followed the current Italian model by concentrating all public and private resources under the party's command and spreading unilateral messages all over the capital city of Tallinn."
"I would have nothing against a European discussion on that issue here as well."
"That is why, unlike the PPE Group, I believe it is time to discuss the freedom of the press and to adopt a resolution."
"The resulting resolution should not be considered some kind of settling of scores between political parties in one or other Member State but rather should be viewed as an opportunity to promote the values on which our Union is based."
"(IT) Mr President, I have held up my card three times now, and you have not given me the floor, whereas you have given it to Mr Schulz."
"I shall therefore now address my question to the speaker and to all those who have taken the floor, irrespective of their political group: have they enquired as to whether the centre-left governments have ever issued a law that could prevent the concentration of the mass media in the hands of Prime Minister Berlusconi?"
"That is an interesting question."
"It takes historical research: have the centre-left governments done anything about it?"
"In my speech, I pointed out that the centre-left party is doing the same as Mr Berlusconi is doing in Italy, so the debate is about Europe, about freedom of speech and about threats to freedom of speech from either side - left or right."
"That is my opinion."
"I would like to inform Mr Salatto that unfortunately, I cannot give the floor to everyone who wishes to put a blue-card question."
"It would make the debate overrun."
"I am sorry."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I really heard everything being thrown at the Italian Prime Minister except for the fact that, thanks to his entrepreneurial activities, he provides jobs for tens of thousands of people."
"Excuse me if that seems a negligible factor at a time like this."
"Those who maintain that there is no freedom or plurality of information in Italy are lying, and they know it."
"I invite you, ladies and gentlemen - not just the Italians among you, but the others too - to study the articles published, in any given month in 2009, in the three main national newspapers: Il Corriere, La Stampa and La Repubblica."
"You will thus be able to realise that, depending on the month, 60-70% of those articles are against both the majority government and the ministers that make up the government."
"The percentage of articles that were negative towards the government and, in this case, Minister Maroni, in the month after the adoption of the security package, rose to 80%."
"As far as television is concerned, I invite you to watch the programmes by Giovanni Floris, Michele Santoro and Fabio Fazio: only then will you be in a position to vote on this resolution."
"(NL) Mr President, I see that, fortunately, I am not the only one who very much questions this rather absurd initiative, the apparent purpose of which is to brand Italy a country where freedom of information is fundamentally under threat."
"Evidently, the socialists have quite a few problems with there being at least one European Member State where the politically correct left does not yet control all the newspapers and all the media."
"Berlusconi's Italy - and I am choosing my words carefully, as I have no dealings with the man - is a model of freedom, freedom of expression and press diversity compared to many other European countries."
"Our fellow Member, Mr Verhofstadt, who has just launched a merciless attack on Mr Berlusconi in this House, is famous, or rather infamous, in his own country - my country - for his threats and personal intervention when journalists criticised his government; and this just recently."
"He is probably the very last person who should be speaking about this."
"What I should have liked to see from the Commission was an initiative to restore freedom of expression and information in all European Member States wherever these are under very real threat from freedom-killing legislation, often on the pretext of supposedly combating racism."
"Or how about a Commission initiative when, for example - as also happened just recently - a Dutch politician cannot even obtain permission to enter another European Member State, the United Kingdom."
"I could also cite the very recent example of my own country where my party, Vlaams Belang, the second largest party in Flanders, suffers discrimination at the hands of the taxpayer-funded public broadcaster; discrimination that, just recently, was described as electoral misrepresentation by Belgium's highest legal body, the State Council."
"It is true that there are many problems with freedom of information in Europe but they are, by no means, all taking place in Berlusconi's Italy; the reverse is true."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of Mr Mauro's persuasive speech, suddenly even Mr Schulz has conceded that it would be a good thing for us to talk about Europe as a whole now."
"Alas, the title of today's debate is Italy."
"I can absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about Europe as a whole."
"If, for example, I were to look at the media interests of Germany's Social Democrats, I would observe that they own 90% of the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau and that the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) owns 57% of the Neue Westfälische newspaper and holds an interest in the WAZ media group."
"The largest source of income for the SPD today is its media interests."
"I can therefore absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about ownership in other cases, but instead only want to discuss Italy."
"This debate is fizzling out because of the situation in Italy and the positive statements that we are hearing."
"I am not Italian, as you can tell when I speak, but the most convincing argument that comes to my mind is the question of what was the matter between 2006 and 2008 when Italy had a leftist government and, of course, at that time - as Mr Mauro has pointed out - everything was fine and dandy."
"There were no legislative proposals tabled by the then government to finally end the concentration of the media, though the power was there."
"Today, when there is once again a clear majority for the conservative parties in Italy, there are suddenly problems again."
"This debate must not give way to dishonesty."
"As long as the socialists, the leftists in this House, no longer have arguments to back us into a corner, I can very happily carry on with this debate!"
"(ES) Mr President, Mrs Reding, this debate can have only one purpose: sending a powerful political message in favour of freedom of expression and its quality assurance check, which is pluralism of information."
"It is also important to send the message through Europe, and therefore at European level."
"I agree with those who have stressed the fact that freedom of expression and pluralism of information are fundamental foundations of the European project and that they are never permanently conquered or confirmed."
"Quite the reverse: they are permanently under threat, and the threats come not only from politics, that is, from authoritarianism or populism, or from the retreat from or the denial of freedom and pluralism within the scope of politics, but also from the market, from market concentrations, distortions and abuses."
"I therefore believe that this debate is not a matter for just one country, but that it has a European dimension, because it is at the European level that a process of transformation of democracy is occurring."
"While democracy was representative when universal suffrage was brought in, making all persons equal - one person, one vote - in the communications market we are not all equal, because we do not all have equal access to radio discussion shows, television debates, columns in the press or editorial comment in the communication media."
"We cannot therefore all participate equally in constructing the social framework that, nonetheless, democratically, belongs to us all equally across Europe."
"That is why this debate is important, to remind you that this year, in 2009, the Commission made a commitment to present before this Parliament a communication to evaluate the possible Europe-wide threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information, and to call attention to the importance of drafting a directive guaranteeing pluralism of information in terms of the new technologies and, in particular, in terms of television."
"It is very important that this debate should take place in Europe, since it is clear that there are many countries in the European Union that cannot tackle this debate by themselves with every guarantee that it will be conducted properly."
"If we work from the European Parliament, and on a European scale, we will be sending a strong message of commitment concerning the permanency and survival of freedom of expression within pluralism of information in the 21st century."
"(IT) Madam President, I will try to be brief."
"Italy is truly a champion of liberty, indeed of libertinage - so to speak - as one can infer from reading its newspapers, which Mr Berlusconi wants to gag, which he is suing because they reveal, among other things, his personal relationships, through which channel he also chooses political candidates."
"His women who visit him are paid either with money or with promises that they will stand for office."
"The situation is this: Mr Berlusconi controls the Italian media."
"It is true, there are no laws against freedom of the press - as yet."
"Mr Berlusconi is preparing to introduce them."
"Only recently, we abolished the Alfano law, which was invented by Mr Berlusconi to protect himself from the courts and from all the proceedings currently under way."
"This is the situation in which we therefore find ourselves."
"Is it right to ask Europe to deal with this problem?"
"Definitely, because we in Italy are not dealing with it."
"We are asking Europe to intervene on humanitarian grounds to solve the problem of freedom of the press in Italy."
"This is what we want you to do, and we believe that it is important for Europe also, if we do not want the virus to spread all too quickly here as well."
"(IT) Madam President, this has not been a thrilling day for the European Parliament; it has been wasted on a pointless debate, when we all know that there is no country in Europe that has more freedom of expression and of information than ours does."
"However, when the left governed Italy and a party such as mine, despite being represented in the Italian Parliament, the Senate and the European Parliament, enjoyed 0.1% of the airtime during television news broadcasts, you, Mr Sassoli - you worked on those television news programmes - did not rend your garments or demonstrate in the streets, let alone give up your handsome salary from RAI."
"You champions of freedom of the press against censorship!"
"We heard the Belgians: but does the Vlaams Belang party, in Belgium, enjoy this freedom of the press, this breadth of information, or is it censored as we ourselves were?"
"In Italy, they censored even the good Mr Pannella and they all kept quiet - you on the left included."
"He had to go on a hunger strike: what fine freedom fighters!"
"The Soviet Union of journalists."
"What freedom does the Italian Press Federation grant to the minority?"
"They have to be silent, they have no column inches or airtime."
"What fine freedom fighters!"
"I am sorry, but those of you who are brave enough, go and carry out those demonstrations chaining yourselves together in Beijing, Cuba and Tehran, where people die for the sake of press freedom!"
"Shame on you, cowards!"
"Go to Tehran, go to Tehran, cowards, cowards, cowards, cowards!"
"Long live freedom, long live our free and democratic country..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to rationalise an apparently ambiguous feeling that I have after this first stage of the debate, because I fully subscribe to the strong words spoken by my chairman, Mr Daul, but I also subscribe to the words of Mr Sassoli who should, by all rights, be a political opponent of mine."
"Let me explain myself better: am I schizophrenic for having such ambivalent feelings, or am I trying unnecessarily to reconcile the fact that, in Italy, I sit on the opposition benches while, here, I find myself next to the People of Freedom party, in the People's Party?"
"I feel I can answer that by highlighting an obvious contrast between the scope and the importance of the subject of freedom of information, which is a very important subject..."
"Were Montesquieu alive today, he would have spoken not only of legislative, executive and judicial powers, but of other powers too, and he would have put the fourth power, the press, in first place, as it represents a problem of freedom, of the fight against mental slavery, and a problem of democracy."
"On the other hand, the straw that broke the camel's back after months and months of barbarisation of the entire Italian press - let it be said - of the right and of the left; the quality of the Italian press has been poor for months now because politics really has reached a low point - was Mr Berlusconi's legal action."
"Please indulge me: I was a criminal judge for four years in the Fifth criminal division of the Court of Cassation, where we judged the crime of libel."
"This is how I know Mr Mauro is right: I saw many of these actions for libel, and no one protested."
"Citizens have the right to defend themselves in these situations too."
"I therefore hope that, by making a genuine attempt to reconcile seemingly opposing points, we will actually come up with a new and better way of tackling the problem for the whole of Europe and not just in regard to Italy."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, people who seek to label as anti-Italian, subversive and communist anyone who calls for a set of rules on communication and freedom of information that respects pluralism, and which is characterised by a clear separation between the fortunes of those who assume important institutional responsibilities and the wealth they derive from entrepreneurial activities in the publishing and information fields, are making a serious mistake, which must not be forgiven, justified or allowed here in Europe."
"Not once in our speeches have we mentioned the Italian Prime Minister."
"We could have referred to the number of newspapers he owns: 150 in Italy; and around 40 television channels."
"That is not the problem, however."
"The problem is that pluralism of information - and in information - is a cornerstone of every free democracy and must be used as a defence against every monopolistic and oligopolistic philosophy and against conflicts of interest."
"The sovereignty of each State, the reaffirmation that the European Union is not a superstate, Commissioner Reding, must not make us forget that the European Union also has a Charter of Fundamental Rights from which stems a legislative system that the Member States cannot ignore."
"You know that, on these very issues, many times the Court of Justice - in the case of Italy, not on issues to do with the system, Mr Speroni - has passed sentences that are still to be carried out."
"Globalisation of the markets and the ever-increasing use of the airwaves now require more targeted European legislation to regulate this sensitive matter, which has such a strong influence on public opinion and therefore also on the principle of popular sovereignty - which underpins the European Union and not just the Italian Republic - and on the ways in which this principle is exercised."
"It should no longer be possible for anyone to invoke the sacrosanct rights of the popular majority to justify threats to freedom of the press in what was, until recently, a situation of disparity between the plaintiff and the defendant - whether in Italy or in Portugal, as we were reminded earlier - because this undermines the foundations of the rules of coexistence on which the Union is based."
"This is why there is an urgent need for a directive against concentrations in the field of information that will regulate the dealings of those who are involved in politics and, at the same time, control very important media."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like quickly to point out that the subject of this debate - and the speeches by Mrs Reding and Mr Daul have clearly shown this - is our idea of Europe."
"It is not a Member State that we are targeting; it is the question of knowing whether we are applying the treaties, whether we are applying the European Convention on Human Rights signed in Rome in 1950, and whether we are applying Article 6 of the Treaty."
"Mr Daul, when you quote Mr Napolitano, quote him in full."
"The President of the Italian Republic pointed out that legal remedies existed and mentioned, in his speech, Article 7 of the treaties."
"This article enables us today, legally, without emotion, to address the issue of the risk of a violation of human rights within a Member State - Italy today, another country tomorrow."
"The final very important point is that, in every country in the world, dictators and people who want to undermine human rights hide behind sovereignty."
"For me, Europe is the continent of the universality of human rights."
"If we fail to admit that we, who sit in the same Parliament, have the right, the duty to see what is happening in one of the Member States, how can we tell dictatorships in distant countries that we defend a universal idea, which is so very important for the defence of women's rights, in particular?"
"(IT) Madam President, it is strange that, when we talk in this House about freedom of expression in Italy, we continually exceed the speaking time, and thus indirectly censor the next speaker."
"I shall therefore try to keep strictly to the speaking time allocated to me."
"I have to say that I would consider it far more appropriate to hold this debate in the Italian Parliament than in the Parliament of Brussels, unless - as someone has already stated - it were our intention to debate freedom of the press in general, that is, within the context of the European continent."
"Leaving opinions aside, however, I believe that it is worth mentioning some data already presented previously by Mr Speroni and on which we should reflect."
"I can confirm that, of 455 sentences handed down by the European Court of Human Rights for infringement of Article 10 on freedom of expression, 29 relate to France, 28 to the United Kingdom, 15 to Greece, 10 to Romania, 8 to Poland and only 7 to Italy."
"I would ask you to reflect on this data."
"(MT) I do not blame anyone who is following this debate for thinking that this is not the European Parliament, but the Italian Parliament."
"Yet this is not the Italian Parliament and therefore it is not the right place to carry out these essentially national political debates."
"We are all aware of the Italian Prime Minister's colourful character."
"However, this is not the issue here."
"The issue is whether we, as a European institution, have the competence to take decisions in these matters."
"The answer to that is clear."
"Commissioner Reding gave it to us today, when she said that these issues did not fall under European competence and that we cannot assume a role that is not ours to take on."
"Therefore, since this issue does not fall under our competence, it must be discussed and decided upon on at national level."
"If we take on powers that do not belong to us, and if we interfere in issues that do not fall under our competence, then we will be undermining rather than strengthening our legitimacy."
"We would be undermining the institution that we represent and we would be widening, rather than closing, the distance between us and our citizens."
"If we want to gain the respect of our citizens, then we have to begin by respecting the limits of our competences."
"(ES) Madam President, the European Union has a duty to guarantee the pluralism of the media."
"The debate on freedom of the press concerns the pluralism of ownership of communication media, their structure and procedures for the appointment of their heads, relations between politics, business and the media themselves, and access for citizens to different opinions."
"I believe that you will agree with me that the situation of the media in Italy, which is the issue concerning us today, does not fulfil the basic rules required to guarantee freedom of the press in that country."
"We therefore ask the Commission to respond to the requests made by this Parliament in recent years and to put forward a definition of specific criteria to evaluate possible infringements of those rights and freedoms in each of the Member States."
"Our aim, let there be no doubt about it, is to protect citizens' rights to receive information of different kinds, just as journalists have the right to report freely because, as the demonstrators said last Saturday, information gives us more freedom."
"Madam President, it is surely not a coincidence that last week, the British Conservatives won the support of Rupert Murdoch and yesterday they voted to suppress this debate on press freedom."
"While the new ex-Communist Member States have made great progress towards a free press, the media domination enjoyed by Silvio Berlusconi would have made Erich Honecker green with envy."
"But the threats, intimidation and abuse that Berlusconi is directing not only at the press but also at the President and judges go far beyond a purely national issue: this is a major European concern."
"Commissioner Reding very strangely said that we should not use the EU institutions to solve national problems."
"So why do we have any European treaties and laws, including those on the requirement of fundamental rights and the rule of law?"
"There is, in fact, a clear legal competence for the EU to act to uphold freedom of expression and fundamental rights in general."
"That legal basis exists and must be complemented by legislation on media diversity and pluralism."
"The passivity of the Commissioner is deeply disappointing."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Italy Article 21 of the Constitution and Article 3 of Law No 102 of 2004 define the scope of press freedom and set its limits: the press must be objective, thorough, fair and impartial, always safeguarding human dignity, in line with the principles laid down by the European Union."
"In the Internet and digital age, in which new newspapers continue to be launched, the public service is showcasing programmes that are openly hostile to the Head of Government, while the press and the media are horrified by the action for damages being brought by Silvio Berlusconi against two newspapers."
"In reality, 1 100 radio stations, 162 newspapers and several hundred private television stations would not be enough to guarantee the plurality of the media, which are supposedly threatened by Silvio Berlusconi's initiative."
"One is left with the suspicion that once a particular media power becomes censorial, it has ambitions to become a political power itself."
"In other parts of the world, in the meantime, the same system is in operation as influential newspapers such as El País, The Sun and Tarin seem to be quickly changing their political stripe."
"Yet the Italian left, rather than adopting its own political strategy, is relying on elements of the national federation of journalists to exhibit the most disloyal and obstinate anti-democratic assault on the government in office - through a series of orchestrated actions on this occasion."
"Nonetheless, the citizens continue to be highly supportive of the Prime Minister, who was freely chosen by the Italian population, and trust that the European Parliament will be able to confirm - as it did in 2004 - that freedom of the press is a recognised and well-established asset."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not my intention, nor that of my group - which supported and wanted this debate - to transfer Italian internal political diatribes to the European domain."
"The issue of freedom of information concerns us all: it concerns the European Union, which can and must regulate the matter at Community level, so as to resist political and economic conditioning and to guarantee true pluralism of information."
"The Italian anomaly, where the Prime Minister is also the owner of some of the most important private networks, lies precisely in the existence of a dangerous link between the media and political and economic powers."
"It is precisely for this reason that we are calling for a European legislative measure, a measure that - far from being an anti-Italian act - will help to safeguard pluralism of information, preventing concentrations and conflicts of interest."
"We therefore call on the Commission today to intervene as quickly as possible - as this Parliament has already requested in the past - in order to equip the European Union with common rules for safeguarding freedom of information for all European citizens."
"Madam President, I have to confess I was rather shocked by the statement of Commissioner Reding because, indeed, the Member States are primarily responsible for ensuring respect for democracy and fundamental rights."
"But you are wrong if you say that the EU has no role to play here."
"First of all, there is Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which reads: 'The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States.'"
"And to prove that that was not just a hollow statement, the European Union furnished itself with Article 7 - the legal instrument to enforce Article 6."
"Secondly, Mrs Reding, when we are negotiating with candidate states, we insist that they apply the highest standards of press freedom, otherwise they cannot join the European Union."
"This demand has been laid down in the Copenhagen criteria - so why do we apply different standards to candidate states from those applied to current Member States, Commissioner Reding?"
"There are other countries where there are violations of press freedom or freedom of speech, such as the Czech Republic, which has just passed a law restricting the freedom of the press, or Ireland, which has passed a draconian blasphemy law."
"Commissioner Reding, I conclude by saying that if we are serious about being a Community of values, then the European Commission needs to act."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we heard Mr Verhofstadt telling us an hour ago that we must join together to protect the values of freedom, and I have to tell you that I agree with him."
"Freedom of speech is an important fundamental right."
"This has been the view voiced in the debate so far."
"I also agree and firmly believe that there is not a single Italian politician in the Chamber who would wish to restrict the freedom of speech."
"While listening to the debate, two questions occurred to me."
"Why do socialist and liberal MEPs feel it is important to protect certain fundamental political rights only in the case of certain rights and only on certain occasions?"
"Is the right to free assembly an important fundamental right?"
"Is it as important a fundamental right as freedom of speech?"
"It certainly is."
"Yet, three years ago, you made no protests when the socialist government in Hungary broke up a crowd which had gathered to celebrate the 1956 revolution."
"Is the right to use your own language an important fundamental right?"
"Is it as important a fundamental right as freedom of speech?"
"It certainly is important."
"Yet once again, you make no protest when the authorities in Slovakia, a European Union Member State, want to limit the right of minorities to use their own language."
"Is the protection of personal privacy an important fundamental right?"
"It definitely is an important fundamental right."
"I believe that everyone - be it the Italian Prime Minister or anyone else - has the right and must have the right to bring legal proceedings against false accusations and slander."
"Freedom of the press is indeed an important right, but why have you kept quiet for the last 20 years when it was obvious that in the former socialist countries, the media was concentrated, to a very large extent, in the hands of the former Communist parties?"
"All I ask of you is not to employ double standards."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am aware that, on 30 September, the Commission presented a study on the indicators of media pluralism in the Member States."
"However, in 2008, this House adopted a report by Marianne Mikko in which the European Commission and the Member States were asked to safeguard, and I quote verbatim, 'the multiplicity of opinions in the media, to guarantee the pluralism of information, to ensure that all EU citizens can access free and diversified media'."
"Even earlier, in 2004, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on the risks of violation, in the EU, of freedom of expression and information."
"In this report, the Commission was asked to submit a communication on the safeguarding of media pluralism in all the Member States."
"To date, the Commission has still not given clear responses to Parliament's requests."
"You will notice, Commissioner, that I have mentioned neither my country nor its Prime Minister."
"However, I, as a European citizen, am asking you in this House what the Commission intends to do at European level to ensure that media pluralism is guaranteed in all the Member States."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion against the alleged attack on press freedom in Italy reflects the choice, I feel, of a politically oblique and unsound path."
"Moreover, some of the strong words, tinged with anger and a touch of hatred, seem to me to have clearly got out of hand."
"It is very strange, however, that this decline (or alleged decline) in democracy in Italy should arise only now and in such a striking fashion, given that the centre-right, but also the centre-left, governments - of which I too have been part - have taken turns in governing my country."
"If this wall of illiberality and anti-democracy really does exist in Italy, why, in so many years of left-wing government, has it never been brought down?"
"Are we talking about negligence, reticence, convenience, or - as seems far more logical to me - the simple observation that Italy's standards of democracy are in line with those of the West and of Europe?"
"If we really do want, as an exceptional measure - such as the one, I apologise to Mrs Serracchiani, used in this case, namely that of discussing one country and not Europe - to ascertain the truth about the health of democracy within our country, then we should ask the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, respectfully as an institution, whether he feels that he is the President of a country in which pluralism of information is floundering, freedom is in a tailspin and the tide of democracy is going out."
"However, I do not believe that, were the situation thus, President Napolitano would refrain from denouncing such a state of affairs, faithful as he is to his prerogatives as guarantor of our Constitution."
"Since the issue does, however - ladies and gentlemen of the left, and I am sorry to say it - touch on Italian political matters in a very provincial way, taking on an artificially European, and now domestic, dimension, it must be pointed out that, as long as the Italian left, which was once so much more powerful and substantial, allows itself to be led politically by comedians and demagogues, it will become increasingly distanced from power."
"I do not believe that Woody Allen dictates to President Obama the line he should take."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, as a former journalist, I too never imagined that today, 50 years after we started building Europe and shortly before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, we would be debating certain basic principles and values on which the European Union has been built and founded."
"Values such as independence of the press, pluralism of the media, freedom of speech for everyone, especially journalists, equality for everyone before the law or even, if you like, the basic principle of the division of powers."
"Is there division of powers when the Prime Minister of a country, in other words, the highest executive authority, holds and controls most of the media in his country and prosecutes the rest?"
"What is happening in Italy is not an Italian issue, it is a European issue, because the very credibility of the European Union is at risk when it controls and judges infringements of fundamental principles and rights in third countries and tolerates infringement of those same values and principles in its own back yard."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many of you will have read 'The Trial' by Kafka: it is a fictional work but it is what is happening today in my country, a country of great democratic traditions, with a government elected by the sovereign people, but in which an attempt is being made to undermine the democratic vote with an historically unprecedented attack by the media and the courts."
"We are debating freedom of information, when 72% of the press is against the government and Prime Minister Berlusconi."
"70% of the legal actions brought against the newspapers were brought by the leaders of the left, with an alleged claim for damages amounting to EUR 312 million of the EUR 486 million in total that has been claimed since 1994."
"That equates to EUR 32 million per year."
"This amounts to a form of additional financing through the courts."
"To you, ladies and gentlemen, who represent Europe's democracies, we say and we maintain that, in Italy, the power of the courts and the media is crushing the will of the sovereign people in the name of partisan, class-related political interests."
"Democracy in Italy is therefore at risk if the government is brought down."
"The main person to subvert this concept, from a semantic point of view, is called Antonio Di Pietro."
"To conclude, I would like to thank Commissioner Reding for her great sense of balance and democracy; she has drafted an intelligent and accurate report."
"(RO) Freedom of the press is never given adequate protection against abuse."
"Every time a State President or Prime Minister of a European Union Member State attacks journalists, even if only because they disagree with them, the European Commission, European Parliament and everyone of us must respond."
"In Italy a Prime Minister is attempting to intimidate the opposition press by every means available."
"In Romania, a president is attempting to discredit the press and journalists criticising him."
"In both cases, we are talking about excesses from certain politicians who regard themselves as being above the law."
"In Romania we have, according to the latest information, a president who not only insults, deceives and slanders journalists, but who also commits other abuses of authority which, on the eve of the presidential elections, seems to be used for any purpose, including breaking the law, in order to help himself, as the current Head of State, gain re-election."
"This is exactly why I am calling on the European Commission, just as I did on 23 September, to publicly condemn this behaviour from both the President of Romania and the Italian Prime Minister."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to confirm that, in Italy, freedom of the press does exist and is stronger than ever."
"Those are the words of a great journalist, Giampaolo Pansa, who, for many years, for decades, was one of the most prestigious names writing for the newspaper La Repubblica, part of the Espresso-Repubblica group, from which he subsequently had to resign because the group's management accused him of revisionism, which in Italy, as you know, is one of the most serious crimes by far, when it is perpetrated by the dominant intelligentsia, by the dominant culture in Italy, which is completely left-wing: just look at the primaries of the Democratic Party, where everyone from bankers to all of the most important actors, directors and journalists from our country stand in line."
"However, freedom of information does not mean freedom to insult or to defame; except that the right to a fair hearing is always granted to the left: if Mr Prodi sues, it is okay; if Mr D'Alema sues, it is okay; if Mr Di Pietro sues, it is okay."
"Mr Di Pietro is the record-breaker - incidentally, the judiciary sues the press more than politicians do - as, according to information published in La Repubblica, he has filed 357 complaints, and has already received EUR 700 000 in damages."
"We have heard the information supplied by our fellow Members."
"To conclude, if there is a realignment problem - and I believe that this problem exists in Italy - the only political party that has the right to invoke it is the centre-right."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2008, the Berlusconi Government granted a total of EUR 206 million in direct contributions to the press and to radio and television stations."
"As luck would have it, most of those millions went to the four main left-wing newspapers."
"Freedom of the press in Italy has, in the Berlusconi Government, the most generous of backers."
"The left, in Italy and throughout Europe, has launched a campaign claiming that freedom of the press is under threat, a campaign based on scandalous fabrications and brazen lies."
"And, inevitably - as luck would have it here too - it launched this campaign only after Prime Minister Berlusconi had made a legitimate claim for compensation from two left-wing newspapers that had defamed him, accusing him of disgraceful behaviour, accusations based on complete fabrications that are beneath any form of journalism worth its salt."
"Prime Minister Berlusconi is the first to say that freedom of the press is very important, but the freedom to insult, to deceive, to defame and to slander is something altogether different."
"In this case, every citizen - including, therefore, Prime Minister Berlusconi - has the right to be able to defend himself using the democratic means at his disposal, by asking a civil court to consider the attacks made against him in writing, something which, I would add, other leaders of the left have also done."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not only a debate among Italians: this debate is, first and foremost, about Europe."
"(RO) Mr Berlusconi is certainly not the only example of someone breaching the basic regulations governing the mass media."
"Traian Băsescu frequently behaves in an aggressive, undemocratic manner and intimidates the mass media by using language which I cannot repeat here in the European Parliament."
"The European Charter on Freedom of the Press will just become another nice piece of paper if Europe's Heads of State or Government want to carry on behaving in this way."
"We, the European Union, will be made to look a laughing stock, analysing and criticising the freedom of information in various countries in Asia and Africa, while these freedoms are not protected and respected in the European Union."
"I therefore propose combating this monopoly situation with the means provided by and the authority of the Commission, along with the enforcement of the Charter on Freedom of the Press, backed up by European authority."
"(SV) Mr President, a long time ago, the well-known Swedish writer August Strindberg said: 'You have power, I have words, I have words in my power.'"
"However, this is not the case today for the writers and journalists in Italy who are systematically denied the right to express themselves freely."
"Over the last three years, 200 journalists have been threatened on account of what they have written."
"What happens in Italy concerns us all, however."
"The freedom to speak, write and to have your words published freely is a fundamental right of all 500 million European citizens."
"What is happening in Italy shows that the freedom of speech is sometimes more dangerous than weapons to a regime that seizes power over the freedom of speech."
"Today, Parliament has a unique opportunity to bring out and reveal our most positive attributes."
"Here we are showing that fundamental freedoms are at stake."
"Italy's concerns are also our own."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate really is incredible, because in Italy freedom of information is a guaranteed and recognised constitutional right."
"Others before me have provided information on the number and the political bias of the newspapers published in Italy."
"For the benefit of the non-Italian Members, I will take the liberty of doing a press review."
"These are some of the independent newspapers that I bought yesterday at the airport: this is Il Manifesto, a communist newspaper; this is L'Unità, a newspaper founded by Antonio Gramsci, of the Democratic Party-Democratic Party of the Left; and this is L'Europa, the newspaper of the Margherita party, which has joined the Democratic Party."
"Then, the Democratic Party also has a D'Alema-Letta faction, which has its own newspaper, Il Riformista."
"Then there is the Refoundation Party, which has its own newspaper, Liberazione."
"Last year Refoundation split, and the breakaway party founded its own newspaper, L'Altro."
"Lastly, there is the political subject of this debate: Il Fatto quotidiano."
"Do you know to whom this newspaper refers?"
"It refers to Mr Di Pietro's party, which is the driving force behind this debate today."
"This is a party that is asserting in this House that there is no freedom of information, when it founded a newspaper ten days ago in Italy."
"To conclude, Madam President, it is as though I were here telling you that in Italy there is famine and hunger, when last weekend, I was in my country at the sausage festival eating roast meat and drinking wine."
"This is the paradox of a left that owns so many newspapers but has no readers or votes."
"It will have to come up with more serious arguments if it wants to win them back."
"Madam President, I too would like to join the calls for a European directive on freedom of information, freedom of the press and media pluralism."
"Although this has been a debate about freedom of information in Italy, as other speakers have said, there are serious issues in other countries in the European Union."
"One of these is the United Kingdom."
"Rupert Murdoch has already been mentioned, and one of the reasons I believe we need this directive is because of Rupert Murdoch."
"Rupert Murdoch is not a Head of State but he is an international media mogul with his own very particular agenda."
"He is not democratic and we need to legislate for the likes of Rupert Murdoch as well as for the likes of Silvio Berlusconi."
"(MT) I come from Malta and therefore, as you can imagine, Italy is a neighbouring country we have been following for many years."
"In matters relating to freedom of expression, my country also looks to Italy because it is a clear example of democracy."
"Therefore, to delve into this internal issue, which is what the Italian socialists want, is, in my opinion, a shameful form of politics for their country."
"I would never have thought that the Italians would ever have resorted to attacking their country in this Parliament in such an unjust fashion."
"I think I can understand better why the Italians do not trust the Left to govern in Italy for more than a few months, the reason being that upon analysing this party's policy it becomes clear that it can only suit those who want to attack the very concept of democracy, which is why I believe that they should have heeded the Italian President, and from here I would like to greet him, when he said that this debate has no place within this Parliament, but should be dealt with within the Italian Parliament."
"(BG) Thank you, Madam President."
"I will speak in the language of one of the countries criticised in this chamber today, Bulgaria."
"If I were a journalist in Bulgaria at the moment, as I once was, I would probably choose one of the two diametrically opposed statements made as a heading on the front page of any newspaper."
"One of them is that we must not turn this House into a sounding board, let alone a supreme court of appeal."
"The other one, made by a speaker from the Socialist group, advises us not to treat this House like a museum containing old objects that must not be moved."
"I believe that the truth lies somewhere in between and is reflected in the proposal made by Mr Verhofstadt about drafting a directive which must create a more modern and democratic system for regulating all the matters discussed today on the subject of media freedom and pluralism."
"However, apart from dealing with the issues of pluralism and freedom, and the protection of journalists, this directive must include and place particularly strong emphasis, in actual fact, on the deconcentration of media resources, including within national media systems."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I think that this debate was very important because it made very clear that there is a strong agreement in this House, a strong agreement that the freedom of the press does not have an if or a when, it is the basis of our European Union."
"We have to defend it, it is a fundamental value, we have to speak up when it is not honoured and we have to act if there is a problem to be solved."
"(The President requested silence in the Chamber)"
"There is also an agreement in this House that the freedom of the media is a problem to be looked at in all Member States."
"Many of you have not been in this House before so I will just recall the action of the European journalists to set up a European Charter on Freedom of the Press."
"That was drawn up in order to help mainly the journalists in the new Member States and they had asked for this help from the journalistic community."
"I just want to recall this, because it has been said in this House that there are problems with public television in many of our Member States."
"I recall having gone to one of those Member States - it was Hungary - to reinforce the case for saving public television, and I think that that should be done in all Member States when there is a problem."
"It is for this reason that we have voted in the new Television Without Frontiers Directive, with the help of the Parliament, for the establishment of independent media authorities in all of our Member States."
"I can assure this House that whenever there is a problem in establishing these independent media authorities, the Commission will act."
"Now where there is a disagreement in this House is on how to bring together EU competences with media policies."
"I think that many Members did not hear my introductory statements where I quoted from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is very clear."
"I also quoted Article 51(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which also states very clearly when the charter is to be implemented and the rules for implementing the charter."
"So I think that everybody can read this and recall it."
"Unfortunately, nobody is listening now, although this is very important."
"(The President again requested silence)"
"In my introductory speech, I also underlined the very clear actions, the concrete examples of where the EU can act and has acted, and I underlined the problems which have to be solved at national level."
"The constitutional court of Italy, which acted yesterday, has clearly shown what that means."
"Now there have been several clear demands by this House and I would like to reply to these if the House would permit and listen."
"(The President once more requested silence)"
"There is the demand by this House to go for the media pluralism approach which has been promised."
"The work on media pluralism has already made substantial progress and we have published the second step with the risk indicators on media pluralism."
"Maybe many parliamentarians have not seen these."
"They are on the Internet; they can be looked at and they are a very important element in being able to conduct this objective work on media pluralism which Parliament has called for."
"I must say that I was very disappointed because we had a public workshop on this and not a single parliamentarian turned up to participate in the workshop."
"Well, the risk indicators have been published now and they can be looked at."
"They will be the basis for our future work."
"Second question: why does the Commission not activate Article 7 of the EU Treaty in the case of Italy?"
"First of all, Article 7 is a very exceptional provision."
"So far, it has never been activated by the EU institutions."
"This clause would apply only if there were a complete breakdown of national jurisdictional orders and fundamental rights systems in a given Member State."
"I do not think that we have reached such a situation in any of our Member States."
"But - and it is very interesting - the article states that the European Parliament itself has the possibility to activate Article 7 of the EU Treaty."
"So I call on the European Parliament, if it really thinks there is sufficient proof, to activate Article 7 of the EU Treaty."
"Third question: many parliamentarians from all political parties - and I think there is relative unanimity in this House - have asked for an EU directive on media pluralism and media concentration."
"(The President once more requested silence)"
"This is a fundamental question that has to be discussed in depth."
"You might recall that the European Commission started to work on the draft for such a directive in the 1990s and you will also recall that all Member States, without exception, were against such a directive at that time because it was considered to be outside the competences of the EU."
"Now, maybe the situation has changed today and there will be a large majority of Member States thinking this can enter into the competences of the EU."
"Of course, it would be possible to arrive at such a very generous interpretation of the Treaty, to allow the EU to tackle the matter."
"But, before even starting to think about this, the Commission would need to have the strong support of the whole European Parliament."
"And I would like the European Parliament to identify clearly which internal market problems it wants to be tackled with such a directive."
"You know that I personally am not the kind of Commissioner who has a problem in regulating."
"I have, in the last five years, regulated when it was necessary."
"But to do this we need clear evidence about the questions we want to answer."
"Would legislation solve the problems you all have in mind today?"
"Could we justify it under existing EU competences?"
"Is there a clear cross-border dimension?"
"Is there a clear internal market dimension because - remember - the legislation which we have already put on the table was all on the internal market legal basis."
"All this would need to be clarified before we could start a legislative process."
"So I invite Parliament to discuss this seriously and I invite Parliament to respond to this question in an own-initiative report adopted by a majority of Members."
"Then the Commission will take that a step forward."
"In the meantime, the Commission has done its homework by establishing the risk indicators that will help us to analyse this whole problem in all Member States on an objective basis."
"I think, in the end, that is what the Parliament wants."
"That is also what the other institution wants, because we do not want political usage of our basic freedoms."
"We want these freedoms to be a right; we want these freedoms to be a basic value and to be treated as such."
"(Applause)"
"Commissioner, please accept my apologies on behalf of the House for the noise during your speech in response to the Members' comments."
"(DE) Madam President, before I make my personal observations, I would like to start by raising a point of order."
"I do not believe that any member of the Commission or the Council, or even of this very House, should be expected to address the House in the conditions that Mrs Reding faced just now."
"It is just not acceptable!"
"(Applause)"
"I therefore ask the Bureau to consider how we can bring an end to this dishonourable state of affairs whereby, during the final stages of debates and during ongoing statements, conversations can be held here, such as between Vice-President Vidal-Quadras and his former colleague up there, who are interested in absolutely nothing other than their bilateral relations."
"I do not believe that that is acceptable."
"I would ask the Bureau again to give some consideration to this."
"I would now like to make a comment on something that Mr Weber said."
"Mr Weber addressed me personally in the debate on the freedom of the press in Italy and brought up the media interests of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD)."
"(Uproar)"
"As a Member of this House, but also a member of the executive of my party, I would like to say that I have some sympathy for Mr Weber."
"Anyone who has lost as many votes as the Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria and my party needs to ensure that he attracts attention."
"(Uproar)"
"I would just like to point out that the media interests of the SPD in their present form are the result of the restitution of the German media after its expropriation by the Nazis and by the Communists in the GDR."
"We German Social Democrats are proud of our media interests!"
"(FR) Madam President, I have just one more point to raise, which concerns the whole of Parliament: on Tuesday 18 September, upon leaving the European Parliament at 23.00, Mrs Niebler was brutally attacked; she was thrown to the floor."
"She had her telephone, her money, her credit cards and all her papers stolen."
"What is more serious is that a Belgian restaurant owner came to her aid and called the ambulance and the police."
"Half an hour later, the ambulance arrived to treat Mrs Niebler."
"Very well."
"Half an hour after that, the police were still not there."
"We are still waiting for them."
"I therefore call on the President to intervene here, in Parliament, because this is now the third attack that the police have failed to follow up."
"One's safety is not guaranteed in this city..."
"(Applause)"
"... nor are responses from the authorities."
"I call for very strong intervention from the President of Parliament to obtain a response concerning this attack."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Daul, unfortunately, as you said, there have been episodes of this kind on numerous occasions, and therefore I obviously regard them as unacceptable."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the second October part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"It is extremely difficult for an MEP to see a democracy such as Italy have the finger pointed at it, as this debate is intended to do."
"Freedom of the press is a fundamental freedom enshrined in Article 21 of the Italian Constitution."
"In Italy, there are private and public newspapers reflecting all political tendencies."
"Out of respect for thousands of people who suffer oppression and a lack of free expression in many countries in the world, it is obscene to describe the Italian regime as a freedom-destroying regime."
"Moreover, one of the most fundamental characteristics of any constitutional state is that they offer access to the courts to any citizen who feels wronged."
"Thus, the fact that a Prime Minister of the Republic who has been slandered in national newspapers has chosen the legal route to attack his detractors, and not parallel routes characteristic of undemocratic regimes, confirms the good health of Italian democracy."
"Lastly, it is crucial to point out that the European Parliament must not become a chamber in which contentious national issues that have no connection with Community competences are settled."
"National debates must be settled at national level!"
"Freedom of expression is enshrined among the democratic criteria which we have laid as the foundation of the European Union."
"Every Member State must assume its responsibility and comply with the Copenhagen criteria, including in the political domain."
"However, I believe that the European institutions must not be used, in any manner or form, as a forum for settling internal political disputes."
"We are discussing today matters that relate to the domestic policy of a Member State, as long as it has operational democratic institutions."
"On a personal note, I give my unreserved support to absolute freedom of the press."
"At the same time, this freedom comes with the utmost responsibility for every editorial team to provide the public with correct information."
"Calls have been made in this Chamber for tighter regulations governing the concentration of media ownership and pluralism at Community level."
"However, we must not forget that Member States have voiced their opposition to such a directive because it does not come under the EU's jurisdiction."
"The European Commission has published, nevertheless, a list of media pluralism indicators based on an independent study."
"I believe that it is important for us to give greater importance to these criteria and to use them as a starting point for a future directive in this area."
"It is also important for us to try to find solutions instead of making accusations."
"To declare that freedom of information is denied in Italy is an instrumental and opportunistic offence against one of the West's greatest democracies."
"Freedom of information is denied in those countries in which the dictatorial regimes prevent their subjects from expanding their knowledge of daily events by choosing what they believe to be the most authoritative source."
"The Internet today has the virtue, in traditionally democratic countries such as Italy, of demolishing every political, geographical, economic and social barrier to information."
"In certain countries, however, the Internet is filtered, and many websites, considered anti-government, are banned."
"There, civil rights, such as freedom of expression, of marriage and of demonstration, rights of which we in the West do not even realise the importance any more because we are used to them, are not even vaguely close to the concept of inalienability guaranteed by our Constitution because, quite simply, they do not exist."
"The European Parliament must be a place of growth, of debate and of exchanges of best practice among the Member States."
"It cannot be reduced to an elite theatre set where first-night performances of any old small provincial theatre production are put on free of charge."
"If the debate on freedom of the press, in Europe, must be held at the European Parliament, then so be it, but it should be constructive and worthy of the prestigious institution of which we are proud to be part."
"'Freedom of the press is essential to a democratic society."
"To uphold and protect it, and to respect its diversity and its political, social and cultural missions, is the mandate of all governments.'"
"This is Article 1 of the European Charter on Freedom of the Press."
"Mr Berlusconi seems not only to be defying one of the fundamental values of a democratic society, but also to be using the influence he has to manipulate public opinion."
"In Italy, as well as other countries, a large proportion of newspapers are owned by individuals controlled by certain politicians who lay down management policy for them and from which they cannot deviate."
"In other countries, the government uses taxpayers' money to finance newspapers used for its own benefit."
"In the European Union, which champions democracy and promotes democratic values throughout the world, we must not allow restrictions on freedom of the press."
"This is why I am calling on the European Commission to propose in the near future a directive on freedom of the press, intended, in particular, to limit political interference in the mass media and to prevent any monopoly being established in this area."

"(For the results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"(CS) Madam President, the Czech Republic was among those initiating the submission of the draft Council Framework Decision on prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings, and this shows that the Czech Republic attaches considerable importance to judicial cooperation."
"In view of the sensitivity of the issue, however, it is necessary to ensure that this cooperation operates within the bounds of the authority vested in the European Union by the founding treaty."
"That is happening in this case."
"The weak point, on the other hand, is a relatively pronounced generality, for example, in the absence of deadlines for a response from a requested authority and the lack of criteria for determining the most suitable judicial authority for handling criminal proceedings."
"Another fly in the ointment is the poor integration with Eurojust, which should have been the focus of attention."
"As the body for European cooperation in judicial matters, there is, lying dormant, a far greater potential for Eurojust than the role it has in the draft framework decision, which does not even stipulate a requirement to inform Eurojust when resolving issues of criminal prosecution of cross-border crimes in a single Member State."
"(NL) Madam President, I voted against this report, but not because I oppose the exchange of information between national authorities on criminal proceedings."
"It is a good idea to find out whether there are parallel ongoing proceedings for the same facts in other Member States."
"What I do strongly oppose, however, is the federalist tone of various amendments."
"Take Amendment 3, for example, which explicitly denies each Member State the discretion to decide which authorities are competent to act."
"I am by no means opposed to Eurojust, but it must not turn into a 'super-institution'."
"Madam President, I voted for the resolution."
"I am glad to see that both Europe and the most powerful countries do not underestimate the seriousness of the situation we are all in and are not looking for a 'one size fits all' approach."
"The crisis has been caused by a number of complex and interrelated factors, and there will be no easy way out."
"The global financial crisis also gave us a good opportunity to reconsider our priorities and actions, especially in the long-term management of sustainable economic recovery."
"We have commitments to and expectations from our citizens to get our economies moving again at full speed with a view to ensuring the effective functioning of capital markets and lending, tackling unemployment and creating jobs, and protecting our people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable."
"This is not going to be easy, but I believe that we are moving in the right direction."
"Madam President, we propose very seriously to exacerbate it."
"The cause of the financial crisis was excessive state intervention: first in the sense that interest rates were deliberately kept too low for too long, a political rather than a market decision - one in which all the central banks were complicit - and then in the sense that, as recently as last year, legislatures were urging lenders to make more cheap loans available."
"So the G20 leaders get together and they say 'What is the solution?"
"More state intervention.'"
"I suppose, as Mark Twain once observed, that if all that you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail."
"But the truth is that every action they have taken has, at best, been useless and, at worst, has actively deteriorated our situation: the bail-outs, the nationalisations, the pretence of going after tax havens (by which they in fact mean countries with more competitive tax rates than theirs), and the massive extension of state jurisdiction under the pretext of 'contingency'."
"And now we want to reform the entire financial system."
"I will close with the words of my late countryman Mr Justice Asprey: 'Reform?"
"Aren't things bad enough already?'"
"Madam President, I have two comments on the recent voting on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh."
"I regret, and I think it is deplorable, that there is so little on solving the climate crisis in this resolution and also in the material from the G20 Summit."
"There is also mention of the Tobin tax, which I think might be a new way of financing both development aid and helping developing countries when it comes to climate issues."
"The reason why I did not vote 'yes' to the amendments is because they were phrased in a very old-fashioned way, as though we were having a discussion on the Tobin tax 20 years ago."
"The modern way of discussing whether this is a new financing source for the United Nations aims at something different, and I hope to come back to this in the Chamber later."
"Madam President, I gave my support to this resolution as I believe that it is time for all the players to take their responsibilities and to fulfil their commitments to the developing countries."
"It is true that the global, economic and financial crisis has hit hard even the most developed economies, but we must not forget that it has hit the poorest countries even more."
"We must bear in mind that the developing countries did not cause the crisis, but they are now the ones bearing a heavy burden."
"The implementation of the Millennium Goals is now at serious risk."
"I very much welcome the acknowledgement of the G20 to take collective responsibility and I am expecting to see those promises turning into real actions."
"Madam President, I supported this report because I think that there is a need for a new paradigm in the world - a new paradigm in which we shift from completely money- and profit-centred decision making to human being- and community-centred decision making, and from the logic of competition to the logic of justice."
"I see this report as a seed at least."
"I am not saying that it fully supports the new paradigm, but it at least contains the seeds of a new paradigm, in particular, in paragraph 2, which states: 'Believes that there is an urgent need for radical policy reform to address the systemic causes of the food and financial crisis by putting in place new democratic, transparent regulations for international trade as well as for the international financial system'."
"I do believe, and hope, that we take this very seriously."
"There are fundamental causes of this crisis, and we really need to look at those causes systematically and radically."
"We need a radically new paradigm."
"(ET) Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution."
"The global financial and economic crisis has indeed affected all countries, but it has had a particularly devastating effect on the poorest."
"The crisis has negatively influenced all of their sources of financing, and they are unable to maintain what they have achieved without foreign assistance."
"The crisis has threatened the millennium objectives set for the year 2015."
"Therefore I support the plan to implement, earlier than had been planned, the EUR 8.8 billion of development aid for budget assistance and rapid measures for agricultural financing, and the proposal to allocate EUR 500 million for social welfare expenditures."
"I did not support the articles in this resolution concerning the Tobin tax."
"(ES) Madam President, I voted for the resolution and also for the amendments to bring in the Tobin tax."
"This was on grounds of personal consistency, because back in 2002, when I was a member of the Basque Parliament, it adopted a resolution saying that we considered it necessary to tackle the phenomenon of international capital movements, in accordance with their social and economic impact throughout the world, that we should introduce criteria and mechanisms to provide some mechanisms for monitoring and contributing to human development, to overcoming inequalities between peoples and social sectors, and to environmental balance, and that we had an obligation to set up mechanisms to restrict speculative movements."
"In the same way, we believed that we had a duty to contribute to the development of proposals to deal with the democratic control and the social impact of international capital movements."
"We also laid down and approved the need to establish urgently the so-called 'Tobin tax', which is a tax on international financial transactions earmarked for development aid, as well as to establish democratic mechanisms for regulating the international system."
"Several years have now passed since the Basque Parliament adopted that decision, and I am pleased that the European Parliament has adopted a resolution that takes the same line."
"Madam President, may I congratulate you on the deft, adroit and sensitive way in which you have exercised the prerogatives of the Chair."
"For fifty years, European trade and agricultural polices have caused preventable poverty in the Third World."
"We have simultaneously excluded produce from countries where often agricultural export is the main generator of revenue and, rubbing in the salt, exported our own surpluses - dumped ineffectively our surpluses - on their markets."
"Then we have tried to salve our consciences by massive aid programmes which have not served to ameliorate the conditions of those countries but, on the contrary, by breaking the distinction between representation and taxation, have served to retard democratic development across much of the world."
"Here is one thing we could do tomorrow that would have an immediate, benign and transformative effect in the countries that we are talking about: we can abolish the common agricultural policy."
"The best thing is that it would not cost us a penny."
"On the contrary, our farmers would be better off, our countryside would be better looked after, our taxes would fall and food prices would fall, which would lower inflation and improve the situation of the world economy generally."
"And in case you thought I had forgotten, I have not gone soft and still think we need a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty: Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est."
"(NL) Madam President, the hypocrisy and inconsistency of this House continue to amaze me."
"On the one hand, this resolution rightly states that it is a shame that the best and most talented people are leaving developing countries, and that this brain drain is harmful to their economy."
"On the other, there is support across the political spectrum in this House for the EU Blue Card and the European reception centres for legal migration in Africa: the very things that cause and perpetuate this brain drain."
"After all, experience has shown that 'circular migrants' remain in Europe."
"Yet there are countless other reasons why I voted against this resolution, such as its plea for more and more EU development assistance."
"If Europe is to play a role in development cooperation at all, it should be as a coordinator among the Member States and not as a donor."
"(MT) Much of the work that this Parliament and other governments carry out in this field is in the form of 'fire fighting'."
"Prevention efforts are made in the light of climate change."
"However, we also need to work on underdevelopment as a form of prevention."
"Many of the immigration problems that we face are not political but economical, especially in the Mediterranean, and therefore we have to provide assistance in order to prevent this problem from growing."
"Written explanations of vote:"
"I voted in favour of the request made by Italy for aid in relation to accessing the European Union Solidarity Fund for rebuilding the Abruzzo region, extensively destroyed by the earthquake in April 2009, based on humanitarian considerations for a country in trouble."
"Bearing in mind the reason why this instrument exists at European Union level, which is to tackle natural disasters and show solidarity with the regions affected by a disaster, I wish to draw attention to the need for quicker procedures for making the funds requested available to the states affected."
"The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is in favour of emergency assistance, but it is for the individual Member States, not the European Union, to provide such assistance."
"in writing. - In April 2009, an earthquake occurred in Italy that caused a great deal of damage."
"It is for this reason that the Commission proposed the mobilisation of the ESF in favour of Italy."
"The events that took place in Italy were tragic indeed."
"I am therefore in agreement that the mobilisation of the ESF is justified and have voted in favour."
"I voted for the Böge report on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Italy because I believe that the European Union must respond, as quickly as possible, to the country's request for help, in order to mitigate the tragic consequences of the earthquake that struck the Italian region of Abruzzo in April 2009, claiming the lives of 300 people and causing extremely significant damage."
"As I have had the opportunity to say before, I believe that solidarity between Member States and, in particular, European support for countries that have been the victims of disasters, constitute a clear sign that the European Union is no longer just a free trade area."
"By adopting special aid instruments, such as the European Union Solidarity Fund, the EU is demonstrating that it is capable of maintaining unity in the face of adversity, in situations that are particularly demanding in human and material terms."
"I must therefore welcome and express my support, once again, for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund on this occasion to assist the victims of the earthquake which struck the Italian region of Abruzzo in April 2009."
"I would reiterate my wish for the European Union Solidarity Fund not to be used too often - meaning that Europe would not suffer many serious emergencies - but also my desire for its structure and availability to be progressively improved and frequently assessed in order to meet any potential real needs in a way that is quick, not bureaucratic."
"The report approves the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Italy, following April's earthquake, which claimed the lives of 300 people and caused very significant damage."
"It is estimated that the total direct damage caused by the earthquake is more than EUR 10 million, and has been classified, in accordance with the Fund's intervention criteria, as a 'major natural disaster' and, as such, falls within the main field of application of the legal basis."
"The Commission is, therefore, proposing the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to the sum of EUR 493 771 159."
"Let us not forget that the proposed revision of the regulations that this Fund establishes, submitted by the Commission and rejected by Parliament in May 2006, is still pending in Council."
"As we see it, it is important, amongst other things, to ensure that regional disasters remain eligible, or even safeguard the possibility of the specificity of the natural disasters suffered in the Mediterranean being recognised and of adapting this Fund - in terms of response times and eligible actions - to the specific needs of natural disasters such as drought and fires."
"I voted today in favour of the Böge report on mobilising the Solidarity Fund for Italy."
"I welcome the fact that this report was included on the agenda, in spite of the difficulties."
"Parliament's administrative body must anticipate in the future situations like the one we have today."
"Technical reasons cannot be used to postpone voting on reports which have serious repercussions for European citizens."
"The European Commission must review the procedures for mobilising the Solidarity Fund with a view to speeding up the payment of grants."
"An advance payment system must be set up, based on an immediate initial assessment of the direct losses incurred."
"The final payment must then be made based on the final calculations of the direct losses and on evidence of the prevention measures adopted as a result of the disaster."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of Amendment 7."
"I am pleased that services have been organised quickly to hold the vote, and I hope the funds required in Italy are made available as quickly as possible to provide speedy and effective assistance."
"I wish to congratulate Parliament on having blocked, at my request yesterday, the vote on mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for the Abruzzo earthquake, which happened in April, causing very serious human and material loss."
"There was really no reason to postpone, even for only two weeks, a vote that has such a significant impact on the lives of European citizens in difficulty."
"The European Commission carried out the preliminary investigation in no time at all, granting Italy the exact amount it had requested, namely EUR 493 771 159."
"This could well be the highest amount ever granted to date by this fund."
"With this vote, Parliament is thus showing full solidarity and unity with the affected populations."
"Normally, it takes an average of around 18 months to mobilise this fund."
"This time, we have reached the consultation stage in Parliament very quickly, considering that the earthquake happened only five months ago."
"I therefore sincerely hope that the Commission and the Council will make the timescales for the rest of the procedure as short as possible and will ensure that Italy can access the funds by the end of the year."
"in writing. - The effects of the Abruzzo earthquake were devastating and tragic, and the funding which we approved today cannot, of course, compensate for the terrible loss of life or the physical destruction of communities caused by this natural disaster."
"However, the funding from the EU Solidarity Fund will make a real difference to the region and its long-term recovery, and the existence and effective operation of this fund demonstrates the solidarity between the Member States of the European Union."
"Programmes and mechanisms to deliver practical measures make us stronger as a union, and better able to cope with crises, whether they be economic downturns or natural disasters."
"We should continue to support these practical measures to provide assistance to Member States during times of genuine need."
"Policy enables us to influence and control events, but for those events - such as natural disasters - which go beyond the realm of politics, we can develop these important mechanisms to help us cope with crises."
"In the face of a tragedy in which people have lost their loved ones and, in many cases, all of their possessions, and a beautiful town of great antiquity has been ruined, support for such a proposal is a gesture of plain decency."
"The EU Solidarity Fund is an example of effective, common EU action in a case when one of its members has been hit by such a tragedy."
"The EU Solidarity Fund allows fast, emergency aid to be given and is, without doubt, a positive signal to its citizens."
"in writing. - I welcome the positive vote releasing funding for the Abruzzo earthquake victims."
"Our reaction to natural disasters, such as the devastation we saw in Italy, must go beyond the realm of politics."
"Acting to help victims of this catastrophe rebuild their lives, homes and futures is surely something that any Member of this Parliament with a shred of humanity will agree on."
"The EU Solidarity Fund allows us to act as a community to alleviate misery and suffering."
"Since it was established, the fund has been used to help people in more than half of EU Member States and over 20 disasters from flooding to forest fires, drought and volcano eruptions."
"I also note that the people of Wales have been among those to benefit from funding following the terrible floods of 2007."
"However, the fund's revenues must be looked at and there is a strong case for allowing the fund to have its own resources so that other projects are not affected by the mobilisation of the fund."
"I hope that in some way, this money can work towards the reconstruction not only of buildings but also the communities which were destroyed."
"Improving judicial cooperation in criminal proceedings between authorities which have parallel competences is a particularly important measure."
"If the actions which have led to an offence being committed fall under the jurisdiction of two or more Member States, the criminal proceedings must be conducted under the most suitable jurisdiction, with it being essential to create a common, uniform framework for choosing this jurisdiction in an objective, transparent manner."
"The unsuccessful application of the ne bis in idem principle, which features in the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, violates fundamental rights and runs counter to the EU's objective to create a common space of freedom, security and justice."
"The report which I voted for underpins the guarantee to respect this principle throughout the entire European judicial area, and not only as part of national proceedings."
"This is why I welcome the adoption of this report during yesterday's session."
"I voted for this report, as matters of conflicts of jurisdiction must be settled as effectively as possible by striving for consensus."
"We should be pleased that the ne bis in idem principle is ensured in the area of states' courts."
"It is regrettable that the report does not lay down methods of settling conflicts of competency, determining which state should exercise jurisdiction."
"The role of Eurojust is also not clearly defined."
"However, this report is a stimulus to strive for further important decisions in the areas of citizens' freedom, justice and home affairs."
"in writing. - In a further globalised world and a situation in which there exist 27 Member States in the EU, the possibility of there being some conflict in jurisdiction is great and could cause difficulty."
"Hence, I have voted in the affirmative."
"I believe that it is essential to make criminal proceedings more efficient, while the correct administration of justice must be ensured."
"This framework decision will contribute to the prevention and resolution of conflicts of jurisdiction, ensure that proceedings are started before the most appropriate jurisdiction, and make the choice of criminal jurisdiction more transparent and objective in situations in which the events are covered by the jurisdiction of more than one Member State."
"I hope that, in this way, parallel and unnecessary criminal proceedings may be prevented, without, however, leading to increased bureaucracy when dealing with cases in which more appropriate options are quickly available."
"For example, in cases where more flexible instruments or agreements have already been put in place by Member States, these must take precedence."
"In fact, the existence of situations in which the same people may be subject to parallel criminal processes, relating to the same events and in different Member States, may lead to violations of the ne bis in idem principle, which must be effectively applied throughout the European judicial area."
"I also support the increased involvement of Eurojust from the start of the process."
"We Swedish Social Democrats chose to abstain, as we believe that it is the Member States themselves that should decide which authorities should be considered competent in consultation procedures."
"We also believe that Eurojust's involvement should be complementary and secondary in relation to the Member States and that the agency's mandate should not in any way be extended by this decision."
"Many points in Parliament's report do, however, improve the proposal for a framework decision."
"It is important, not just for national authorities, but also, and more especially, for those who are suspected or accused of a crime, that there are clear deadlines, procedural guarantees and other protection mechanisms in place."
"Coordinated action by Member States on the prevention and resolution of conflicts in the exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings is essential for more effective justice when conducting proceedings of this type. Therefore, it is desirable to concentrate criminal proceedings that affect various jurisdictions in a single Member State, according to objective criteria and for the sake of the necessary transparency, not only to prevent time and resources being wasted, but also because of the costs involved and because it is essential to increase the consistency and efficiency of proceedings."
"Direct contact - that is also as brief as possible - between competent national authorities is therefore essential to determine the competent jurisdiction and the respective transfer of proceedings."
"In this context, it is important to remember the rights of the accused throughout criminal proceedings, since one of the European Union's basic objectives consists of offering its citizens an area of freedom, safety and justice without internal borders."
"We voted against this report because of the strengthening of the role of Eurojust that it aims to establish."
"From a legal standpoint, the Council's draft framework decision better safeguards the justice of the decisions taken, above all, because it clearly guarantees the ne bis in idem principle: that a person may not be sentenced twice by the same criminal proceedings."
"Despite the rapporteur having recognised this fact, the amendments introduced strengthen the role of Eurojust in areas that are the exclusive jurisdiction of the Member States."
"In this way, and through its anticipated intervention in proceedings, Eurojust is being set up as a higher authority than the Member States, because their chance to come to an agreement on who has authority over proceedings is being taken away from them."
"We do not think that it is acceptable for the justification for all this to be 'waste of time and resources'."
"The transfer of Member States' jurisdictions in terms of justice, and in other areas, to the EU weakens their sovereignty and is being shown not to serve the interests of the public in the defence of its rights, freedoms, and guarantees."
"In our opinion, this is another example of exactly that."
"The ne bis in idem principle - where the same person cannot be tried twice for the same crime - is a fundamental principle of law within a democracy."
"I myself am a victim of a violation of this principle in France, as I am still being prosecuted by order of the government in an affair in which I have, nonetheless, been proved totally innocent by the Court of Cassation."
"I owe this in particular to the abuse of authority by Mrs Wallis, the rapporteur on my immunity, who has allowed all the tricks in the book to be used to strip me of the protection to which I am entitled, if the rules of justice, of morality and of the case-law of this Parliament were followed."
"However, Mrs Weber's report is not aimed at preventing these ne bis in idem cases."
"For that, there is a European convention dating from 2000, which works, it seems, to the satisfaction of practitioners and in compliance with the principles of the rule of law."
"No, the Weber report is basically aimed at giving Eurojust, which many would like to see turned into a European public prosecution service, powers to control and to decide on national jurisdictions."
"That is why we have voted against."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Weber report on the prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings."
"Serious criminal activities have an increasingly cross-border nature and the EU has an important role to play in combating such activities."
"Clearer procedures for the exchange of information in criminal proceedings will enhance cooperation between Member States and improve individual nations' abilities to combat crime."
"Regard must always be had for fundamental rights and, in my opinion, the Weber report improves upon the proposed framework decision."
"in writing. - I decided to abstain on the final vote."
"Although, in the block vote, there are some good amendments on human rights (e.g. Amendments 6 and 15), there are also amendments which move Member State competences to Eurojust (e.g. Amendments 3, 9, 16, 17 and 18)."
"I believe that these should remain with Member States."
"The creation of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis may prove to be essential for preparing the future of the EU."
"The experience of its members is essential for the pursuit of the tasks and proposals that will be presented by this Special Committee."
"I believe that the list of members includes members of this House who are respected and very experienced in the various areas affected by the current context of crisis."
"They will also, therefore, be able to contribute to discussing and presenting relevant measures to correct the faults of the financial system that led to the current situation, making an important contribution to preparing for the possible adoption of properly justified and better legislation in the future."
"I also believe that this Committee will have to remain in place beyond the envisaged 12 months and that its composition may be reviewed, in order to allow monitoring and assessment of the measures that will be adopted in the context of the current crisis."
"I am pleased with the agreements concluded at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh."
"I am sure that they are a step in the right direction."
"The immediate priorities must be to ensure the robust and sustainable growth of the real economy, guarantee that the credit and capital markets are functioning well, support and promote employment and protect people from the negative impact of the crisis, paying particular attention to the poorest and most vulnerable."
"The rapid increases in the public debt and budget deficits are worrying."
"The importance of establishing public finances that are sustainable in the long term must be reinforced in order to avoid overloading future generations."
"Nonetheless, the lack of assessment of the main failures of regulation and supervision that caused the financial crisis is regrettable."
"It is a priority to understand what happened at that level and thereby avoid repetition of the errors of the past."
"The world is faced with a contradiction that will be difficult to resolve."
"On the one hand, the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job-creating growth."
"That was the agenda of the G20 in Pittsburgh."
"On the other hand - and this will be the challenge for the Copenhagen conference - it is just as urgent to combat climate change by reducing energy consumption."
"In other words, we must restart the machine and ensure that that machine pollutes less."
"Moreover, these two issues cannot be resolved one after the other; they are both urgent."
"Relaunching economic activity is urgent, and limiting the consequences of economic activity is urgent."
"At the G20 yesterday, and at the climate-change conference tomorrow, the European Union must tread a narrow path between two equally formidable threats."
"The European institutions must be established as quickly as possible under the Treaty of Lisbon adopted by the 27 countries of the Union."
"By 'playing for time' to delay this moment, the Czech President, Mr Klaus, has a big responsibility towards the 500 million citizens of the Union."
"The European Union needs stricter financial market supervision, for which one institution would be accountable (G20)."
"It is important to ensure long-term fiscal stability so that future generations do not have too great a burden and to create more jobs and protect people from the impact of the crisis."
"It is particularly important to give priority to creating jobs, to ensuring the growth of a large and stable real economy sector, to properly safeguarding capital markets and credit activities, to retaining and stimulating employment, as well as to protecting people from the negative consequences of the crisis, paying particular attention to the poorest and worst affected."
"Today, we must strengthen social dialogue at all levels by trying to avoid salary reductions and ensure that salaries increase proportionally with productivity growth."
"The creation of new jobs must be seen as the most important goal."
"in writing. - The Verts/ALE Group voted in favour of the resolution on the G20 for several reasons, among which: - by referring to the need to develop new indicators which go beyond GDP, the EP gives a clear signal that 'economic recovery' must not be based on a 'business as usual approach', which is in line with our request to develop a 'Green New Deal'; - the resolution insists on the need to tackle global imbalances, especially exchange rate imbalances and commodity price volatility within a multilateral framework; - the resolution sends a good signal towards the setting-up of a tax on financial transactions, which was never the case until now; - as regards the financial crisis, the EP makes a strong statement on international coordination that should aim to avoid regulatory arbitrage."
"It also stresses that the upgrading of prudential rules within the context of the G20 consists of a 'minimum harmonisation' approach that must not prevent the EU from applying higher standards; - as regards supervision of the financial sectors, the EP has made a significant move towards an enhanced and more centralised approach on financial market supervision, with the setting up of a single financial supervisory authority being a final objective."
"The G20 has committed itself to reaching an agreement at the Copenhagen Summit and it is essential that the EU continues to play a leading role in the negotiations in order to establish a far-reaching, equitable agreement."
"The agreement in Copenhagen may drive economic growth, promoting clean technology, and ensuring that new jobs are created in industrialised and developing countries."
"The existence of an agreement on financing and technical support for clean, renewal energy and energy efficiency in developing countries is essential in order to obtain a robust agreement in Copenhagen."
"It is important to define a concrete model in order to maximise the chances of concluding an agreement in Copenhagen."
"The international agreement must ensure collective reductions of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report (25-40% for 2020, in relation to 1990) and must establish a long-term reduction for the EU and other industrialised countries of at least 80% by 2050, in relation to 1990."
"in writing. - The G20 Summit that was held in Pittsburgh on 24 and 25 September was successful in various areas such as discussing the need to address the root causes of the financial crises so as to ensure that such events do not recur in the future."
"I am in agreement with this and have hence voted in favour of the resolution."
"We have today voted in favour of the resolution on the G20."
"However, we chose to vote against the introduction of a financial transaction tax, as it would counteract poor countries' capital formation and would hinder the development and growth that has lifted people and countries out of poverty over the last 30 years."
"We are also opposed to the creation of an anti-cyclical jobs fund at international level, as there is a risk that it will preserve old and obsolete structures, thereby preventing the growth and development of new jobs."
"It would require the introduction of an international tax and distribution system with no democratic control and with the clear risk of all kinds of corruption."
"It is important for people affected by the crisis to be able to receive support and help, but this is best handled at national level, not by a bureaucratic international system."
"The delegation of the elected representatives of the Mouvement Démocrate (Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - France) welcomes the adoption of the resolution on the G20 conclusions."
"Through this vote, the European Parliament is reaffirming that: the EU must provide itself with a financial supervision system and a single financial authority; we need to move in the direction of long-term fiscal stability so as not to harm future generations; the immediate priorities must be to create jobs and to protect the citizens against the impact of the crisis."
"We have voted in favour of Amendments 5, 8, 11, 12 and 13, and regret that the European Parliament did not go further in relation to accounting transparency, the fight against tax havens and environmental commitments ('New Green Deal')."
"We would also reiterate our commitment to a tax on financial transactions based on the model of the Tobin tax."
"In this respect, we call on the European Parliament to begin discussions on the definition of such a tax."
"While we agree with the main guidelines of the European Parliament resolution on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh - and having endorsed it for that reason - the Luxembourg delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to express some reservations about elements of this resolution that are unsatisfactory."
"Firstly, the Pittsburgh conclusions mention the need to make the beneficiaries of rescue measures contribute to the cost of those measures."
"This is not the same as devising a tax on financial transactions, as the Parliament resolution is suggesting."
"Secondly, we recommend a financial supervision system that will combine, in the future, the national supervision authorities and the three European bodies, the creation of which is under way as part of the European legislative procedure."
"Lastly, it is important to prevent the widespread use of the term 'tax havens', taken from the G20."
"Jurisdictions that are by no means tax havens have been included arbitrarily in a 'grey' list, while real tax havens continue to escape all forms of pressure exerted by the G20 and the OECD."
"Calling countries with moderate taxation tax havens will not help us to reach the end of a crisis whose origins lie elsewhere."
"I voted for the European Parliament resolution on the G20 Summit, held in Pittsburgh on 24 and 25 September, because I believe that the present economic difficulties must be used as an opportunity to promote the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and reiterate a commitment to fight unemployment and climate change, as well as to create a European strategy that results in economic recovery that is sustainable in the long term."
"It is, however, regrettable that the proposal for a Tobin-style tax on financial transactions has not been adopted, as that would make it possible to limit excessive speculation, and promote financial stability and investment in the long term."
"Against a backdrop of global economic crisis with serious social consequences, the decisions taken by the G20 become very important."
"It is through coordinated effort by the members of the G20 that we will be able to construct a financial system that will contribute to more even and sustainable economic development in the future, and so avoid crises like the one we are currently experiencing."
"We in the European Union cannot act on our own in case we adopt rules that are not shared by other countries, which would put the European economy at a disadvantage in the globalised world in which we live."
"I am pleased with the agreements that were reached at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh."
"As a result of the globalisation of capital, actions to combat and prevent new crises require the maximum possible international cooperation."
"I am delighted with the agreements, which have economic growth, the promotion of employment and the regulation of markets in mind, and I hope that these objectives come to fruition 'over a wide area'."
"As regards the tax on financial transactions to enable excessive speculation to be controlled and encourage long-term investment, it only makes sense if applied on a global scale."
"The resolution adopted today is in line with the positions already adopted by various bodies of the European Union, including the European Parliament, in an attempt to hide the true causes of the economic and social crisis and, by manipulating it, to speed up and encourage the continuation and development of the policies that caused it."
"Among other things, and with regard to tax havens, it only considers that these 'have undermined financial regulation', while merely recommending that it is necessary to 'improve tax transparency and the exchange of information'."
"What is required, and what the resolution fails to mention, is the need to break from the neoliberal policies of liberalising and privatising services, of attacking the rights of workers and destroying manufacturing infrastructure."
"These policies are responsible for the worsening of living conditions, debt, increased unemployment, job insecurity and poverty."
"It is necessary to value work and workers, to protect productive sectors and public services, to effectively make economic power subordinate to political power, to combat and punish corruption and economic crime, as well as to bring an end to tax havens."
"I voted against all of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the G20 resolution in order to protest against that group's tactic of always reopening debates with generally demagogic amendments."
"The Greens had negotiated the joint motion for a resolution and obtained satisfaction on many amendments. Nonetheless, they have not signed the joint resolution so that they can make a scene in plenary."
"We voted against the resolution on the G20 for one good reason: at no point does it call into question the global financial system that is at the root of the crisis."
"It even states that we need yet more globalisation, yet more liberalisation, with the so-called safeguard of multilateral institutions and bodies destined to become a global government."
"Yet, refusing to change the system is to guarantee the failure of the few useful and necessary measures proposed."
"Trying to save at any cost the system as it is today, with markets that are increasingly disconnected from the real economy, is to pave the way for other crises, and to ensure that the declared objective of job creation will not be achieved."
"The economy is not an end in itself: it is just one means of achieving political objectives, progress within societies and human development."
"As long as you submit to its alleged requirements and surrender before the so-called unchanging laws of the market, you will not resolve any problems."
"On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I wish to explain our abstention from the vote on the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance's amendment on a tax on the model of the Tobin tax."
"Our group has decided to set up a working group on this issue in order to clarify the aim and the practical details of this tax."
"Then, the political groups, in full knowledge of the facts, will be able to agree on a common approach to this issue, one that has the same meaning for everyone and which can be defended within the appropriate international bodies."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh."
"The current economic crisis is truly global in both its roots and its effects, and so coordinated international action is essential to finding solutions."
"National governments all have a role to play in these solutions and joint action at EU level will ensure that Europe can be at the forefront of driving forward global recovery."
"The Scottish Government is pushing forward a programme aimed at supporting jobs and communities, strengthening education and skills, and investing in innovation and the industries of the future."
"Together with the other countries of Europe, we will be able to overcome the challenges we currently face."
"in writing. - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the commitment made by the G20 to work on a financial transaction tax."
"Following the costs incurred by taxpayers during the crisis, it is essential that we ensure the financial sector contributes fully and fairly to an improvement in public finances."
"The Tobin tax is one model of a financial transaction tax which has been proposed."
"We did not support Amendment 8 as we must consider all options rather than commit specifically to a 'Tobin-style' tax."
"Furthermore, the amendment suggests that a unilateral European form of such a tax should be considered."
"The financial services industry is a global industry and our efforts must remain on securing a transaction tax that is effective and workable on a global level."
"in writing. - I abstained from the vote on Amendment 8 on a financial transaction tax."
"I am in favour of such a tax, but I believe it needs to be at the global level, rather than European level, in order to be effective."
"The joint motion for a resolution on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh contains a great many positive elements."
"It plainly points out, for example, the difficulties with the fiscal policy stimulatory measures that have been implemented by the majority of states."
"The consolidation of national budgets must be given a significant role over the coming years."
"I also welcome the fact that an attempt is being made to get to grips with the causes of the crisis, with reference being made to unbridled speculation and the lack of regulation in the financial market."
"This has only been done in a superficial way, however."
"There is no penetration through to real, needed reforms."
"Given the immense crisis that we still find ourselves in and that will, sadly, still bring us many more unemployed, this is far too little."
"It is for that reason that I have abstained from voting."
"The motion for a resolution on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh explicitly states that the crisis is the result of reckless and irresponsible risk-taking by some financial institutions in addition to a lack of regulation of the financial market."
"The door was thus left wide open for total speculation."
"It is therefore even more important to adopt appropriate rules for the markets quickly."
"The ideas put forward in this regard in the motion are, on and off, very much to be welcomed."
"It is unfortunate, however, that the motion also stands behind the Basel II provisions which, we know from experience, have led to the flow of capital to small and medium-sized businesses practically running dry."
"The rigorous abolition of banking secrecy is not something that I can support, out of consideration for the many small bank customers, for which reason I decided to abstain from the final vote."
"Firstly, I would applaud the fact that at the G20 meeting, such important issues were tackled as sustainable economic growth, employment and potential climate change phenomena, which could threaten the habitability of our planet."
"These are current global issues, universally considered vital for the European growth process."
"In this respect, I welcome the fact it has been decided to maintain the stimuli for economic recovery and the commitment shown to a strategy that can make the principles of the Lisbon Agenda viable, particularly the global interest in implementing the Global Jobs Pact."
"On this point, it is important to stress the urgent need to create an anti-cyclical jobs fund at international level and ambitious fiscal stimulus packages which support job creation and retention, along with strong social policies to support the most vulnerable groups."
"The financial crisis arose partly as a result of banks abusing their customers' trust and taking excessive risks with their customers' money."
"We think that a more detailed discussion of how international financial transactions should be handled is needed."
"We do not think that the Tobin tax will be effective in preventing speculation, but we welcome a discussion on how financial institutions such as banks, trust companies and insurance companies can help to create a healthy and stable financial market."
"The financial crisis shows that international solutions are needed to tackle international problems."
"This discussion should therefore be held at global level and not merely within the EU."
"I would like to applaud the agreements concluded at the G20 Summit, about which I am very pleased and which were universally seen as a step in the right direction."
"Since issues as important as the regulation and supervision of financial markets and the sustainability of public finances were discussed, I would like to give special emphasis to the issue of sustainable economic growth and employment."
"I am delighted that the priorities adopted by the G20 are based on the sustainable growth of the real economy, which will not only be the engine that ensures the creation of jobs, but will also serve as a guarantee for the protection of the public from the negative impact of the crisis, especially the poorest and most vulnerable."
"I am also delighted with the undertaking by the leaders of the G20 to tackle the employment crisis at international level, making the promotion of employment the central element of recovery plans."
"I only regret the failure to reach any agreement at the G20 with regard to the global fight against climate change."
"It was important for the European Parliament to send out a clear message to the main world leaders following the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh."
"That has been done with the resolution adopted today, which points out that, although the worst of the financial crisis is behind us, the consequences in terms of budget and employment will be felt for a long time yet without joint action from the European Union, the United States and China."
"The latter have already taken decisions on the reform of the IMF, the supervision of traders' bonuses, capital requirements, and transparency concerning complex financial products, so this G20 was not in vain."
"Nevertheless, at least three huge tasks must still be completed if progress is to be made in controlling globalisation."
"The first is to really tackle tax havens, so much money that is missing from the States' coffers."
"The second is to prevent a monetary storm from brewing as a result of the failure to rebalance exchange rates and the pursuit of competitive devaluations."
"The third is to tackle the volatility of the prices of basic commodities, especially foodstuffs, as this plays a part in increasing the imbalances and poverty in the world."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent G20 Summit in Pittsburgh has confirmed a gradual stabilisation of the economic situation."
"However, it is still necessary to bear in mind problems which may be faced by particular economies."
"The meeting was an opportunity to confirm the determination of states to reform the system of financial regulation."
"The greatest danger, which we must not allow, is a further rise in unemployment, a fall in demand and a scaling back of production."
"The principles proposed in Pittsburgh should be the foundation for common world economic development."
"The summit has confirmed the need for further work on creating institutions and instruments for inspection and monitoring in a variety of areas of the global market."
"in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party supported this resolution and gave support to underpinning the progress made last month in Pittsburgh."
"Without commitments to improve multilateral surveillance within the IMF and further involvement of economies other than the current members, little effective success can be foreseen."
"There is much to commend this resolution, and with careful thought, greater progress can be expected against the problems of the financial crisis."
"Firstly, I would applaud the fact that at the G20 meeting, such important issues were tackled as sustainable economic growth, employment and potential climate change phenomena, which could threaten the habitability of our planet."
"These are current global issues, universally considered vital for the European growth process."
"In this respect, I welcome the fact it has been decided to maintain the stimuli for economic recovery and the commitment shown to a strategy that can make the principles of the Lisbon Agenda viable, particularly the global interest in implementing the Global Jobs Pact."
"On this point, it is important to stress the urgent need to create an anti-cyclical jobs fund at international level and ambitious fiscal stimulus packages which support job creation and retention, along with strong social policies to support the most vulnerable groups."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against the joint motion for a resolution by the conservatives, social democrats and liberals, because it condenses the strategic ambition of the monopolies to pass the painful consequences of the capitalist financial crisis on to the working classes."
"The political mouthpieces of capitalism are calling in their resolution for the bourgeois governments to continue to support the monopoly behemoths with hot public money and, at the same time, to 'establish healthy public finances', by which they mean even greater cutbacks in social spending, in health, in welfare, in education and so forth. They welcome the creation of 'dignified jobs' which will replace permanent, full-time work with badly-paid, flexible and insecure work, with the minimum possible level of rights."
"The political representatives of the plutocracy are proposing this 'dignity' to the working classes."
"The resolution calls for the strengthening of international imperialist organisations (IMF, World Bank, WTO) and paves the way for a 'green' return on capital on the pretext of climate change and the complete liberalisation of international trade, which signals even greater penetration by the monopolies on the markets of developing and poor countries and the plundering of wealth-producing resources and human resources."
"Developing countries are severely affected by successive crises such as the food and fuel price crises, and climate change."
"They are suffering seriously from the consequences of the financial crisis and the economic recession."
"It is essential that the EU and the Member States take their responsibility as international actors, meeting their public development aid commitments, and that they continue to contribute to attaining the Millennium Development Goals."
"The EU has frontloaded EUR 8.8 billion of development aid, budget support and agricultural financing for immediate action, and proposes contributing EUR 500 million to support social spending in developing countries through the FLEX mechanism for ACP countries."
"It is important that budget support be focused on the fields of health, decent work, education, social services and green growth."
"The Commission is called on to find new sources of funding to safeguard the European Development Fund (EDF), and it is also important for the EDF to be brought within the Community budget."
"Increased consistency between the EU's international trade, budgetary, climate change and development policies is also necessary."
"Development aid must favour..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170(1)(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - Despite the fact that developing countries were certainly not the cause of the crises, it is certainly true that they have been most adversely and disproportionately affected by it."
"This is why I have voted in favour of this resolution."
"Although the current economic and financial crisis originated in the United States, its consequences have been felt worldwide."
"It has affected Europe and, more severely, developing countries, whether through human costs that dragged millions of people into extreme poverty, or through the weakening of their already feeble economies."
"It is urgent that all entities that play an active role in public development aid - particularly the institutions of Bretton Woods - respond to the situation rapidly and effectively."
"It is also essential that the European Union and its Member States take on the responsibilities of frontline actors in development aid by meeting their international commitments to these countries, by an urgent increase in aid to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and by an increase in the volume of public development aid, which is insufficient to react to the collateral damage of this crisis in developing countries."
"It is also pressing, especially in the lead up to the Copenhagen conference, that the EU and other international actors articulate their policies on international trade, climate change, humanitarian aid and development."
"For these reasons, I support this resolution."
"We are facing an emergency situation with regard to development and humanitarian aid due to the economic crisis, the human cost of which continues to mount up, all the more so as this recession comes in the wake of the food and oil price crises."
"Unfortunately, one of the direct consequences of the economic crisis is an international donor crisis, against the backdrop of accelerated growth in the level of poverty."
"In 2009 alone, 90 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty, while the number of unemployed has risen by 23 million. A glimmer of hope is offered by the proposals adopted today for providing aid to the most vulnerable countries, the developing countries."
"However, these do not go far enough, given that the USD 6 billion obtained from the sale of IMF gold reserves and earmarked for providing aid to poor countries can cover only 2% of their actual needs."
"Consequently, I believe that the pressure must be increased on the G20 States to assume the major specific responsibility for triggering the crisis by mobilising resources in the form of crisis support to be allocated to the developing countries."
"With this need to streamline the system in mind, I welcome the criticism in the resolution about the failure of the Pittsburgh Summit to tackle the subject of reforming the international financial institutions, given the Bretton Woods institutions' slow response to the crisis."
"Developing countries have been severely affected by the present economic and financial crisis and it is feared that they will suffer a sharp slowdown, or even a serious decline, in their growth and progress indices."
"The EU and the Member States, as significant donors, must keep this fact in mind and consider increasing aid to these countries."
"The alternative is that some of them drop irreparably into levels of poverty that could bring about or worsen social and political conflicts, and contribute to shortages in regions that have been striving, with difficulty, for peace and development."
"This increase, which must be oriented towards flexibility, imagination, solidarity and good sense, must be accompanied by rigorous monitoring by the donors in terms of how the aid is used and by effective tracking of the sums made available to the beneficiary countries, from their transfer to their final destination."
"The civil societies and parliaments of these countries must be involved in this effort towards transparency, and the EU must foster national debates on where the received aid should go."
"Even against a backdrop of economic downturn, Europe cannot, and must not, shut itself off and ignore the burning issues that surround it."
"Developing countries have been hard hit by the current financial and economic crisis, which was caused by banks and other speculators in the United States."
"This has a massive impact on their already weak economies and will put millions more people out of work."
"The unemployed will, where possible, seek their salvation in Europe, thereby increasing the migration pressure on Europe even further."
"We Europeans must therefore support these countries in building up their economies."
"The current form of development aid is an unsuitable tool for this purpose, as lots of funds disappear into dark channels or are diverted back into European bank accounts belonging to corrupt despots."
"For this reason, despite numerous positive ideas, I abstained from voting on the Committee on Development's motion in the final vote."
"The financial crisis arose partly as a result of banks abusing their customers' trust and taking excessive risks with their customers' money."
"We think that a more detailed discussion of how international financial transactions should be handled is needed."
"We do not think that the Tobin tax will be effective in preventing speculation, but we welcome a discussion on how financial institutions such as banks, trust companies and insurance companies can help to create a healthy and stable financial market."
"The financial crisis shows that international solutions are needed to tackle international problems."
"This discussion should therefore be held at a global level and not merely within the EU."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Committee on Development's motion for a resolution mentions, all to its credit, the existing global financial and economic crisis has hit the poorest countries hardest."
"The development targets achieved in many developing countries are at risk and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals seems ever more difficult."
"Despite the many promises made by developed countries, expressed publicly at the G20 and G8 Summits, for example, the amount of aid sent to developing countries is nowhere near what was pledged."
"In fact, even before the crisis erupted, the amount of development aid from many EU Member States was far less than what they had promised."
"The crisis may also be a new opportunity."
"The considerable growth in International Monetary Fund resources and changes to that organisation's decision-making system are two reasons for thinking there may be positive developments."
"The reform of the IMF and the additional resources answer a sore need, but this alone is not nearly enough to ease the situation facing the world's poorest."
"The developed countries must keep their word regarding their commitment to the Millennium Goals and to the 0.7% of GDP needed to increase development aid."
"The financing needed to fight and adapt to climate change is an additional responsibility that the developed world cannot afford to wriggle out of."
"The fundamental pillar of the new international rules must be the notion of more equal opportunities to be involved in revising the rules as well as playing by them."
"Madam President, I voted for adoption of the resolution, because I think that it contains many very pertinent remarks on the causes and effects of the current difficult situation in developing countries."
"I would especially like to stress that the present economic crisis is a result not only of the collapse of financial markets, but also of the earlier food and energy crises."
"I consider it essential to take action aimed at the rapid and more effective use of means which have been made available by developed countries."
"This is of particular significance when we consider the fact that wealthy countries are currently struggling with internal problems, such as an insufficient budget or time limitations."
"I stress once again: it is most important to simplify procedures, so that funds which move from rich countries to poor ones do not disappear in a sea of bureaucracy."
"Providing aid to developing countries is one duty that the European Union must not abandon."
"The current economic and financial crisis has given a new dimension to globalisation."
"The idea of a tax on financial transactions was beneficial: President Sarkozy has made it one of his priorities."
"Europe, it seems, has set the pace and the world has followed."
"The new, sound workings of international finance will have to be based on fairness."
"Thus, I regret that the Striffler-Ponga amendment has been rejected, as it proposed a tax on financial transactions to be added to official development assistance, so that the least developed countries could benefit from it."
"It is true that our economies and our financial systems would have had a greater tax burden, but the European Union would thus have been the initiator of a great international solidarity movement."
"We can still hope that the resolution adopted here will encourage the Union to honour its commitments and to help developing countries keep pace with globalisation."
"I endorsed with conviction the resolution tabled by the Committee on Development on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries."
"The EP rightly calls on the EU to eradicate abuses of tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight from developing countries."
"The IMF has rightly increased the funds for combating the financial and economic crisis."
"Yet it is downright alarming that, to date, 82% of these resources have ended up in Europe and just 1.6% in Africa."
"The first priority must now be accorded to poverty reduction."
"It is also essential that economic partnership agreements (EPAs) be used as a means of giving the countries concerned commercial advantages, and that these countries also be able to leave certain sensitive products and sectors, such as investment and services, out of the negotiations."
"I regret that the amendment asking the Commission and the Member States to present proposals for innovative funding mechanisms, such as a tax on financial transactions to supplement Official Development Assistance, was not accepted."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution but I feel it is necessary to provide some clarifications."
"The recent financial crisis has caused a global economic recession which, due to its many repercussions, has had a particular impact on developing countries, exacerbating the food crisis: according to data supplied by the FAO, the number of starving people has reached in excess of the one billion mark for the first time in history, and there are 100 million more malnourished people than there were in 2008."
"The impact of the financial crisis on countries in the ACP region has been devastating, making the environmental challenges and the volatility of food prices even more complex."
"Those countries are not responsible for the crisis, but they have suffered the worst of its consequences, receiving the smallest quantity of aid."
"This is no longer acceptable."
"For these reasons, faced with a situation that it is not a cliché to call tragic, I believe it is necessary to improve the quality of the aid that is allocated to those countries, rather than just look at the quantity."
"I believe it is necessary to act more transparently and effectively when using the funds and I believe it is necessary to verify the results obtained in an impartial manner."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."

"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 15 October 2009, pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Monday:"
"(FR) Mr President, my speech relates, in fact, to Monday's agenda."
"The draft agenda that was issued before we received the document on which we have to vote included, I believe, a debate on three cases of parliamentary immunity."
"These cases of parliamentary immunity are extremely important because they may have a bearing on the freedom of exercise of a Member who is exposed to the political hostility of the government, or to the political hostility of the courts, or to the political hostility of the courts as exploited by the government, via prosecutors."
"I note that these issues have disappeared from the debate and I find that deeply regrettable."
"There remains only one vote without debate on a report by Mrs Wallis, concerning the immunity of Mr Siwiec."
"This vote without debate does not permit speeches and thus does not permit the Member concerned to express himself before his peers, before his fellow Members."
"I find that deeply regrettable."
"I will conclude by saying a word about the report by our fellow Member, Mr Speroni, which was adopted by a very large majority - by virtually the whole of this Parliament, I believe - on the attitude of the French authorities, who denied our former fellow Member, Mr Marchiani, the protection of his immunity with regard to phone-tapping, when such immunity is guaranteed to members of national parliaments."
"I would like to know what has become of the recommendations from Mr Speroni's report and, in particular, of the complaint that we had to lodge with the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"There has not been a request for a debate to be held on parliamentary immunity."
"Therefore, voting will be held on this matter tomorrow."
"Had there been a request, we could have considered this matter in a different way."
"There is no discussion on the agenda because of the absence of any kind of motion on this matter."
"Tuesday:"
"No amendments have been proposed."
"Wednesday:"
"I have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for an amendment to the title of the draft resolutions on freedom of information in Italy and other Member States of the European Union."
"The amended title would be: Freedom of information in the European Union."
"Mr President, a common point that emerged from the debate we had last month on this resolution was that we need to discuss the issue of freedom of expression everywhere, both throughout Europe and outside it."
"However, we cannot, Mr President, declare a crusade against one individual country."
"The issue on Italy within this resolution is essentially a national political debate, and we, as the European Parliament, must hold back from intervening in a debate such as this one."
"If we keep the word Italy within the title of this resolution, we would be assuming the role of some sort of higher court, which we are not, and we would, in fact, be undermining all the authority of and respect towards our institution."
"We support freedom of expression within Europe and beyond it, and therefore we call upon all those who are truly for freedom of expression everywhere to vote in favour of the change in the resolution's title."
"Mr President, I should like to support and speak in favour of the motion."
"Not every issue in Europe is an issue for Europe."
"We practise subsidiarity and we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have confidence in our colleagues in the parliament in Rome and trust in the Roman courts, in the Italian courts, which can rule independently on what is good for Italy and what is not good for Italy."
"The Italian parliament has just proven that it is independent."
"We are happy to debate freedom of opinion, but then we should also debate freedom of opinion in the European Union."
"That must be clear in the motion and its title, which is why we are asking for support for our motion."
"Mr President, this is actually something of a humiliating spectacle."
"We said clearly beforehand that this started with the Italian case, but we do not want to concentrate on that."
"We want to say something in general about freedom of opinion in Europe."
"That is why we chose this title; it is about the case that started in Italy, but it is also about general statements."
"We should not try and do everything."
"For weeks, we have tried again and again to put the starting case to one side."
"At least be honest: if you say we want to defend Berlusconi, whatever he does, that is an honest position, but now you are acting as if you wanted to be neutral, to be objective."
"Let us stick to this title."
"That is reasonable."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, one short comment and one request to you, Mr President: on Thursday, we shall be discussing, among other things, the terrible death penalties in Iran, which are totally unacceptable and which are often handed down for so-called crimes which, under our sense of justice, are not even prosecuted."
"We should take this opportunity to say clearly - and perhaps you should find an opportunity, like the Council, to say that, because we are against violence, we condemn terrorist violence in general, even if it is directed against the government bodies of Iran."
"I think that our objective position would be stronger if we said clearly that the attack that cost 42 people their lives is not in keeping with our policy."
"We are against violence, against the death penalty and also against terrorist violence as a matter of principle."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(LV) Mr President, the whole of the European Union is feeling the global economic crisis, but the recession has had its most serious effects in the Baltic States."
"For these states, the way out of the economic crisis is closely linked to a full transition to the euro."
"Although, since 2005, all the Baltic currencies have been directly pegged to the euro, because of the official Maastricht criteria they still cannot fully join the euro area."
"It is therefore the case that the Baltic States are suffering from the European Central Bank's low interest rate policy, which brought the loans and property bubbles to a head, but they are prevented from enjoying the true fruits of currency stability."
"I call upon you to take a political decision so that the euro can be introduced in the Baltic States on an exceptional basis."
"The small economies of these states are not a threat to the euro area."
"The threat is instability in the region, if these countries remain outside the euro area. Thank you for your attention."
"(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the very dangerous economic situation in the Republic of Latvia."
"Currently, there is a plan in the country to close 50% of the hospitals."
"In some regions, unemployment is at 25%."
"In Latgale, 50% of workers have been laid off."
"30% of police officers, 30% of schoolteachers and 30% of doctors have lost their jobs."
"The tax reforms, which are designed to increase taxes, will lead to the utter collapse of the economy."
"In this situation, instead of assistance, Latvia is being offered loans, which demand even more cuts to the very small budget."
"Things have now gone so far that some Swedish ministers are literally blackmailing the Latvian Government, demanding a reduction in funding."
"All this has led to a social explosion ..."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Parliament should be very concerned by the latest report from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation."
"Indeed, while some governments in the European Union, and most recently the Italian Government, continue to make immigration a criminal offence, violate the right to asylum and indiscriminately refuse entry, I believe that we need strong cooperation since it is a disgrace that the level of poverty described by the FAO in Africa, the Middle East and Asia still exists."
"Cooperation does not mean undertaking pointless projects which merely generate business for the same old companies, but helping these countries to emancipate themselves."
"Another disgrace which Parliament needs to address is the privatisation of water, something in which certain governments of the EU engage."
"Water is a resource that belongs to everyone, an essential resource and not a commodity at the service of the multinationals."
"(FR) Mr President, my speech concerns the deterioration in working conditions in Europe."
"Today, nearly half of the people working in the world earn less than USD 2 a day."
"12.3 million people are still victims of slavery, and more than 200 million children are forced to work."
"In Europe, the number of working poor is increasing day by day, and each year the International Labour Organisation records 160 000 deaths linked to a lack of prevention."
"In this context, I would like to emphasise our responsibility towards all those who are deprived of jobs and social rights, who work in unfit conditions, towards those millions of workers who suffer mentally and physically, who are, at times, driven to suicide, or who are victims of cancers or chronic diseases caused by their working conditions."
"It is time to break with the religion that dictates that we must work harder, and to stop the race to make profits and to compete in the short term."
"Guaranteeing the right to decent work and strengthening labour law must be the Union's top priority over the next 10 years."
"(PL) Mr President, the Food and Agriculture Organisation released a report recently in which it states that world food production must rise by at least 70% by 2050, or humanity will face the threat of famine."
"This is confirmation of an obvious truth."
"It is well known that there are increasing numbers of people in the world, while the amount of arable land available is falling."
"Meanwhile, European Union agricultural policy, under the guise of caring for market principles and improving the competitiveness of agriculture, is based on the systematic reduction of agriculture production in almost all of its sectors."
"In the context of world tendencies, this policy may turn out to be lethal, and may cause hunger in the not too distant future."
"I think that in the European Union, there is a need for a fundamental change in the political approach to agriculture and its problems."
"We must really care for the food security of our continent."
"Enough of the policy of restricting agriculture, because it is a policy which is short-sighted and devoid of imagination."
"(GA) Mr President, about this time three years ago, the British Government gave a commitment that they would bring in an Irish Language Act to protect and develop the Irish language in Northern Ireland."
"The legislation to protect the rights of Irish speakers is a significant part of the peace and reconciliation process."
"As such, the Irish language should have the same statutory protection as native languages in the South of Ireland, in Scotland and in Wales."
"Three years on, that legislation is still not in place."
"I would appreciate it if you, Mr President, could speak with the power-sharing executive in Belfast about the importance and influence of multilingualism in general."
"Eleven years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, and three years after the signing of the St Andrews Agreement, it is a matter of urgency for us that an Irish Language Act be put in place to normalise the rights of Irish language speakers in Northern Ireland."
"Thank you."
"Please submit a written request on this matter."
"Mr President, Wales is currently a major beneficiary of EU funding under the 2007-2013 Structural Funds programme."
"The money is largely directed towards developing sustainable economic growth and creating jobs."
"West Wales and the Valleys receives the highest level of support under the current Structural Funds, and rightly so."
"Many regard the UK as a wealthy place to live."
"Very few people know the reality of the scale of poverty and unemployment in Wales."
"The Valleys have all but been destroyed by the closure of big industries which, at one point, were the backbone of solid hardworking communities."
"Today, the mines are closed."
"The factories that grew up in their place are outsourcing work overseas."
"The communities that thrived on this employment have not just lost their jobs but also their sense of purpose and belonging."
"With more and more countries queuing up to join the EU, I am worried that Wales will see much-needed support go to newer member countries."
"I urge the Commission and the Council to ensure that Wales receives adequate funding, through a strong transitional settlement, when the current round of Structural Funds ceases in 2013."
"(DE) Mr President, the extraordinarily dangerous Temelín nuclear power plant, at which there have already been 127 incidents since 2000, is very close to where I come from in Upper Austria and there is another close to Vienna at Mochovce in the Slovak Republic."
"Together, they form an unpleasant cocktail of old Soviet design and American engineering."
"From a legal point of view, the whole issue is problematic, as environmental impact assessments are not carried out in compliance with European legislation in either country."
"The parties to the proceedings have no possibility of obtaining judicial review of the final decision."
"That contradicts Article 10 of the Community Directive on environmental impact assessments."
"I should like to take this opportunity to call on the Community to firmly oppose this construction project."
"(EL) Mr President, given the resumption and intensification of Doha Round negotiations and in the run-up to the WTO ministerial conference to be held in Geneva at the end of November, we call for an in-depth debate with the Commission so that we can jointly decide on the European Union's negotiating position in light of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We also call on the Commission, as far as the agricultural sector is concerned, to respect its negotiating mandate in full and for any offer on its part not to entail further reform and, more to the point, not to pre-empt the review in 2013."
"In other words, we do not want a premature reform of the common agricultural policy through the back door or imposed from on high."
"(HU) Mr President, it is commendable if a politician wishes to gain the maximum benefit for his or her country."
"We all do this, bearing in mind our voters' interests."
"However, this benefit cannot be gained to another person's detriment, and cannot, in any way, be the result of blackmail."
"Václav Klaus, the Czech President, has astonished us all with his tactics for blocking the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This man who started his political life as a reformer has come up with demands that bring shame on both him and his country."
"I feel it is unacceptable to link the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon with the immunity of the Beneš Decrees."
"The Beneš Decrees passed in 1945 applied the principle of collective punishment, which is alien to the European legal order."
"In accordance with these laws, millions of innocent civilians had their citizenship revoked and were forcibly deported from the land of their birth simply because their mother tongue was German or Hungarian."
"According to our European legal order, we cannot tolerate violation of human rights and personal freedom in any shape or form."
"However, this is what Václav Klaus is demanding from us."
"(EL) Mr President, the recent kidnap of Athanasios Lerounis, the president of the non-governmental organisation 'Greek Volunteers', is the last in a series of kidnaps in the chaotic area between Pakistan and Afghanistan which contains Polish, British, Spanish, Chinese and Canadian citizens, most of whom have not escaped death."
"The residents of this area, also known as Kafiristan, which means land of the infidels, are fighting to uphold their principles, traditions and customs in a hostile environment which is gradually taking over."
"Mr Lerounis and his team have been working effectively with the Kalash tribe for about fifteen years and have managed, during that time, to improve living conditions in this isolated community."
"We call on the members of the European Parliament to use their power and to help rescue a volunteer who has devoted much of his adult life to understanding a community in central Asia threatened with extinction."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two Member States - France and the United Kingdom - have announced their intention to send to Afghanistan refugees who came to Europe in an attempt to save their own lives."
"I do not believe that we can continue to stand back in the face of this very serious threat to their lives."
"The British newspaper, The Guardian, reported in October that some Afghan refugees expelled from Australia had been killed upon their arrival in their country."
"I believe that all of this goes completely against all of our international commitments."
"The European Commission itself said in an action plan dated June 2008 that legitimate measures to reduce illegal immigration should not result in refugees being denied access to protection within the European Union, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned the European Union against making any attempt to undermine the Geneva Convention and the other additional forms of protection that are designed to ensure that Afghan refugees are not deported to Afghanistan."
"A large number of MEPs, from four different groups, have signed an appeal along these lines."
"I call on you, Mr President, to talk to the European Commission, the United Kingdom and France, and our House, our Chamber, must take up this issue in order to prevent this crime against the right of asylum from being committed."
"Mr President, I would like to denounce the restrictions suffered by the Catalan language in the Spanish state."
"More specifically, I am referring to the Autonomous Government of the Valencian Community which, in 2007, closed the TV repeaters of La Carrasqueta and Mondúver."
"Some other TV repeaters will be closed in the coming months."
"These TV repeaters allow the reception of Catalan television in the Valencia region."
"The Valencian Autonomous Government is acting against the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which ensures the free circulation of television contents between European countries."
"Inside the EU, cultural freedom exists but, inside the Spanish state - for Catalan television - it does not exist."
"This is the sad paradox I wanted to share with all of you this afternoon."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'equal pay for equal work' is a principle of the 1957 Treaty establishing the European Community."
"This principle is still topical today because, although more and more women occupy managerial positions, there is still a blatant income divide."
"It is incomprehensible that women, merely because they are women rather than men, are paid a lower wage for the same work, especially the same standard of work."
"The benefit to a modern democratic society when it finally fully implements this principle, which we should rather call a demand, should be clear and obvious to everyone."
"I therefore think it is important for something to be done to improve current laws and wage transparency."
"One small example is Austria, where the income divide is about 28%."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to condemn an event that is without precedent in the ten year reign of King Mohammed VI in Morocco: the fact that a Moroccan military court is going to try seven Saharan independence activists for collaborating with the enemy, a charge that could carry the death penalty."
"This has not happened since the times of King Hassan II."
"A civilian has never been put in the dock in a military court."
"This means that repression is once again intensifying in this former Spanish colony."
"While the complicit silence of the European Union is very striking, what is even more serious is the silence of the Spanish Government, which is primarily to blame for the current situation in the Western Sahara due its abandonment of the area."
"My question is therefore a very direct one: is this the Moroccan regime with which we want to have a special relationship?"
"Is this the regime with which we want to establish a relationship of friendship and mutual respect?"
"How many more times can we and must we keep quiet in the face of what is happening in the Western Sahara?"
"Is this the way they intend to resolve the problems that are currently facing the whole of that population?"
"I think that it is precisely now, in the context of these negotiations, that we should give a clear, firm response to this situation."
"(RO) The European Union has 1 636 border points designated as checkpoints for entering EU territory and every year, approximately 900 million border crossings are made."
"I am actually from a region located at the European Union's external border and I am very much aware of the problems encountered by the customs authorities."
"This is why I believe that we must address this issue with utmost seriousness and review the Frontex agency's mandate."
"Frontex is currently facing a number of problems."
"For example, Member States must take a more active involvement in cooperating at the European Union's external borders."
"More attention must also be focused on cooperation with third countries which are, in many cases, the countries of origin or transit countries for illegal immigration."
"The Stockholm Programme actually helps reinforce the involvement of Frontex so that this agency will play a key role as part of the future integrated mechanism for monitoring the EU's borders."
"(PL) Mr President, in view of the increasing amount of freight moving from the north to the south of the continent, and the insufficient number of transport corridors, I should like to underline the significance of the Central European Transport Corridor, CETC Road 65."
"This encompasses road, inland waterway and rail transport through an area which links the Baltic Sea with the Adriatic and runs from Sweden through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia."
"The corridor would be an axis of regional development for the entire area through which it runs."
"It would fully accord with the principles of intermodality and would have a balanced influence on the natural environment."
"It would help increase the tempo of social and economic development in a large part of the European Union by increasing speed and volumes of trade between countries of the Baltic Sea region and countries of the Mediterranean and Adriatic region."
"It is my duty as an MEP, but also as a specialist who has been associated with the transport industry for years, to ask for support for the CETC project."
"It fully deserves to be included in the existing TNT network of Pan-European Transport Corridors."
"(FR) Mr President, following the dismantling of the 'jungle' camp in Calais at the end of September, I wish to denounce here the organisation, by France and the United Kingdom, of forced returns to Afghanistan, a country in total chaos."
"Like my colleague, Mr Désir, who spoke just now, I too call on the European Commission to put pressure on the Member States so that they stop putting these people's lives in grave danger by forcibly returning them to Afghanistan."
"We know that these migrants are unable to apply for asylum in France under the Dublin II Regulation because they are liable to be deported to Greece or Italy, where the detention conditions are unacceptable and the chances of them seeing their asylum applications succeed are slim."
"The only effect that dismantling the 'jungle' camp has had is to make the tragedy suffered by these migrants in need of protection even more traumatic."
"In contrast to the objectives set by the French authorities, these migrants have become more vulnerable as a result of the camp closure, and they are even more likely to be handed over to people traffickers who, for their part, are not in the least bit worried."
"Now more than ever, we must remember that the credibility of an asylum system is compromised if it fails to protect the people who need protection."
"Mr President, I welcome the endorsement by the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) of the recommendations of the Goldstone report and their call for an end to the illegal siege of Gaza, which is causing so much human suffering."
"I propose that our relevant parliamentary committees should now examine without delay what steps the European Union should be taking to ensure that the Goldstone recommendations are pursued in an effective way."
"I was shocked that four Member States of this Union - Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary and Slovakia - voted against the HRC resolution."
"Human rights and international law are not optional extras to be defended or ignored depending on the relevant political advantages."
"All our Member States must defend international law and human rights without fear or favour, otherwise our credibility is undermined as a force for justice in the world - and, indeed, as an honest interlocutor for peace in the Middle East."
"Finally, could I ask that, in the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty, you insist that no new agreements with Israel are signed by the Commission or the Council in the coming week."
"(PL) Mr President, in the second half of September this year, Russia and Belarus held military exercises codenamed 'West' 2009 and 'Lake Lagoda' 2009."
"It was the largest undertaking of its kind on the western borders of Russia since the end of the Cold War."
"Assault exercises on a similar scale last took place in 1981, at the height of the Cold War."
"It is interesting that the 'West' 2009 phase started on 18 September, which was almost to the day the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland."
"Part of the exercises were held at the mouth of the Bay of Gdańsk, and 'Lake Lagoda' 2009 is universally thought by experts to represent preparations for a potential attack on the Baltic countries and Finland."
"Despite openly hostile moves by the Russian Federation, both the European Union and NATO have remained passive."
"They still have not developed a strategy for defence in the event of an invasion from the east because some of the countries and NATO members consider the question too sensitive politically."
"In view of the approaching EU-Russia Summit, and also in view of the facts I have mentioned, I have submitted a question on the matter to the Council of the European Union."
"(ES) Mr President, agreements should be honoured and rules should bind everyone equally."
"This statement, which may seem obvious, is not so obvious in reality when we are talking about the Association Agreement between the European Union and Morocco, which contains consistent irregularities, as recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office."
"Spanish tomato producers, particularly in the Canary Islands, are going through a difficult time, and need the agreement to be honoured, but also want to know what the Commission plans to do about the new agreement that is still being negotiated: whether an increase has been offered in the preferential tomato quota and under what terms, whether the entry price system is going to be changed to prevent further breaches in the future, and whether the plant health requirements demanded of European producers are going to be enforced."
"Also, while we are talking about agreements, banana producers are also following negotiations, in some cases bilateral negotiations with third countries, with a great deal of concern, because such dealings could have irreparable consequences if they do not go hand in hand with compensatory measures."
"In both cases, the Commission cannot abandon its producers and we cannot allow that to happen."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the arrest of Mohammad Othman, a 33-year-old Palestinian human rights activist and supporter of the non-violent civil society campaign of boycott, divestment and sanctions."
"Mohammad Othman was arrested on 22 September by the Israeli authorities."
"Since then, his detention period has been repeatedly extended by the Israeli army."
"A military judge is due to rule on his detention on Tuesday 20 October - i.e. tomorrow."
"Mr President, on behalf of the European Parliament, I call on you to take action to ensure that this human rights activist, whose only crime is a thought crime, is released."
"This week, we are going to award the Sakharov Prize."
"Sadly, we cannot give the Sakharov Prize to all human rights campaigners, but at least let us offer them our support when their freedom is in jeopardy."
"(PL) Mr President, I speak today as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, and also as a member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"In this role, I appeal for continued, comprehensive consultations and efficient action on the matter of the digitalisation of books and the role of Google."
"We cannot allow our market, all that we have accomplished in this area in Europe, to be dominated by one firm."
"We must develop good legal instruments, which will protect the interests of our authors and publishers, and the European Union must do this together with others, especially with the United States, but also with other countries in today's globalised world."
"It is a question of our European literature, our culture, and our identity."
"We must develop these things, and act together to protect them."
"They are our European authors and our European publishers."
"The problem of digitalisation is too important to be decided only across the Atlantic."
"We must establish this legislation together, and we must devote the greatest attention to this matter."
"(RO) These days are crucial to the democratic development of the Republic of Moldova."
"The election of the president by the new parliament, scheduled for 23 October, was postponed due to a lack of competition."
"Once again, by resorting to subversive tactics through not put forwarding a candidate, the Communist Party is attempting to sabotage the path to democracy."
"It is our duty to monitor the entire process closely to ensure that the constitutional provisions are applied and that the Republic of Moldova passes the democratic test of elections."
"The strengthening of democracy in this country must be one of the priorities of the European Union in its neighbourhood policy."
"This can then serve as an example for the entire area to the east of the EU."
"It is our duty to offer this democratic government a new opportunity by providing it with the moral and technical support that it needs."
"The most appreciated sign of this support would probably be to come up with a viable solution for giving the citizens of the Republic of Moldova access to the European Union."
"(SL) After some serious and careful thought, the voters of Ireland have ratified the Treaty of Lisbon with a two-thirds majority."
"We receive this news with pleasure and pride, as the Treaty will enable further enlargement."
"The only ones still making their minds up are President Václav Klaus and the Czech Constitutional Court."
"I come from the former Yugoslavia and I have memories of us supporting Czechoslovakia, not just when they played ice hockey against the Soviet Union, but on every occasion and in every context."
"From the time when the forces of the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia during the Prague Spring, we always showed solidarity with them."
"On this occasion, however, I cannot and must not do so, as that would be to the detriment of the European Union, my own country and any future candidate countries."
"I must express our concern publicly and say that we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed."
"For this reason, I call on the political leaders and the public opinion of both the current and future candidate countries to let the President of the Czech Republic know that he is toying with our destinies and with their destinies."
"It is high time that this game came to an end."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three years ago, on 23 October 2006, tens of thousands of people gathered in Budapest to celebrate in a dignified manner and commemorate the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and fight for freedom which our people waged against the Communist dictatorship."
"Three years ago, terrorists disguised in police uniforms without any identification insignia used banned weapons to disperse the crowd that was holding a peaceful commemoration."
"This was presumably under the political order of the party which has succeeded the Communist dictatorship."
"It took 50 years after 1956 for Hungarian blood to be shed again on the streets of Budapest."
"On Friday of this week, 23 October, at 15.00, several thousand people will commemorate the events of 1956 again on Deák Square."
"We Jobbik MEPs, along with several fellow Members, such as Andreas Mölzer and Bruno Gollnisch, will monitor at this location the physical safety of those attending the commemoration."
"However, I would like the European Parliament to send observers and I would ask Mr Buzek in particular to draw the Hungarian police chiefs' attention to observing the European Convention on Human Rights."
"(MT) The past weeks have witnessed a number of violent incidents in the Holy City of Jerusalem, in the Al Aksa area."
"Both sides are pointing fingers at each other as to who is to blame, who the instigator is, and who is ultimately responsible for these violent acts."
"As frequently happens in this region, one incident can quickly escalate into a crisis."
"Let us not forget, in fact, that the most recent Palestinian intifada took place right after the incidents in Al Aksa."
"In a situation such as this, I believe that we must analyse our duties as the European Parliament."
"We are duty bound to take a clear stand against all unilateral measures and to ensure we put a stop to all international law violations immediately."
"Experience has taught us that in situations like these, we should not remain silent."
"(SK) For three and a half months, Slovakia has been subjected to a brutal campaign of discreditation concerning the amendment to the national language law."
"EPP Vice-President, Viktor Orban, said in Romania in July that Hungarian foreign policy must treat this matter as a serious instance of 'casus belli' which translates as 'a cause for war'."
"One week later, the former Hungarian ombudsman for ethnic minorities, Jenö Kaltenbach, stated that all of the minorities in Hungary had suffered a complete loss of identity, unable to speak their own languages and unaware of their own history."
"The words of the former ombudsman did not provoke the slightest political or media debate."
"Greater Hungarian nationalists are not interested in the rights of minorities in Hungary but only in the rights of Hungarian minorities in other countries."
"The innocent people living in the south of Slovakia have, in this way, become hostages to these nationalists and their dreams of a politically reunited Hungarian nation."
"(PT) Regional differences remain a challenge in the context of an enlarged European Union."
"For this reason, it is essential that cohesion policy supports those regions and Member States that are less developed."
"That is why we are extremely apprehensive about the recent amendment to the General Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund proposed by the Portuguese Government to the European Commission."
"This amendment establishes exceptions to the general rule on the geographical eligibility of expenditure relating to operations with a spillover effect and those relating to technical assistance, allowing funds destined for the convergence regions of Northern Central Portugal, Alentejo and the Azores, to be actually disbursed in the Lisbon area."
"This amendment may constitute a violation of the principle of economic and social cohesion - a principle that is a cornerstone of the European project."
"(FI) Mr President, I am concerned about freedom of religion in Turkey."
"Turkey's possible membership of the EU depends on its fulfilment of all the Copenhagen criteria."
"Recently, the country has seemed less willing to improve the situation with regard to its human rights and freedom of religion because of internal tensions."
"There has also been negligence in the investigation of crimes against churches."
"What is more, the Orthodox Church, for example, is still unable to choose its Patriarch freely and irrespective of nationality, and there are ever more attempts to place restrictions on clerics as regards wearing their priestly garb in public."
"Concrete measures are to be expected of Turkey in talks on its membership, measures which would demonstrate that it understands and recognises the value of the European cultural heritage, even on Turkish soil."
"For that reason, Turkey should immediately allow the Halki Seminary, for example, to continue to function and, furthermore, restore the protection of church property."
"(RO) The surveys published by the European Commission indicate that the current account deficits of the large majority of European Union Member States are expected to exceed the 3% of GDP limit during 2009 and 2010."
"Similarly, in 2010, an average level of public debt of 80% is envisaged for the 27 Member States and of more than 80% for the countries in the euro area."
"In the case of Eastern European countries, however, the need to curb the recession clashes with the duty to comply with the Maastricht criteria."
"In fact, a discrepancy can be seen between the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact for the countries in the euro area, where deficits and public debt are on the rise, and the extremely stringent standards imposed on those wishing to join the euro area."
"It is therefore necessary to adapt the Maastricht criteria to the current climate and economic realities characterised by larger cyclical movements."
"Adapting the Maastricht criteria and providing quicker access for Eastern European countries to the euro area would strengthen the European Union and continue the integration process."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to speak about accidents at work in Greece and Europe."
"The shortcomings and negligence of shareholders, control mechanisms and national and Community authorities in applying health and safety regulations is criminal."
"The statistics for my country, Greece, are tragic."
"There were 142 fatal accidents in 2008 and there have been more than 56 since the beginning of 2009."
"At a time when lives are being lost, companies, the national authorities and the Commission are addressing the issue in a very relaxed manner and crimes are basically going unpunished; crimes for the sake of profits, such as the crime which France Telecom has been committing since February 2008."
"Last week, another worker, just 25 years old, committed suicide due to the intolerable working conditions."
"What does the Commission have to say about that?"
"Had it been a different matter, it would have intervened."
"That is why I call on the Bureau and my fellow members to observe a minute's silence at some point during the three-day plenary for the victims of France Telecom and other accidents at work."
"Mr President, last month, I informed the plenary of the discovery of the remains of Cypriot soldiers who, during the invasion of 1974, were photographed surrendering to the Turkish army, alive and well."
"In a new development, the European Court of Human Rights has found Turkey guilty of cruel and inhumane behaviour towards the relatives of missing soldiers of that period by failing to investigate and inform the relatives about their fate."
"Turkey was ordered to pay compensation in this regard."
"I call again on this Parliament to urge the Turkish army to provide its records to the UN Committee on Missing Persons for the resolution of this humanitarian issue."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you for asking the Belgian and French authorities to provide me with police protection."
"To feel the solidarity of the institutions when you are on the frontline fighting a phenomenon such as the mafia in Italy, which has resulted in many victims over many years, is really important in my view, and I offer my heartfelt thanks."
"However, for some time, Mr President, mafia organisations have been a global phenomenon: not just through money laundering, but also through their permanent presence in various European countries, and also via immigration."
"When, on 16 July this year, I called for the establishment of a committee of inquiry into mafia organisations in Europe, I did so with the aim not only of serving my country, but also the European Community, in the belief that a lack of vigilance when it comes to organised crime associations such as the mafia could have a negative impact on citizens' quality of life and safety and on development mechanisms."
"And it is strange, I have finished, Mr President ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Thank you."
"I would like to say that I have also asked the authorities in Brussels to increase vigilance around the European Parliament, because we have had an unfortunate incident recently."
"The Brussels authorities have replied very positively to the European Parliament's request, and talks are also being held on this subject."
"(RO) The report published to mark World Food Day indicates that one in six people are suffering from hunger and the number of undernourished people in the world has passed the 1-billion mark, while the number of people blighted by famine has risen by 100 million in just one year."
"During this entire period, the World Food Programme has been facing a 50% drop in international donations compared with 2008, which is having a serious impact on the volume of food aid being supplied to poor countries."
"The European Union is the leading campaigner against global famine."
"Its position was strengthened by the commitment made at the G8 summit in L'Aquila to provide EUR 2 billion, which is in addition to the EUR 1 billion Food Facility."
"This is a large sum, but is still far from what would be required to meet the objective set by the UN, which is to halve the number of people suffering from endemic hunger."
"A much broader political effort is required to mobilise the resources of all the major industrialised powers in the world."
"I believe that a Marshall Plan is an absolute necessity with a much more specific and tangible objective, which is to help the billion of our fellow human beings suffering from hunger rise above the subsistence threshold."
"Mr President, the missile defence project of the former US Administration, of which Europe has been made part, was fiercely contested by Russia, which chose to see in it a move directed against it, and by some Europeans who were upset because the Russians were upset."
"The Obama Administration is trying to address such a position by shifting defence from the long-range to the short- and medium-range missile threat, thus increasing the direct protection of Europe, and apparently by accepting Russian cooperation through providing a radar facility in the Caucasus."
"Still some Europeans contest the project, ignoring its new orientation."
"Russia has not spoken yet."
"I only wish that the European position is not moulded only by this fact, but reflects a genuine search to find the best way to protect European soil from this real threat, in cooperation with the US, and with Russia, too, if the latter is willing."
"Mr President, last year, this House debated the use of whole-body scanners at airports and subsequently the European Commission withdrew its proposal in this regard."
"Recently, at Manchester Airport, a new trial was started and legal advice has now been given that to use these machines on minors could be in breach of child safety and protection legislation because of the nature of the image produced."
"Similar cases of this nature took place in 2005 and 2006 by the Action on Rights for Children group, which resulted in the banning of the use of body scanners on under-18 year olds."
"Since the very raison d'être for these machines has now been compromised by this legal advice - and I address this directly to Commissioner Barrot - is it not now time that the Commission ruled that the use of these types of scanner in the EU should not be allowed, since my constituents travelling anywhere in the Union should not be subject to this indecent and degrading treatment?"
"I also call for a global ban on such technology in order to protect all EU citizens."
"(HU) Mr President, last year I protested against religious fanaticism and the persecution of Christian minorities, and I am doing the same again this year."
"Having heard about the most recent anti-Christian acts in India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey, allow me to speak out again against the continuing atrocities in the name of religious exclusivism, which are being perpetrated in general by Muslim and Hindu fanatics against our fellow Christians."
"However, in India, in the states of Orissa and Gujarat, both practising Christians and Muslims are suffering severe persecution."
"In Transylvania, Romania, where I come from, religious freedom was proclaimed by the Edict of Torda in 1568."
"Religious freedom is both an individual and a collective human right."
"Jesus says: 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice'."
"According to the teachings of our faith, I call on Jerzy Buzek, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the European Commission to ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the imminent closure of Independent Network News, a Dublin-based news agency providing a first-rate national and international news service to the majority of Ireland's local radio stations, raises serious and legitimate questions about the ownership, plurality and regulation of the media in Ireland."
"Local radio stations in Ireland are required to ensure that 20% of their news content is national and international."
"This service has largely been supplied by INN in recent years."
"On foot of INN's demise, the Newstalk station owned by Communicorp - which is also a major shareholder in INN - has been awarded the contract to provide a replacement service for the next six months."
"UTV, whose withdrawal from INN precipitated the service's demise, has also been centrally involved in the efforts to source a replacement service."
"The National Union of Journalists has raised important questions over the appropriateness of the involvement of these two bodies in this process, in the context of diversity of media ownership in Ireland."
"These questions must be fully explored."
"(SK) I would like to warn you that representatives of Hungary are attempting to provoke Slovakia."
"On 21 August 20 years ago, a Soviet and Hungarian army invaded the former Czechoslovakia."
"On the very same day this year, Hungarian President Sólyom, despite the reservations of three senior representatives of the Slovak Republic, was preparing to take the provocative step of unveiling a statue of a Hungarian king on the ethnically mixed territory of Slovakia."
"Today, he is protesting that he was denied entry into Slovakia."
"On a visit to Slovakia last week, Viktor Orban, head of the leading Hungarian political party Fidesz, called on the Hungarian minority to undertake autonomy-related initiatives."
"He called for joint planning over the future of Hungarians in the Carpathian basin."
"This is a revival of the idea of Greater Hungary - a provocation that has no place in a modern Europe."
"It is playing with fire and the European institutions must not turn a blind eye to it."
"(RO) I would like to say that there is no specific mention made of sport in the Treaty of Lisbon, and particularly of football, an activity which has a huge social and cultural influence."
"I would like to tell you that there is no legal basis for an EU policy on sport."
"In actual fact, sports are governed by the rules of the relevant sports associations, but I believe, Mr President, that it must be clearly specified in the Treaty that activities and the organisation of sports activities should operate according to the rules of the relevant sports associations, while any activities linked to these sports activities should operate according to civil regulations and laws."
"The debate is closed."
"Evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis - Establishment of an evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis (debate)"
"Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of a mechanism for evaluating Schengen that will improve the system currently in place and make it more efficient, so as to ensure that the Schengen acquis can be applied more transparently and coherently."
"Nevertheless, I am disappointed with the proposals put forward by the European Commission."
"In essence, these proposals maintain the rules relating to the first part of the mandate without making any changes and, with regard to the second part of the mandate, or the evaluation of how the Schengen acquis is being implemented by the Member States that are already part of the Schengen area, they merely incorporate the recent improvements to the current evaluation mechanism."
"Indeed, the only new thing, which I applaud, is the possibility of carrying out unannounced visits."
"As far as the evaluation process is concerned, these proposals transfer the role currently played by the Council wholly into the hands of the Commission, allowing very limited forms of cooperation with the Member States, and removing the European Parliament from the entire process, without demonstrating what is being gained by these steps."
"I am also concerned that we are moving towards the total separation of the evaluation mechanisms for each part of the mandate, which could jeopardise the efficiency and consistency of the system."
"Countries that wish to join Schengen should not be subject to different rules and systems of evaluation to those that are already in it."
"There are also data protection problems."
"I shall give just three examples: firstly, the item about the security of consular facilities is incomplete, as the facilities of external companies, when outsourcing is involved, are not covered."
"Secondly, the security requirements proposed for the Schengen Information System (SIS) should also be included in the item about visas."
"Thirdly, Article 7 of the regulation should include not only the risk analysis but also the audits and reports on the security inspections carried out by the Member States in accordance with the rules introduced by the statutory instruments of the SIS and the Visa Information System (VIS)."
"Besides the problems I have mentioned here, and the improvements that could be made, there is a fundamental problem in that the role given to the European Parliament is an irrelevant one."
"According to our Legal Service, the Commission's choice of legal basis is legitimate."
"However, it would also be possible to apply the codecision procedure for the draft regulation."
"Political will is the only deciding factor between the two possibilities."
"After all, if the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force, which is to be expected in the short term, these proposals will have to be made into a single proposal and resubmitted, since the pillar structure will be eliminated."
"We should not forget that we are discussing the security of the area of freedom, security and justice, which should involve all Member States and all the European institutions."
"Hence, codecision is the right procedure to choose."
"The European Parliament's role should not be merely accessory, but should rather reflect the influence that it wields when it comes to adopting basic legislative instruments."
"I would like to conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for supporting this position for the European Parliament and I invite Vice-President Barrot, who has always shown respect for this Parliament, to resubmit these proposals, introducing not only improvements in terms of the content, but also establishing a proper role for the European Parliament as regards the procedure itself."
"Mr President, I will try to respond to the concerns expressed by Mr Coelho in his report."
"The evaluation mechanism is a key measure when it comes to preserving the integrity of the Schengen area and to maintaining mutual confidence between the Member States."
"That is why the Commission is proposing that the experts from the Member States be fully involved in planning the visits, the in situ visits, and in drafting the evaluation and follow-up reports."
"The Commission is, of course, convinced that Parliament should be involved in the Schengen evaluation, which is not the case at present."
"The citizens must have access to the results of these evaluations."
"That is why the Commission has offered to submit annual reports to Parliament indicating the conclusions reached following each evaluation and the progress of the corrective measures."
"So that is the first response."
"It is true that Mr Coelho raised the issue of codecision for Parliament."
"The treaties currently in force do not permit this."
"However, although there is no codecision as yet, the proposals do communitise the current mechanism."
"Through these proposals, the mechanism can be made more effective with regard to planning, the in situ visits and the follow-up given to the evaluations."
"Moreover, the role of the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, will be enhanced."
"However, Mr Coelho, this enhanced role is being challenged strongly by the Council."
"Therefore, under the treaties in force, two parallel proposals were required, since the Schengen acquis covers both the first and the third pillars."
"The Commission considered that Article 66 of the EC Treaty, which provides for consultation of the European Parliament, was the correct legal basis for the proposal of the first pillar."
"This legal basis was chosen as the correct one for the current Schengen evaluation mechanism when the Schengen acquis was integrated into the European Union framework by the 'breakdown' decision taken in 1999."
"Articles 30 and 31 of the treaty were the ones chosen as a legal basis for the proposal of the third pillar."
"That is why we had to refer to two different articles for the evaluation of the first pillar and for that of the third pillar."
"The Commission, on the basis of the treaties in force and of the legal debates that derive from them, must stand by its proposals."
"It must be said, Mr Coelho, that, given the difficult negotiations at the Council regarding the enhanced role of the Commission, it is conceivable that they will not be concluded in the short term."
"We can hope, above all today, that this Treaty of Lisbon will be ratified, and then the matter will be reopened and the Commission will decide, when the time comes, what it considers to be the most appropriate legal basis for the proposed mechanism by involving the European Parliament as fully as possible."
"Obviously, when that time comes, the Commission will be able to submit amended or new proposals depending on the situation."
"As you know, I myself am generally very much in favour of this provision, which will enable your Parliament to act as a colegislator in most of the issues relating to justice, freedom and security."
"Clearly, I can only be in favour of a much more active role for Parliament."
"However, as things stand, I do not think that we could have done anything other than to propose this amendment on the current legal bases."
"Nevertheless, as I told you, the discussions at the Council are not easy; this is not because we did not want to involve the Member States, but because the Commission, in its role as guardian of the treaties, feels that it, too, is responsible for managing this entire evaluation mechanism, with the involvement of the Member States and, of course, Parliament."
"The creation of the Schengen zone was undoubtedly a huge step forward for several European Union countries."
"It brought along with it the concept of full liberty of movement for our citizens in a more realistic manner, and it could even be said that when a citizen travels within the Schengen area, he or she might almost feel as though they are travelling within their own country."
"However we are all aware that for an ambitious project such as this to succeed as it did, a substantial amount of hard work was put into it, and considerable sacrifice was made."
"Above all, when we chose to open our doors to each other, we had to place our trust in each other on an issue as delicate as this one, that is, the protection of our external borders."
"When it comes to external borders, trust is placed in a country and trust is gained in return."
"Therefore, when it comes to these reports, I agree with my colleague Carlos Coelho, in that they are meant to enhance the evaluation mechanism within the Schengen Area project; a project which is of great importance, and which is built upon mutual trust."
"Yet we also maintain that this evaluation needs to be carried out in an efficient and transparent manner."
"Moreover, it must involve Parliament, which must be allowed to exercise its full powers, especially now that we are, or potentially are, a few weeks away from the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I am certain, therefore, that the Commission will understand when we say that, considering that the Lisbon Treaty is close at hand, we expect proposals such as this one to fully respect all the powers that the European Parliament will wield under this Treaty."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (RO) The creation of an evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis is an important measure which will put into practice the decisions concerning the area of freedom, security and justice, especially the provisions of the Hague Programme."
"The draft proposals submitted for debate today are a variation of an evaluation mechanism."
"They include provisions specific to the targeted area, along with an adequate control methodology."
"However, a closer analysis highlights that certain principles of interinstitutional cooperation are being ignored, both at European Union level and between EU Member States."
"From this point of view, the proposal submitted includes provisions restricting cooperation between Member States with regard to evaluating the results from the application of the Schengen Agreement."
"At the same time, it increases unacceptably the role of the Commission in this process, while the European Parliament is kept outside the entire evaluation mechanism."
"Furthermore, the wording of some articles in the regulation leaves scope for different interpretations of the relationship between the Commission, Parliament and Council with regard to their access to information about the application of the Schengen acquis."
"Therefore, Article 14, aimed at sensitive information, emphasises that 'the reports drawn up following on-site visits shall be classified as restricted."
"The Commission, after consulting the Member State concerned, shall decide which part of the report can be made public.'"
"I also wish to mention in connection with these provisions that Article 16, which refers to the report submitted to the European Parliament and Council, does not imply that the annual report on the evaluations carried out will contain restricted information as well."
"We could therefore deduce that it is up to the Commission to assess which information will be included in the annual report and which not."
"This fact assigns the Commission functions which, in my view, are not justified."
"The Treaty of Lisbon will soon come into force and from then on, codecision will become the normal legislative procedure, which also covers the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The legislative proposals which we are debating at the moment contain provisions which conflict with the principles included in the Treaty."
"Consequently, these drafts, if they are approved now, will need to be reviewed at the time when the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force."
"Fellow Members, freedom, security and justice are areas of paramount importance to Europe's citizens whose interests are represented directly by the European legislative."
"Restricting the role of an institution like the European Parliament is wrong."
"I wish to conclude by supporting the proposal made by Mr Coelho, that this draft, in its current form, needs to be rejected and returned to the Commission."
"I propose to you that we support the draft resolution."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, our colleague, Mr Coelho, has yet again justified his middle name: Carlos 'Schengen' Coelho."
"He is our resident expert on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and we are very grateful for his work and his expertise."
"He has done very good forensic reports on these proposals and they highlight what an awful muddle the European Union is in regarding monitoring and evaluation."
"It certainly makes no sense to me that fitness to join the Schengen zone should lie exclusively in the hands of the Member States in any case, irrespective of any arcane split between pre- and post-Schengen accession."
"We are told in the Commission proposal for the regulation that 'as evaluation before putting into effect is fundamental for Member States in order to gain mutual trust, it seems reasonable for this to remain the responsibility of Member States'."
"But we do not leave it to Member States to evaluate the Balkan countries, for which this evening the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will vote on their fitness for visa waiver, for visa-free travel - it is the Commission which does the assessment and evaluation, so there is no consistency at all in saying that it should be in the hands of the Member States to judge other states."
"To be honest, I do not grasp this peculiar split between evaluation of 'putting into effect' measures necessary to join Schengen which, according to the Commission, has to remain intergovernmental, and checking the 'implementation' of the Schengen acquis."
"Certainly, it appears that the Member States do not do a very good job because we learn from the proposal for a decision that 'in recent years, Member States have not seen the need to carry out evaluations on the spot concerning judicial cooperation in criminal matters and drugs."
"Data protection has also not always been subject to on-site evaluations.'"
"I think there are many people not only in this House but beyond who would think that issues to do with criminal cooperation, drugs, tackling drug smuggling and protection of privacy are rather important matters to have on-the-spot inspections about."
"So I entirely support the conclusions of Carlos Coelho that we need to bring all this together, to have a consolidation of the procedures by which this evaluation is done, to consolidate the task between the first and the third pillar - and I hope that soon the phrase 'third pillar' will be consigned to history and I never have to say it again - to have one simple, effective, efficient and transparent evaluation and to ensure that the transparency includes accountability to the European Parliament."
"It is most strange that at this juncture, on the eve of what I am now convinced will be the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty - and I did my bit in the UK House of Lords last year, by the way - the Commission should put forward this extremely muddled and senseless set of proposals."
"I support the rejection and I request the Commission to come back with a better proposal that takes account of the Lisbon Treaty, takes account of codecision, takes account of simplicity and effectiveness in monitoring and is consistent with the Commission's and Parliament's responsibilities in other areas."
"It begs the whole question of the way peer review is done in this European Union of the 27 Member States."
"As I say, that bears looking at, including in the human rights area, because we do not seem to have any clear principles and structures and simply adopt different things in different areas."
"Much as I love the Member States, I am afraid they often adopt a practice of 'I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine', which means they do not criticise each other, so actually they are not good people to evaluate each other."
"The Commission, when it works at its best, is the one to do it."
"As I have a few seconds left, I would like to challenge Mr Bradbourn from the ECR Group on an issue of free movement."
"He called for a global ban on so-called 'naked body scanners'."
"It would have helped if he had been at the vote last year when his colleagues opposed a ban on the use of these body scanners without a fundamental review of human rights."
"His colleagues voted against that ban."
"Mr Bradbourn was not even present at the vote, so it is a bit rich for him to go on about it now."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I also want to thank our colleague, Carlos Coelho, for his report."
"We do indeed need a simple and effective, transparent mechanism for the Schengen evaluation."
"I agree that the Commission should play a more active role in the evaluation mechanism which Mr Barrot just talked about."
"Nevertheless, we parliamentarians have a number of concerns."
"You know that our Green Group has a very strong position concerning personal data protection."
"The Commission forgot to mention outsourcing when speaking about the security of consular premises."
"It has also forgotten about IT security provisions for these."
"Besides the annual evaluation programme, Article 7 of the regulation must take into account not only the risk analysis provided by FRONTEX but also the audits and inspections conducted by Member States themselves."
"Therefore, we demand that data protection concerns be taken into account."
"When speaking about the codecision procedure and the proposal of Mr Coelho, our group, the Green/EFA Group, fully supports his position."
"I shall not remind you about the role of the European Parliament as an elected institution."
"We have heard already that, under the Lisbon Treaty, the codecision procedure will be the only option."
"We fully support the rapporteur and we also support his proposal."
"The Schengen Area is 20 years old - or nearly 20 years old - and it has been evaluated for 10 years, first by a standing committee, and then by the Evaluation Group."
"It is, therefore, high time that we improved the evaluation procedures and responded to concerns about the Schengen area."
"It is a shame that the Commission, on approaching this anniversary, has failed to do enough work or make much progress in creating a more effective and comprehensive evaluation mechanism which would be able to respond not only to the concerns raised in the early years of the Schengen area, such as efficiency and cohesion among Member States and a certain equivalence of procedures, but also concerns about transparency, control by citizens (democratic control) and, finally, concerns about respect for human rights, which are extremely dear to this House."
"There are well-founded concerns that greater efficiency has been achieved at the cost of citizens' rights, and it is high time that we bridged this gap."
"I would also like to talk briefly about codecision."
"The European Commission and all the others that defended the Treaty of Lisbon, extolling its democratic virtues, are now facing the test of whether they can make good their promises and allow more parliamentary and democratic control over the Schengen evaluation processes."
"I cannot, however, support the conclusions of the rapporteur, our fellow Member, Carlos Coelho."
"I believe that he does European democracy good service in exhorting the Commission to rework its proposals and deliver something that is simpler, more effective, more transparent, more respectful of human rights, and which provides greater parliamentary and democratic control."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, it is not very often that I find myself agreeing with something said by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"They are saying that these proposals on the evaluation mechanisms and on the Schengen acquis are pointless because, after the Lisbon Treaty is fully ratified, they will be changed anyway."
"After the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, the first and third of the so-called three pillars of different policy areas will be consolidated into one."
"The implementation of Lisbon will no doubt see attempts to use it as a tool to apply the Schengen acquis across all the Member States, including those currently exempted, which includes the United Kingdom."
"You will notice that I said 'when the Lisbon Treaty is implemented' and not 'if'."
"It seems that the one Head of State holding out against it, the valiant President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic, will be browbeaten into giving his consent shortly."
"Britain's own traitorous Labour Government has reneged on its promise to give the British people a referendum on Lisbon and the one person who could hold out the hope of a referendum, David Cameron, does not have the courage, principle or inclination to do so."
"The UK has a completely uncontrolled, unlimited and chaotic immigration and asylum system."
"As a Member State of the European Union, we no longer control our own borders and under Lisbon, the tidal wave of immigration that we have experienced will become a tsunami."
"So this report will make no difference whatsoever to anything and the comments made by the committee and the Parliament will be ignored by the Commission."
"I have heard the words 'freedom, liberty and justice' bandied around in this debate."
"What freedom is there when the citizens are not consulted on their new constitution under the Lisbon Treaty because they would reject it?"
"What liberty is there in laws made by undemocratic institutions that cannot be removed by the voter?"
"What justice is there when, under the European arrest warrants, national courts have been stripped of their powers to protect their own citizens from unjust arrest and imprisonment?"
"This Union is an Orwellian creation where words mean the opposite of what is said."
"(DE) Mr President, we need a democratic revolution."
"You just heard what the previous speaker said; we often see that when you go too far too fast, you achieve the opposite of what you were actually trying to achieve."
"The motto of this group is that if the European Union develops too fast, it will result in precisely what it does not want, namely new nationalism."
"That is what we are seeing at the moment in my country."
"I come from what has become a divided country; in the west, in Voralberg and a bit beyond, we are happy about the open borders, while in the east, you can see that we have gone too far too fast with Schengen."
"What we are getting in return is new revanchism and nationalism in my country and elsewhere."
"We must not hide behind technical debates."
"We need to face up to these challenges."
"Of course, this must necessarily mean that the European Parliament is granted codecision rights and that you, Commissioner, must wait until we have this codecision or it is at least granted to us by default."
"(ES) Mr President, I congratulate and support Carlos Coelho, and I would like to point out that this report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The Council's proposal has a bearing on the second part of the mandate given to the Schengen Evaluation Working Group, which is to confirm that the acquis communautaire is being correctly applied following the lifting of internal border controls."
"The aim of this mandate is to make the Schengen evaluation mechanism more efficient."
"Evaluation of the correct application of the Schengen acquis has a legal basis in third pillar elements, while other aspects of the acquis have their legal basis in first pillar instruments."
"In my view, the proposed legal basis is correct, but it does not seem to be very consistent with the more than significant entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, when the functions and powers currently shared between the two pillars will be consolidated."
"The proposal scarcely contains any new elements that differentiate it from the evaluation mechanism that is currently in force, and Carlos has mentioned them ex novo."
"However, it introduces a change that is obviously significant, as the document that is before us would mean transferring the functions currently carried out by the Council to the Commission."
"This transfer of powers means de facto that Parliament and the Member States themselves are sidelined in the evaluation process, despite the fact that they are the ones with power over the security of their external borders."
"Parliament, which represents European citizens, plays an essential, leading role in security matters."
"Our task is important, and this is recognised in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Consequently, Mr President, what we want is to wait three months, because if we wait three months, there will be no need to reopen the case."
"Mr President, another question: I have just seen the Vice-President putting on a pullover, and it is freezing cold here."
"I must excuse myself because I have to leave, but I am not leaving because I do not want to follow the debate, but because I am starting to get bronchitis, which is no good at all, so I would be grateful if you could do something about it Mr President."
"(SK) Perhaps it is cold here also because the Commission takes very little account of our Parliament and the opinions of our Parliament."
"Perhaps our relations will become warmer in the future."
"I believe that this situation and this discussion are not very pleasant for the Commissioner, for it seems we all share the same opinion, or at least a majority of us share it."
"All the same, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report."
"The creation of the Schengen area really did bring freedom of movement for our citizens within the Schengen area and, in my opinion, was one of the greatest successes in European history."
"Much remains to be done, however."
"The ending of internal border controls requires complete security and also trust between the various parties in relation to their ability to carry out the necessary measures."
"The creation of a monitoring and evaluation mechanism is therefore very important if we are to win the support of Member State citizens."
"This agenda is very often exploited by right-wing extremists, who spread claims that the Schengen area actually allows various criminals to penetrate into the countries that are inside the area, and the citizens of our states quite justifiably ask us how we intend to prevent this happening in the future."
"Reinforcing the principle of interinstitutional coordination is also a very important point which the Commission rather suppresses in its proposal, which is clearly detrimental because, as a number of previous speakers have already said, we all believe that the Lisbon Treaty will soon enter into force and therefore it would be good if this context could be incorporated."
"We also see no reason why the European Parliament should not receive in the annual report all of the relevant information - unfortunately, the Commission has failed to incorporate this principle of democracy into its opinion."
"Therefore, like the rapporteur, my preference is for the draft to be returned to the Commission and for us to insist that a joint decision-making process be incorporated into it and that the entire principle be simplified and the entire process made more transparent."
"(SV) Mr President, like Mr Coelho and many other fellow Members, I would like to emphasise that the creation of the Schengen area during the 1980s and 1990s was one of the most important reforms of our time."
"Jean Monnet, one of the EU's most important figures, is purported to have said that the goal of a European Union is not to bring nations together, but to bring people together."
"Over the centuries, people's movement has been severely curtailed in Europe."
"Suspicion of our fellow men has dominated relations between the countries of Europe."
"Trust between the countries has, at times, been decidedly lacking."
"Mistrust, rather than trust, has typified relations."
"Fortunately, this is in the past and we are now seeing new possibilities for Europe."
"Most of us here in the European Parliament have, for a long time, had the opportunity to avail ourselves of the freedoms that the Schengen area provides."
"It is easy to forget the unique level of trust between the States that formed the basis of its creation."
"It is easy to forget the arduous road to get to that point."
"However, free movement is a prerequisite for people to be able to meet across national boundaries."
"Mr President, as Mr Coelho so rightly said, it is, of course, important for there to be an effective and transparent evaluation mechanism for the Schengen acquis so that the area remains, and develops into, an area defined by free movement."
"However, the basis of Schengen is trust between the States involved in the cooperation, not the mechanism itself."
"It is important for this mechanism to be both effective and transparent and I therefore see a problem with the Commission's proposal."
"The problem is that the Council's current role is transferred to the Commission and that the scope for cooperation is severely reduced."
"However, my most serious objection is that we, the popularly elected representatives in the European Parliament, are excluded from the process."
"We are talking about something as technical as an evaluation mechanism, but we must not forget that this concerns the basic foundation of European cooperation: freedom, security and justice."
"It is therefore important for us all to be involved in taking new decisions in this area."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to take note of the criticism expressed here in this Chamber."
"I urge the Commission to come up with a new and better proposal as quickly as possible."
"The substance of a new proposal must be that any amendments to the evaluation mechanism must be the subject of codecision between the Commission, the Member States and, in particular, the popularly elected representatives in the European Parliament."
"(EL) Mr President, the Commission proposal aims to strengthen the role of the Schengen Evaluation Working Group by making this mechanism more efficient and transparent so as to safeguard the effective and consistent application of the Schengen acquis."
"However, it is curious that, free movement within the European Union notwithstanding, it is, at the same time, pushing for the establishment of a system which is far from meeting all the procedures for respecting human rights."
"The difficulty we have in evaluating the application of the Schengen acquis lies precisely in the difficulty we have in accepting that it makes provision for the exchange of sensitive information, the 'personal files' and repressive mechanisms which have been created with the excuse of the protection of, and free movement in, the European area."
"The Commission is right to worry."
"Abolishing controls on the internal borders depends on adequate compensatory measures in terms of strengthening controls on the external borders and cooperation between the police, customs and courts."
"It has also meant, and it still means, a constant exchange of information and the use of biometric visas for entry into the European Union."
"We consider that any evaluation must take account of the advisability of all the relevant measures taken and should not just verify their application."
"Under no circumstances shall we agree to a proposal which, if approved, will give greater legitimacy to what are mainly repressive measures via mechanisms for their evaluation."
"Mr President, I always thought being an MEP was a waste of time, but this really takes the biscuit here this evening."
"We are here talking about something that does not really matter, because the Lisbon Treaty - which you know you have bullied your way through - is going to come into force within the next month or so and we are going to have to debate this again."
"So here we are, wasting our time, thank you very, very much."
"Let us take a critical look at the Schengen Agreement and what that has actually meant for Europe: it has allowed criminals, people traffickers and drug dealers to travel across thousands of miles unaided; it has allowed camps such as Sangatte and the Jungle to develop on the other side of the English Channel, with people living in deplorable conditions."
"I hope you are proud of yourself."
"You would be aware of the 1951 Convention on Refugees that says that a refugee should claim asylum in the first safe country - but you disregard that."
"You disregard international law and you purport to be a responsible legal personality, as Lisbon would make you."
"Come on, pull the other one: this place is a joke!"
"The people of the United Kingdom want to control its own borders; it has had enough of being ruled by you."
"I leave you with this warning: the British people are a just, tolerant and trusting people, but when you push us too far, we fight back."
"And when we fight back, we win."
"(NL) Madam President, a more efficient evaluation mechanism for the application of the 'Schengen acquis' is certainly needed, but I have the impression that we are busy discussing the sex of angels here while the EU's external borders are full of holes."
"This certainly has more to do with the lack of political will to monitor external borders effectively on the part of the governments of most Member States and the EU itself than it does with the lack of efficient evaluation mechanisms."
"We all know that there are some Member States who are unable or unwilling to protect their EU external borders against illegal immigration."
"We all know that there are some governments who are undermining the whole Schengen system through the mass regularisation of illegal aliens."
"I would cite the examples of the Zapatero Government in Spain and also the governments of Italy, the Netherlands and, last but not least, Belgium."
"The Belgian Government is currently preparing to regularise new illegal immigrants on a massive scale and is thereby putting the whole system at risk, since the illegal immigrants thus regularised are able to settle wherever they wish in the European Union."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the modernisation of the Schengen Information System is becoming a nightmare."
"With the further expansion of the EU, there is a growing risk of terrorism and organised crime and higher levels of security must therefore be a priority."
"It is reprehensible that the changeover to the new database is again being delayed."
"The system contains data on missing persons, stolen goods and judicial proceedings."
"The current system has been in operation since 1995 and was developed for up to 18 countries."
"I applaud the flexibility of the Commission, which has made the Schengen expansion possible, despite the delays with SIS II."
"The incorporation of the nine new Member States was possible only under exceptional conditions, of course."
"The second version of the system is delayed at least until 2011."
"It is supposed to bring improvements in administration, flexibility, security and data storage capacities, as well as providing other new functionalities."
"It will enable other states to join, including a link to Great Britain and Ireland."
"The FRONTEX agency must also have all the powers it needs for combating illegal immigration effectively."
"Nevertheless, I have reservations over the communitarisation of the Schengen Working Group, because I am concerned that it will lead to Member States abandoning their responsibility to provide controls."
"On the other hand, I would like to draw your attention to the experience of Czech citizens, as I know of cases where German and Austrian police officers have harassed Czech drivers without reason."
"I regret that President Klaus is nonsensically delaying ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, but it is clear that soon after that happens, the Commission will have to submit the legislation again, this time under the codecision procedure of the European Parliament."
"I am therefore now in favour of rejecting the submitted texts, as proposed by Mr Coelho, and I congratulate him on a fine report."
"(PL) Madam President, the word 'Schengen' has been heard over and over again in this Chamber."
"Most of us agree that Schengen has been a great success, and that for the people of the new countries, the new Member States of the European Union, this means the significant success of integration."
"However, at the same time, Schengen is an enormous obligation, and it is the new countries which have taken it on - the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria."
"Responsibility for the eastern land border of the European Union rests on the new Member States, and they are meeting this obligation extremely well."
"However, I would like to talk about something which has not been mentioned in this Chamber."
"What is for us a matter of admiration and pride - I mean Schengen and freedom of movement - is a nightmare and a source of huge problems for all those who are covered by the visa policy and the need to obtain what are called 'Schengen visas'."
"I am talking about the residents of Ukraine, Moldova and other countries to the east, who want to come to the European Union."
"Schengen visas have been introduced, but they cost a great deal."
"For these visas, people in those countries have to pay roughly as much as they earn per month."
"They are subjected to a humiliating procedure for obtaining these visas, and they have to stand in gigantic queues."
"This, too, is Schengen."
"For them, Schengen means humiliation, a wall and a problem."
"In order to establish a system to evaluate the function of Schengen policy, I would like at least to mention matters related to visa policy."
"I would like to evaluate this."
"Perhaps there was some kind of justification for this, but we do not know how long this policy will be in force, and I would like to evaluate how we introduced such instruments, which separate us from many people who quite naturally want to come to our area, to the Schengen area."
"Although this is not the subject of the report, I wanted to say these words here during today's debate."
"(DE) Madam President, as you know, there are now 28 countries, including 25 EU Member States, which have done away with passenger traffic controls at common borders."
"This degree of freedom of movement obviously depends on broad-based trust between the states concerned."
"It is absolutely necessary for the free movement of passenger traffic to be sustainably regulated by effective flanking measures."
"Of central importance in this context is efficient supervision and control of the external borders, which - as we know - are to be carried out to a uniform standard through the Schengen Information System and by introducing harmonised entry requirements for third country nationals."
"However, we are still miles away from that."
"Compliance with accompanying mechanisms is therefore an essential factor for the security of EU citizens."
"My country, Austria, is particularly affected, due to its geographical proximity to the eastern European states."
"You only need think in this context of the latest incidents during the confiscation of a refrigerated lorry in Austria, which was found to contain 64 illegal Kurdish immigrants being smuggled from Turkey, via Hungary and Austria, to Germany."
"This case shows how important it is to be able to rely on proper and effective control of external borders and how rare that is the case."
"In internal affairs, we also have to battle with increasing crime in numerous regions of Europe which, increasingly often, stems from organised, cross-border gangs."
"This being so, I believe that we should carefully consider temporarily re-introducing controls at internal borders."
"As you know, this proved to be very effective during the 2008 UEFA Championship."
"As the introduction of an evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis is a core concern of the Member States and, more to the point, of their citizens, I believe it is very important for the European Parliament, as the representative of the citizens, to be involved in these decisions."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, both proposals fully transfer to the Commission the powers which, until now, have been held by the Council."
"With the impending entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the consequent abolition of the pillar-based Community structure, the legal situation will be profoundly different and significantly modified."
"Therefore, the evaluation mechanism will have to be based on a consistent allocation of the tasks currently shared between the first and the third pillars."
"This is why I feel it is essential that the proposal provides for greater involvement of the Member States - I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that the involvement of experts is sufficient - and, above all, true involvement, true participation of the European Parliament within the coordinating group of the mechanism to monitor and verify the proper application of the Schengen acquis."
"Furthermore, in my opinion, we should determine and better define, by means of more comprehensive, more precise criteria, how to use the migratory pressure parameter, which pinpoints the areas of greatest risk where unannounced visits should take place."
"Lastly, the proposals should be treated as a single package and not separately, since they both represent common aspects of the same issue and have the same shortcomings."
"This is also because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the applicable procedure will be codecision."
"I therefore fully support the position set out by Mr Coelho and the calls on the Commission to withdraw these proposals and submit other, better ones, which take into account what has come out of this debate."
"(RO) Membership of the Schengen Area entails complete freedom of movement for citizens of a Member State within this area, thereby totally removing borders between Member States."
"The security of the Schengen Area depends on how stringently and effectively the controls are imposed by each Member State at their external borders."
"Given that a two-fold evaluation mechanism is involved in this case, it must be implemented, as we are talking about evaluating and verifying the application of the Schengen Community acquis to ensure that it is implemented in a transparent, effective and consistent manner."
"While we should welcome the Commission's proposal for both a decision and regulation, as we feel that this will raise the level of mutual trust between Member States which are part of an area free of any internal borders and provide high uniform standards in the specific application of the Schengen acquis, we believe, however, that it ought to be reviewed taking into account and following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I welcome the fact that in the Commission's proposal, Member States are working with the Commission as part of the coordination group to enable the Commission to implement this evaluation mechanism."
"I also welcome that some multi-annual programmes are being developed and some national experts are being involved in order to carry out on-site visits, which will facilitate a better exchange of information between Member States in the area of Community acquis."
"However, after the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force, the area of police and judicial cooperation will become part of the first pillar, the Community legislation pillar."
"I also wish to draw attention to the fact that Article 14 of the proposal for a Council decision on introducing an evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis stipulates an annual report which the Commission must submit to Parliament and the Council."
"However, I wish to repeat that the proposal needs to be reassessed to take into account the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"One last point I would like to add is that the suggestion which the Commission has made on the proposal for a Council decision for introducing this evaluation mechanism has significant implications for new Member States as well, as we are discussing in this case a procedure for implementing the Schengen acquis provisions in two stages."
"Some of them feature in Annex I of the accession treaties, with the others due to come into force after a decision is adopted by the Council regarding certain provisions of the Schengen acquis."
"(PL) Madam President, it is good that the discussion we are having today to evaluate the Schengen acquis is taking place at the same time as a larger debate is beginning in the European Union, and also in the European Parliament, on the Stockholm Programme."
"This is a major project concerning exceptionally important areas of the lives of EU citizens, such as justice, freedom and security."
"For instance, two elements of the programme, the freedom and security of EU citizens, clearly should be included in the evaluation of the Schengen project."
"We must, therefore, ask ourselves what the European Union was set up for and why it is so important for us that this great project succeed."
"After all, it was not created for the politicians or for international organisations, but for particular states."
"It was, in fact, set up for the good of its citizens."
"Therefore, the good of the citizens, their freedom and liberty, but also the highest possible standards of security which should be guaranteed to them, are one of the main elements of the work which the EU institutions should undertake."
"It is, therefore, not good that we are discussing the Schengen area on its own without combining this discussion with an evaluation of the EU's migration programme, visa programme and the programme for cooperation with neighbouring countries."
"For only then can joint discussion and common evaluation of the situation lead to our reaching appropriate conclusions - this is what the involvement of Parliament in making these decisions is for, and I hope this will happen."
"I am, therefore, convinced that Schengen has performed well."
"Despite the fact that it was said initially that the admission of new countries to the Schengen Area would be impossible without the adoption of SIS II, the admission of 10 countries in 2004 showed that it was possible, and that nothing disastrous happened."
"Now we need only take care to ensure that mechanisms intended to improve and tighten up the functioning of the system be developed as quickly as possible with, of course, the involvement of the European Parliament."
"This explains my esteem for Carlos Coelho and I fully endorse his report."
"Madam President, I would like to add to the calls for this proposal to be withdrawn and for the Commission to submit a new one with a different legal basis."
"There is a clear attempt to sideline Parliament on this important issue and Parliament's Legal Service has confirmed that a different legal basis which would have allowed full involvement of Parliament in the process could have been chosen for this proposal."
"The Schengen Information System, the Schengen visa, the Schengen Border Code and the Visa Code are all subject to the codecision procedure and, as we move towards ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and a more simplified and united legal structure throughout the European Union, we should be seeing greater involvement of Parliament in these issues, not less."
"There is none reflected in the current proposal."
"We have seen considerable cross-party agreement on these issues at committee stage, and I hope that a strong, clear position of the whole Parliament, together with a proper evaluation of the legal circumstances, will result in a redrafting of the proposal and the presentation of a more appropriate one to replace it."
"(FR) Madam President, like many of my fellow Members, I fully support the report by Mr Coelho, who I sincerely thank for the excellent work he has accomplished."
"From the outset, the raison d'être, the sine qua non of the lifting of internal border controls was the existence of compensatory measures designed to prevent the much-feared security deficit."
"These measures form the basis of the mutual confidence that is crucial to good cooperation in the Schengen area."
"Thus, it is only with an effective and transparent mechanism for evaluating the application of this Schengen acquis that we will be able to ensure that this confidence is maintained and, therefore, that the Member States cooperate at a very high level."
"The challenge is therefore huge, and Parliament's role in the creation of this new mechanism must be equal to this challenge."
"It follows that, if this text is adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the mechanism, or at least the elements that come under the first pillar, will have to be adopted by codecision."
"Moreover, while conclusions must certainly be drawn from the integration of the Schengen acquis into Community law and into EU law, this does not mean that the management of this evaluation should be entrusted to the Commission alone."
"Member States must have a greater involvement in this evaluation mechanism, or else this mutual confidence is in danger of diminishing."
"The same goes for the domestic security of our Member States."
"When a Member State does not apply this acquis properly, it is all of the other Member States that suffer the consequences."
"Lastly, in terms of effectiveness, it does not seem appropriate to me to provide for two separate mechanisms for the two evaluation stages, which are the check prior to the application of the acquis and the application of the acquis by the Schengen States."
"I therefore join with Mr Coelho in calling on the Commission to withdraw this proposal and to present us with a new proposal that takes greater account of the philosophy of the acquis and of the Member States' role in evaluating its application."
"Madam President, it is with great regret that I am addressing the House as a Member from a country that has not yet opted into the Schengen Agreement."
"It is something I would support entry into."
"It is my hope that the Schengen Evaluation Working Group will finally demonstrate to the Irish State, and indeed our neighbours across the way in Britain, the undoubted benefits of Schengen."
"Freedom of movement is a basic right and a pillar of EU citizenship for which we are all striving."
"Being able to reduce borders and allow the freedom and benefits of travel to EU citizens has been quite remarkable, especially considering European history."
"The fact that this was done while increasing the ability of our authorities to tackle crime associated with crossing borders has been a major historic achievement and one of the great successes of the EU to date."
"It was the Schengen Agreement that prompted Ireland to build a full data system of criminal information that will hopefully be linked up to a European system in the coming years."
"Schengen has worked extremely well and it is visible for all to see."
"It is because of this remarkable achievement that it is regrettable that my own country is only taking part in Schengen on a piecemeal basis."
"While there has been full cooperation between the Irish security authorities and our European counterparts in the whole area of police matters, the full benefits of the EU are not being shared by Irish citizens."
"The abolition of border controls requires mutual trust between all Member States involved."
"Unfortunately, the Irish Government's position so far is that it cannot trust its European neighbours in full and it is operating on a minor level when it comes to free movement of people in Europe."
"I very much regret this."
"What we really need is an EU-wide visa system to which Schengen and today's debate will hopefully contribute."
"Regarding the proposal in front of us, I would ask the Commission to withdraw it."
"I believe that it gives too much power to the Commission."
"In real terms, it tries to disregard the European Parliament."
"It should come back to us with proposals that respect the codecision procedure and, besides this debate, post-Lisbon, there will be a requirement to bring in new proposals anyway."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho for the very good work he has done."
"The establishment of a simple, effective and transparent evaluation mechanism complementing the current Schengen evaluation is a most welcome initiative."
"However, there are also several problems in terms of data protection that the rapporteur stressed earlier."
"Unfortunately, in spite of the improvements needed, in the current procedure we are only consulted."
"Once the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, Parliament will automatically have codecision powers in matters under the third pillar."
"Since the security of the Schengen area and its citizens is at stake, all players should be deeply involved in the establishment of these evaluation systems, thereby making it possible to guarantee and consolidate the principle of mutual trust essential to maintaining the Schengen area."
"For all these reasons, I support the rapporteur in this initiative requiring the Commission to withdraw the proposals and present new, more complete ones."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho for the fine job he has done and for the determination he has shown in his desire for an evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis in a simple, efficient and transparent manner."
"I regard the introduction of free movement within the territory of the EU and the waiver of internal border controls as among the most important achievements of the European Union."
"Taking into account border permeability, we need high standards when putting the Schengen acquis into actual practice in order to be able to maintain an increased level of mutual trust between Member States, including in their ability to implement measures accompanying the abolition of controls at internal borders."
"We have to improve the evaluation mechanism for monitoring the application of the Schengen acquis."
"The need to maintain a high level of security and trust requires good cooperation between the governments of Member States and the Commission."
"Given the relevance of the regulations in this area from the perspective of fundamental rights and freedoms, the European Parliament must insist on the enforcement of the Treaty of Lisbon being a prior condition to any legislative developments involving the enhancement of border security."
"Bearing in mind how important this legislative initiative is, it is regrettable that the European Parliament is playing the role of consultant rather than colegislator, as ought to have been the case."
"Creating an area of justice, freedom and security is a top priority for the European Union."
"This is why it is vital for Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament to be equally involved in maintaining and developing it."
"Consequently, I give my full support to the rapporteur's suggestion to invite the Commission to submit a new improved proposal to the European Parliament to provide Parliament with the opportunity to assume its role as colegislator."
"Madam President, we have survived the cold snap here, in this Chamber."
"There is probably a misunderstanding in this debate, in the sense that the aim of the proposal is to communitise this evaluation process."
"It is true that we have Schengen - I also note that the vast majority of MEPs celebrated this Schengen success, which makes it possible to have freedom of movement and, at the same time, security."
"It is true that the Schengen evaluation was on an intergovernmental basis to begin with, and that the Commission was there only in an observer capacity."
"However, it is true that the Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, must be responsible for the evaluation."
"There is no question, however, that it will have a monopoly over the evaluation - we must be very clear about that."
"We will, of course, involve the Member States, and the experts from the Member States will be involved in planning the timetable of the visits, in performing the in situ visits, and in drafting the evaluation report."
"It is quite clear that the misgivings that we sense within the Member States are also due to a misunderstanding."
"Since we want mutual confidence between the Member States, there is no question of our not involving them closely in the evaluation of the measures taken to apply Schengen and the Schengen acquis."
"I now come to Parliament."
"There is a misunderstanding here too."
"Our aim is not to exclude Parliament, as I heard someone say."
"Our aim, as things stand, is simply to see how Parliament's involvement can already be increased, with regular reports."
"However, this does not, in any way, preclude the possibility of our giving Parliament a greater role in this communitised mechanism, once the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified."
"I am somewhat insistent because we know that the European general interest can prevail when this method is used, even if, at times, a Member State may drag its heels a little when it comes to defending this European general interest."
"Thus, there are some misunderstandings that I would like to try to clear up."
"Furthermore, I would also like to say that the proposals bring a certain added value when compared with the current mechanism."
"The evaluations will be far more frequent and will be clearer."
"Visits will be planned in situ, on the basis of risk assessments; there will be unannounced visits and a high level of expertise throughout the evaluation exercise, and the number of experts taking part will make the visits effective."
"The assessment of the follow-up to the recommendations made at the end of the in situ evaluations will be improved."
"Those are my thoughts, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I fully understand your impatience to see Parliament's involvement increased when the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified."
"There is no doubt that Parliament must play a major role in this Community method, but we have made this proposal for communitisation purposes, it being understood that this subsequently leaves the way very clear for the European Parliament to become involved."
"I have listened carefully to all of the speeches and I have certainly noted Parliament's virtually unanimous position."
"However, I do believe that all of this is based on a misunderstanding, which can be cleared up."
"I would like to make three final points."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the Members who supported my report and made statements to this effect during this debate, and Vice-President Barrot for his statement encouraging the involvement of the European Parliament as a colegislator, making the very most of the possibilities that arise from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This was no surprise to me."
"I know Commissioner Barrot has held this position for a long time, but it is good that he, as Vice-President of the Commission, has made this formal statement to us."
"As a second point, I would like to recall something that Commissioner Barrot said when he mentioned that the negotiations with the Council were difficult."
"We are also aware of this, and we realise that it would be difficult for things to be any other way when dealing with this matter."
"For this reason, we also hoped that the Commission would see Parliament as a partner with powers of codecision, because in terms of their approach to Europe, the Commission and Parliament alike are positively identified with the idea that decision making cannot continue to be purely intergovernmental."
"Thirdly, I would like to underline two things that I believe have come out of this debate."
"In the first place, there can be no breach in consistency."
"There cannot be two evaluation systems; there must be one alone, whether for the new Schengen members or for the established ones."
"Moreover, the principle of mutual confidence must not be undermined."
"All parties must be involved."
"Both the Member States and the European institutions must be involved in the process of evaluation."
"The European institutions do not just include the Commission or the Council alone; they also include this Parliament, and that is why we are asking for codecision."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"It is vital that there should be a simple, effective, efficient and transparent evaluation mechanism that will enable the Schengen area to be preserved as an area of free movement whilst, at the same time, it is indispensable to adapt the intergovernmental framework for the Schengen evaluation to the EU framework."
"The European Parliament's Legal Service carried out a study and determined that the codecision procedure should have been chosen over the consultation procedure to debate this proposal."
"The Treaty of Lisbon will soon enter into force and according to it, the European Parliament will have greater powers in the area of freedom, justice and security, into which this proposal falls."
"As the security of the Schengen area and its citizens is of vital importance we must choose the codecision procedure."
"Schengen cooperation can take many different forms."
"Very many applications can be picked out and closely scrutinised."
"I believe that as an MEP, it is worth mentioning, here and now, that one of the basic conditions for the free movement of people is to have a complete Schengen system operating efficiently and built on mutual trust."
"Border controls, our common visa policy, cross-border police cooperation and data protection issues are only components of this complete system."
"These are different issues, but all connected by one important factor."
"Europe's citizens have been given, and are given, every day so much additional freedom, which symbolises for them one of the most obvious successes of the European Union's existence."
"As a representative of the electorate in a Member State which joined only a few years ago, I can happily confirm this."
"If it was not for the proposal made by the Portuguese EU Presidency, the new Member States could not be part of the Schengen system."
"As it is, the latest (second) generation of the Schengen Information System is still not working to date."
"It is the responsibility of the Commission and Member States to preserve this freedom, a matter also referred to in two of the questions on the agenda."
"The European Parliament also shares this responsibility, which is precisely why it cannot but get involved in issues relating to citizens' freedom."
"Consequently, I emphatically support the rapporteur's efforts and agree with his proposals."
"The creation of the Schengen area at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s was one of the biggest achievements in European history."
"The provisions of the Schengen acquis have been part of the European Union framework since the Amsterdam Treaty came into force in 1999."
"An essential part of the observance of the application of the rules of the Schengen acquis, which form part of European law, is the evaluation mechanism, which should guarantee the transparent, efficient and consistent implementation of the Schengen acquis, and also reflect the changes to the legislative situation which came into being after the integration of the Schengen acquis into the EU framework."
"I agree with the rapporteur's view that today, the proposals given in the bill are restricted to the adoption of some of the general suggestions for improvement to the valid Schengen evaluation mechanism which were made recently."
"The only new idea in the whole bill is the regulation concerning the possibility of making unannounced visits, which is very welcome."
"I cannot, however, accept the fact that the role currently played by the Council should be given over as a whole to the Commission."
"This proposal leaves very limited opportunities for collaboration with the Member States, and keeps the European Parliament away from the process."
"It should not be forgotten that this is an area based on freedom, security and justice, and also that the responsibility for preserving and refining this area does not rest solely with the Commission as guarantor of the supervision of the implementation of the constitutional treaty, but with the Member States, which are continually responsible for the security of their external borders, and also with the European Parliament, which represents the citizens of the European Union."
"Agreement between the EC and Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and Seychelles on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and Barbados on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and Saint Kitts and Nevis on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and Antigua and Barbuda on the short-stay visa waiver - Agreement between the EC and The Bahamas on the short-stay visa waiver (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0015/2009 -,"
"the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0012/2009 -,"
"the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Barbados on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0017/2009 -,"
"the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0013/2009 -,"
"the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Antigua and Barbuda on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0016/2009 -,"
"the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Commonwealth of The Bahamas on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0014/2009 -."
"Despite the cold being felt inside this chamber, this topic will deal with countries boasting far warmer temperatures, which is rather more ideal."
"These reports, in fact, consist of an agreement which provides for a short stay visa waiver between the European Union and its citizens and the citizens of six different countries - The Republic of Mauritius, The Republic of Seychelles, Barbados, The Federation of St Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas as well as Antigua and Barbuda."
"This waiver applies to European Union citizens who travel to these countries and vice-versa, that is, when citizens from these countries travel to the European Union."
"It is valid for a maximum stay of three months within a six month period."
"This waiver covers all categories of persons, meaning ordinary citizens as well as diplomats travelling for various reasons."
"This applies particularly to the numerous tourists who are European Union citizens and who go on holiday to these six countries, and thus we will be greatly facilitating things for them."
"This agreement however, specifically excludes those who travel for work and remuneration purposes."
"In these reports, we have included a provision that says that each of these third countries can suspend or terminate this agreement with regard to all countries of the European Union rather than excluding individual countries."
"This was done in order to safeguard a level playing field for of all European Union citizens and, beyond that, as an expression of solidarity."
"On the other hand, the European Union will do the same, meaning that the European Community can also suspend or terminate an agreement on behalf of all its Member States."
"The European Union or any of these countries can either suspend the whole agreement or parts of it, on grounds of public interest, protection of national security, public health protection, illegal immigration or in the case of a country's re-introduction of a visa obligation."
"Above all, I would like to clarify, Madam President, that before taking a vote on these reports at committee level, we asked for and were given a guarantee on the part of the European Commission that full reciprocity would be ensured."
"This was an essential principle for us; full reciprocity assured by these countries in the removal of their visa requirement whilst we would do the same in turn."
"Thus, we would be eliminating visa requirements on both sides."
"This agreement has been achieved in the requisite manner and once again clearly demonstrates how the European Union is capable of negotiating with one voice on an international level and by showing solidarity towards all countries."
"I will conclude by saying that once more, this illustrates the European Union's capacity to open its doors to citizens worldwide."
"Madam President, I am also very grateful to Mr Busuttil for his excellent report."
"The six non-EU countries - Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles - were transferred from the negative list to the positive list of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 pursuant to a new regulation, Regulation (EC) No 1932/2006, adopted on 21 December 2006, which confirmed that these countries fulfilled the criteria laid down in the regulation."
"This regulation governed the implementation of the visa waiver for nationals of these countries upon the conclusion and the entry into force of a bilateral visa waiver agreement between the European Community and each of these countries."
"As Mr Busuttil said, it was important to ensure full reciprocity, since back then, some of these countries were still imposing the visa requirement on citizens of one or more Member States."
"Due to the temporary visa regime applied by the CARICOM - the Caribbean common market - countries to nationals of several Member States during the Cricket World Cup, formal negotiations on the visa waiver only began in July 2008."
"To ensure that citizens benefit from the visa waiver as soon as possible, the Commission proposed the temporary application of the agreements signed on 28 May 2009 and, since then, they have been applied temporarily pending completion of the procedures necessary for their formal conclusion."
"Under the principle of reciprocity, the visa waiver covers all categories of persons - ordinary, diplomatic or service/official passport holders - travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity."
"As Mr Busuttil said, in order to maintain equal treatment for all EU citizens, the agreements include a provision stipulating that the six non-EU countries may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Community and, reciprocally, that the Community may also suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all of its Member States."
"There you have it; I am grateful to Parliament and to Mr Busuttil for his cooperation."
"It reinforces this initiative, which will thus make travelling easier for our fellow citizens."
"I would also add that, in this slightly chilly Parliament, we can dream of sooner or later visiting all of these marvellous countries, such as the Seychelles and the Bahamas..."
"Madam President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left is in favour of the European Union agreements with these six countries, which are indeed dream destinations, Mr Barrot."
"As you informed us, with these agreements, citizens of these six countries and, reciprocally, EU citizens, will, in future, be exempted from the short-stay visa requirement - at least some of them will be, since excluded from this exemption are those who wish to work or to perform a paid activity, as an employee or as a service provider, in short."
"This means that those exempted from the visa requirement are businessmen and women, sportspeople and artists - at least when it comes to performing a one-off activity - journalists and trainees, among others."
"Let us not be fussy and let us welcome this progress, since we know all the administrative formalities that are carried out in our embassies in order to issue visas to citizens of countries of the South."
"I am sure, ladies and gentlemen - at least those who are left - that you have all heard about these cases of artists who are prevented from attending a festival or of sportspeople who cannot take part in competitions."
"We in the GUE/NGL Group are in favour of abolishing all short-stay visas."
"They go against the free movement of persons and plunge the citizens of those countries into a vicious circle that encourages them to apply for short-stay visas and, once they have obtained them, not to return to their countries for fear of not being able to obtain another visa."
"In return, we, in our countries, keep cracking down on short-stay visa holders, and a vicious circle emerges."
"This even leads to actual family breakdowns between migrants, who are living in our countries, and their families, who remain in their countries of origin."
"We therefore believe that these agreements are a positive step in the direction of another migration policy, which would see men and women move as freely as capital and goods."
"We do have one small point - one small technical point to make - however, Commissioner. We noticed that the English term 'valid passport' was translated into French as 'passeport ordinaire', but we do not believe that this is the same thing."
"We would therefore be delighted to have clarification on this point, since we believe that the correct translation would be 'passeport en cours de validité'."
"We are also surprised - the word 'surprised' is perhaps a polite way of putting it - we are therefore surprised that these agreements do not apply to the outermost regions of France when they do apply to the outermost regions of Portugal."
"(PT) I would just like to support Simon Busuttil's report, which endorses the European Commission's initiative, by making three brief points."
"Firstly, with this decision, which facilitates movement, we are disproving the idea of a Fortress Europe."
"Secondly, we are not throwing open the doors at random."
"As Vice-President Barrot reminded us, we are opening them in accordance with the rules."
"As he said, the countries have complied with the rules and can come off the negative list."
"I believe that it is important to take a European approach, and avoid 'picking and choosing' countries, accepting some and barring others."
"Either the whole European area is accepted or it is not."
"Finally, as Simon Busuttil and Vice-President Barrot emphasised, guarantees of reciprocity are essential in these agreements."
"We cannot very well ask Europe to open its doors to other countries if these countries do not open their doors to Europe, and this is amply ensured in these agreements."
"Madam President, I should like firstly to thank Mrs Vergiat and to tell her that she is perfectly right - it is indeed 'passeports en cours de validité' - and, secondly, to say that this opportunity is one that we wish to pursue as far as possible."
"I think that Mr Coelho also made it clear, after Mr Busuttil, that we have to be very strict as regards reciprocity and that we also need real European solidarity: we cannot leave a Member State to the mercy of the reintroduction of visas."
"We need real solidarity on the part of all the Member States and of the Union."
"I am grateful once again to Mr Busuttil for clearly identifying the problem and for offering us Parliament's support in this way."
"I would simply like to thank all those who have intervened."
"This goes for my colleagues as well as for the Vice President of the European Commission, Jacques Barrot."
"If I had to summarise this institution's political message in a single phrase, it would clearly be that of the principle of reciprocity."
"This is important to us."
"It is of considerable significance in the agreement we have before us, in the same way that agreements with other third countries are essential."
"The Vice President of the Commission knows that there are several other third countries that are still not honouring the principle of reciprocity with regard to all the Member States of the European Union."
"The United States are amongst these, having recently included a number of countries into its visa waiver programme but left others out."
"Brazil, with whom negotiations have recently taken place, is another case in point."
"I augur that whenever an agreement is concluded, insistence be made upon the principle of reciprocity, and I believe that it is these type of agreements that can serve as the foundation for this to happen elsewhere."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Progress of SIS II and VIS (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the progress of SIS II and VIS."
"Madam President, I would not wish to try Parliament's patience, but all the same, I do need to clarify a number of things for the MEPs here present and for Parliament."
"When, a year and a half ago, I took on the portfolio of commissioner responsible for justice, freedom and security, I found on my desk two large-scale information technology projects aimed at equipping the Member States with modern and effective cooperation tools."
"Those two projects, SIS II and VIS, formed part of the same contract, signed in 2003, between the Commission and a consortium of information technology companies."
"Both of these projects are technologically complex."
"We need to interconnect a central system and national equipment with particularly demanding specifications, and make them interact."
"I have always tried to keep Parliament informed of these developments."
"Following the Justice and Home Affairs Councils in February and June 2009, I wrote to Mr Deprez, the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to inform him of how the work on SIS II was progressing."
"I sent you a copy of that correspondence, Mr Coelho, because you are the usual rapporteur for SIS-related issues, and you follow these issues closely."
"Motivated as I am by this spirit of openness, I should like today, once again, to give you as much information as possible."
"It is true that, like most major industrial projects, both SIS II and VIS are in danger of going over schedule and over budget."
"It is true that the situation is unsatisfactory as regards both SIS II and VIS."
"Despite the involvement of experts from the Commission and the Member States, SIS II continues to come up against various obstacles."
"VIS, for its part, has entered an important phase."
"The initial specifications made it difficult to perform the planned tests but it seems that, with the Member States' agreement, the review of these specifications should enable the tests to be completed successfully next time."
"I come firstly to SIS II."
"The Commission is working closely with the Presidency, the Member States and the contractors to implement the guidelines laid down in the conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 4 and 5 June."
"Firstly, all the parties concerned are actively involved in the technical preparations for a first 'milestone' test aimed at ensuring that the current technical solution is built on a solid foundation."
"With this in mind, the Commission has negotiated the contractual changes required with the consortium in charge of the project."
"For the first milestone, there is an extra cost of EUR 1 026 000."
"At the same time, our services have stepped up the governance and monitoring of the project."
"They have introduced contractual penalties so as to put added pressure on the contractor."
"On Friday evening, I summoned and met with the CEO of the company in charge of the project so that he could inform me personally of the measures that he was implementing to resolve the technical difficulties."
"Finally, for precautionary purposes, as was stipulated by the June Council, the Commission has begun the preparatory work with a view to potentially switching to the alternative scheme should the current technical solution fail."
"In order to take account of this data and of the new timetable, we must obviously translate these circumstances into legislation."
"That is why, on 29 September, the Commission proposed some amendments to the SIS II migration instruments, amendments on which your Parliament is currently being consulted."
"This will give us an opportunity to review the issue in detail."
"As regards VIS, in April 2009, the contractor began a series of tests on the central system in order to assess the progress made."
"The contractor has not yet succeeded in meeting all of the contractual criteria required to conclude this series of tests, even though its deadline was extended."
"The Commission has, of course, applied the contractual penalties provided for to punish this delay."
"It has ordered the contractor to implement all of the appropriate corrective measures."
"I do not believe, but I may be proved wrong, that there is a design problem."
"On the other hand, it would seem that the STT is going well."
"The tests should be concluded on 11 November."
"However, in parallel to this, the Member States must also adapt their own national systems so that they can use VIS."
"At least three Member States are encountering major difficulties, and the delays due to these three States are even more significant than those caused by the central system."
"Thus, we are currently performing a detailed analysis with the Member States in order to set out a new timetable for the launch of VIS."
"To do this, however, we need to have a clear idea of the outcome of the series of tests on the central system."
"My meeting on Friday gives me reason to believe that 11 November could be the date when we will know whether the tests under way are successful."
"In any event, however, both the national systems and the central system must be fully operational before the system is launched."
"I will, of course, inform Parliament of this new timetable as soon as we have been able to draft it."
"I shall finish here - please excuse me for my rather lengthy speech, but I really wanted to give a detailed account of the progress of SIS II and VIS."
"There is real cause for concern; there is no point in hiding it."
"The technical, budgetary and political risk profiles of both projects justify us all getting involved, given our respective responsibilities."
"Significant financial resources have been harnessed."
"The total amount of the Commission's budget commitments on SIS II stands at just over EUR 80 million, of which just over half, or EUR 44.5 million, have so far been paid."
"The total amount that the Commission has already committed to VIS so far is in the region of EUR 74.5 million."
"In terms of budgetary implementation, nearly EUR 43.3 million have actually been spent to date."
"These figures are in line with those of projects on a similar scale developed in Europe and elsewhere in the world."
"Madam President, I am anxious to say here that I will definitely inform Parliament of any developments that may have an impact on the budget, or indeed on the launch date for these systems."
"However, if we succeed with VIS and SIS II, we will have equipped Europe with the most effective system in the world."
"We therefore have to tackle the obstacles in a calm, clear and practical fashion, and in this respect, I will take the liberty of requesting Parliament's help as often as I need it in order, once again, to monitor these two issues very closely and to ensure their successful conclusion."
"I would like to start off by thanking the Vice President of the European Commission for the explanation he just gave us and, in turn, I would also like to explain why we requested this debate."
"This was because the Schengen area is extremely important to us in light of the freedom of movement of our citizens."
"Yet, although we intended the Schengen area to offer complete freedom to our citizens, we do not want to bestow this privilege upon criminals."
"For this reason, we created the Schengen information system, which was meant to be upgraded to a new generation system known as SIS II in order to help us strengthen our citizens' freedom whilst holding back criminals from gaining any sort of leeway."
"Therefore, the fact that this new generation system, SIS II, is well overdue and yet still does not look like it is anywhere near being finished is of concern to us."
"This is why we are putting these questions to you now as to the reason for this delay and as to whether it would be possible to guarantee a date by which the system will be up and running."
"However, I would like to make it abundantly clear that our final target is to work together with the European Commission to ensure that the Schengen area is fully operational and that it works in the best interests of our citizens, without giving free reign to those with the wrong intentions."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for coming here today to update us on these issues in some detail."
"We appreciate the manner in which he has done that."
"Like Mr Busuttil, I want to set out an explanation - which is a joint explanation - of our serious concern regarding the significant delays in migration from SIS to SIS II and the development of VIS."
"I think you will understand why we tabled a joint resolution, because there is a genuine concern here."
"Mr Coelho and others have been making this concern known for some time and it is worth putting on record that, while these significant delays are obviously highly worrying on their own, the key issues here for Parliament, as you know, are those of transparency and accountability, particularly when we are dealing with sensitive data, and sensitive data in this area."
"As co-legislator and the EU's only directly elected institution, Parliament needs to be kept informed about the developments of these systems, as it has requested many times in the past."
"In our resolution, we do not want to be seen to be making unreasonable demands."
"We want to be reasonable, and we want to respond to the way in which you have given us the information today."
"We simply want to be informed of the current state of play, to be given explanations about the reasons for the delay, and to be reassured that these problems will be resolved."
"It is vital that a project as important as this, which will have an impact on vast numbers of people - both EU and non-EU citizens - is developed transparently."
"However, in addition to the issues of transparency and accountability, it is also important to point out some of the wider implications."
"The technical problems we are seeing, and the development of these large-scale databases, do not inspire wider confidence."
"Many of our Member States - including my own Member State - have had significant difficulties in their own development of major databases, in development of ID databases and so on."
"Public confidence in these systems is absolutely vital."
"Therefore, we certainly have to look jointly across the political parties to see how these problems arose, how they can be prevented in the future, at the planning stage rather than the development stage."
"Lessons have to be learned; we have to have confidence in these systems and, above all, we have to have full and effective oversight."
"In the end, these systems will only work through technical cooperation - but also through that public confidence in this system and the fact that Parliament is seen to be scrutinising these matters openly and with some results at the end of the day."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I have never had so much speaking time in one evening in all my 10 years in the European Parliament!"
"Ten minutes in total is an unaccustomed luxury, and I am not sure I will be able to use it."
"I, too, am grateful to Vice-President Barrot for coming to report to us on the problems, although I feel we should not have had to keep asking for those updates."
"Anyone who has the merest familiarity with the installation of large IT works in the public sector in their own Member State will know that all these technical and budgetary problems frequently arise."
"Unfortunately, however, when you have two such high-profile, big systems - the Schengen Information System (SIS) II and the visa information system (VIS) - being affected, this also affects the credibility not only of the Union's internal security - and I will come back to that later - but also of the EU's visa policy."
"As rapporteur on the VIS, I can say that we were under pressure to get the legislation done in time, because we wanted to press ahead with having the VIS up and running - as it should have been by now - and any slippage in the programme is deeply disappointing."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Barrot what the implications are going to be for visa applicants."
"Are we going to end up with a lot of confused people, because the VIS is destined to deal with 20 million visa applications a year and delays presumably have a knock-on effect?"
"And what about the outsourcing arrangements which are being established?"
"You mentioned that there have been contractual penalties imposed owing to the delays in the visa information system."
"Could you tell us what those penalties are?"
"What are the estimated extra costs envisaged?"
"And could you tell us, Commissioner Barrot, whether overall, you have continued confidence in the contractor, or are we looking at a potential cancellation of the contract?"
"This presumably also has implications for the setting-up of the agency for the common management of the SIS and VIS - and, potentially, other databases in the future."
"Perhaps some of the ambitions for the collection of data and large-scale surveillance systems might have to be looked at again, which would be no bad thing from the privacy point of view if we are going to have all these technical and infrastructure problems."
"The last thing I wanted to ask the Commissioner is this: the current estimate is that the SIS II will be in operation in the last quarter of 2011."
"We can, I guess, expect some further slippage."
"In the summer of 2012, the Olympics are being held in London."
"The UK Government did not take the opportunity to go into SIS I for reasons best known to itself."
"It actually had quite a few years when it could have gone into SIS I but said 'oh no, no, we will wait till SIS II'."
"In answers to me, the Government has said that it is not worried about any implications for security."
"However, not only UK but also European security could be put at risk if the UK does not participate in access to the policing side - which it is allowed to do - of the Schengen Information System, by a time well ahead of the London Olympics taking place in 2012."
"Could you tell us, Commissioner Barrot, what you think the implications could be for security around the Olympics, which, especially as they are being held in London, and not least in my constituency, I am greatly concerned about?"
"I think we would all be greatly worried about the security of the Olympics."
"Those are a few of the questions I would like to ask you."
"Thank you again for coming here."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, on behalf of my group, I too thank Commissioner Barrot for his explanations."
"Of course, we also deplore the current situation with SIS II and VIS."
"But I would also like to raise some other concerns as well, because you know that our group has a specific position on using biometric data, in particular in VIS and SIS II."
"I would like to use this opportunity to underline our position."
"Like Sarah Ludford, I am also extremely thankful for the extra time to speak this evening."
"For me, too, it may be too much, even though my time is six minutes, not ten."
"We also regret that more and more authorities have access to these systems."
"Currently, we are concerned that SIS is being transformed from a technical tool into a general system of control and surveillance."
"Therefore, we would remind the Commission that a coherent legal framework for data protection based on the highest standards, and the adoption of a legal instrument on minimum safeguards in procedural law, is the necessary precondition for the full implementation of those new systems."
"We also want to deplore the lack of cooperation from the Council, in particular, the refusal to use the codecision procedure for the implementing measures."
"We hope that in future, the European Parliament will regularly receive reliable information on the tests, costs, etc."
"I do not want to repeat an earlier speaker's question, but we, too, would like information from Commissioner Barrot on the contract and obligations arising from it, and what will happen if the test is unsatisfactory, and we would also like to know about possible costs."
"The issue is perhaps also one of approval: we would avoid a lot of questions if our Parliament were allowed to participate actively in the whole process from the very beginning."
"Therefore, I hope that this case will also prove that now it really is time to cooperate."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, as ECR signatory to the joint motion, I am very pleased we are now engaged in this debate."
"It is of vital importance that we in the European Parliament call the Commission to account when we are discussing matters involved with the spending of substantial sums of European taxpayers' money."
"It is correct that there is a special interest from the general public in such a sensitive area that relates to data protection and exchange."
"There have been numerous problems and delays, meaning that the new system has still not begun operation."
"Indeed, there are now doubts over the viability of the project."
"I would like to ask the Commission why there have been such delays and overspending."
"What action is being taken to address the shortcomings?"
"We would like to see full transparency as regards the implementation process as well as concerning the financial aspects to which I have referred."
"As our resolution states, the United Kingdom - not, of course, as a full member of Schengen at this time - along with a number of other Member States, will not want to be part of this system until a solution has been found."
"I would also like to ask what action has been taken against contractors to secure some damages."
"We would like the Commission and Council to respond to the questions asking them to give an explanation of the grounds for continuing to have confidence in the current contractor and in its ability to successfully take the systems forward."
"In fact, is there a future for this project or should we now be rethinking the whole initiative?"
"As Commissioner Barrot has said, some states are delaying, but without confidence you could hardly blame them."
"The European Parliament must be kept constantly informed on the state of play of the deployment of these systems."
"I look forward to reading the Commission's response to the questions my colleagues and I have raised."
"Madam President, first I should like to say that we do not share the concerns of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"It is perfectly simple: we believe that further development towards SIS II is not necessary and is politically wrong."
"We take this view for three reasons: firstly, because it mixes secret service and police data, giving rise to a data system that no longer guarantees controllability and in which personal data is not, in fact, protected."
"The second is biometric data, which is being anchored here as a large-scale experiment and, thirdly, SIS II is, of course, to be used against so-called illegal immigration."
"Hence our proposal: as we all know, we have SIS I. We consider it reasonable to develop this further 'as one for all'."
"It is a pragmatic approach, even if we are strongly criticised for it."
"However, we believe that, with the approach being pursued here, nothing more can be done."
"To put it simply: SIS II is a de facto failure and to keep on crawling round it - to put it one way - is meaningless."
"What is important is that money which is being put to the wrong use here should be saved, which will mean we have fewer problems with the whole thing and can stop worrying about the delay with SIS II."
"I say this also from the point of view of Saxony, a region of Germany close to Poland and the Czech Republic."
"I know full well here that it would certainly make more sense to do something towards stabilisation within the police than to introduce something like this."
"(PT) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Vice-President Barrot for his statement, although he is in an unfair position, because it would also be good to hear the Council's position."
"Clearly, it is easier to exercise parliamentary scrutiny of the Commission than of the Council."
"In December 2001, the Commission was given a mandate to introduce the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS), which was expected to come into operation in March 2007."
"There have been many problems and delays."
"The new system is still not working."
"Some people predict that it will not be running before 2012, while others question the very viability of the project."
"There are now delays not only in SIS, but also in the Visa Information System (VIS), as both projects are being developed by the same company."
"I must say here that I continue to have confidence in Vice-President Barrot."
"In his political life, he has always shown himself to be competent, serious and a true pro-European."
"We know that he did not initiate the SIS project; he inherited it when he accepted a change of portfolio at the request of President Barroso."
"However, the services of the European Commission and the company contracted to develop the central system should clearly be held to account."
"Parliament has budgetary authority, and we have the right and the obligation to seek an explanation from the European Commission."
"Why do we need SIS II?"
"We need better control of our external borders, we need more security, we need biometric data, and we need alerts to be interlinked."
"Two global technical tests, the so-called milestone tests, are planned, the first on 22 December, and the second in the summer of 2010."
"The aim of the first test is to check the smooth, reliable and effective operation of SIS II under operational conditions, for a period of 72 hours, and to check that the vital core features and data consistency can function without any problems or interruptions."
"This raises a number of questions."
"First, is there any risk that might jeopardise the implementation of the test in December of this year?"
"Secondly, in order to lower the risk, is the possibility of reducing the level of requirements or even the number of states participating in the test being considered?"
"Thirdly, can these new tests be considered part of the annual contract with the company, or will they be regarded as additional requirements, incurring extra costs?"
"Fourthly, has the detection of problems and technical errors led to additional services being added to the contract? How much money has been paid out on these grounds?"
"Fifthly, what was the total amount of the penalties imposed on the contractor - as mentioned by Vice-President Barrot - for the delays and technical errors that caused the previous tests to be unsuccessful?"
"In the sixth place, does the Commission consider that, if there is a switch to implement an alternative solution, this will mean the termination of the contract with Steria? If this is the case, what implications will it have for the VIS?"
"Finally, Madam President, one last question: Is it true that Bulgaria and Romania have given up waiting for SIS II, and their integration into SIS I is already being planned?"
"(DE) Thank you Madam President."
"I shall try to keep to my speaking time."
"In principle, we welcome the introduction of SIS II and its functionality."
"In my time as Minister for the Interior at the beginning of this millennium, I lobbied intensively for this system."
"At that time, we were promised that it would be introduced in 2007, one reason being that we urgently needed it for the new Member States so that they could participate in this security architecture."
"The new Member States are here, but SIS II is still not here."
"The delay needs to be relentlessly analysed and investigated."
"There must also be clear consequences."
"We should learn from past experiences for the future."
"We must admit that the Commission has done everything to advance the SIS II project, including putting up with less than perfect test results."
"However, we must not forget that it makes no sense to make too big a compromise here because it would be at the expense of the stability and reliability of the system."
"We should therefore prevent any additional financial burden for the Member States which might come out of the analysis or the tests and any further delay in the system."
"What we need for this is 100% transparency, as well as clear language for those implementing the project on the Commission's behalf, and that must also mean that, where necessary, there are financial consequences for these project managers."
"(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, in 2006, when the new Member States were waiting to join the Schengen area, we stipulated, and it was stipulated to us, that one of the conditions was that SIS II had to be in operation."
"In the meantime, it transpired that the system would be unable to operate at all."
"We then heard that the floor was not strong enough to support the weight of the technical equipment and certainly, if the Portuguese Presidency had not come up with a solution for operating the 'SIS one for all' system, the eight new Member States would still have been waiting to join the Schengen area even now."
"Meanwhile, we should remember that new contracts had to be signed, new financial packages had to be found for developing the SIS II system, while the operation of the SIS I+ system still has to be financed."
"Therefore, in practical terms, we are financing two systems, which is costing European taxpayers no small sum of money."
"We are obviously talking about a large investment when it comes to safeguarding European citizens' safety."
"Unlike my left-wing fellow Member, I feel that it can bring about a huge change in terms of quality for the benefit of European security."
"I am also curious about the delay given that in 2001, the system's development was planned to take five years, from 2002 to 2007."
"We are now talking about it being developed perhaps over 10 years."
"Commissioner, it is not possible to have such a degree of uncertainty with a technical system that its development time doubles."
"We are well aware that technical gremlins can throw a spanner in the works and that public investment has been delayed, but we ultimately need to ask the question: what is the reason behind this?"
"Are not some countries, some Member States in fact, deliberately stalling the SIS II system's development?"
"To simply conclude my question, what guarantee is there that we will not have the same story with the VIS system?"
"(PL) Madam President, in view of the delays and problems in completing work on SIS II, and of forecasts which say that it will not be fully functional by the end of 2011, and even, as some are saying, by 2015, it has been decided to conduct tests on SIS II before the end of this year which will assess its functionality."
"If SIS II proves to be defective, it is said that an alternative plan will be introduced, based on improvements to SIS I."
"This, therefore, raises several questions."
"Is the European Commission ready to implement an alternative plan?"
"What will be done about the investments made by Member States which have borne costs associated with the purchase of equipment to service the new system?"
"Will this equipment be used in the alternative plan?"
"Finally, how does the Commission intend to exact contractual penalties on those responsible for the project?"
"Madam President, I cannot reply to all of the questions that have been put to me, given that we find ourselves at a difficult moment in time."
"With regard to VIS, it is the tests which affect the central system and which must be performed by 11 November, and for SIS II, it is the milestone, that is to say, this criterion that must be fulfilled by the end of the year."
"Firstly, I am very grateful to all of the speakers."
"I want the European Parliament to have full access to all of the information."
"I would remind you that these two major systems were devised by the Member States precisely so that they could enjoy freedom of movement in secure conditions, as Mr Busuttil and Mr Moraes, in particular, pointed out."
"I would firstly like to try to respond on VIS, and in particular to Mrs Ludford, who, as rapporteur, has taken a particular interest in this problem."
"What we can say is that tests will be carried out on VIS by 11 November, and these tests will tell us whether we ought to change course."
"Until now, VIS can be thought of as having a sound architecture and, in fact, a few bugs, but ones that can be put right."
"Nevertheless, it is these tests that will show whether we need to terminate the contract with the contractor."
"It is too soon to tell, but the timetable would be reviewed accordingly in that instance."
"I would point out that, in 2005, the Council decided that VIS had to be rolled out in a consistent and coordinated fashion by the Member States."
"That is why the VIS regulation stipulates that the system will begin operating in the first region on the date set by the Commission once all of the Member States have notified it that they have made all the technical and legal adjustments necessary to use VIS in that region."
"This means that VIS will begin operating in the first region - North Africa, which covers the countries presenting the biggest risks in terms of illegal immigration and security - on the same date for all the Member States."
"This leads me to say that it really is important for all of the Member States to be able to get up and running and manage VIS because it would be extremely damaging if the central system proved to work normally but we were forced to extend the deadline even further because of these delays on the part of a few Member States."
"Hence, I am somewhat insistent on this point."
"I note that Mrs Ludford made particular reference to the problem of the Olympic Games."
"I sincerely hope that we will have made progress by then."
"However, it is true that provision has been made for the United Kingdom to connect to SIS I + ahead of the Olympic Games, if such action proves necessary."
"What I would also like to say is that, with regard to visa applicants, we sincerely hope not to deviate too much from the deadline that was set, since that is very important for us, and the serious risk of people 'shopping' for visas at consulates may increase if we delay VIS too much."
"Mrs Ždanoka talked to me about biometric data and controlling access to the system."
"I think that we will have an opportunity to discuss this again, but these controls will be subject to a number of clear rules."
"I noted that Mrs Ernst is against the system, but I wish to remember what Mr Kirkhope told me, also."
"I now come to Mr Coelho."
"Mr Coelho is well acquainted with SIS II, and I would like to try to answer some of his questions while keeping the option open to write to him in order to give him the other answers to his seven questions."
"What I can say is that the Commission opened the contractual negotiations with its co-contractor and that those negotiations were focused on two areas: the commissioning of the additional services and equipment required to perform the test of the first milestone, and an amendment to the basic contract to enable the milestones within SIS II to be formalised by contract."
"We reached an overall agreement at the end of July."
"We reached an overall agreement at the end of July, and it is true that the co-contractor pointed out that there were specifications that seemed to make the achievement of this first milestone a very complicated business."
"Nonetheless, we signed a contract with the contractor that stipulates that this milestone must be achieved."
"The analysis and repair period made it clear, however, that SIS II was built on solid, though at times excessively complex, foundations, and that, although some efforts needed to be made, the system was repairable."
"This in-depth analysis enabled us to identify several ways of improving the system, but it is true, Mr Coelho - and I say this to the whole of Parliament also - that we have a very ambitious project before us in this area, and that it is not easy to see exactly what is going to happen."
"I can say, however, that we have imposed contractual penalties on the Hewlett-Packard-Steria consortium in order to punish it, on the one hand, for its inability to bring the system up to the contractually required level at the end of the contractual phase of the operational tests on the ST and, on the other - for the time being, in any case - for the delays caused in the internal VIS tests."
"Both of these projects are governed by the same contract, so the penalties are deducted equally from the invoices for SIS II and for VIS."
"These penalties amount to almost EUR 3.5 million, and the penalty meter keeps on ticking in the case of VIS, while that of SIS II has been switched off since the start of the analysis and repair exercise begun in January."
"Should these projects have to be abandoned, the co-contractor will obviously have to bear the corresponding costs."
"Madam President, as things stand, and given what I said in respect both of VIS, about the tests that are going to take place by 11 November, and of SIS II, about the aim of confirming, via the end-of-year milestone, whether the architecture really is viable, I am unable to provide a more precise answer, since we are now at the stage of carrying out these tests and of preparing for the milestone."
"I wish to say that Parliament is welcome to help us spur on the co-contractor."
"As you have seen, I am very determined and I have become personally involved in this matter."
"I hope that, as in the case of Galileo, I will succeed more or less in saving both of these projects, which are very interesting in technological terms and which would enable Europe to benefit from a high-performance system, but I cannot be sure of that yet, this evening."
"Parliament is also welcome to help us spur on the Member States: as regards VIS, we are finding that the longest delays are being caused at the moment by a few Member States."
"Madam President, I am well aware that I have not answered every single question, but I remain fully at Parliament's disposal to provide all the information that the MEPs and, in particular, those who put questions to me this evening, want, as and when I receive it."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner."
"I have received three motions for resolutions to wind up this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 on Thursday, 22 October 2009."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was suspended at 20.45)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Action taken on Parliament's resolutions: see Minutes"
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the milk sector."
"The dramatic nature of this crisis continues to concern us, just as European farmers continue to express their hardship and voice their fears for the future."
"Parliament has already expressed its views on this matter, both by adopting a resolution with our proposals and by adopting the Commission proposal to extend the intervention period for milk powder and butter, to which we added the request for the measure on the private storage of cheese."
"At that time, we pointed out that the measures proposed by the Commission did not go nearly far enough."
"We now have to decide whether or not to allow the urgent procedure for the extension of Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation to the dairy sector, namely the possibility for the Commission to decide, in the event of a market crisis, to implement emergency measures without going through the normal procedure in Parliament."
"Yesterday evening, an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was held to discuss this, with Mrs Fischer Boel attending."
"Firstly I, and the committee which it is my honour to chair, would like to thank the Commissioner for coming to us in Parliament right at the end of the Agricultural Council which was held in Luxembourg."
"This gesture was one of great attentiveness which we appreciated."
"Yesterday evening, the debate was very spirited, Mr President, and our fellow Members voiced a lot of criticism."
"First of all, it was pointed out that the Commission was very slow to act, and did not adequately grasp the seriousness of the crisis under way."
"Then the objection was raised that Article 186 deprives Parliament of its decision-making prerogatives, thereby giving carte blanche to the Commission."
"It was also said that the Commission should have made more funds available to tackle the crisis."
"These are legitimate concerns which we agree with in part."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, I feel compelled to admit that the Commission has made considerable efforts and progress, showing that it takes Parliament's opinion and wishes seriously."
"It has explained how it intends to use a fund of EUR 280 million - which, I would remind you, we will be voting on this Thursday in the context of approval of the 2010 budget - and set out some of the measures it will implement, such as the private storage of cheese and raising the ceiling of de minimis aid from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000, as requested in our resolution which was adopted in September."
"Although I am aware that all this still does not go far enough, I nevertheless believe, Mr President, that today we should vote in favour of the urgent procedure."
"European farmers expect immediate answers and too much time has already been wasted."
"Today we must take responsibility for speeding things up in order to face the crisis head on."
"Let us show, ladies and gentlemen, the same responsibility which pervades our preparations for the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon with codecision in agricultural matters."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are arguing against the urgent procedure, not because we do not believe that there is an urgent need for measures, but because we believe that the Commission is not implementing the right measures and is not willing and able to solve the current crisis in the dairy sector."
"The Commission is not part of the solution to the problem, but is actually the problem."
"We must point out, therefore, that the Commission has caused part of the problems itself by increasing the quantity of milk."
"It failed to react in any way for months as the crisis went on."
"The Commissioner told us as recently as four weeks ago that there were no problems, that the market would improve and that we must be patient."
"This, of all Commissions, is the Commission to which we are handing our powers and this, of all Commissions, is the Commission from which we are expecting help."
"No, I do not think that is the right way to proceed."
"Even yesterday, the Commission was unable to tell us what the additional funds are to be spent on."
"The Commission talks of restructuring."
"Over recent years, all restructuring has meant has been fewer and fewer dairy farmers."
"The Commission has also failed to say how it intends to reinforce the producer organisations going forwards."
"No, it wants to continue paying out export refunds."
"We have also heard no answer about how we are to strengthen the producers' position in their struggle against the supermarkets."
"The Commission was unable to put forward any solution in this regard yesterday either."
"In the light of all this, we are highly doubtful that the Commission is wholeheartedly working to resolve this crisis."
"We are writing a blank cheque without knowing what the Commission is doing, how it is doing it and with what it intends to do it."
"Yet another issue was the crucial reason for our decision to reject this procedure, however."
"We, Parliament, have long been fighting for more rights - particularly in the field of agriculture."
"Yet just as we are on the verge of the Treaty of Lisbon being ratified, the first thing we do is to give these rights away again!"
"That simply cannot be allowed to happen."
"As a new Member of this House, this strikes me as somewhat extraordinary."
"We must exercise our rights, we must hold the debates in this House and we must keep our hand on the tiller."
"We, too, have responsibility here, I am happy to accept that."
"We must not, however, give up any responsibility."
"Rather, as parliamentarians, that responsibility is our calling."
"We must provide the dairy farmers with serious and long-lasting help."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the request to use the urgent procedure put forward by the Commission is certainly not perfect."
"I can partially agree with what the previous speaker said."
"However, to not allow this request to use the urgent procedure now would send completely the wrong signals to the dairy farmers, who are expecting at least initial responses."
"That is why I support this request to use the urgent procedure."
"In the course of this procedure, we will have the opportunity to improve the motion by means of amendments and, as Mr Häusling suggested, to cede powers."
"It is absolutely the case that there are possibilities to put a time limit on these powers so that we only give the Commission a power for two years before we then decide on the matter again."
"I would therefore ask for your support in order to put this request for use of the urgent procedure on the agenda."
"(Applause)"
"Climate change and developing countries in the framework of the UN Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on climate change and developing countries in the framework of the UN Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen."
"Mr President, we are at a decisive point in time."
"In just under two months' time, the world will sign an agreement in Copenhagen for combating the climate challenges that we face."
"This agreement must meet three conditions: it must keep global warming to less than two degrees Celsius, it must encompass all nations and it must adapt future efforts to higher levels of ambition as new knowledge becomes available."
"With just 48 days left to the opening of the UN's major Conference on Climate Change, it is high time that political will was transformed into concrete actions."
"Negotiations are moving too slowly, however."
"A number of key issues have not yet been resolved."
"Many people are now taking the easy way out - by giving in to pessimism."
"Let me make one thing clear: that is not what the EU is here to do."
"We want the EU to show leadership by expressing a clear, unequivocal political will."
"A comprehensive and ambitious agreement on climate change has the very highest priority for the Swedish Presidency."
"The EU's response to the negotiating difficulties is that we must step up the pace."
"We must drive things forward to ensure that the world reaches the agreement required."
"We will take on the challenge of bringing the other nations of the world with us into an agreement that is sufficiently capable of meeting the challenge of climate change."
"We are therefore taking an intensive two-track approach: firstly, sending a powerful message to our negotiating partners; and secondly, bringing the EU together behind a strong negotiating mandate ahead of the Copenhagen conference."
"The EU has already laid the foundation for this with the climate and energy package agreed on by the European Parliament and the Council in December 2008."
"I would like to express particular thanks for the commitment shown by many here in Parliament in the work on the climate and energy package."
"The decision made by the European Parliament at that time places the EU in a strong negotiating position."
"This week, the final pieces will be put in place to provide a complete picture of this strong position."
"The negotiations will be concluded in the European Council next week and I know that many of you will be following this closely."
"I am pleased that some of you will also be able to be present in Copenhagen."
"I also welcome the resolution that the European Parliament is in the process of preparing."
"Emissions must be restricted to the level required to keep global warming down to less than two degrees Celsius."
"This means that the bids currently on the table are not enough."
"The EU will reduce emissions by 30% by 2020 provided that other parties also make adequate commitments."
"We view the 30% goal as a way of leveraging others to join us in raising their ambitions."
"Emissions should be cut by at least 80% by 2050."
"However, measures by the EU alone are not enough to ensure that global warming does not exceed two degrees Celsius."
"We need to get everyone on board."
"We have seen promising signals, for example, from the new government in Japan."
"We now urge other developed countries - not least the US - to raise their bids."
"The developing countries have an opportunity to achieve sustainable development while, at the same time, reducing emissions."
"This means planning low-carbon growth, integrating climate measures and adapting national development strategies."
"It is a way of making sure that climate and development measures are incorporated into all political decisions and ensuring that growth benefits everyone; a way of constructing and opening up democratic governance, contributing to equality and fighting and reducing poverty."
"We make particular demands of the fastest-growing developing countries - not least China, which is the country with the highest emissions."
"Emissions need to be cut by approaching 30% by 2020 compared with the situation where no measures are taken."
"Development issues must be absolutely central in the agreement reached in Copenhagen."
"The European Council has concluded that climate change is undermining efforts to combat poverty and achieve sustainable development."
"Climate change poses a threat to the Millennium Development Goals."
"Experts in development will also take part in the negotiating work."
"We will particularly highlight development issues within the context of the ongoing negotiations."
"All nations - except those that are least developed - should share responsibility for the costs of measures to combat climate change, but those of us in the developed countries must take the lead by ourselves reducing emissions and financing important measures."
"We need a sustainable international structure for cooperation and support for developing countries."
"Such a structure would also allow us to assist the very poorest and most vulnerable countries, which are often the hardest hit by climate change."
"Adaptation measures are required in this regard."
"Finally, let me state that the EU is prepared to take its responsibilities seriously."
"The Council is aware of the scale of the financing required."
"The Commission estimates that the costs will amount to nearly EUR 100 billion per year in the developing countries by 2020."
"We in the EU are also prepared to provide prompt financing for immediate measures in the period up to 2012, as a way of increasing trust between North and South in the climate negotiations."
"We face a great challenge in these final weeks leading up to Copenhagen."
"I am therefore asking you to set the pace."
"We need leadership from the governments of the Member States, efforts by national parliaments and support from the populations of the EU Member States."
"The European Parliament has a very important part to play in this work if we are to achieve our goals in Copenhagen."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first of all thank you for giving me the opportunity to express the Commission's views on this sensitive issue."
"You are already aware that there will be no ambitious deal in Copenhagen if the concerns of the developing countries are not taken into account, not only those of emerging countries, but also very much the concerns of the most vulnerable and the poorest developing countries."
"Nevertheless, reaching a good deal in Copenhagen is in our common interest."
"Developing countries are the most vulnerable countries to climate change."
"The EU is the first donor in the world and a leader in the fight against climate change."
"We have to combine our efforts."
"There is no place for North-South confrontation when you are dealing with climate change."
"I would even go further and say that no other alliance can be as determining and effective as the one engaging the most vulnerable countries and the ones who have put on the negotiating table the most ambitious proposals to fight this plague - that is to say, Europe."
"Our general approach towards the most vulnerable countries, followed up to now through the Global Climate Change Alliance, is made up of three parallel strands, which are interlinked and are mutually reinforcing."
"First, building political alliances through reinforced dialogue on climate change."
"Three joint political declarations have been signed respectively with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, plus one with the ACP group as a whole."
"Second, promoting sound policies and strategies linking climate change and development."
"I am of the opinion that climate resilience and low-carbon policies must be integrated into wider developments and the poverty reduction strategies of our partners."
"There can only be a single development strategy, which incorporates climate concerns pursuing the objectives of sustainable development and poverty reduction."
"It is not a matter of choosing one or the other: both are essential."
"In this spirit, we already support the implementation of the existing national adaptation programmes of action of LDCs in 15 eligible countries."
"Third, encouraging adequate EU contribution to finance climate actions, in particular, for adaptation, which is the priority concern for those countries that are most vulnerable to climate change impact, but who barely contribute to greenhouse gas emissions."
"We are only 50 days away from Copenhagen."
"Expectations are very high."
"And we are worried because the negotiations are dangerously close to deadlock at the moment."
"It is now the time for putting offers on the table."
"That is what Europe has done, and that is what we expect our partners to do as well."
"Firstly, we have made offers in terms of commitments."
"The EU has already put on the table ambitious targets and commitments - so far, the second most ambitious on the table of negotiations."
"We have already guaranteed a unilateral 20% emission reduction by 2020, and we are committed to increase to 30% if comparable efforts are made by others according to their responsibilities and capabilities."
"Second, offers in terms of financing."
"We are all conscious that a deal on financing will be crucial to achieving an agreement in Copenhagen."
"To move forward in the negotiations, the EC issued in mid-September its own proposals on finance."
"One of them is the need for short-term international public funding for climate to be scaled up for the period 2010-2012 to respond as a priority to urgent needs identified in the most vulnerable developing countries and, in particular, LDCs, SIDs, and African countries as defined in the Bali Action Plan."
"Another one is the readiness of the EU to take on its fair share of the estimated financing requirements, public funding contributions being based on preferred criteria of ability to pay and responsibility for emissions."
"This may lead to an EU contribution between EUR 2 billion and EUR 15 billion annually in 2020."
"These proposals will be discussed by the European Council at the end of October and will hopefully be the basis for a fully-fledged EU negotiation position on finance."
"But action by the EU alone is not enough."
"We strongly hope that other developed countries will follow our paths as the pressure grows before Copenhagen."
"We count on developing countries as well."
"They have to take the opportunity offered by climate financing to fully integrate adaptation into their development strategies and to move gradually to low-carbon development paths for the longer term."
"Although the focus has been, up to now, on adaptation for the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries, there is some ground to promote the design of low-carbon development paths (i.e. mitigation), which are compatible with poverty reduction objectives in those countries."
"A specific focus on mechanisms to avoid deforestation and promote sustainable management of forests is crucial."
"Indeed, the fight against tropical deforestation is the largest immediate mitigation challenge for the LDCs, and they can be beneficiaries, through mechanisms such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation schemes, of its international financing."
"Similarly, ensuring in the future a more balanced distribution of the CDM (clean development mechanisms) investments in favour of the LDCs should also be part of the current reflection on the reform of this mechanism."
"Finally, a word on the delivery channels for climate funding."
"We as the Commission are not in favour of creating new funds."
"New funding for climate should use existing and potentially improved delivery channels, promoting a decentralised bottom-up governance structure in support of country-owned actions."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to see you here for this debate, particularly as you are a former member of the Committee on Climate Change."
"President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is absolutely right that the European Union should send a clear signal to Copenhagen."
"Over the next 50 days, however, it is not so much in Copenhagen, but behind closed doors at the conference that the real activity will take place."
"I have been involved with this since the climate conference in Rio in 1992."
"The mood before these conferences is always the same, but there are also opportunities."
"Commissioner, I would like to see you engaged somewhat more enthusiastically in putting your US colleagues under a positive pressure to negotiate, as you continue to exude a certain phlegmatic quality that we need to work on."
"I think it is right that we should not start with some sort of financial competition now."
"One party says 15 billion, another says 30 billion. There are some who simply put up the money, who want to put 150 billion on the table each year, starting now."
"Let us develop criteria for how the money is used."
"We will then be able to provide a large contribution from Europe, but it cannot be a bottomless pit."
"Enough has been said about the crisis."
"I would like, however, to once again go into the opportunity that the industrialised world in the United States and Europe has."
"If we lay down the right standards, we will be able to develop efficiently."
"That will then enable Europe to sell efficient machinery across the globe, for example, to China, where, at the moment, for example, energy is produced in the most inefficient ways."
"I also do not see only the threat of climate change but also very much the opportunity to drive forward business and the economy through developing ultra-modern technology."
"We must seize this opportunity, we must be much bolder and we must act as entrepreneurs, as political entrepreneurs, because if we do not do so, then we will be being neglectful and we will have chosen the wrong path."
"Commissioner, I wish you a great deal of luck and all power to your elbow!"
"Go forward positively!"
"Take the Americans and the Indians with you, and we will already be half way there."
"Mr President, climate change is responsible for more than 300 000 deaths each year."
"It affects 325 million people, and more than 90% of the people affected, more than 90% of the deaths, are in developing countries."
"The economic losses due to climate change are estimated at more than USD 125 billion per year and, once again, 90% are borne by developing countries."
"These countries are being hit at the same time by the financial crisis, climate change and the extremely unequal mechanisms of a form of unbridled capitalism that plunders them in every corner of the world."
"So, what are we calling for?"
"Firstly - and it is true, as you said, I am addressing the Council here - large-scale and long-term action to combat climate change, which means having a new, more ambitious Kyoto Protocol, and that is why the Copenhagen Summit in December is so important; secondly, an increase in the financial aid for the commitments already made so as to attain 0.7% of GDP by 2015; and, lastly, thirdly, legal protection for these new environmental refugees who are starting to flood in."
"For what are we going to do with them?"
"To where are we going to return them if, by chance, they want to enter Europe?"
"To Libya, as this trade agreement that I invite you to study, Mr De Gucht, this future agreement that we will have with Libya, proposes?"
"We absolutely must establish a proper plan and proper means of managing the flows of environmental migrants and we must bridge the legal gaps that affect the protection of these migrants."
"I believe that we have a huge responsibility because it is clear that there is much more at stake here than solidarity; we really are dealing with the future of this planet."
"Mr President, we MEPs have a twin responsibility towards, firstly, our citizens, who expect us to make real efforts in Copenhagen, and, secondly, the countries of the South, of which Europe has always been a supporter, if not the supporter, at international level."
"We must send out a genuine message to the countries of the South by means of a clear financial commitment that will permit an aid package to be agreed on in addition to development aid, which absolutely must reach the agreed level, i.e. 0.7%."
"The Union's contribution should not be less than EUR 35 billion per year by 2020 and, from 2010, between EUR 5 and 7 billion should be made available to the countries of the South to cover the most urgent requirements."
"My second point concerns the method of financing."
"We will not limit ourselves - we will be unable to limit ourselves - to the existing funds alone."
"Other methods of financing will have to be found, because if there is no money in Copenhagen, then there will be no ambitious agreement in Copenhagen either."
"This will most probably mean - even though the subject is very controversial - that we will have to raise the issue of a tax, a kind of 'green Tobin tax', to finance the fight against climate change."
"Thirdly, on the matter of deforestation, which I would point out accounts for 20% of today's greenhouse gas emissions, it is absolutely imperative that we uphold the target of zero gross deforestation by 2020."
"I would draw your attention to the difference between gross deforestation and net deforestation, which would enable primary forests to be replaced with poplars, the idea being that it produces the same result."
"We all know that it does no such thing."
"It is true that we do need to be realistic about our industry, but we also need to be realistic about our survival and that of our children."
"Mr President, Mr Carlgren, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the world's future will be at stake in Copenhagen, but before that, it is the credibility of the European Union, as the global leader in the fight against global warming, that will be at stake at the end of October in Brussels."
"The Member States must make climate-related financing proposals that are proportionate for a tragic situation."
"Together with the commitment - which I hope will be ambitious - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the issue of financing and of reducing and adapting to climate change in developing countries will represent a major theme in the forthcoming negotiations."
"The figures speak for themselves: 100 countries, most of them poor, account for only 3% of global emissions."
"Although developing countries have contributed the least to these greenhouse gas emissions, they are already the worst affected."
"According to a recent report by Oxfam, 26 million people have already been forced to migrate due to the effects of climate change or other forms of environmental damage."
"By 2050, these climate refugees could number more than 200 million. The effects of climate change could destroy the progress made in some developing countries and could quite simply prevent the Millennium Development Goals from being achieved."
"This is therefore not a question of charity."
"It is a question of us accepting our full responsibility and laying the foundations for a fair and peaceful world."
"The European Union's current strategy is unworthy of the ambitions declared by the leaders of environmental diplomacy."
"It must lay its cards on the table now in order to relaunch the negotiations."
"The Union cannot reasonably pledge less than EUR 35 billion in public finances."
"It goes without saying that these funds can only supplement those already pledged for official development assistance, all the more so because the commitments made in this area are not always honoured by our Member States."
"Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of our planet is in our hands."
"If we do not stop the damage being done to our environment and the inequalities, we can fear the worst."
"We have a choice between an ambitious and proactive Europe and a timid Europe that is aligned with the United States, which cares little about the fate of developing countries."
"I urge you to make the right choice."
"Mr President, Mr Carlgren, Commissioner, I would like to begin by responding to the previous speech."
"I do not believe that the European Parliament or the European Union should restrict themselves to modest ambitions in this area."
"A year ago, we completed the preparation of a climate package which is clearly the most advanced and most ambitious of its kind in the world."
"We should also acknowledge the fact that it will have perhaps the greatest economic impact of any legislation that has been passed here in the last decade."
"When I read through the declaration drafted by the European Parliament for Copenhagen, I see things there that I like."
"The declaration talks of the need to strengthen the role of the European Parliament, of the need to get ready for adaptations to climate change and we can surely all agree with the article on deforestation, in connection with which I would like to stress that deforestation is not, and has not been, a problem just of the developing world, but is also a European problem, so we must focus our attention on it."
"What is missing, however, is a reference to the need for global agreement, as has been pointed out both by the Council representatives and the Commission representative who is present here."
"Without a global agreement, we will go nowhere."
"We talk here about assistance for the poorest countries, which is all very well, but if you look at the current numbers for greenhouse gas production, you can see clearly that even if we were more ambitious in Europe and actually disconnected all of our energy sources, it would not change anything at all in terms of climate change as it is simply impossible for us to slow down this phenomenon."
"We know there is a need today to talk not only about China, which is repeatedly mentioned, but also about other rapidly developing economies such as Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and particularly India."
"I cannot imagine what India's next steps will be and what I have heard so far has not, I must admit, been very pleasing."
"I would like to emphasise in this Chamber that if we do not reach a global agreement, then all of our efforts will simply amount to a burden on the European economy and a masochistic annihilation of European competitiveness."
"Mr President, we must give support to developing countries to help them adapt to climate change - a phenomenon for which they are not responsible, but as a result of which they are suffering disproportionately."
"Developing countries do not have the resources to combat climate change that we have in Europe."
"As we turn our attention to the United Nations negotiations in Copenhagen, what we need is solidarity that is real and practical."
"This solidarity must be demonstrated through financial and technical support."
"This support must be in addition to our Overseas Development Aid."
"We should not give something with one hand while taking it away with the other."
"The countries must have a full participatory role, no matter what financial mechanisms are in place to distribute this financial support."
"One of the most important ways in which we should measure any deal made in Copenhagen is to look at the way in which it helps the developing world deal with the challenge of climate change."
"For example, significant help to combat deforestation will be vitally important in a comprehensive agreement."
"Without financial solidarity and the transfer of technology, we will not see the progress which we all need."
"There is no doubt that climate change is accelerating."
"No further time can be wasted."
"If climate change is not dealt with, it will result in disasters all over the world."
"The economic recession should give us the courage to move more quickly towards a green economy."
"Our scientific approach should not be changed."
"We should not back down from the courage and political will we have shown hitherto."
"Actions that will be carried out at international level must be ambitious and tied to the scientific reality of our own weather, and we most move ahead with the understanding that it is not the developing countries who created that problem."
"We created it ourselves."
"Mr President, last night, to great applause, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted a Christmas list for the climate change conference in Copenhagen in December."
"The list includes a lot of well-intentioned, large and heavy presents."
"But, dear Santa Claus, a.k.a. the Commission: is there any chance at all of all these well-intentioned desires being realised, when 500 million US citizens have health, pensions, jobs and welfare on their agenda, and 2.5 billion Chinese and Indians just want the same living standards that some of us here in western Europe have?"
"We have no influence on what the Sun does."
"As we all know, it determines a great deal of the climate on our planet."
"To put it another way: what can the Commission realistically do to make all 6 billion people on this Earth use fewer resources, not in the future but right here and now?"
"Mr President, there are two overriding themes in this place: first, concern with the growing gulf between the political elite and the ordinary taxpayers."
"Second, a hysterical obsession with man-made global warming."
"These two themes are intimately linked."
"The global-warming fixation is a classic example of how the political class here is out of touch with the little people who have to pay the bills."
"While the EU backs the Copenhagen proposals to further the deindustrialisation of the West and the corporate domination of the Third World, a growing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as an elite scam - an excuse to tax and control us and to impose internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of the nation state."
"Can you not see the danger in this growing gulf?"
"It is time to look at the facts."
"Man-made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics."
"The so-called consensus on the issue is the product not of debate but of the suppression of expert dissent."
"Before the political class and the green industrial complex dare to impose a single new tax, poisoned light bulb or useless wind farm on the ordinary taxpayer, they need to try to convince the public that global warming is man-made, that returning to the warmer climate of medieval times would be a bad thing and that there is something that Europe - as opposed to the United States, China and India - can actually do about it."
"Either hold a debate and close the gap between you and the people, or do not complain when we nationalists - the ones who listen to the people - close it for you."
"Mr President, I would like to thank more or less everyone who has taken part in this debate for the support you are giving the EU in its highly important work in the climate negotiations."
"The EU has a vital responsibility."
"We will really need Parliament's support if we are to successfully play our part."
"The efforts and views of Parliament are crucial to this work."
"Can I also state outright that I very much appreciate the fact that development issues have been so central in this part of the debate."
"I agree with Mr Florenz's comment that it is incredibly important that this does not simply become a 'beauty contest'."
"It is not a London auction in which our task is to outbid each other."
"Rather, it is about creating a robust architecture that genuinely creates foreseeable and extended initiatives for developing countries in the long term."
"In this context, the very strong work of the EU is vital."
"Consequently, I also agree with Mrs de Keyser's challenge to developed countries to finally meet the 0.7% goal for development aid."
"Ultimately, this is a matter of solidarity."
"As one of the wealthier regions of the world, the EU has good reason to demonstrate its strength and solidarity."
"I would also say to Mrs Lepage that I absolutely agree that there is a need for new, increased and foreseeable initiatives and resources."
"However, Official Development Assistance will also play a part in ensuring that development issues are integrated with climate policy."
"Consequently, both ODA resources and new funding will be required."
"One crucial development issue is ending the deforestation of rainforests."
"I would like to see strong support in Copenhagen for initiatives to combat rainforest deforestation and to promote reforestation and sustainable forestry."
"The system currently being constructed under the name REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) will be of vital importance in this context."
"I believe that those who deny the climate problem are actually passing on the bill to the ordinary people."
"Moreover, it is a way of hiding the problem and of hiding the reasons why ordinary people are having to pay the price of climate degradation."
"This is the case in developed countries - and it is even more the case in developing countries, where the very poorest are likely to be those hit hardest by climate degradation."
"That is why we are turning to the group of developed countries as a whole."
"As Mr Florenz says, we need to cooperate with major nations such as the US."
"However, pressure is also needed to increase efforts to drive home the message that emissions must be sufficiently reduced."
"That is why it is so important for the EU to get to the heart of the emissions problem, i.e. the actual increases in emissions."
"We have the most ambitious and the most far-reaching targets in the world."
"It is now a matter of making sure that we get others to join us in taking measures at the level required to save the climate."
"The economic crisis provides an excellent opportunity to increase investments in green initiatives; in other words, in new green products, in new companies with green production, in growth companies with green production, and in new jobs created through green initiatives."
"It is also a way of rejuvenating our economies."
"We must take the lead in the offensive towards a low-carbon society, which will also create the conditions for real development opportunities in developing countries."
"We must make it possible for developing countries to bypass the fossil fuel-dependent economies route taken by the developed countries and to create low-carbon growth for the future instead."
"It is also a way of finally turning to the rapidly growing developing economies and telling them that developed countries have a responsibility for the poorest and most vulnerable; but the fastest growing economies among the developing countries - and China already accounts for the world's highest emissions - must also shoulder their responsibility and make a contribution to solving the climate problems."
"With this approach, Europe will be able to play a vitally important role as we lead the way towards an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly, what I have noticed in the debate is that all political groups agree on the principles that we should put forward in Copenhagen."
"I think this is a very important feature."
"It is not very common in a Parliament with so many political parties and political groups to nevertheless have unanimous support for what you are proposing."
"Secondly, Mr Florenz and others have said that there should not be a competition to put bids on the table - it is about commitments."
"This might be true but, on the other hand, I think it is important that we have put a bid on the table and said that we are ready to do this, provided, of course, that we get the green light from the European Council later this month."
"This is not simply a competition."
"It is about an engagement of the European Union."
"We look forward to the other political and economic heavyweights also putting bids on the table, which has not been the case up to now for several of them."
"We understand that the situation of the United States is not very easy at the moment but it is important that they put a bid on the table so that we can negotiate."
"Otherwise, the deadlock that we fear we are in at the moment will continue."
"(FR) I believe that it is true that developing countries are the worst affected, both by the economic crisis, for which they are not responsible, to say the least, and by climate change."
"We must offer developing countries a substantial amount of support in this regard."
"However, we will not only have to support developing countries in this spirit, but we will also have to be courageous with regard to our own industries and our own economic operators."
"When people talk about deforestation in developing countries, this too is a responsibility of our countries, of the European Union."
"I believe that, following Copenhagen, we will have to acknowledge the need to adopt laws with extraterritorial aspects so that we are not confronted with a situation in which, on the one hand, we are financing the adaptation to climate change and the mitigation of that phenomenon and, on the other, economic operators are having an opposite effect in developing countries."
"A last word on ODA: I think that this is a very important topic that we will also have to tackle amongst ourselves, because one of the biggest fears is that the 0.7% of GDP would be reached by adding adaptation efforts."
"Already now, ODA includes many topics which constitute adaptation, and that is quite normal."
"That will continue, of course, but we should find a measuring mechanism by which we can clearly distinguish the present efforts we are making from the additional efforts which have to be made for climate change."
"That is something that we will certainly have to come back to after Copenhagen."
"(NL) Mr President, following 10 years of discussion, we are now approaching the Copenhagen climate change conference."
"We have 50 days left in which to reach an ambitious agreement with binding targets, not only for Europe but also for the United States and countries such as China and India."
"An ambitious agreement requires adequate financial resources - as was mentioned a moment ago in this debate - and these not just from the European Union."
"All countries will have to provide financial resources so that developing countries, too, can participate in a climate agreement."
"After all, solidarity with the very poorest must be firmly embedded in any climate deal."
"The Commission has rightly taken the lead on financing, but what Mr Florenz was mainly driving at was that, in this House, we are pretty much trying to outbid one another as to who gives the most, and the question is whether this is really helpful."
"You have rightly challenged the Member States to participate, and I also commend the Swedish Presidency on its efforts."
"Yet the United States and the emerging economies, too, must put their hands in their pockets."
"You can count on our support."
"Much remains to be done in Europe, too, however."
"Although we are among the world leaders when it comes to our emission standards, we are lagging far behind the United States in terms of private-sector investment in technological innovations and sustainability."
"I see positive incentives for green investments and innovations by enterprises as more promising than a new European tax."
"After all, particularly at a time when we urgently need more activity and employment, European investors and enterprises must be increasingly challenged to do their bit towards this necessary transition in Europe and worldwide."
"(SV) Mr President, Mr Carlgren - who is representing the Council here today - started by saying that many people are tending to give in to pessimism ahead of the Copenhagen conference."
"I can only agree, and I really hope that a majority of the European Parliament can ensure that the pessimists that Mr Carlgren must do battle with within his own Presidency government and on the Council are not allowed to have the casting vote."
"We have to resolve two specific issues if we are to prove the pessimists wrong."
"The first, which has already been mentioned, is, of course, the financing of climate efforts in developing countries."
"The Commission's proposal is quite simply not enough."
"The EU's contributions to developing countries must be at least EUR 30 billion per year by 2020 and we must provide substantial support for restructuring measures as early as 2012."
"Naturally, this support must be in addition to regular aid."
"Reallocating money that has already been promised would only jeopardise our ability to reach a global climate agreement."
"I would like to ask Mr Carlgren whether he has the Council's backing for his high ambitions."
"Secondly, we must take the two degree target seriously."
"If we are to succeed in this, it is not enough for the developed world to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases by 20%."
"I would therefore like Mr Carlgren, as the Council's representative, to once again state his position on this matter."
"Many of us consider it necessary to reduce emissions by between 30% and 40% by 2020."
"What level of ambition does the Council have - and does Mr Carlgren have the Council behind him?"
"(FR) Mr President, there are, in my view, three essential points in this debate."
"Firstly, the Copenhagen conference is a gamble on the future."
"The gamble has not yet paid off, as the Presidency has just pointed out."
"I will not go so far as to say that everything depends on the European Union, but without determination and credibility, as Mrs Joly has just mentioned, nothing will be achieved in this area."
"My second point is that we must be careful not to add confusion to uncertainty."
"The European Union must remain credible when it comes to the impact of climate change on developing countries."
"It made a commitment in 2005 concerning the level of official development assistance, which must reach 0.7% in 2015."
"Skimping on that objective is out of the question."
"There can be no question of diluting that promise, either through a reduction in the commitment as I just explained it, or through a reallocation of the amounts paid in official development assistance for the purposes of combating climate change."
"It should be pointed out that the sums that are due to be announced in Copenhagen as being earmarked for developing countries must be additional funds."
"The sum of EUR 35 billion has just been mentioned; we are talking here about an additional EUR 35 billion."
"The European Union would be well advised not to allow the slightest doubt to remain about its determination to fight for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, on the one hand, and against climate change, on the other."
"Were the European Union to deviate from this path, it would amount to a political breakdown that would undoubtedly undermine developing countries' confidence in the European Union."
"If we even manage to agree on this point, this debate will not have been in vain."
"Thirdly, we need the United States, China, India and all of the industrialised countries, but we also need emerging countries and, of course, developing countries."
"To that end, it would be wise to think about new North-South partnerships, particularly in the area of alternative energy production."
"The use of solar energy to generate electricity in the south of the Mediterranean can become, if we so wish, one of the major North-South projects, in response to the economic crisis, on the one hand, and the climate-change crisis, on the other."
"This should not, under any circumstances, undermine the efforts that must be made in the context of combating deforestation, for example, where the responsibility - I am also keen to point out - of emerging countries, some of which are members of the G20, is overwhelming."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Finnish poet compared humanity to passengers on a train who are on a journey to hell, but who focus their attention on squabbling over a seat in first class."
"Once again, this is a time for EU leadership."
"The best way we can help break the deadlock over climate talks is for the EU Summit next week to make an offer to finance climate measures in the developing countries."
"Yesterday, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety gave its support for a figure of EUR 30 billion as the EU's share of financing."
"It is obvious that the EUR 2-15 billion proposed by the Commission cannot be enough."
"If we are honest, we must recognise our historical responsibility for climate change and that our emissions per capita are still many times greater than those of China or India, for example."
"(NL) Mr President, the climate change summit has to succeed, and so Europe must speak with one voice and set its sights high in the negotiations."
"Copenhagen is important because God's creation is highly vulnerable, and is deeply affected by man's actions."
"Special attention is required for developing countries."
"People in these countries make barely any contribution to climate change, but it is they who bear the brunt of it."
"Crops wither or are washed away by flooding, villages are destroyed by cyclones, the development of whole regions is set back years in a single night."
"Our industrialised countries have greatly contributed to climate change, and therefore bear responsibility for providing developing countries with adequate and sustainable financial and technical support."
"The Bali Action Plan put that well."
"Therefore, it is also important to make sufficient European funds available; after all, that is what this is all about."
"That is why we are saying that an annual minimum of EUR 15 billion must go into the Climate Fund, plus a contribution from the other major world economies."
"They, too, must face up to their responsibilities."
"Finally, I am pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council has drawn attention to deforestation."
"We consider this an essential area."
"Combating deforestation is the best way of reducing CO2."
"(NL) Mr President, deforestation is often somewhat neglected when climate issues are debated in the light of development aid."
"Fortunately, this is not the case in today's debate in this House."
"Forests, including the tropical rainforests, counteract a substantial proportion of CO2 emissions."
"Land-use change, such as deforestation and destruction of the rainforest, accounts for at least 18% of contemporary CO2 emissions."
"An equally sinister result of deforestation is that many indigenous peoples in developing countries are driven from their territories and are no longer able to meet their subsistence needs."
"Nor does the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) work; that is, the financing of projects in developing countries in order to be able to emit more CO2 ourselves."
"Unfortunately, it is still the way of the world that the interests of rich countries and major industries are deemed more important than social and economic justice."
"Deforestation must be stopped, but industrialised countries are morally obliged to give developing countries financial and technical support with this."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday evening, the Lega Nord delegation was the only political party which voted, in committee, against this resolution."
"We voted against as we consider it to be euro-folly."
"At a time of industrial crisis such as the one we are experiencing, with the loss of competitiveness and jobs, the idea of funding the technological innovation of third countries that are developing countries equates to sounding the death knell for European businesses."
"This text lays down an appropriation of EUR 30 billion a year until 2020 for countries such as China, India and Brazil, which are our most dangerous and dishonest competitors, and, at the same time, asks our industries to further cut emissions, with serious economic consequences."
"We cannot transform the legitimate battle to protect the environment into a war between poor peoples."
"As long as there are countries like China, which make unfair competition their industrial policy, there can be no eco-sustainable global market."
"We in the Lega Nord support the workers, the businessmen and women who, on a daily basis, have to fight the mammoth industrial groups of countries which have no concept of rules."
"'Yes' to the environment but 'no' to funding our competitors at the expense of our workers."
"(HU) Mr President, opinions vary as to what extent mankind influences climate change."
"My view is that we do have an influence, and the purpose of the Copenhagen climate conference is to mitigate this."
"I strongly believe that the outcome will be decided in the political domain."
"What means can we use to successfully persuade the biggest polluters to cut their emissions?"
"We will not do it by promoting the strong message from Europe that we will make cuts of not 20%, but 30 and 40%."
"We must get the biggest polluter in the world, the United States, to reduce its large-scale pollution."
"A decision implementing such an amendment was actually proposed in the relevant committee."
"There were many people who optimistically expected that Barack Obama would bring about major changes and travel to Copenhagen."
"However, he attended the International Olympic Committee meeting to campaign for Chicago instead."
"Without success."
"The European Union's leaders act on behalf of 500 million people on many occasions unnecessarily."
"The question is why they are not daring to act more decisively now because it is only with their intervention that we will be able to achieve success on a global issue, something which cannot be done at a local level."
"(PL) Mr President, it was with great unease that I received news of the meeting of finance and environment ministers, and specifically of the draft final document, which does not contain a solution to a key question: how does the European Union want to support the poorest countries of the world in their efforts to limit carbon dioxide emissions and adapt to climate change?"
"This is, indeed, a key matter."
"In the draft document, there is not even a repetition of the sums which the European Commission is proposing - that the needs of developing countries in this area are estimated at EUR 100 billion annually to 2020, and what the EU's contribution to that amount might be."
"What is more, there is no decision as to what mechanism of cofinancing by Member States would be introduced, and we know that proposals on this are very diverse."
"Of course, we can understand arguments which say that we should be cautious about making specific declarations, and that we should wait for proposals from other countries, especially those which have strong economies."
"If, however, the EU wants to be a leader in the fight against climate change, it must present specific proposals and specific solutions, especially because part of the problem is our internal affair, as is the cofinancing mechanism."
"It is our duty to negotiate a fair agreement with developing countries."
"The poorest countries of the world have contributed to climate change to the least extent and, at the same time, are bearing the greatest consequences of that change."
"The significant dependence of many of the poor countries on agriculture and fishing, and also their weak infrastructure, leave them in a very difficult situation when it comes to climate change."
"Over the last four years, Africa, which is the poorest continent and one of the most exposed to the consequences of climate change, has received less than 12% of the funds which are available for fighting climate change."
"This is not the way to persuade such countries to become involved in the process."
"(NL) Mr President, in the Pacific region, thousands of people are having to move because their islands are being flooded; in Sudan, the livestock is dying of thirst."
"Everyone has seen the pictures, and the most important thing with regard to these and other effects of climate change is that the polluter must pay."
"In Copenhagen this December, the world faces the historic task of giving substance to those words."
"However, Oxfam calculates that, to date, three quarters of changes in poor countries have been made by the countries themselves."
"Meanwhile, the oil disappears unhindered from these developing countries, often without fair payment reaching their treasuries."
"In the future, climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion per year."
"This money goes not towards development but merely towards creating the preconditions for development, as a Pacific island may just escape submersion thanks to climate policy, or desertification may be prevented, so that people can continue to live and work where they want."
"Of course, there are climate measures that can also stimulate the development of poor countries."
"Planting trees helps to combat desertification."
"At present, however, money for climate policy comes mainly from development-policy funds, and that is unacceptable."
"'No new funds,' says Commissioner De Gucht."
"Fair enough, but then it should be ensured that the existing funds are topped up."
"The developing countries are now suffering a triple blow."
"Most EU countries are failing to keep their own promises with regard to development policy, the economic crisis has meant that less is being invested in poor countries, and the development budget is decreasing."
"A fourth point could be added: the poor countries themselves are having to pay for the climate damage they have not caused."
"We must break through this logic in Copenhagen by introducing new financing mechanisms."
"Development policy must also be coordinated with climate policy from now on."
"The two will have to be aligned with each other as never before."
"The most important thing is that the developing countries themselves be given a say when it comes to spending the Climate Fund transparently."
"This fund must be introduced, therefore, for the EU and for the world."
"(FR) Mr President, we are the main ones responsible for climate change, but developing countries are its main victims, which is why the developed countries, which are also the biggest polluters, will have to make some strong commitments in Copenhagen."
"This is necessary for us, but it is even more necessary for the countries of the South."
"We have accumulated a debt over a long period of time, particularly with Africa."
"That is why we will have to find the right level of financial and technological compensation."
"Europe will have to step up to the plate even if it is painful for our fellow citizens."
"We will have to help these countries to adapt their economies and to combat climate change, but we will also have to think up a radically different development policy."
"Africa needs a protected market if sustainable agriculture is finally to emerge."
"Africa needs to protect its forests, its soil and its resources from the plunder of the developed countries."
"Copenhagen will only succeed if we can convey this message of shared responsibility and solidarity."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths and will cause millions more in the future."
"Inaction is a crime against humanity."
"This is an emergency, but the negotiations are at a virtual standstill."
"However, countries such as Japan, Australia, Norway, China, Brazil and South Africa are making efforts that are commensurate with their responsibilities."
"This is not the case with the United States, and it is unfortunately no longer the case with Europe."
"Extending Europe's ambitions to the entire planet would result in global warming of 4 degrees."
"That is totally unacceptable."
"However, it is Europe that holds the key to Copenhagen."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if the European summit, acting on the European Parliament's recommendations, takes the right decisions at the end of the month, then Europe can boost the negotiations - with targets of a 30% reduction and a EUR 35 billion aid package for the countries of the South."
"Mr President, the way in which certain Member States today use aid for the countries of the South as a negotiating tool is, in our view, absolutely shocking."
"The distress of the countries of the South is not a matter for negotiation."
"Mr President, it is critical for an international consensus to be reached on tackling climate change and global warming."
"The Copenhagen Summit provides us with an opportunity."
"But let us think for a moment of the problems facing this summit."
"The US, the world's biggest economy, has failed to agree to specific greenhouse gas emission reductions for 2020, and many other developed industrialised nations are uncertain as to whether the ambitious actions required are possible."
"Let us be clear: we really have no choice."
"The EU, in setting ambitious targets for 2020 and 2050, has acted courageously and must now urge others to do the same."
"We cannot meet our targets without cooperation from other states."
"The establishment of an effective global carbon market is crucial, as is international consensus if we are to avoid the risk of protectionist measures relating to CO2 emissions within the EU."
"At Copenhagen, we must encourage courageous leadership from the national governments of large industrialised nations."
"Although individual states in the US have begun to tackle climate change, there is a woeful lack of leadership from the Federal Government."
"We need the US and emerging economies such as India and China to form a partnership with us for the future of our planet."
"We can encourage developing nations to follow a different, less environmentally damaging path of industrialisation."
"They still have time to take a fresh approach that will be less environmentally damaging, and we must help them in the planning and building of the infrastructure which will achieve this."
"(PT) Mr President, the approach to the problem of climate change has been stripped of certain essential aspects and, above all, skewed by so-called 'market solutions'."
"At present, fossil fuels provide for almost 85% of the world's energy needs."
"A consistent approach to climate change should focus on reducing this dependence."
"Instead, the main tool proposed by the European Union to tackle climate change, carbon trading, will not only fail to help alleviate this dependency; it will itself prove an obstacle to the necessary change in energy paradigm."
"Experience tells us that trading in emission allowances has not led to a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases; quite the contrary."
"Various examples belie the ability of the market to control emissions, while others demonstrate the effectiveness of normative regulation and targeted investment, particularly in relation to impacts and safeguarding the environment."
"The environmental problems that humanity faces today are many and diverse, and are serious enough to threaten the existence of life on earth as we know it, but they are unlikely to find a solution within the irrational system that caused them in the first place."
"Mr President, I take this opportunity of wishing well the east European cities in the coming of the very early skiing season, with the snow and ice that have come there."
"Of course, this is indicative of the fact that, as independent science has now confirmed, the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002, and temperatures have been broadly flat since 1998."
"So we are all talking here about something which is not happening."
"Time and time again I have heard Members here talk of CO2 as a pollutant."
"A pollutant!"
"It is a life-giving natural gas."
"It gives me the impression that some of our Members have not had the benefit of a formal education."
"Isn't this really just about the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people's trouser pockets to steal yet more tax from them?"
"Isn't this all about political control?"
"Isn't this all about politics and big business?"
"The whole thing is a sham - this bogus hypothesis, this ridiculous nonsense that man-made CO2 is causing global warming."
"Enough please, before we damage irrevocably the global economy."
"(RO) I include myself among the MEPs who believe that agriculture is a solution to and not merely a cause of climate change."
"I think that it is even one of the victims of this phenomenon because drought and floods are affecting us all in Europe with ever-increasing regularity, but their impact is felt primarily by farmers."
"I also include myself among the MEPs who believe that we need a common agricultural policy in the future as well."
"We need it so that we can develop new models and new methods of production to restore the agricultural and domestic biodiversity which we had already lost 70% of at the start of this millennium."
"When we talk about agriculture, we are talking about living beings, starting with the soil, then the plants and especially the trees, forests and pasture land."
"I would like to think that this is the kind of message and approach which will be in evidence in Copenhagen in two months' time and that the EU's policy in this area will be seen in a concrete and strategic manner, as well as in budgetary terms, to treat agriculture as a solution, as I mentioned at the start of this speech."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is politics, and not religion, that we are debating here."
"For that reason, we should make a distinction between facts and empirical certainties on the one hand and hypotheses on the other."
"It is a fact that the global temperature has risen by around 0.7 °C when compared with the pre-industrial age."
"It is also a fact, however, that the temperature has hardly risen at all over the last ten years."
"A further fact is that Copenhagen is an international conference and that the Community's CO2 emissions make up approximately 17% of the global total."
"The Community has already implemented legislation requiring that its CO2 emissions be cut by 20% by 2020."
"Now let us consider the hypotheses."
"One hypothesis is that the global temperature will continue to rise."
"A second hypothesis is that there is a direct connection between CO2 emissions and the CO2 content in the air and the rise in the temperature, while a third hypothesis has it that humanity can have a real influence on this CO2 content in the air."
"There are various scientific opinions on this."
"This is a dilemma that we, as politicians, are facing, and that we must make a decision about."
"It would be useful, however, to take a second observation into account in order to provide orientation for our policy making, and that observation is that all societies which work in a very efficient way with their energy and resources are very successful."
"In the light of this it makes sense to operate a policy that makes it possible to be energy and resource-efficient and to do so at Community level so that we can continue to play a leading role internationally from a economic policy point of view, but also to offer help to other States, especially less developed States, to take the same path."
"If we now look at the funds transfers that are being discussed in this regard, it is a key point that they should be very well monitored and be tied to conditions, because otherwise all we are doing is opening a second route to development aid."
"Mr President, I do not think Godfrey Bloom heard the BNP speaker, but if he had he would have seen that they have so much in common, as I always suspected."
"It was almost a carbon copy speech."
"We heard something about polling."
"In fact, in a recent survey, more than two thirds of Europeans said that climate change was a very serious issue, and 20% said it was a fairly serious issue."
"For the UK, that same figure was 51% saying it was a very serious issue and 30% a fairly serious issue."
"That is 81%."
"In fact, only 10% of Europeans said it was not a serious issue at all."
"The opinion polls show that people in Europe do care about climate change and they do understand."
"That is why all the mainstream parties in this House are backing the Council and the Commission in Copenhagen and why we backed the legislative package last year."
"Last night in the Environment Committee, Members voted by 55 to 1 to back an ambitious negotiating position of the European Union in Copenhagen."
"On the financing side, which is extremely important this week - and we know the finance ministers are meeting today - we want funds, additionality, no double counting and good governance structures."
"Sometimes in life you see things you never forget."
"About three years ago, Fiona Hall and I went to northern Kenya."
"We went to one of the poorest communities and met pastoralist farmers there."
"We met young women - girls - who were being married at ever younger ages in northern Kenya."
"Why?"
"Because when a young woman gets married in Kenya, in return for her hand in marriage, her father receives cows in payment because cows are the currency."
"Cows are becoming a rare commodity in northern Kenya because of climate change."
"We will never make poverty history unless we tackle climate change, and this House has a duty to respond to that call."
"(SV) Mr President, if you include the complete production chain, around 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions come from food production."
"You could say that agriculture is the big villain in this context."
"We have to understand that agriculture and forestry are probably one of the most crucial areas to look at if we are to get to grips with the emissions problem."
"To do so, however, we rich countries must be brave enough to adopt new technology and to move away from our past experience."
"We have to change our agricultural policy so that we no longer dump produce on the developing countries' markets."
"Perhaps that would be one of the most useful measures we could take to get Africa's agriculture standing on its own two feet and to liberate the women of Africa."
"(SV) Mr President, Mr Carlgren, you come here time after time with fine speeches, but what about the actual content?"
"In developing countries, the land is drying out and diseases are spreading."
"There are growing numbers of climate refugees."
"Do you ask them to smile in the face of death?"
"You can turn around the pessimism that you on the Council are yourselves creating by making some specific promises."
"So I wonder: will you offer EUR 35-40 billion a year in new aid for climate measures?"
"Will you rule out nuclear power and carbon capture and storage from projects qualifying for assistance?"
"Will you accept compulsory licensing of important green technology to the poorest countries?"
"Will you save the forests by refusing the market-based mechanisms of REDD?"
"If you can promise all this, then you will also achieve a 40% reduction - and then we will all leave here with a smile on our faces."
"(PL) Mr President, the position of Parliament on the global division of obligations concerning CO2 reduction unfortunately lacks balance regarding the way the costs of this reduction are to be borne."
"By adopting the resolution, we are undermining the climate package, which was so hard to negotiate, and the costs of which currently fall unequally on the Member States of Central Europe."
"Adopting the solutions proposed today will increase the inequality still further."
"We are trying to force on Member States norms which are lethal to their economies while, at the same time, not requiring anything specific of the countries which bear the greatest responsibility for CO2 emissions on a world scale."
"This is unjust and ineffective."
"Without proportion on a world scale, we are only increasing the competitive edge of China, India and Brazil."
"The resolution goes even further - it proposes subsidising the poorest countries."
"The sum of EUR 330 billion until 2020 means a contribution from EUR 16.5 billion up to as much as EUR 40 billion from a country like Poland."
"This is political madness, which undermines the economic sense of membership of the European Union."
"Furthermore, it is an ineffective method, as is demonstrated by the preparations being made to begin the exportation of electrical power from the Kaliningrad region bordering Poland."
"In Copenhagen, it will not be worth signing an understanding in which the burdens associated with limiting CO2 emissions are not spread proportionally on a world scale."
"(PT) Madam President, considering a plan of action for supporting developing countries in terms of climate change is a simple matter of justice and equality."
"They are the worst affected countries, yet they are also those who have contributed least to the situation in which we find ourselves."
"That is why we have to go beyond a mere declaration of intent."
"Going beyond a declaration of intent shows that we are decided and serious about fundamental issues such as financing."
"However ambitious our strategy may be, if the funding issues are not clearly defined, we cannot have any kind of concrete policy."
"The Council is talking about EUR 100 billion by 2020."
"There are various estimates, including those that mention the need for EUR 120 billion per year, every year, to support developing countries."
"We need our own resources, therefore, not just palliatives."
"For this reason, it is vital to establish how this financing is going to be implemented, and who is going to provide it."
"We must have the courage to tackle this issue and get all the stakeholders involved, while also including the private sector and industry."
"Or are we hoping that they will offer to contribute to this undertaking of their own accord?"
"(FI) Madam President, the climate mafia is using gullible green politicians to shift hundreds of millions of euros of the developed nations' tax resources to supranational companies making huge profits in developing countries, and to state-owned companies in developing countries, in the form of this type of climate charge now being promoted."
"For example, China could very easily attend to its obligations itself: it is the world's richest country in terms of its reserves of foreign currency."
"Finland and the European Union need to rescue their own steel, engineering and forest industries by calling for a decision at Copenhagen to be taken to introduce a specific emissions system to achieve climate targets for climate products, instead of the present targets based on percentages and emissions trading."
"This is the fairer option."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission."
"With regard to the subject that we are debating, there are some certainties and a set of uncertainties."
"The first certainty, or the first common element, is that there is now a major convergence of opinion that emissions need to be reduced and that clean energy sources need to be developed."
"The second certainty is that there needs to be a global approach to or way of dealing with the problem."
"Therefore, the countries that emit the most CO2 into the atmosphere need to take part in all international agreements."
"The major producers of CO2 include the United States, China, India and Brazil."
"The third certainty is that the European Union is putting a proposal on the table that is an obligatory system of targets: 20% or 30%."
"The fourth certainty is that there are no reasonable signs, for various reasons, that the major CO2 emitting countries are going to accept an agreement of this nature, and that is the reality."
"There is not such a lack of optimism if we acknowledge the reality; pessimism wins the day if we do not know the reality."
"It is only by acknowledging the reality that we can create an effective policy, and it will be a more optimistic policy."
"I think that the European Union, as it takes the lead on this issue, has a duty to put additional measures and additional proposals on the table."
"Japan has been mentioned here, and we have to talk about the success of projects such as the Sector Focus project, which affect the most polluting industries."
"On the basis of a process of benchmarking, such projects have achieved extraordinary objectives in Japan."
"These are the realistic ways of tackling climate change."
"Copenhagen is an opportunity, but it will only be an opportunity for efficiency rather than rhetoric if we base it on reality."
"Madam President, Commissioner Olli Rehn has praised this Parliament for its activities in bringing about the climate protection package and, in fact, we aim to continue to be ambitious."
"Last night, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted 55-1 in favour of adopting a resolution that sets high targets for the negotiations in Copenhagen."
"This result shows that the denial of climate change, the ignorance of these matters, is represented by a vanishingly small minority of individuals here in this House whose views really should be disregarded and who have made their views known here on a number of occasions, but who are actually swimming against the tide of opinion of the citizens of all the countries of the European Union."
"It makes no difference to the Earth's atmosphere where the CO2 comes from."
"That means that we need a global agreement for every country and not - as is already being argued in Bangkok - multiple agreements, with one for the US, one for Europe and one for the developing countries - that would be disastrous."
"We need a global pact against climate change and that means that we also need a global pact of solidarity of the rich countries with the poor ones."
"This point has already been made many times."
"Climate change represents an opportunity for us and also for the developing countries to set in motion low-carbon development with new technologies, together with the modernisation of the infrastructure."
"Europe must help this come about."
"When it comes to funding, we have endorsed the demand that the EU needs EUR 30 billion by 2020 and that we must develop funding tools that are durable and predictable."
"They must not simply be dependent on funds from the budget, but must also have other sources of funding."
"I want to stress, once again, that marine transport and aviation must be included and that, of course, the forests and agriculture have their own, significant share."
"Development and climate protection are not opposites - rather, they must be brought together into a synthesis in Copenhagen."
"(NL) Madam President, when all is said and done, there is only one solution to the problem of climate change, and that is technology."
"Only new technology can enable us to maintain our way of life."
"Yet the development of technology is too slow and its diffusion, especially to developing countries, is particularly slow."
"The climate is a global problem, but has not been tackled by sharing the best available technology."
"This was a complete failure under Kyoto, and so let us learn the lessons."
"We must, of course, take account of intellectual property."
"Particularly enterprises at the forefront of such development must be encouraged and rewarded accordingly."
"Yet this knowledge must be diffused more quickly."
"A fund was established to this end with regard to the ozone problem under the Montreal Protocol, and the idea of a Multilateral Climate Technology Fund has been raised."
"Can the Commission and the Council explain their views on this?"
"Finally, halting deforestation is particularly important as far as developing countries are concerned, yet I gather that the European Union is now divided as to the role of forests, especially thanks to Sweden, Finland and Austria."
"How can we induce developing countries to halt deforestation if the EU itself has an ambiguous attitude towards its own forests?"
"I would welcome Mr Carlgren's comments on this."
"(NL) Madam President, we are talking about climate change, but we should be talking about the people who are hardest hit by it, namely those in the least developed countries."
"In the Maldives, people are fighting rising sea levels, and in Sudan they are fighting for fertile land."
"The Commission keeps assuming that market actors will make a substantial contribution to climate-change adaptation."
"If one talks to all the investors, however, they keep saying the same thing: 'Yes, we are giving money, but mainly to the emerging economies."
"We are not going to invest in vulnerable countries.'"
"After all, these are unstable markets, and the projects involved when it comes to investing in climate-change adaptation are small in size."
"This is not the kind of thing investors put their money into."
"It must now be made very clear that public funding must be channelled to the least developed countries."
"The World Bank states clearly that the amount concerned must be at least EUR 80 billion."
"It is time the EU showed serious leadership by making a serious offer rather than offering the vague figure of EUR 2-15 billion."
"The EU must simply follow Parliament's lead and come forward with at least EUR 30 billion."
"Madam President, the climate change conference in Copenhagen in December presents us with a unique opportunity to address this massive and huge problem."
"If we consider the consequences of global warming, it is obvious that the developing world is paying the price for environmental damage caused by the richer nations."
"Climate change is not the only environmental problem we face but it is imperative that we attempt to address it in Copenhagen."
"It is the opportunity for the EU to speak with one voice and find solutions to a problem which is affecting us all."
"All countries must play their part in terms of achieving targets and sustainable development."
"The developing world must be supported and encouraged, but the targets set for these nations must be realistic."
"I know that there are others who hold a different view from the one that I hold, but I do not believe that we can afford to wait 50, 60 or 70 years to find out who was right or who was wrong."
"We have a responsibility today to act now to do what we can while we are here."
"Madam President, what a relief that they have stopped burning heretics or I would be well and truly alight by now."
"I am, though, glowing hot in my opposition to the concept of man-made climate change."
"Carbon dioxide accounts for only 0.038% of our atmosphere and only 4% of that is influenced by man's activity."
"It is a vital and irreplaceable food for plant life."
"The more plants receive, the faster they grow."
"A shortage of this gas will be far more serious than a surplus."
"The alarmist and incorrect statements that suggest any increase in carbon dioxide will create significant rises in sea levels is being used as an excuse by local authorities not to maintain low-cost wooden sea defences."
"When these inevitably rot, after 40 years' service, nothing is done to repair them and homes are lost."
"This is creating an aura of despair among coastal communities."
"If computer predictions cannot forecast the weather properly in the short term, they have no place whatsoever in predicting long-term changes."
"(SL) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Minister Carlgren and Commissioner De Gucht for the statements which they have given, but there is still something causing me concern."
"What concerns me is that we are talking about quantitative targets which will not have to be met until 2020 and 2050, respectively, while the experts are warning us that we need to start reducing global emissions as early as 2015."
"I would like to know whether perhaps the Commission has overlooked or abandoned this target."
"Secondly, we will need to come up with an all-encompassing agreement in Copenhagen, one which includes all countries."
"It is not enough for us to impose these ambitious environmental standards on Europe alone, as that will just mean that the technology that causes high emissions shifts to other parts of the world."
"I would be really interested to hear from the Commission how it intends to introduce into the negotiations the issue of apportioning the burden equally across developed industrial countries and what arguments it is going to use to encourage developing countries to shoulder their responsibilities."
"How are we going to prevent carbon leakage?"
"I would really like us to have an ace in our hands, a good card up our sleeves."
"Thirdly, I would like to point out that we cannot close our eyes to reality."
"Fossil fuels are the main source of emissions and we are not going to be able to ban them in the immediate future."
"Expecting countries to abandon coal just like that is unrealistic."
"Developed countries are not going to do it and developing countries are even less likely to do so."
"This is why we also need to devote a great deal of attention in international negotiations to the continuing development and use of technologies which enable fossil fuels to be used efficiently, without emitting greenhouse gases."
"There is one more thing that Europe can do right now: we can increase funding for the Seventh Framework Programme, which has been designed for the purposes of international cooperation on climate change."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Carlgren, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of climate change will keep us occupied much longer than the financial and economic crisis."
"There are parallels - both cost lots of money, and Copenhagen will be about reaching an agreement on the financial tools for the third world and the developing countries."
"The Copenhagen conference must succeed, and we can play our part in achieving that."
"Yesterday, we did a good job, we adopted the resolution in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety by a large majority, and I think that the resolution will achieve a large majority here in Parliament, and in so doing, we will change the political climate as Copenhagen approaches."
"There is often a psychological side to it, and we should all play our part in that."
"I do still have one specific concern."
"In the European Parliament, we have worked to get aviation included in emissions trading, and in the end we succeeded."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to ensure that this subject is pursued consistently in Copenhagen."
"We must achieve international agreement to the effect that shipping, and also aviation, are incorporated into the successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol."
"This is because these two transport sectors are growing to a disproportionate degree and are therefore contributing in a disproportionate way to global warming."
"We should not exceed the 2 degree Celsius mark. That, in fact, is where the parallels between the financial crisis and climate change cease."
"If we go over this mark, we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and that means that it is damage that we will not be able to reverse."
"Madam President, we must look at the opportunities that can flow from striking a comprehensive international agreement in Copenhagen so that we can effectively arrest climate change."
"The Union is committing to ensuring that 20% of all our energy needs will come from the renewable energy sector by 2020."
"Europe - and indeed my own country, Ireland - can become world leaders in developing new and innovative wave and tidal technologies."
"The development of such technologies is a vital component of our strategies to achieve our climate change targets."
"We must ensure that we maximise funding under the seventh and eighth EU research and technology framework programmes between now and 2020."
"(GA) The investment in green technology will help to create jobs in Europe at a time of economic crisis."
"We know about the great difficulties that will result if we do not accept our international responsibilities."
"We know about the challenges ahead of us."
"As such, we'll face these challenges steadfastly and responsibly."
"Madam President, do you know Russian roulette?"
"Have you ever played Russian roulette?"
"Of course not, because you have one chance in six of being killed or injured."
"If Copenhagen is not a success, we do not even have a 50% chance of keeping this planet from going into dangerous climate change."
"Why are we in this impossible situation?"
"We have basically lost twenty years - twenty years from the big Rio conference, twenty years of being lobbied by dirty industries from oil to coal to cars."
"Twenty years of the Centre-Right in the US and in Europe making it too difficult for Greens and others to push an ambitious agenda."
"So next week's European summit in Copenhagen is the last occasion for the Centre-Right in Europe - with the Swedish Presidency of the Council, and Denmark, as well as France and Germany, being ruled by Centre-Right politicians - to act responsibly."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Union is seen as a leader in the international arena in the area of promoting dialogue on action against climate change and setting policy priorities for the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"As part of the preparations which are under way for the Copenhagen conference, the European Union has made more pledges than any other region of the world."
"To date, not one of the industrial powers - the United States, Japan, Australia - has sent a specific proposal, with specific figures, giving details of aid for developing countries in their efforts to limit CO2 emissions and of support for the development of energy-efficient technologies based on renewable energy sources."
"Europe will only be a credible partner in negotiations if it presents realistic, achievable and common-sense proposals, which will be a starting point for reaching international consensus and understanding."
"Now Europe needs allies, and support for its existing proposals."
"Therefore, we should also be careful about increasing pledges on reduction from 20% to 30%, since other industrialised countries are not showing the will to set themselves such ambitious goals, while financial support for developing countries should also be a realistic undertaking."
"This must not just be a wish list."
"It should be a system of giving aid which complies with the principle of sustainable development, and which should make it possible for the beneficiaries to plan what they do."
"There is one more thing, which is significant from the point of view of the citizens of Europe."
"We should not forget that the summit in Copenhagen, our resolutions, and the preparations of Parliament for the summit should be accompanied by a clearly defined system of communication with the citizens, with society."
"We do not want a barrier or a gap to be created between society and the EU institutions in the system of communicating information about global warming."
"Madam President, I will keep my CO2 emissions down and I will be brief."
"Commissioner, it is good to see you in place."
"Presidency, it is good to see you here."
"Talk of 2020 or 2050 is not good enough."
"We need agreement and achievement now because climate change is placing poverty reduction at risk."
"We are seeing the diversion of ODA budgets away from development."
"That is unacceptable and puts at risk the Millennium Development Goals, which must be achieved."
"At Copenhagen, we will see 27 countries acting as one to achieve ambitious targets."
"We have heard the climate change deniers here in this House."
"Let me just say this: there is talk of plants and CO2; there is deforestation and desertification."
"This means that in some places there is no water."
"There are no trees."
"Climate change kills."
"It is as simple as that."
"Let us be clear - Member States should maintain their 0.7% of GNI for development and cap any use of that GNI at 10% maximum, and then bring in the additional funds needed to combat and defeat climate change."
"Madam President, I am concerned that the Commission's calculations on international climate finance are just smoke and mirrors."
"First, it has claimed that 90% of energy efficiency measures can be financed by developing countries themselves."
"That is EUR 30 billion per annum."
"In the EU, the biggest obstacle to introducing energy efficiency measures for both governments and for individual citizens is the lack of upfront financing."
"Why does the Commission believe that developing countries can finance efficiency measures without upfront funding when EU Member States themselves have struggled to do so?"
"Also, the idea that the international carbon market can fund EUR 38 billion a year is unrealistic."
"We have seen how slow the EU ETS carbon market has been to get off the ground and how badly the carbon price has been thrown off course by the economic crisis."
"It is likely to be many decades before there is a properly functioning international carbon market, so we need a new and additional financing measure now."
"(FR) Madam President, climate change, as we having been saying since this morning, is quite simply an increase in desertification and drought; it is deforestation, it is natural disasters, it is the spread of famine and of poverty, mainly in the countries of the South, and it is migratory flows."
"The Copenhagen Summit must have the commitment of the world's nations to find a balance between four important objectives, the first being, of course, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it is also a question of not holding back our economy, of preventing environmental dumping and of promoting Europe's new technologies."
"Therefore, on this subject, since we must take account of the poorest countries, I should like to draw your attention to developing countries, in particular, to the most advanced developing countries."
"This notion does not appear in the international texts, and these countries fall into the category of developing countries."
"Thus, they are not regarded as countries that are obliged to contribute to the effort to reduce greenhouse gases, even though they are some of the biggest consumers of carbon."
"I am, of course, thinking of China, India and Brazil, which absolutely must make a commitment in Copenhagen to achieve similar targets to those of the industrialised countries since, strictly speaking, they are nothing like most of the other developing countries."
"The efforts to reduce CO2 must be shared under the fairest of conditions."
"We must prevent all distortions of competition."
"The negotiations must also be an opportunity to stimulate the deployment of our new technologies and to enable substantial investment to be made in research and development."
"In Copenhagen we will have to - and this is a necessity - create the conditions for sustainable trade among countries, on the basis of mutual interests."
"Success will consist in promoting the dissemination of technologies in the least developed countries in return for the recognition of intellectual property rights and the opening up of their markets to these technologies."
"(ES) Madam President, the two most serious crises in the world are poverty and the effects of climate change: two crises that will be even more closely linked to each other in the future, two crises that become more devastating as each day goes by."
"There are now many more poor people than there were a year ago, tens of millions more."
"Today, the effects of climate change are more serious and more intense than they have ever been."
"We are a month and a half away from Copenhagen, just a few weeks away."
"In Copenhagen, we need to make a big effort."
"We need to focus more effort on combating climate change, but not using the resources that we are currently using for development aid, not with the resources that we are currently using for education or health."
"Developing countries need both types of resource."
"We therefore need to go beyond 0.7% of GNP."
"This was the message from various leaders at the recent United Nations meeting."
"This was the message from the President of the Spanish Government."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a gathering involving the Health Commissioner, Mrs Vassiliou, and medical experts from across Europe a few days ago in Brussels discussed the subject of 'Health and climate change'."
"It was a very informative event entitled 'Prescription for a healthy planet'."
"The President of the Standing Committee of European Doctors (CPME) used a very good image - the patient planet Earth is like a person suffering from a serious illness."
"The later you intervene, the more painful is the treatment and there comes a point when it is even too late for treatment."
"At that point, the patient is damaged beyond recovery."
"That is why we need to act quickly and determinedly for patient planet Earth."
"I hope that we all agree on that."
"It is equally as true that climate change affects everyone - every country on earth and every sector of the European economy."
"I see an imbalance - we put very heavy burdens on the traditional participants in European emissions trading, yet they represent less than 50% of the European Union's emissions."
"We therefore need more shoulders to bear the burden - we decided that last night."
"We also adopted Amendments 198 to 202 on the inclusion of aviation - as mentioned by Mr Groote - and marine transport."
"Perhaps this needs to be better worked out and differentiated, but it is a move in the right direction."
"The Commission and the Council must finally get more involved in this regard."
"At the EU summit in the run-up to Pittsburgh, and in Pittsburgh itself, no progress at all was made on this."
"The Council and the Commission must do more in this connection."
"I have one final word to add."
"Other regions in the world, too, must do more."
"I am pleased that Barack Obama has won the Nobel Peace Prize, but if he does not come to Copenhagen and if he does not put forward a decent proposal, then he will be frittering away his credibility and, for that reason, he must deliver something at Copenhagen."
"(EL) Madam President, developing countries have contributed less than anyone to climate change."
"At the same time, however, they experience the very worst repercussions."
"In Africa, millions of people need to travel further and further year on year in order to find water, wood for cooking and food."
"These are people who depend on the services provided to them by natural ecosystems and people who have contributed nothing to climate change."
"These natural ecosystems, such as the forests of Africa, store three times more carbon than they have emitted into the atmosphere, three times more carbon than exists in the atmosphere at present, while they absorb 50% of the carbon that we emit into the atmosphere every year."
"That is why protecting and extending forests, on the basis of natural processes and without commercial intentions, should be the top priority of our policy, both in order to combat and to adapt developing and developed countries to climate change."
"(EL) Madam President, I should like to take a position on the specific but very important matter of shipping in connection with Copenhagen and the developing countries."
"I have two comments: it would be a huge mistake to deal with shipping and aviation as if they were one and the same thing."
"Shipping is the most efficient and environmentally-friendly mode of transport, while aviation is more or less the worst."
"Targets therefore need to be set in shipping, but they must be fair in relation - in particular - to road transport, which competes with shipping and is much more polluting."
"By striking disproportionately at shipping in comparison with road transport, we are striking disproportionately at the core of the economies of developing countries, because developing countries are based predominantly on raw materials, agricultural products and industry which basically use shipping, whereas our economies are mainly service economies."
"Will we, I wonder, be able to persuade developing countries of our good intentions by proposing that we finance the climate change endeavour from money that we shall take, to a disproportionate degree, from shipping and which, as a percentage of GDP, will encumber developing countries more than developed countries?"
"I also wonder, having been informed that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance refused yesterday to back a debate on the correlation of targets for shipping with targets for land transport, if driving along a European motorway in a luxury car at 180 kilometres an hour is more ecologically friendly than carrying food and raw materials for the planet's economy."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Carlgren, Mr President of the Commission, we are facing a challenge for humanity, a challenge for the future generations."
"In order to take up the gauntlet, Copenhagen must provide the conditions for a global agreement, a single agreement, because, as the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr Leinen, was saying earlier, a universal alliance, involving industrialised countries and emerging countries alike, is necessary."
"Today, with our debate, but also with the drafting of a resolution by Parliament, we are once again calling on the European Union to maintain its leading role in this necessary policy to combat climate change."
"Let us remember that we must speak with one voice if we are to maintain our credibility."
"Yes, we must come to an agreement in Copenhagen to limit the increase in the global mean temperature so that it does not exceed the pre-industrial levels by more than 2 degrees."
"Yes, we must sign an agreement in Copenhagen in order collectively to ensure that, by 2020, there are 30% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than there were in 1990."
"That will not be enough, however."
"Not only is it necessary for developed countries to substantially reduce their emissions, but developing countries must help achieve the targets too."
"It follows that the industrialised countries must provide developing countries with adequate, long-term and predictable financial and technical support to encourage them to make a commitment to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions."
"Copenhagen must also enable developing countries to move in the direction of low-carbon models."
"Thus, allow me to address two areas that I feel are necessary for our future."
"Firstly, the introduction, at international level, of funding to combat global warming, based on the taxation of financial transactions."
"Secondly, I feel it is necessary to introduce a tax adjustment at Europe's borders that would hit imports of goods manufactured without the slightest concern for environmental protection, a tax adjustment linked to the contractually stipulated repayment to the countries of the South of the carbon tax collected in this way at Europe's borders, and which would be used to finance investment in the equipment they need to combat global warming."
"(FR) Madam President, following the example of the recent G20, which was an opportunity for Europe to play a leading role in the definition of a new world economic order, at the Copenhagen conference in December, Europe will again have a responsibility but, above all, an obligation, to show its international partners the path to pursue."
"Contrary to what was said just now, particularly by some of my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Europe has begun to assume its responsibilities in terms of environmental protection, since in December 2008, the energy and climate change package was adopted."
"With this package, Europe will have all the legitimacy it needs to guide the negotiations towards the definition of an ambitious, practical and global response to the challenges of climate change."
"The agreement that must be reached in Copenhagen will have to be based on a principle of shared responsibility, but also of differentiated responsibility."
"In concrete terms, as Mrs Grossetête just said, it is up to us, as industrialised countries, to ensure that our partners, the developing countries, have the means to follow us as we take the ambitious step of combating climate change."
"We also need to set an example, not least by committing ourselves to an ambitious programme aimed at an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050."
"I heard it said just now that this is not enough, but it is already a good start."
"At the same time, we must also create the conditions to ensure that developing countries can participate alongside us in this global effort."
"We have a responsibility, but we also have duties towards these countries."
"The simple fact is that we have a common challenge to overcome that requires everyone's involvement."
"However, as we know, we do not all have the same capabilities and we do not all have the same history."
"Copenhagen must therefore be a success, but a success achieved by means of a genuine contribution that goes beyond a mere commitment."
"The European Union will be judged on this contribution and on this commitment."
"Should Copenhagen not result in our international partners making firm, shared commitments to take concrete action, then, as the last speaker just said, we in Europe will have to impose a carbon tax at our borders."
"This will be the only way of making ourselves heard and of ensuring that our virtuous commitment has meaning."
"It is up to Europe to ensure that this message is clearly heard."
"(EL) Madam President, the basic challenge which we have before us seven weeks before the Copenhagen Summit is whether or not we shall manage to reach agreement in terms of taking responsibility for the global financing of policies for the moderation of climate change on the part of developing countries."
"Europe has made important steps by defining sources of financing and ways of organising it, but now the time has come for us to persuade other developed countries to take their share of responsibility, bearing in mind that support for efforts by developing countries to combat climate change also affords an opportunity to combat global inequalities and to narrow the divide between developed and developing countries."
"There is something else which we must not forget, especially here in the European Union."
"We are on the point of creating a new order of refugees, climate refugees who are not protected today under any international convention, and, as a result, they have no rights."
"Closing this legal loophole and substantially supporting climate refugees is a basic obligation of the international community in which the European Union must take a leading role."
"(PT) Madam President, Mr Carlgren, Mr De Gucht, the European Union should continue to play a leading role in the international negotiations to achieve an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen."
"This agreement should be based on the principle of shared yet differentiated responsibility."
"This principle should be applied equally to developing countries, but each one requires measures tailored to its individual situation, as they are at different stages and have different circumstances."
"All developing countries, with the exception of the least developed, should adopt national low-carbon development strategies."
"Developing countries will be faced with a cost of about EUR 100 billion to reduce their emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change."
"Some of the funding will come from the private sector, but international public funding will also be necessary, in addition to official development aid."
"It is paramount that we define how this funding system will be structured, along with the source and the amount of funding, so as to secure an agreement in Copenhagen."
"On the other hand, the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol should be reformed so that credits are only given to projects that allow supplementary reductions to be achieved."
"The economically more advanced developing countries and economically more competitive sectors should be gradually excluded from this mechanism, so that it can focus mainly on the poorest countries, especially those in Africa."
"(LT) The European Union is setting an example for other continents by tackling threats hovering over our planet."
"This also strengthens the fight against climate change."
"The European Union is ready to be the leader in the future as well, but all the countries participating in the Copenhagen conference must join this fight."
"Additional aid is required for developing countries."
"Their economic growth, like that of the BRIC countries, must be based on 'green technologies'."
"More attention must be paid to sharing the most advanced technologies and knowledge."
"The EU should show an appealing example, not just by making commitments to reduce emissions, but also by promoting renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency."
"Let us not forget that in the European Union too, there is a considerable gap between those countries successfully implementing new technologies and saving energy and those that are straggling behind."
"There must be a joint effort to eliminate that gap, and that would again be a good example to everyone."
"(FI) Madam President, certain facts need to be acknowledged."
"Firstly, our efforts with regard to climate so far have brought us no benefits."
"The strategy has proven ineffective because emissions have increased in absolute as well as in relative terms."
"Contrary to expectations, global carbon intensity has only increased at exactly the same time as there has been actual international investment in the area."
"Emissions per tonne of production in the countries that ratified the agreement have not fallen with any greater degree of success than in the countries that have remained outside the Kyoto Protocol."
"It is a poor agreement that we have, and it has to be replaced with a better, more comprehensive, more effective and more ambitious one."
"Secondly, it has to be said that we know less than we thought we did some time ago."
"Although emissions have increased more than was predicted, the temperature is not now logically following the rise in emissions."
"Now it has stopped increasing, and global cooling is predicted to continue over the years to come."
"Nevertheless, the time series is too short to draw any conclusions or to allow us to forget all about the earlier warming pattern."
"This information, which is confusing to the general public, does not therefore mean that we no longer have to worry about climate change, but it does mean that we need more research."
"Consequently, emissions have to be at a reasonable level in all circumstances, irrespective of whether there is rapid warming or not."
"The starting point for this should be the ideas on sustainable development in the UN's Millennium Development Goals Report."
"It does not merely scrutinise the carbon issue, but is also a comprehensive policy on climate."
"Thirdly, we are living through an economic crisis, and as a result we have a responsibility to our citizens."
"What we do must be wise and effective."
"The world can no longer afford a poor agreement on climate."
"The mistakes of Kyoto cannot be allowed to continue, and we do not need the sort of agreement that is content with simply moving emissions around from one place to another without actually reducing them."
"As the criteria underlying climate policy are currently about emissions from production and not consumption, the cause of the problem can be shifted elsewhere."
"Given the carbon leak that results from this, it is even possible that as local emissions fall, global emissions will rise."
"Instead, we need a huge investment in decarbonisation and in technology that reduces emissions."
"Dirty production must not be possible anywhere."
"We cannot create loopholes, though emissions trading in the EU is a model example of how to do that!"
"(ET) Mr President, the ambitious climate measures would help to solve the current economic crisis through the creation of new jobs and an increase in economic activity."
"The International Energy Agency regards it as necessary to come to an agreement in Copenhagen in order to direct the investments which were delayed due to the crisis into investments in the environmentally sustainable energy sector."
"I can see opportunities for my home country of Estonia here as well."
"We need an extensive energy savings programme, and also an ambitious and long-term approach in the area of renewable energy."
"However, we cannot limit ourselves to this."
"We should review our own transport and logistical regulation, make use of environmentally-friendly building materials and technologies, reduce the use of materials and chemicals in industry, reform the packaging methods used in retail, and develop organic farming."
"These and many other solutions will be the essential growth sectors of the future."
"Many of these new solutions require the efforts of our scientists; some can only be created by our own efforts."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have noticed that the vote which took place yesterday in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has been mentioned several times."
"I would, however, like to make it clear that not everything can be put down to one single extremist ideological position."
"We have heard many positions of our fellow Members which are very diverse, much more nuanced, based much more on common sense and therefore, given that they reflect reality more closely, I think that they are more likely to provide real solutions."
"Science is not a totem."
"When the mistake was made to pick out one issue in such an ideological way, solutions were not provided but it led to disaster."
"Europe should be an expert at this, at not repeating the same mistakes, albeit when they take different forms and have labels which appear, on the surface, much friendlier."
"I must point out that the emissions trading directive itself stipulates precisely that the virtuous path followed by the European Union must be assessed by the Commission, according to the outcome of the conference."
"We must go to the conference with strong positions and clear ideas certainly, but also with the absolute aim of sharing our efforts fairly among, first and foremost, all the industrialised countries, which must accept equivalent emissions reduction targets."
"We must also keep in mind what Mrs Grossetête expressed very well, namely that we can no longer fail to differentiate between developing countries: some countries truly are developing and some are newly emerged economies, such as India, China and Brazil."
"These, too, are countries which must shoulder commitments of their own."
"Well, if a balanced outcome is not achieved in Copenhagen, I, on the other hand, strongly urge the European Union to continue to ensure that allowances are allocated free of charge to sectors at risk, in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC."
"These are key points."
"We want the Kyoto Protocol itself to retain its importance for the environment and, above all, we want to avoid creating a financial bubble at the expense of European businesses."
"(FR) Madam President, as our fellow Members have said repeatedly this morning, the problem of financing the developing countries' fight against global warming may cause the Copenhagen Summit to fail, when we were all hoping it would be a success."
"As we know, however, these countries are often the main victims of global warming, but they are not responsible for it."
"The industrialised countries have provided a substantial financial aid package."
"It is insufficient today, and even the declared amounts are not actually being honoured."
"This is what obliges us and will oblige us to find new sources of finance."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, following the lead of the Committee on Development, has acknowledged that there is now a need to consider the introduction of a tax on financial transactions of the Tobin tax kind."
"This 0.01% tax on speculative transactions would bring in USD 100 billion per year; in other words, the amount that it is estimated will be required by 2020 to combat global warming in developing countries."
"Therefore, Parliament, in following the lead of certain national political leaders, is assuming its responsibilities."
"I should like to know the position of the Council and the Commission and whether they will support us on this point."
"(SV) Madam President, the world is currently facing three major crises: the financial crisis, the employment crisis and the climate crisis."
"The solutions that we come up with together must help to solve all three of these crises."
"Our businesses face major challenges, but there are also great opportunities for new jobs and for dealing with a number of social crises."
"Applied in the right way, with the right decisions and with sufficiently tough decisions from those leading these negotiations, we could see a renewal and a new environmentally sustainable economy in the world."
"People all over the world expect the Copenhagen conference to come up with vigorous measures."
"We must be aware that the US will want market-based solutions, Europe will want solutions based on legislation and China will want to solve its own domestic social problems."
"There are also differences in approach within Europe."
"In the European Parliament, there are Members who want the thresholds set so high that it will be impossible to achieve a solution in Copenhagen, while others want to insist on only voluntary solutions."
"The future lies in a green, liberal market economy."
"We must ensure that consumers are given the opportunity to use their power in the market through knowledge and transparency."
"(RO) Deforestation, a phenomenon often alluded to during this debate, is certainly something which affects developing countries in particular."
"However, before laying the blame on these countries, we need to realise that deforestation meets certain needs for survival."
"I would like to mention in today's debate the conclusions from a study carried out recently which highlight that almost half of the agricultural area in the world has at least 10% forest cover."
"This agricultural area covered by forest vegetation amounts to double the area of the Amazon Rainforest."
"I believe that this prompts us to realise the value of this vegetation."
"It goes without saying that farmers would make greater efforts to protect this vegetation if they were given sufficient finances to do so."
"Another aspect which could also be taken into consideration would be to encourage stratified agri-forestry systems which combine the growing of crops with trees."
"Crops of this type, which are less viable than monocultures, are often abandoned."
"I believe that any solution aimed at avoiding deforestation must also take into account systems for compensating farmers, including those farmers in Europe who grow these types of stratified crops."
"Madam President, 'success or failure, that is the question'."
"All types of crises have already been mentioned, but one has been forgotten next to global warming, which is the crisis of public confidence in politics."
"I agree with Mr Carlgren."
"Let us not make this a beauty contest about who is more or less ambitious, more realistic or less realistic or more or less willing to pay."
"We need four clarities, because too much is at stake: we need a clear and ambitious political stance; we need a clear commitment; we need a clear path and clear deadlines; and last but not least, we need clarity on financial support."
"If Copenhagen is not a complete success, let us not cry wolf and start naming and shaming, but let us set out a clear process and time path in order to come to a result."
"Let us show we are reliable and responsible, both in target setting and in a fair financial perspective."
"Madam President, we talk a lot about the melting of the ice caps, but as well as the Arctic and the Antarctic, there is also the 'third pole': the Himalayan ice cap and its glaciers which give water to some two billion people - almost a third of the world's population - in China, India and elsewhere on the subcontinent."
"These glaciers are retreating fast because of black carbon coming largely from industrialisation, but also from fossil fuel-powered generators in use in agriculture, and will deprive billions of people of water for both drinking and irrigation."
"The European Union needs to recognise that help is going to be needed to improve the quality of the machinery that is being used, and to cut down its polluting impact."
"I believe this should be put on the agenda for Copenhagen, but it should also be put on the agenda for the forthcoming European Union summit with India and other summits with the countries affected."
"Unless we help them, we will not be able to prevent the melting of the Himalayan glaciers or serious water provision problems for a third of humankind."
"(RO) We live on a planet with a diverse climate."
"However, there is a single factor that affects all this: climate change."
"Reality shows us that the effects of this change do not respect borders or geographical areas."
"Each and every one of us is affected in different ways, whether in the form of flooding, drought, fire or powerful storms."
"The main cause of these disasters is obviously the rampant development of certain groups of activities resulting in a rise in carbon dioxide emissions and global warming."
"According to current statistics, the ratio of carbon dioxide emissions per capita may be hundreds of times higher for developed countries compared to developing countries."
"Given the current situation, I feel duty bound to ask the following rhetorical question: is it our duty or not to support developing countries with initiatives and technologies in order to keep our planet clean?"
"I think the answer to this is obvious."
"We cannot therefore procrastinate in any way in adopting specific measures for our own sake and the sake of future generations."
"(FI) Madam President, it is very important to make the switch to a low-carbon world fairly and to have a viable policy system, because the market never has any time for fairness."
"That is why the Copenhagen meeting is important."
"I would have liked Minister Carlgren to have prioritised things more."
"You made everything a priority and so, in fact, nothing took priority."
"I believe that climate policy must also have a prominent part to play in income distribution effects."
"How can we also make it easier for households on a low income in Europe to adapt?"
"Has no country in Europe given consideration to this yet?"
"For example, more flexible use of the Structural Funds could be made to promote green structural change."
"It is not enough to save the world: we also have to save the people in it."
"(HU) Madam President, one of the key topics at the forthcoming Copenhagen climate summit may be forest management."
"It is no coincidence, in fact, that more harmful gases accumulate in the air as a result of deforestation than can be attributed to transport, for instance."
"The inability to resolve this situation is highlighted by the fact that according to estimates, almost 40% of the logging in the world is carried out illegally."
"When we talk about logging, we first of all think about tropical forests, but we do not have to look so far from home."
"According to a study recently published, one third of the timber used in Hungary is felled illegally."
"Due to the lack of sanctions in this area, the ground apparently gained by renewable energy sources actually conceals the partially illegal burning and felling of trees."
"Based on what I have described, we must tighten the regulations governing sustainable forest management."
"The Copenhagen climate summit may provide the opportunity for forest management to become an integral part of climate protection systems."
"Madam President, the issue of food security needs to be mentioned in this debate on climate change, for the developing world in particular."
"It is very difficult to ask people to look at climate change mitigation if their basic needs for food are not met."
"We need to allow them to use the best available technology to produce, in a sustainable way, food which does not harm the environment, and to tackle the issue of climate change."
"I have a concern in relation to the World Trade Organisation and a deal on agriculture which does not take into account the impact, for example, of deforestation in Brazil as it supplies beef to the European Union."
"These are very complex issues."
"We might solve a problem in one place and create another elsewhere."
"We obviously need a global agreement which tackles climate change but we also need to recognise the very serious issue of food security."
"Madam President, the evidence is not that rising levels of CO2 lead to temperature rises, but that the causal connection is the other way round; but, of course, we must not let facts get in the way of a good story."
"However, let us accept for the moment that man-made emissions are a bad thing for various reasons. Why, then, does the British Labour Party support aggressive and illegal wars that not only kill British soldiers, Iraqis, Afghans and, in the future, Iranians, but also produce vast increases in global emissions?"
"(PT) Copenhagen is a great opportunity for a global agreement to be reached before it is too late."
"For the first time, the United States has an administration committed to building solutions, and there are also positive signals from other countries, such as Japan."
"However, we need a new approach to climate change that takes its impact on security, economic recovery, immigration and even combating terrorism into account."
"Nor must we forget that climate change will require the contribution of science, technology and economics."
"The major obstacle to an agreement in Copenhagen is the question of funding."
"There cannot be an agreement unless there is funding tailored to developing countries."
"Moreover, Commissioner, it must be stressed that the funding currently in place is not sufficient."
"Developed countries must lead by example, by setting ambitious emission reduction targets of at least 30%, and helping developing countries by providing funding and technology."
"(SL) Good afternoon, Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Carlgren, ladies and gentlemen and visitors, including those of you who have come from Slovenia."
"Allow me to briefly remind you of one thing: Copenhagen is happening at what may be a bad time."
"We are living in a time of crisis, which makes it difficult to make the kind of decisions on weighty and important issues which we will have to make in December in Copenhagen."
"Nonetheless, let me stress that Copenhagen will only be a success story if it upholds both the environmental and the social dimension, that is, if we succeed in reducing, or agreeing to reduce, emissions."
"On this score, the Council and the Commission are yet to reach an agreement on the targets to be attained by 2020."
"In addition, Copenhagen will only be a success story if it ensures sustainable development, if it also includes a social dimension and, in particular, if we, the developed part of the world, succeed in financing developing countries."
"If that does not happen, I think that this generation will have missed an exceptional historic opportunity."
"(PL) Madam President, in the context of our debate, I should like to draw attention to two issues."
"Firstly, when submitting a proposal regarding the limitation of CO2 emissions and the means allocated for developing countries, we must not forget the present economic and financial situation brought about by the world crisis, because setting ambitious goals is very important, but I think that achieving them is even more so."
"Secondly, we should pay attention to the question of the awareness of citizens and the necessity of change in the area of ecological issues."
"Research carried out at the time of the Climate Conference in Poznań last year showed that society does regard climate change as a serious problem, but thinks that solving this problem is a matter exclusively for the authorities."
"An appeal is therefore needed, an information campaign which will change attitudes and promote models of behaviour aimed at increasing the effectiveness or reducing the consumption of energy in homes."
"We need a campaign to make people aware that the way we live, and the way we work, has an economic and an ecological price attached."
"(RO) Development and cooperation mechanisms and the allocation of considerable resources to developing countries for tackling climate change are important measures in terms of concluding an international post-Kyoto agreement."
"However, the best argument for persuading other states to comply with a post-Kyoto agreement is provided by the measures which the European Union is adopting in order to fulfil the commitments that it has already undertaken."
"In the case of non-ETS sectors, the measures considered may include the following: renovating buildings with poor energy efficiency, creating an energy efficiency fund in each Member State; and increasing considerably the ERDF rate which can be used to boost energy efficiency in buildings and develop public transport."
"These measures will allow us to create around 7 million jobs across Europe by 2020."
"In the case of ETS sectors, financing mechanisms are required for the low-carbon economy."
"Modernising the technology used by European companies operating in the energy production or metallurgy sectors will enable them to use an environmentally-friendly method of production."
"Madam President, deforestation has been mentioned by many speakers and absolutely correctly so - both industrialised deforestation and individual deforestation."
"I myself noticed that, when I worked on a voluntary basis in Africa, day in day out, I saw people climbing up the mountain, spending the whole day with their little axe cutting down timber, and coming down in the afternoon carrying their little bundle of timber on their head or on their bicycle."
"It is quite obvious that this cannot be tackled without dealing with the whole question of global poverty, because individuals are not going to stop chopping down wood for the greater good of society if it means they themselves are going to starve."
"So climate change and global poverty will have to be tackled hand in hand."
"Madam President, there has been much talk in this Chamber this morning about developing countries playing their part in tackling climate change, and that is indeed true."
"Like many others, I would draw attention to the fact that, in order for this to happen in regions of great poverty, this House, the Council and the Commission will have to take cognisance of the cost involved and there will have to be a strategy in order to tackle this."
"However, I would not like to leave this House without saying that, in areas like my own in Northern Ireland, areas of high energy costs, there also needs to be some work done to take account of those who are disadvantaged - where there are high levels of fuel poverty amongst disadvantaged people, where we have an economic base which relies on small business - when considering the costs of tackling climate change."
"(SL) I would like to express my agreement with the fundamental objectives of our strategy, i.e. preventing the climate from increasing more than two degrees in temperature, on average."
"This is a strategy which is primarily based on limitation: the smaller the emissions of greenhouse gases, the smaller the increase in temperature."
"However, I would like to point out another dimension and here, I refer to the technological breakthroughs that are necessary."
"I, for one, am a believer in technology."
"Limitation alone will not help us attain our targets."
"We need greater investment in technological advancement and, above all, investment in the artificial reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and in the development of a fusion reactor."
"Therefore, I would urge the Commission to make as effective and rapid moves as possible to put such investment on its agenda."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for their commitment to this debate and their far-sighted contributions."
"Naturally, the broad political support of the European Parliament plays a very important part in deciding Europe's position in the negotiations."
"I also genuinely welcome the resolution on climate change prepared by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Parliament's commitment is very important for the 48 days remaining before the conference in Copenhagen."
"We really must use these days in the best way possible."
"That means that we must go out into the rest of the world and put pressure on other countries."
"A global threat calls for a global response."
"There has been mention in the debate of global partnership - I agree with that."
"There has been mention of the need to globally achieve low-carbon development - I agree with that."
"There has been mention of the need for new green technology - and I also agree with that."
"I would also like to say that we need a global solidarity pact."
"I am now off to the Luxembourg Council meeting on the environment, at which we will also set out the EU's mandate for the Copenhagen conference."
"We are talking here about the long-term objectives of the EU, which must be to reduce emissions by more than 80% by the year 2050."
"We are talking about how to encourage other countries to increase their emissions reductions, so that we also achieve our 30% reduction in emissions."
"Not least, it concerns what has been raised in the debate here - namely, measures to combat deforestation and towards sustainable forestry, financing that Ecofin is to decide on."
"Finally, it is about having a mandate that has been adopted by the European Council."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its support."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, very briefly a couple of points."
"I think that after this debate, after what the Council has said, we can say that we are ready for this Copenhagen conference."
"I have noticed very broad support for our proposals, and that goes for the targets that we have put on the table, the financial commitments we have been making."
"Very important also is the common understanding we have with the developing world - the commitments we have been making towards them and, maybe foremost, it is very important that we have also agreed on an internal redistribution of the efforts that have to be made by the European Union, because if you make commitments and promises but do not reach agreement among yourselves you will not be very effective in these kinds of things."
"We can move forward, provided that the European Council later this month gives support to these proposals. I have no doubt about that."
"We also expect the others to come forward."
"Then we will speak about the United States; we will also speak about the BRIC countries."
"They have to come forward."
"I think we need a frank and open discussion in Copenhagen."
"It will certainly not be easy, that is the least one can say, but I think we really will be discussing our common future there."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"We must not regard the costs involved in the transition to clean energy sources as an economic burden that will increase companies' production costs and public expenditure as part of national budgets, but as an investment that will bring tangible benefits in terms of creating new jobs, technical innovation and a clean infrastructure which will support the sustainable development of our respective countries."
"Climate change poses a threat to the environmental balance and our habitat."
"Europe must show courage and adopt a consistent stance in leading the effort to combat global warming."
"Based on considerations of fairness and historical responsibility, poor countries must be helped not only to consolidate and adapt their economies to the new challenges, but also to protect themselves from the effects of global warming to which they are the most susceptible."
"I hope that those attending the conference in December will realise that there is no alternative to cutting polluting emissions and that postponing any decision in Copenhagen on the mandatory objectives will mean failure not only for the conference, but also for the multilateral dialogue on global topics that affect the future of every one of us."
"in writing. - Negotiations for a new global climate agreement are now on a knife edge."
"The US seems unable to pass legislation to curb its excessive CO2 emissions."
"China seems unwilling to accept binding targets."
"Developing countries claim correctly they did not cause this crisis."
"Europeans have an historic responsibility to clean up the climate mess we helped create."
"It is actually our reckless abandon of the environment that has led to this dangerous changing of our climate."
"This is not only an environmental issue and it is not just an economic issue, but also an issue of international social justice."
"I join my colleagues in supporting calls for Europe to make a real offer of financing to the developing world to help it fight climate change in order to break the deadlock in the current negotiations."
"This financing must be new and additional (the existing promises of 0.7% should not be touched) and it must be adequate enough to allow developing countries to fight climate change, with the necessary mitigation and adaptation measures."
"Some say we cannot afford such new financing."
"However, when the banks came begging, most governments, including the Irish Government, were only too quick to provide them with billions in taxpayers' money."
"Our economies will recover, but our environment will not..."
"Climate change poses one of the most serious threats not only to the environment, but to the economy and society as well."
"Crop yields fluctuate from one year to the next, heavily influenced by the variation in extreme climate conditions."
"This has an impact on every sector of the economy, but agriculture remains the most vulnerable."
"I believe that this problem must be dealt with in two ways:"
"an action plan is needed for the most affected areas, which includes: using certain plant varieties which are resistant to the new climate conditions, adapting the calendar of farming activities to the new conditions, forestation, building greenhouses, managing water resources from agriculture and making polluted land more environmentally friendly;"
"the other measure must be a plan for the future aimed at eliminating the causes of climate change by promoting a global economy based on reduced carbon emissions, combined with the promotion of energy security."
"I also think it is important to devise strategies for preventing and managing natural disasters as droughts and flooding have occurred frequently over the last 10 years, exerting an adverse impact on both agricultural production and flora and fauna."
"I strongly support the European Union in having to maintain its leading position in the battle against climate change."
"It must not slip to number two as a result of the current economic difficulties."
"For five years, I have been witness to how, here, in the European Parliament, a specific group of people, recruited from all political groups, but mainly from the Greens and the Socialists, have been whipping up unprecedented hysteria about the climate."
"This hysteria is cleverly maintained through the speeches by the President of the Commission, and also by the former President of Parliament, presenting us with the unimaginable cataclysms which they claim will result from climate change."
"People who think rationally on this matter are accused of lacking moral principles, and simply - as was the case with me today - they are not given the opportunity to speak in a 'democratic' way."
"The economic decisions contained in the Climate and Energy Package, which were made on the grounds of a not-very-credible hypothesis of the cause of climate change, are not only a cynical gibe at common sense, but are also a portent of future economic catastrophe and the upheaval of civilisation."
"We should demand to hear honest discussion, based on the opinions of the entire objective world of science, on the subject of current climate change and its causes and, above all, on methods of tackling its effects."
"In order to ensure success in the battle against climate change, an ambitious, comprehensive global agreement must be reached in Copenhagen."
"The issue of funding has become the keystone of the agreement in Copenhagen."
"Every country must make its contribution to funding the battle against climate change, according to its resources and economic potential."
"The European Union plays an important role in, and assumes a commitment to, funding the climate programme."
"According to estimates for providing support to developing countries and based on calculations for the 2010-2012 period, the EUR 5-7 billion required in funding every year will place a significant burden on both EU and national budgets."
