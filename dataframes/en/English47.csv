"The directive, however, is beginning to creak, and revision cannot be put off indefinitely."
"Indeed, a thorough review is becoming urgent."
"I appreciate the Commission's careful approach and congratulate the Commissioner on her careful and extensive consultation."
"However, we need to take care: too long a delay in revising the directive will impede progress in the industry."
"We should not move away from the fundamental principles of the present directive which relies largely on self-regulation and is not too prescriptive."
"We should no more seek to control what people watch than we would seek to control what books they might wish to buy in a bookshop."
"Therefore, I am clear that overzealous use of quotas and too detailed definitions would be wrong."
"Above all, we should only seek to regulate and influence at a European level that which is of transeuropean concern."
"However, there are European issues we need to address."
"For instance, events of major importance need to remain free to air, and there is a case for a short European list of such events."
"There was a real risk that last year's World Cup would not be freely available in all our countries."
"I am as keen as any colleague to encourage European content in television, although primarily that could be helped by the 'MEDIA Plus' Programme."
"I also urge the Commission to look at ways to ensure that channels like Euronews and Arte flourish and develop."
"They help create a European television identity and help our citizens to appreciate and understand the European dimension in their lives."
"Euronews in particular is a very effective means of allowing European and world citizens to get a European perspective on current affairs, rather than an exclusively national or American view."
"I would also urge the Commission to find means to protect the diversity of ownership of television and to guard against undue concentration of ownership."
"Plurality of media ownership is important for democracy."
"In this report I touch on two particular issues which may be seen as minor but are important."
"First, the needs of viewers with sensory impairments: these fellow citizens wish, and have the right, to enjoy television."
"I hope the Commission will conduct the study called for as soon as possible to enable us to get best practice for subtitling, sign language and audio description in television broadcasts."
"Finally, I want to raise the issue of those European citizens - often retirees but not only - who move to a place in the sun."
"Spain, Greece, Portugal, Italy and France are indeed wonderful and hospitable countries, but for those people from the north of Europe it is nice to watch television programmes from their own country and even to watch their own country play in a football match."
"Many people do this by skirting around the law by watching via satellite broadcasters from their own country."
"They often ignore the terms of their contracts or even use pirate technology."
"Perhaps that is not a big problem, but, as sensible legislators, we ought to be able to frame sensible laws that allow citizens to lead their lives within the law and not in a grey market."
"Therefore, I thank the Commissioner for her commitment to Europe's television."
"I urge her to heed this report and to come forward as soon as possible with practical proposals to revise the directive."
"Mr President, the Commission congratulates Mr Perry on his work, evident not only in this report but also in the efforts made over the past months to contribute to a reform of the directive that is in the interests of our citizens."
"On 6 January, the Commission adopted the fourth report on the application of the Directive and a work programme for its revision incorporating a public consultation."
"What did we note in this report on the application of the Directive?"
"Firstly, we noted that the Directive is operating relatively well."
"Nevertheless, recent technological developments call for more detailed reflection."
"The aim of the public consultation was to enable the Commission to assess the need to update or adjust the Directive and the report and today's debate will help us in this respect."
"As part of its work programme, the Commission organised two series of public hearings, in April and June, and interested parties were invited to participate in public debates by responding to specific questions and forwarding their responses to us."
"We received 160 written contributions, which are all available on the Commission's website with the exception of a few whose authors asked for them to be kept confidential."
"Based on the analysis of the results of this consultation, the Commission plans to submit to Parliament and the Council at the end of 2003 or beginning of 2004 a communication on the future of audiovisual policy, which will be accompanied by proposals if appropriate."
"One of the challenges of the revision is to take account of technological innovations."
"I am thinking in this respect of the Council's 1998 Recommendation on the Protection of Minors and Human Dignity and Audiovisual and Information Services, which is the first legal instrument to cover the content of audiovisual services on the Internet."
"After the break, the Commission intends to publish a second report on the implementation of the Recommendation based on a questionnaire that was sent to the Member States."
"The aim of this report is to ascertain the progress made, to make it possible to make a direct comparison and to include the new Member States."
"Mr Perry raises several questions in his report, to which I would like to respond, without prejudice, of course, to the consultations under way."
"The first relates to the scope of the Directive, referred to in paragraphs 7 to 12."
"Mr Perry calls for the definition of audiovisual content to be extended to take account of media convergence."
"However, as long as television broadcasting services continue to enjoy unequal importance and impact in our societies, it would be difficult to reach consensus on the concept of content without frontiers."
"This was also borne out by the consultation."
"In addition, while information society services are at an early stage in their development I feel that it would be inappropriate at the current stage of negotiations to subject them to the more detailed approach of the Directive."
"The very first thing that must be done therefore is to ascertain whether the Directive provides the appropriate regulatory framework for the coming years or whether it needs to be adjusted, and this will be verified in the communication."
"As regards the working group of national regulators, mentioned in paragraph 19, the Commission held a meeting with the regulators in March and the next meeting is due to be held on 14 October."
"Some Member States do not, however, see the need for an additional committee and have already expressed concern that this committee may duplicate work already being done."
"I am not in favour of the systematic participation of public and private broadcasters; I prefer a system of ad hoc invitations like the one we are using at the moment."
"With regard to self-regulation and co-regulation - paragraph 20 of the report - I agree with the rapporteur that greater emphasis should be placed on co-regulation."
"As a result, in the working documents we have specifically raised this question and I think that we will be able to make some progress in this area."
"I would now like to move on to paragraph 28 concerning channels that have a pan-European dimension."
"I do not think that it is up to the Commission to take the initiative in this field."
"Indeed, given the disappointing results of a study on the possibilities of using digital platforms for thematic channels, it would be difficult for the Commission to finance any new studies on this subject."
"Having said that, we are going to contribute indirectly to the creation of pan-European channels by establishing a favourable regulatory framework and by supporting the creation and broadcast of European audiovisual works."
"In relation to the question of television for disabled people - paragraph 34 - we must not forget that the Directive deals essentially with the aspects linked to content and the issue of disabled persons is therefore not formally covered in the report on the application of the Directive as it does not fall within its scope."
"It is up to the Member States to apply the principle of subsidiarity in this area."
"Nevertheless, access to television services for disabled people is very important."
"My services have received many contributions regarding these pertinent issues and all of these can be found on the Commission's website."
"The website also contains the contributions from associations representing disabled people."
"In order to make some progress in this area, we plan to organise a round table on 21 October in association with the Royal National Institute for Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Blind in the United Kingdom and to invite the Member States to attend and to report on the situation at national level."
"We are therefore going to continue in this way, and I must also point out that the Information Society DG has set up a working group that has been christened 'Inclusive Communications'."
"This aspect is thus being taken into account."
"Finally, as regards media concentration, discussed in paragraphs 36 to 42, I support the idea in the Perry report that pluralism is an important element in safeguarding democracy."
"This idea is fully reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I would also like to stress that one of the topics covered by the May 2003 Green Paper on Services of General Interest relates precisely to the protection of pluralism."
"All interested parties are invited to submit their comments by 15 September."
"The Commission will determine its future policy on the basis of the conclusions of this consultation process."
"Finally, I will not be able to comment on all of the changes to the Directive today because we have not yet received all of the written contributions."
"We receive new contributions every day and I would like to allow my colleagues to complete their analysis before informing you of them by way of the communication on audiovisual policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has done me the honour of asking me to present its opinion."
"We cooperated with the rapporteur, Mr Perry, and I am in the happy position of saying that we have taken a common approach."
"The Commission needs to pay particular attention to Mr Perry's individual proposals if we are to take another step forward on the interconnected problems linked to the whole of the audiovisual sector."
"This year's report has a factor of additional interest compared with previous reports, because it proposes in its annex a programme of work which makes provision for dialogue to develop with the individual national agencies, such as radio and television organisations, independent regulatory authorities etc."
"The objective is to reform the directive so that it can monitor rapid technological progress, but it also has other individual objectives."
"All these objectives mean that a difficult job awaits the Commission and it must convince us of how it is going to work in order for all the necessary adjustments to come about."
"Another conclusion on which we more or less agree is the dual role of the audiovisual media."
"They are an economic commodity, which is why they are linked to the issue of competition, to the knowledge society being promoted by the Lisbon policy."
"Full coordination is therefore needed here."
"At the same time, they are a cultural commodity and their promotion needs to take account, on the one hand, of the public interest, such as protecting minors and safeguarding cultural diversity; on the other hand, however, they must take horizontal account of the European interest, which is to safeguard the European identity against non-European standards, especially American standards."
"We need to realise here that the danger from the commercial deficit on the audiovisual media market in comparison with the corresponding American products is directly linked to the future of Europe."
"The dialogue has started."
"It may be public."
"I would say, however, that it needs greater publicity and greater visibility."
"In view of all this, the reform of the Television without Frontiers directive must be one of the most serious concerns of all three institutions of the European Union because, over and above clarifying disputed concepts, such as independent producers etc., we need to guarantee the availability of digital options to a wide public and promote the cohesion of the policy of the audiovisual industry."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Perry on the quality of the work he has carried out on what is a vital and extremely sensitive subject."
"It is true that he usually deals with difficult issues."
"We are all aware of the substantial cultural and economic challenges the Television without Frontiers Directive presents for each of the Member States of the Union and the candidate countries."
"That is why we support the Commission, which had the quite right and sensible idea of seeking the opinion of each Member State before taking any decisions on the revision."
"Specific improvements to the Directive are no doubt necessary to take account of technological developments, but we must ensure that these adjustments are not premature."
"In fact, if we look objectively at the situation of the audiovisual market, we can see that the national markets are adapting bit by bit to the new technologies."
"Thus, the recent technological developments have not really disrupted the audiovisual landscape, which continues to be dominated to a large extent by traditional television. Future changes to the Directive must under no circumstances disrupt its content."
"A revision calling into question the cultural objectives on which the Member States had reached agreement, under the pretext of extending the scope of the Directive to include all broadcasting formats, would in reality change completely the initial aims of the Directive, that is, the defence and promotion of cultural diversity."
"The main provisions of this Directive must not be called into question."
"The key principles must continue to form the foundation of the Community's audiovisual policy: the promotion, movement and broadcast of European works within Europe; the production and broadcast of works by independent producers; the existence of broadcast quotas for television services; the guarantee of protection of minors; and measures to combat excessive advertising."
"The Television without Frontiers Directive has proved its worth as a legal instrument and is now being applied satisfactorily."
"Its revision can only be justified if it makes genuine improvements to certain elements such as the worrying issue of media concentration, which obviously undermines pluralism."
"The Directive must continue to be a useful tool in promoting cultural diversity and must not become a legal instrument providing solely for the promotion of commercial channels where we would see, for example, continuous advertising with disregard for the works broadcast."
"Over and above the economic and financial issues, which are clearly vital, is the simple question of our cultures, our identities and the values in which we believe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Perry has earned our gratitude by presenting a report demonstrating a very forward-looking perspective, and in which he has not left out the areas of conflict that undeniably exist in a dual system in which public and commercial service providers square up to each other and fight over a market comprising 155 million households in the present European Union of fifteen Member States, a figure that will further increase."
"There is no doubt that the directive will have to be revised if its objectives for the future are to be achieved."
"My Group takes the view that the Commission is too hesitant in this respect."
"What is in fact at stake is the safeguarding of cultural diversity, a wide range of opinions and pluralism."
"Whilst democratic opinion today is, in essence, shaped by television, this is no longer only the traditional television with analogue transmission."
"More and more, we have digitalisation to cope with."
"I was recently at the International Broadcasting Exhibition in Berlin, where I could see very well how consumer habits in this area are changing, and that nowadays the technical means of transmission can no longer be decisive when it comes to deciding which is the right way to draft laws for a media service."
"It must also be clear, however, that we need to establish a system of graduated regulation, and this is where there will be new demands placed on future legislation."
"Not every media service is of major importance in publicity terms, so the determinative criterion for the future must be the extent to which a media service is useful for publicity purposes and in what sense it is not."
"If I might put it rather loosely, it is on that basis that legislation can be drafted with varying degrees of rigour."
"Much will also be demanded of the rules that will have to be laid down, not only, to be sure, under the television directive, but also in parallel with it, in order to counteract the accumulation of economic power, which becomes media power and, eventually, also political power."
"We are dealing here with a development that makes it plain that bounds must be set at European level to contain media concentration, which does indeed endanger pluralism."
"As we can see from the example of Italy, national legal resources are not, in any case, sufficient."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I make my comments, I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Perry, for his sterling report."
"It is an important directive, and thanks to the Commission's regular reports, we are gaining a clear insight into its functioning, which enables us to prepare well-considered proposals for a possible revision in future."
"I do have some remarks."
"First of all, given the current increase in media convergence, both in the present Member States and in the acceding countries, we must continue to hammer away at pluriformity, both in the public broadcasting corporations and in the private stations."
"This is crucial to my group, and I assume my fellow Liberal will also stress this in a moment."
"Secondly, sound criteria are needed to protect minors from aggressive TV commercials."
"In fact, with regard to television programmes too, it is important for children to be able to make informed choices and for their parents to be able to help them in this."
"My group is a great believer in self-regulation, which gives me an opportunity to stand up for the Dutch system, 'Kijkwijze', which enables parents and children to make informed choices by means of pictograms."
"Finally, I should like to say how pleased I am by the wide support given to my proposal for a pan-European children's network."
"It is a good way of distributing European productions for children on a larger scale, since it combines broadcasting licence-holders from the Member States and candidate countries."
"Excellent children's films have been made in Europe."
"If we now see that in my country, the national production of quality films has enjoyed an enormous boost, which is what I read the morning of the day we returned from the film festival in Venice, that the proportion of Dutch films among those seen by cinema audiences has increased by some 6%, and especially audiences composed of young people, due to an innovative approach whose key aim is to show producers that they are making films for a certain audience - an audience-specific approach, in other words - then I can only be optimistic about the preservation of our cultural diversity in the media, and there is certainly a place for television without frontiers, and, needless to say, for Europe."
"Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"This issue is a difficult one and is undergoing constant change."
"I must thank Mr Perry for his work, and yet I am unsure whether or not this Directive needs to be revised."
"This has been stated clearly both by those working in the industry and by the Commission."
"This current issue comes up against the problem of definition and apprehension raised by the transfer of images, the development and acceleration of which we have not yet managed to control."
"What worries me is the absence of a definition of a 'work'."
"The Television without Frontiers Directive provides a negative definition."
"We know what it is not."
"It is not information, it is not advertising, it is not this, it is not that."
"It is produced by X or made by Y. I, myself, would prefer - and I believe that some of those working in the industry would also prefer - to know what it is."
"That would perhaps make it easier to settle the ongoing debate in France and other European countries on reality television."
"The problem is defining the scope of audiovisual works."
"Some works are very easy to define, such as documentaries and films, but not all are."
"I do not know how to define reality television and this is a serious concern."
"The second point raised by this debate is the movement of works."
"The movement of works and artists is a recurring problem in the field of culture, as I highlighted in the report on the performing arts."
"In the context of Television without Frontiers, it is magnified as a result of concentration and the non-national nature of the sector."
"How can we promote non-national works in each of our countries?"
"We will have to give our opinion on this fundamental problem."
"Mr Perry, you paid a great deal of attention in your report to the question of media concentration, which can prevent the movement of non-national works."
"I am very pleased that you stress this point as, in my view, it is vitally important and something we must look at very seriously indeed."
"Mr President, the fundamental problem in this audiovisual debate is that we do not dare to define the quality we want to protect."
"When we talk about European works, for example, we include completely ridiculous talk shows, under the pretext that they are European productions."
"Until we have the courage to define what a work is - and that is where Mrs Fraisse is right - in other words, what it is that we want to protect, our television services will be unable to protect European production and European works in Europe for want of the appropriate instruments."
"Secondly, as regards concentration, the problem is very simple."
"If we do not define what we cannot democratically accept in Europe, there will be more and more concentration and non-European forces will dominate the market."
"For both these reasons, I believe that the European Union must have the courage to define what a work is and to define what should be the limit, democratically, between political power and the power of the media."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I and Mr Volcic have tabled some amendments to the excellent, and I repeat, excellent, report by Mr Perry, regarding an issue which you have all touched upon, media concentration and, therefore, pluralism."
"I listened with great interest to what Commissioner Reding had to say in defence of pluralism as an essential value."
"We cannot, however, close our eyes to the fact that, throughout the western world today, market forces, if left to themselves, almost always lead to serious, dangerous phenomena of concentration and that only a political measure can lay down the rules for a liberal society, the essential basis of which is pluralism."
"We are, therefore, facing a major political battle on this issue, taking place in the US, where there is a deadlock between Congress and the authority, and in Europe with the grave problems in England that have thrust themselves upon our attention and the problems in Italy that many of you are aware of."
"I do not want you to think, however, that the amendments tabled by Mr Volcic, and myself urging Parliament and the Commission to adopt a measure, a directive, in line with what was, moreover, approved by Parliament in November, were dictated solely by Italian issues."
"There is truly a much greater, much wider issue here that affects the whole of Europe: it is an issue of civilisation."
"If we want to be a Community based on liberal principals, then this is one of the first issues we need to regulate, in a spirit of freedom and respect for all opinions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly grateful to Mr Perry for his report because, in emphatically demanding the revision of the television directive, he has done so with the objective of maintaining and promoting cultural diversity in Europe in an era of technological convergence."
"The fact is that content is no longer dependent only on the medium of television, but, in the same way, on many other technological media, and if we want to maintain diversity, we have to find ways whereby we can achieve common rules in this area, which do justice to the various demands, albeit in a slightly different procedure."
"There are two issues I would like to address, and the first is media pluralism."
"This Parliament has very emphatically spoken out, most recently on 10 November 2002, in favour of greater support for, and underpinning of, media diversity in Europe and against unhindered media concentration."
"I would press upon the Commission the urgent need to do what this vote by Parliament demands of it and put before us the pieces of work that we have asked for."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot, however, endorse Amendment No 10, which was tabled today, as it refers exclusively to one instrument, the directive, and because we will achieve a result in this area only if we balance, in an appropriate and proper way, the competences of the Member States and those of the European Union."
"Considerations of media pluralism therefore demand the solution that we called for in our resolution in November."
"The second point I want to address is the protection of young people."
"New technologies require that children and young people be protected in the same way as is provided for in the television directive."
"Let us therefore work together towards a new system and new ways of self-regulation with minimum standards accepted by all."
"I wish the Commission much success as it travels down this road."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have now heard many answers concerning how the television directive is applied, but also questions, and I think we must and should make some changes."
"We must unreservedly guarantee basic principles such as the requirement that the cultural diversity of the media be protected in order to maintain freedom of expression, diversity of opinion and pluralism, creativity and the right to free access to information."
"Public broadcasters must perform their educational function, by which I mean that the quota for the transmission of European programmes and works by independent producers could be increased."
"This is an aspiration with which I wish to associate myself."
"There must, however, be clear, workable and manageable definitions of what is meant by European works and independent producers."
"I see the requirement that levels of media concentration be monitored as being the most important."
"We have examples of media power and political power being concentrated in one pair of hands."
"I believe this cannot be conducive to democracy, and so this is a vitally important area of concern."
"We will no doubt have to work towards a directive founded on our demands in the 20 November resolution, and, if all these things come together, I hope that we will be able to do all that media diversity in the European Union requires of us."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. This directive confirms once and for all that European democracy and transparency is closely connected to the freedom and pluralism of the media."
"Therefore, media concentration jeopardises freedom of conscience and is a grave injury to human dignity."
"In its Green Paper of 21 May 2003, the Commission calls for specific measures to be looked at once again to actively protect pluralism; in its Recommendation of 28 January 2003, the Council expressed the same concern; in its Resolution of 20 November and the two reports by Mr Sylla and Mr Perry, Parliament said likewise."
"We must, therefore, give a specific response through a Commission initiative to this effect."
"We are in a constituent phase."
"The draft Constitution includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 11(2) of which explicitly enshrines the right to freedom and pluralism of the media."
"What sense is there, however, in adopting a Constitution when that is, itself, negated by the present situation?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, our colleague Mr Perry, and say that I am very pleased that the revision of this directive aims to promote values of public interest, that is, cultural diversity and the right of reply. Above all, moreover, it wishes to promote the development of the European audiovisual industry."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European audiovisual industry must above all be an industry of quality."
"As a mother of two small children, I naturally look for children's programmes and cartoons - with a view to finding programmes which do not injure their sensibilities and which are not prejudicial to minors - and I often find that these programmes or cartoons intended for small children are much more violent than anything even I would like to see."
"I often remember how, as a child, I heard adults talking about how they believed that cartoons such as Bambi or Pinocchio were not suitable for us, but now that kind of thing is by far the most ethical programme we can find."
"If we want a society free of violence, which is what we all aspire to, we must invest in it."
"Investing in it means investing in children and young people, who are the future of the European Union."
"I believe that showing them violence on a daily basis is not the best way to do so."
"I would therefore insist that the European audiovisual industry must be of high quality, strictly controlled and, above all, must be suited to its intended audience."
"Mr President, Mr Perry has reminded us of where the directive has succeeded and he has also indicated, very politely, where we have gone too slowly."
"We have gone too slowly in tackling the problem of media concentration, the limits to public access and the progress we have to make towards a sensitive, but forceful, restatement of this directive and its contents framework."
"I would say to the Commissioner that we are now in the 52nd month of this Parliament and more conferences and discussions simply intended to spin out time until the end of the Parliament are not good enough."
"I thank Mr Perry for accepting my own amendments on access in paragraph 44."
"Television must empower as well as entertain."
"Digital broadcasting can reach those with sensory deprivation just as well as it can reach the mass audience."
"In this year, above all, we should make progress to that end."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
". (EL) Mr President, the Constitutional Treaty reformulates in one of its articles the cultural dimension of Europe and this constitutional foundation expresses a clear political position."
"Namely that European culture is a fundamental component of the European economic and social model which is needed if the political venture of the European Union is to be completed."
"It is the duty of us, as Members of the European Parliament, to convert this constitutional formulation to an active, effective policy."
"I consider that, with the report on cultural industries, we are making such a step."
"We have expanded our policy horizontally with certain important admissions which have to do with the conditions of production and consumption of cultural products and services by European citizens."
"We demonstrated during the preparation of this report and in the dialogue held in the Committee on Culture with all the honourable Members, and I must thank them for that, the central importance of creation and of creators as a basic source of the added value of cultural products."
"We took account of the important economic dimension of culture nowadays, its role in the economic development of regions and towns and its contribution to GDP and to the employment sector."
"We noted the revolutionary changes brought about by new technologies in many of the sectors of the cultural industries, such as in music, in publications and in the audiovisual sector."
"We discussed in detail the importance of the competitiveness of European products, compared with those from other countries of the world, the inequalities of the international trade and the close link between cultural heritage and tourism."
"European citizens consume millions of copies of disks and books and buy millions of tickets to the cinema and concerts every year."
"All this constitutes their cultural diet, thereby shaping their profile and their cultural identity."
"The citizens also watch television programmes."
"They receive information and influence on the Internet from a massive quantity of material which we refer to as content."
"In these ways they select, cultivate and promote one form or another of art and culture, different aesthetics and quality, in close dependency on education and their personal development."
"It is a complex cultural process which characterises the daily life of citizens and we should not ignore the broad political importance and weight which it has."
"In addition, enlargement gives Europe an even greater cultural dimension, together with diversity."
"The internal market is growing."
"Creators' works must overcome a number of obstacles, such as problems in connection with distribution and promotion and extensive piracy, in order to find a way of reaching the European public."
"What we are looking for is European added value and that also applies to the thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises working in the various sectors."
"In order to address all this, we have made a series of proposals to the Commission."
"They are numerous, but I shall comment on just three."
"First, the need for a definition of cultural industries and the sectors they include."
"We need here to analyse the cultural, commercial and economic dimension in order to include the sectors in the definition of cultural or creative industries, as they are called in certain countries."
"I think this will give us a better statistical picture, which we do not have at present."
"Our second call on the Commission is to map the cultural industries at European level."
"We are calling for it to concentrate on cultural, economic, legal, technological and educational aspects, to include employment, intellectual property, the competitiveness network, new products and exports."
"Finally, we consider that it is very important to have a Green Paper in order to promote the coordination of the Member States and the regions in the sector of the cultural industries, so that obstacles can be analysed, solutions suggested and a way found for the public and private sectors to cooperate, to promote competitiveness and to improve European citizens' access to culture."
"I would like to believe that this report is just the beginning and that the Commission will respond not only to this specific report but also to the signs of the times, by taking the necessary initiatives with which, it should be added, the Council has also been preoccupied recently."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Mrs Zorba for her excellent report."
"It has come at just the right time to highlight the importance of the phenomenon of European cultural industries not only from an economic point of view - to which reference has been made - but also in terms of the potential they offer for cultural diversity in Europe."
"It is unfortunate, but we are not always aware of the economic significance of European cultural industries."
"I am referring to audiovisual, music and publishing services."
"A study carried out in 2001 on the employment potential of this sector estimated that 4.8 million people were employed by creative industries in the broadest sense, which accounts for 3.1% of employees in the European Union."
"The European audiovisual sector alone directly employs more than 1 million people."
"Therefore, in addition to their contribution to diversity, cultural industries contribute significantly to the economy."
"They of course differ from other industries in that they have an obvious social and cultural role."
"They have to do with creation."
"They involve producing and selling not products, like other industries, but cultural goods."
"These goods are the expression of an identity; they are reference points."
"Therefore, as far as cultural industries are concerned, normal industrial policy cannot play the same role, not being adapted to these industries."
"We need to look beyond it."
"Cultural diversity presupposes a solid and varied industrial fabric that guarantees pluralism in the cultural supply within a global market."
"This phenomenon alone shows the importance that needs to be attached to this sector of activities that relates to our identities."
"I would like to mention some key actions to demonstrate to you that Europe is paying attention to this sector, not only within the framework of cultural programmes, but far beyond them."
"You are all aware of the MEDIA programme and the work we do for film, but did you know, for example, that in the Culture 2000 programme, the support provided for publishing houses to encourage literary translations has benefited 1 300 translations in the past years?"
"Did you know that a large proportion of the Structural Funds is used to develop the cultural industry?"
"For example, in the Swedish town of Hultsfred, the ERDF cofinanced projects aimed at developing the music industry."
"Since then, the town has become the rock capital of Sweden!"
"As you can see, European aid can result in genuine, concerted and concentrated development of cultural industries."
"Indeed, in your report, you call for a communication on the Structural Funds and culture, a communication that will highlight these types of actions."
"I would like to point out that since 2002 we have also been developing experimental measures designed to support the music and book industries."
"For instance, we have the project to increase exports of European music outside our continent."
"You can therefore see, ladies and gentlemen, that these cultural industries are being supported only by EU programmes and actions."
"I must add that we will soon have a unique opportunity to strengthen this action when we discuss the extension of the MEDIA and CULTURE programmes and the new generation of programmes."
"To this end, with Parliament's help, we will have to envisage very systematic action so that the creativity of this sector can encourage economic and cultural diversity and, thus, our European roots."
". Mr President, it has been a great pleasure to work closely with Mrs Zorba on this important 'own initiative' report."
"I am pleased that the final report, as adopted in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, incorporated the more important elements of my Committee's contribution."
"I refer in particular to the emphasis on the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I have a long involvement with cultural industries in Ireland, in particular local industries which promote the Irish language, traditional music and culture of my own region in the West of Ireland."
"SMEs in the field of culture are clearly more vulnerable compared with similar sized companies in other spheres."
"These SMEs frequently produce, what are in effect, public goods."
"In other words, their products offer benefits to society as a whole above and beyond any commercial value."
"Such SMEs frequently face difficulties in assessing finance, particularly in the start-up phase."
"If you combine the uniqueness of the cultural sector with the fact that such industries are often located in peripheral and rural regions, it is clear that the question of providing adequate finance must be addressed."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would like Member States to look at what policy instruments could be used to promote cultural industries."
"Parliament has previously stressed the need to reduce the legislative and administrative burden on SMEs, simplifying the collection of data for tax collection and reducing unnecessary red tape, especially for the self-employed and small businesses."
"One point of Mrs Zorba's report that I particularly welcome is the call for a revision of the 'De Minimis' rules on State Aid."
"Such a review would take into account the unique situation pertaining to SMEs in the cultural sector, particularly those in peripheral regions."
"In conclusion, I would like to make one particular plea in relation to the policy on the information society."
"Priority must be given to the development of broadband Internet access to rural and peripheral regions."
"This, would help create a more level playing field for the many cultural related SMEs based in these regions"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Zorba on having taken this very interesting initiative to dedicate a report to cultural industries."
"In fact, today we are seeing the emergence of cultural industries with an ever-increasing economic dimension, which also play a vital role in Europe's cultural diversity and identity."
"One of the problems raised by this report is the total absence of a precise definition of cultural industries and of any European industrial strategy in this area."
"The Commission must look at these issues and put forward proposals to us, perhaps by way of the Green Paper."
"In future, we will have to increase aid for cultural industries in projects for the economic development of regions and towns, through the Structural Funds, and also by encouraging private and public partnerships."
"Similarly, the European Union will have to establish support measures for SMEs and independent enterprises, which play an important role in the area of artistic creation and production."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise here the importance of the printed word, and in particular of the regional daily press."
"That is what best guarantees linguistic and cultural diversity and is the most overlooked of the Union's cultural policies."
"It is vital that when the Commission is drawing up its Green Paper it should at long last put forward proposals to actively support this sector, which is also essential for pluralism."
"In the same vein, the Commission will have to propose specific measures to combat media concentration."
"In conclusion, I feel that it is now time to mobilise our efforts to ensure that the proposed UNESCO convention on cultural diversity can soon see the light of day."
"More than ever, we must promote a European cultural spirit in order to encourage creation and bolster cultural diversity, without which Europe would not exist nor have any influence abroad."
"Mr President, the direct cultural policy of the European Union is restricted, as the Member States have wished, to the modest funding of programmes which, nevertheless, are amongst those most often requested by the citizens."
"This deficiency is due, in my opinion, to fundamental causes."
"Firstly, the Council's fear of denationalising these policies, which some consider as signs of national identity."
"The other reason is the governments', and also the Commission's, fear of using Community resources for subsidies which are not directed towards farmers or large public works."
"People avoid talking about culture or art in economic terms when, on the contrary, it should be argued that the cultural industries create employment and generate wealth for Europe."
"If we include the audiovisual field and cultural tourism in the culture sector, it is by far the most important sector for the European economy."
"I address this, without much hope that they read the Minutes, it is true, to the Finance Ministers and also our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets."
"As requested by Mrs Zorba, the Commission must quantify these aspects and consider them when drawing up its policies, not only the directly cultural ones but also the economic, social and territorial ones."
"Furthermore, Commissioner, you should demand that your colleagues take this approach to territorial policies."
"On the other hand, it is also becoming necessary to restrict the commercialisation of culture."
"You will perhaps remember that a few years ago one of the best museums in the world, the property of one of our Member States, was renting out its rooms when the museum was closed - rooms exhibiting humanity's greatest works - for weddings and other social events."
"This was a depressing and alarming example."
"Within the European Union, the economic exploitation of cultural resources must be compatible with their historical and artistic dignity."
"Mr President, these aspects and many others are dealt with in this report, and I warmly congratulate its author on its timeliness and quality."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to express my appreciation for Mrs Zorba's sound initiative."
"We worked well together and managed, via a poll, to gain more insight into the finer points of the cultural industries."
"It is clear that there is much room for improvement, certainly at European level."
"The cultural industries are, after all, of great economic significance, and offer much scope for employment."
"On this basis, I should like to call for culture to figure more prominently in the Structural Funds;"
"SMEs in particular might benefit from this."
"Culture is also, however, an expression of our national identity."
"In a united and, soon, enlarged Europe, it is important for us to be aware of this cultural diversity."
"Museums in all manner of areas are trying to accommodate this, but unfortunately, they are hindered in most European countries by the sometimes exorbitant premiums they have to pay for the exhibits on display."
"This gives museums in countries where this is not the case a major advantage in the organisation of outstanding exhibitions."
"This is, in my view, a clear form of distortion of competition, and it must be stopped; it prompts me to urge the Commission to map out the differences in indemnity regulations in the present and future Member States, and subsequently to table a proposal for more streamlined regulations."
"It is unacceptable for a united Europe to have an elitist group of citizens who are well-informed on what Europe has to offer in terms of culture, while others have to remain deprived of all the fine things that the cultural industries in other European countries have produced and are producing."
"Thank you."
"I should therefore like attention to be given to these indemnity regulations."
"Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for the serious work she has done; however, I cannot agree with her on the approach which she has opted to take."
"In a society in which everything can be bought and sold, culture is in immediate danger of commercialisation, which changes its nature."
"Cultural creation is no longer the art created either collectively by society or by gifted people."
"It is becoming a product which is produced and sold, so that it can be converted to business profit, as well as a means of ideological guidance of the peoples, by promoting a specific way of life."
"Under these conditions, approaching culture in terms of the industry, the market and added value, as if we were talking about cars or oranges, is very dangerous."
"Of course, the report expresses a number of concerns about cultural diversity."
"However, it is not these that determine its content, it is concerns that the European art markets have lost an important share of the global market, that the European Union has not yet developed its potential as regards the trade in cultural commodities."
"Company mergers are considered dangerous not because they result in monopoly control, but because they jeopardise market transparency."
"Even piracy is condemned not as theft of intellectual work, but because it deprives these industries of vast revenues, impacting on future investment."
"The proposals are in keeping with the concerns expressed."
"The report calls for the intervention of the Commission and the Member States not in order to strengthen artistic creation and protect it from commercialisation, but in order to strengthen companies and promote the competitiveness of the European industries."
"This sort of intervention will further institutionalise culture and put it under even greater control by the monopolies."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to the amendments proposed by our political group, in a bid to mitigate somewhat the consequences of the report."
"Thank you, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou."
"On behalf of the sittings service, I apologise for the hubbub over which you had to speak."
"This morning's debate on the cultural package is closed."
"Culture being about listening to one another, I assure you that at times we are not always very polite."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several journalists have told me that 'Plenum Aktuell', the German-language summary of our debates, has recently proved to be particularly deficient."
"The German text contains neither Monday's debate on Basel II nor the debate on the outcome of the Convention, which many of us regard as historic."
"Until 11 this morning, there were no reports at all, something that seems to have something to do with the reorganisation of the press service."
"I think this bodes ill for the quality of the reports on our debates, and I would be glad, Mr President, if you would set the relevant inquiries in motion."
". (FR) Although of economic importance, culture is above all about citizenship."
"The diversity and quality of culture and the capacity to participate in cultural creation are elements of a democratic society that cannot be ignored."
"In this respect, public intervention is crucial."
"Financial support must be provided for cultural creation and production in order to ensure diversity and vitality and to avoid concentration in the hands of a few, often American, multinationals."
"Today, though, systems of public aid are threatened by the thinking that makes the market pre-eminent over everything else."
"In the EU, these systems may be considered to be 'State aid' prohibited as being contrary to European competition law, which is sacrosanct."
"We must regret, in this respect, the result of the Convention, which leaves the existing texts as they are instead of promoting aid for culture to the ranks of aid that is automatically authorised."
"A formidable sword of Damocles thus hangs above our cultural policies."
"At international level, we must safeguard the cultural exception, particularly in light of the GATS, by ensuring that the unanimity rule is maintained in relation to trade agreements in the field of culture."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that in the next report we are going to vote on - the Ebner report - the Spanish version of paragraph 14 of Recommendation 2 of the Annex does not have the same meaning as the original version."
"I would therefore like to ask that, when it comes to the vote, we vote on the text of the original version of that paragraph."
"Mrs Zabell, as in all cases, the services will guarantee that the version ultimately published will conform to what has been voted for in plenary."
"The Spanish version will be corrected."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on:"
"Report (A5-0271/2003) by Mr Michl Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, with recommendations to the Commission on regional and lesser-used languages - the minority languages in the European Union in the context of enlargement and cultural diversity (2003/2057(INI))"
"Mr Vallvé is requesting the floor for an oral amendment."
"Mr President, Mr Ebner, I would like, at this juncture, to bring in an oral amendment."
"With your permission, I would like to replace 'in the official language' in the last sentence with 'in the official language or languages'."
"[I think that is perfectly clear]."
"If there are no objections we shall proceed in this way."
"(Parliament approved the resolution)"
"I will take advantage of the Presidency and offer my [sincere] congratulations molt sincerament en la meva pròpia llengua [in my own language]."
"Joint motion for a resolution"
"Mr President, I had informed the services that I should like to table an oral amendment after Article 39."
"I should now like to ask you whether this is still possible."
"That is very kind of you."
"We have at the moment a situation in which, among others, the Dutchman, Arjan Erkel is still being held, with no indication as to his whereabouts."
"This is why I should like to table the following oral amendment, which is in line with the rapporteur's views."
"I will read it to you in English."
"It is to be inserted after Article 39, and reads as follows:."
"I would say to the honourable Member that as President I have no problem repeating votes if there is really the least reasonable doubt."
"I can guarantee that there is no doubt, I have declared the result entirely convinced of this and I am not going to rectify a vote whose result has already been declared."
"The rapporteur is going to present a technical modification of paragraph 120 rather than an oral amendment."
". (NL) Mr President, I should like to table an oral amendment to the effect that the last sentence of paragraph 120 should be changed, because the situation has meanwhile changed."
"It should read as follows: starting with complete freedom of movement."
"Freedom of expression and religion on the part of the Venerable Thich Quang Do - I hope I have pronounced this correctly - released in June 2003 but still subject to police control, and the reinstatement of the legal status of the banned United Buddhist Church."
"I would insist that I believe that this is more of a technical correction."
"Does anybody object to the presentation of the rapporteur's oral amendment?"
"If not, we shall proceed to the vote."
"I am sorry, but I have no intention of carrying out that check."
"I would insist that the result was perfectly clear."
"You have not taken account of the fact that one group has not voted in the same way in both cases."
"I am simply applying Rule 19(2) of the Rules of Procedure and I will take the consequences."
"Mr President, you cited a Rule that I did not know existed when you made your ruling on the points of order by Mr Wieland and Mr Van Orden."
"Rule 138(3) mentions that points of order concerning the validity of a vote may be raised after the President has declared it closed."
"Thus Mr Wieland had the right to do what he did."
"Rule 138(4) provides that 'after the result of a vote by show of hands has been announced, a Member may request that this result be checked using the electronic voting system'."
"You did not do that Mr President."
"I know the final decision on all this is yours, but it was a legitimate call by a host of Members of this House."
"You said at the very beginning of this voting session that your eyes were playing you up."
"I would humbly ask that you take a check on Amendment No 16."
"(Applause from the right)"
"I am going to apply Rule 138(5) of the Rules of Procedure, which gives that final responsibility to the President, and I therefore consider the result I declared previously to be valid."
". (NL) Mr President, as rapporteur, I would not like to see any ambiguity left about one section in the decision-making process."
"I should therefore like to urge you to consider complying with the EPP's request and permitting, at this stage, an oral vote on point 16."
"I appreciate that you would then have to go back on a decision, but I should nevertheless like to urge you to treat this report in such a way as to leave no misunderstanding or uncertainty on this matter at all."
"I would therefore make an urgent appeal to you now to honour the request."
"I am sorry but I am not changing my opinion."
"We shall proceed to the vote on the whole of the motion for a resolution thus modified."
"(Parliament approved the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0281/2003) by Mr Fodé Sylla, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs, on the situation concerning fundamental rights in the European Union (2002) (2002/2013(INI))"
"Mr President, I would like to present an oral amendment to the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 135, which says the following: 'calls on the institutions to provide access to opinions of the Legal Services, respecting the principles established by the Court of Justice'."
"I believe that this amendment would resolve the small problem which had arisen."
"Mr Turco is requesting the floor."
"Is it on the same issue?"
"The mere fact that the staff of the Legal Service and Parliamentary Bureau only let us know at 10.40 this morning which texts we have to submit, how we should vote and which amendments they can accept, gives a picture of the situation in which we find ourselves in Parliament."
"I would like to thank Mr Mollar for his efforts, but, as far as I am concerned - being one of the authors of the amendment adopted unanimously by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, an amendment which, moreover, quoted the opinion of the European Ombudsman - I think that we must put an end to this farce."
"I will vote against this compromise."
"We take note but, institutionally, the correct procedure was to hear the chairman of the committee and you as author of the amendment."
"We are therefore going to vote firstly on the proposed compromise by the chairman of the committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would nevertheless like to remind those Members who have asked for no less than five or six passages of the report to be deleted that we are not in a supermarket with a trolley."
"This is about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we are not here to decide what should be retained or completely removed."
"It also has to do with the Charter that has to appear in Part II of the text of the Constitution."
"So when Members propose removing the right to education, the right of asylum, the right to citizenship, the reference to racism, when Members call into question equality between men and women or on the basis of sexual orientation, I say to them that the next time we should not call this text the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union but the Charter of Random Rights of the European Union."
"Mr Sylla, I believe that the amendments have been presented correctly, in time and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, and what you are making is a political objection rather than a regulatory objection."
"Your observation is not therefore relevant."
"I would ask the honourable Members not to take it into account."
"I believe it is a clarification with regard to the wording and as such it will be taken into account."
"In any event it has to be approved."
"Mr President, I would very much like to make a brief statement about the next amendment. My concern is with torture."
"It is quite extraordinary that there is no amendment whereby this House can condemn torture in the strongest terms."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, you are perfectly aware that this is not a debate."
"It is not appropriate to speak here about the fundamental issue."
"We shall proceed to the vote on the whole of the motion for a resolution thus amended."
"(Parliament approved the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0273/2003) by Mr Paul A.A.J.G. Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission on water management in developing countries: policy and priorities for EU development cooperation (COM(2002) 132 - C5-0335/2002 - 2002/2179(COS))"
"President."
"Firstly there is an oral amendment by Mr Knolle to Amendment No 15."
"Mr President, I ask that the following change be made to the amendment on which we are currently voting. The last line reads: '?the work of private operators'."
"I ask that the word 'private' be deleted, so that it will then read: 'the work of operators'."
"Does the House agree to this oral amendment being tabled?"
"Are there any objections?"
"We shall proceed to the vote on Amendment No 15, including the oral amendment."
"The rapporteur is requesting the floor."
"Mr President, I had asked to table an oral amendment."
"I will ask the Socialist Group to remove a small section of their amendment, which states 'can be sometimes in practice'."
"I would propose to them that they remove this part of the sentence."
"If they are in agreement, I will support their amendment; if not, I will vote against it."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists does not agree to that omission."
"The amendment will therefore be put to the vote in its original form."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on the whole of the proposal for a resolution, including amendments."

". (PT) The European Union's objective is to ensure that Europe remains prosperous and peaceful."
"It is also, however, an important partner in cooperation, in particular with developing countries."
"I congratulate the Commission on its Annual Report for 2001 on EC development policy and the implementation of external assistance."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, however, I can only underline the fact that questions of gender, development and combating poverty are interrelated."
"The Commission should, therefore, incorporate into its development policy specific goals relating to education, health, gender equality and combating poverty."
"The financing of female participation in business should be promoted. Moreover, the reduction of child mortality and maternal mortality, as well as measures to fight violence against women, genital mutilation, rape of girls and trafficking in human beings, should always be included in development policy."
"The Commission should ensure a gender-balanced participation in projects, with a special regard for areas where discrimination against women is most severe."
"I support the Commission in its reform of the management of external aid, which will allow us to strengthen the evaluation and improve the implementation of development policy."
". (FR) The Martinez Martinez report calls on Parliament to approve the Commission's 2001 annual report on its development policy and the implementation of external assistance."
"We voted against the report to highlight both our opposition to the Commission's policy and its justification."
"Even the report from the very official UNDP notes that the situation in most poor countries deteriorated in the previous year and that, for some of them, it is disastrous."
"Under these conditions, the very title of the report, which refers to development policy, is an insult to these hundreds of thousands of human beings whose situation, rather than improving, is only getting worse."
"The fact that the report dares to welcome the Commission's emphasis on poverty reduction is a further insult."
"The amount of aid provided is pitiful; it comes nowhere near the amounts the pillage of these countries yields to oil, building and maritime traffic trusts and the countless European enterprises that are growing rich on the meagre wages paid in these countries."
"The report calls for specific measures to protect indigenous populations."
"Quite apart from the language, which is redolent of colonial times, what the poor countries, and particularly Africa, must be protected from above all, is these predators, the large cartels?"
"(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Mr President, I am glad that this report has been adopted."
"The report by Michl Ebner from the South Tyrol is successor to a long line of great reports adopted by this House on this subject since the 1980s, beginning with the Arfé Report, produced by a great Social Democrat from the Valle d'Aosta."
"I rejoice in it."
"It was the eastward enlargement that made it necessary to send out a clear signal concerning these matters, for a very large number of minorities and ethnic groups will be finding their way to us: Hungarians in Slovakia, Germans and Poles in the Czech Republic, Poles in Lithuania, Lithuanians in Poland, and so on."
"That shows the immensity of this issue in quantitative terms, and even in qualitative terms it is of great significance, as these minorities can become either the mortar in the foundations of the EU or an explosive charge."
"We want them to be the mortar that holds us together."
". (FR) I am vehemently in favour of keeping, indeed developing, cultural diversity in Europe, particularly at this time when it is being enlarged to comprise twenty-five Member States."
"Since languages are the main component of this diversity, then I am in favour of linguistic enlargement, in spite of any material or technical difficulties that may arise from it."
"Incidentally, I fear that there is a double game being played by those who are arguing for an increase in the number of languages, with the actual aim of better establishing the monopoly of English."
"Therefore, we need to work on the language question, in particular by again giving objective consideration to Esperanto."
"The monopoly of English is neither good for Europe nor for Great Britain, whose language will become a mere 'nuts and bolts language'"
". (NL) Respecting and safeguarding the linguistic and cultural diversity in Europe is an honourable objective."
"Any erosion of this diversity would constitute an impoverishment of our cultural heritage."
"Consequently, measures to avoid this, such as the proposed establishment of a European Agency on Linguistic Diversity and Language Learning, deserve every support."
"However, the draft resolution is explicitly based on the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities."
"The Flemish Government has always refused to sign this agreement - with good reason - since French-speaking Belgians who have moved to Flanders want to misuse it in order to have French recognised as an official language in Flanders."
"This is in conflict with language legislation that has been established with great difficulty and the principle of territoriality in Belgium."
"It mainly concerns people who refuse to fit in with the Dutch-speaking character of the region, and who, in fact, turn failure to teach another language - in this case Dutch - into a political point of debate."
"Since the report does not propose any measures to prevent groups of relatively recent newcomers to the region from using the Treaty to their advantage in order to cancel out a linguistic balance that has been achieved with great difficulty, the representatives of the Vlaams Blok will be voting against it."
". (ES) It is my pleasure to explain why I voted for the Ebner report, given the far-reaching significance of promoting, respecting and also, where necessary, protecting the languages which enrich the European Union's cultural and linguistic heritage and which ought to bring to life the motto of the draft Constitution for Europe, 'United in diversity'."
"Moreover, those languages are the central nucleus of the linguistic and cultural rights recognised by that draft Constitution and also by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"With that in mind, I want to draw attention in particular to the need to add the official languages of the Member States to the list of official languages of the Union. An example from within the Spanish state is Catalan, a language spoken in an area containing ten million inhabitants, and recognised by Parliament, in the Reding report, as deserving special treatment given its importance and standing at the heart of the European Union."
"It is a sad fact that successive Spanish Governments have failed to champion the official languages recognised by the relevant Statutes of Autonomy, earmarking for development the principles and rights of the Spanish Constitution itself."
"For that reason, it is very important that it should be the European Union that recognises and protects these languages, over and above the positions of governments."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (NL) The recognition of language diversity within the EU is no folklore."
"There are currently 40 million EU citizens who speak a language other than the official national language, and next year they will total 46 million."
"For the children and grandchildren of migrants, the language of the environment will become their first spoken language."
"This does not apply to stateless peoples or to people who live in pockets of society on the other side of the state border that separates them from those who speak the same language."
"Within Europe, there has been a long-term battle for education, administration and work in the citizens' own national language."
"People without this opportunity end up in the position of second-class citizens."
"The first-class citizens are those who speak the prevailing language at home or who have completely adapted to it."
"Within the EU, a stark contrast is starting to emerge between peoples who now have their own Member State and peoples who are treated as minorities within states that predominantly speak a different language."
"The language of this latter group is still not being recognised within the EU, unless it happens to be the same of that of the neighbouring country."
"For example, the ten million Catalan-speakers will continue to wonder why their language counts for less than the much smaller languages of the Danes, Finns, Baltic peoples and Slovenians."
"We will soon face major conflicts unless a solution is found in good time."
"(PT) I voted against this report, not because I consider less widely-spoken European regional languages to be undeserving of respect, protection and dissemination, but because I feel that the rapporteur's approach to this question gives impetus to separatist tendencies within the Member States. This will bring about an intensification of political and territorial disputes inherited from nineteenth- and twentieth-century conflicts and the territorial agreements which always followed them."
"Its prevailing characteristics have been an inability to understand much of what was said, and the clear and conspicuous use of minority and regional languages as an offensive weapon in a brazen quest for vengeance on the part of many national minorities. Some of these minorities are, notoriously, involved in worrying secessionist or independence movements, some of which have no qualms about resorting to extremist violence and brutality."
"I do not believe that the European Union should be allowed to meddle in the structure and internal affairs of its Member States, much less intervene, even indirectly, in their political and institutional balance of power."
"I recognise the need to preserve Europe's cultural and linguistic diversity, but I feel that pushing for the establishment of yet another European agency to that end is a signal that ?"

". (FR) We can subscribe to some of the joint resolution's exhortations and agree to collaboration between countries faced with disasters, in particular to help countries such as Portugal."
"The text as a whole, however, only hides the Member States' responsibility in their incapability of dealing with the repercussions of the heatwave and the forest fires."
"Obviously the heatwave itself was not the responsibility of the Member States; nor, generally speaking, were the fires."
"Why though, were there not enough staff in old people's homes and in hospitals to deal with the consequences of the heat wave on elderly people?"
"Why were there not enough firemen, and not enough equipment, to fight the forest fires?"
"It is because all Member States, even the richest ones, have for years been cutting back the budgets for essential public services."
"They are reducing funds allocated to them; they are not taking on staff in sufficient numbers."
"Even at normal times, the emergency services at hospitals and the fire-fighting services are at their limits and can meet their obligations only by subjecting their personnel to intolerable working conditions."
"In such conditions, what value can be attached to promises - in any case extremely vague ones - that it will not happen again?"
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)."
". (FR) Leaving behind the media stir, there are two issues to which this summer's heatwave in Europe should open the eyes of decision-makers."
"We are responsible for the disruption of the climate and for the dangerous world that we are going to bequeath to our children."
"For some things, it is already too late."
"For others, courageous decisions have to be taken very quickly, even if they are not popular."
"The thousands of deaths, often of elderly and sometimes unknown people, reminds us that it is not enough to 'prolong life' but that we need to give the means to live, whatever the situation, the handicap, health and age."
"Our society is far from this and worse, it is getting further away from it. (Just look at the French Government's decisions to lower taxes)."
". (DE) In July and August, extremes of heat, drought and forest fires inflicted great suffering on European citizens."
"The forest fires, in particular, caused severe damage; human lives were lost, and the destruction of flora and fauna is harming the ecosystem."
"The rebuilding of the homes, factories and infrastructure that have been destroyed in the affected areas will take years, and people will not be able to accomplish it on their own."
"Dealing with the damage will require the creation of a whole network of relief agencies, and the people affected are in urgent need of solidarity, from the European Community in particular."
"I therefore welcome the allocation of aid totalling EUR 31.6 million for the people severely affected as being the EU's first significant response, but we should assume even now that financial support will need to be improved - to what extent, it goes without saying, will be able to be determined only after the full extent of the damage has been precisely ascertained."
"It is, at the same time, indispensable that we ensure that it is possible to get the long-term help needed to rebuild the social and economic fabric started promptly and without bureaucracy."
"Also, for the sake of protecting the forests in future, steps must be taken to improve meteorological forecasts, thus making it possible to minimise the risks associated with adverse weather conditions."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (FR) We have not voted in favour of this joint resolution on the heatwave for the simple and good reason that it does not grasp the social, health and environmental measure of the disaster."
"The heatwave is not fate and its gruesome repercussions were not unavoidable."
"This climatic accident is primarily the result of the greenhouse effect caused by global warming generated by human activity."
"Other choices are, however, possible, notably to oblige the industrial powers to respect the Kyoto protocol."
"The free-marketeers' choices in terms of energy and transport policies are harmful and criminal."
"When will there be a resolution for renewable energies so as to leave behind fossil fuels and nuclear energy?"
"When will there be a resolution to prioritise rail and piggyback transport, and moreover, one for other choices relating to national and regional development?"
"Finally, if we continue to reduce public deficit and dismantle public services to abide by the dogma of the Stability and Growth Pact, we will close down social services and hospitals."
"If we continue to cast elderly people into precarious situations and poverty by revising retirement schemes and systems of allowances, then we will make them even more vulnerable and we will destroy the social security systems."
"This policy has killed more than 14 000 people in Europe."
"We need to make different choices for our society."
". (PT) The final text of the resolution goes a long way towards meeting the expectations of the Portuguese people and provides, at last, a response that is in line with the scale of the disaster that struck Portugal in the form of a devastating series of forest fires at the end of July and August."
"I voted for all the proposed amendments to the motion for a compromise resolution and am delighted that they were all approved, significantly improving the high standard of work achieved previously by the representatives of the groups."
"Portugal's justifiable request for an increase in the size of its grant from the Solidarity Fund has received a strong vote of confidence here today. A complementary move is now afoot to reorganise some Structural Funds and Community programmes with a view to dealing with the effects of the disaster; that move has also been given a boost."
"At the same time, moreover, the second reading of the draft Forest Focus regulation, which will soon reach this Chamber, has gained considerable impetus. This is because renewed sanction has been given to the demands already made by the European Parliament for the forest fire prevention programme, as it functioned until the end of 2002, to be properly reviewed."
". (PT) The main priorities of the programme for rebuilding infrastructure and regenerating the affected areas should be replanting and reforestation, to be financed by the Structural Funds, the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and the Cohesion Fund."
"Fire prevention in southern European countries should be encouraged through binding measures to which the governments of the Member States must strictly adhere. It should not be left at the mercy of purely economic policies such as those in evidence during the disaster we have just witnessed."
"There can be absolutely no doubt that Member States' national, regional and local land-use plans should make provisions for forestry reserves, scheduling initiatives for protecting indigenous species, preventive schemes and natural reforestation schemes, in the interests of safeguarding the character and quality of life of communities in a given area."
"I have voted against. And why?"
"Because we are barking up the wrong tree with these resolutions."
"I would put the question here whether we are not at risk of slipping into totalitarian thinking with the selective condemnation of the Cuban situation, while other countries that are allegedly friendly to us have maintained similar practices, more systematically, and for much longer."
"This means that even the European Union is turning into a totalitarian regime that is selective in who it holds accountable and prosecutes."
"To what extent has Cuba as a country and the Cuban population over the past 40 years had a reasonable chance of developing its own policy?"
"It is hypocritical to point the finger only at Cuba."
"Instead, what is needed here is understanding and cooperation based on mutual respect."
"My thoughts, therefore, also go to Guantanamo, to what is going on there, to all the lies and manipulations that are being disseminated."
"Lies are being told, people are even paying other people to lie, and I think that this should stop."
"I object to this behaviour."
"Mr President, I have voted against the resolution on Cuba, not because I disagree with what is said in it about the situation in Cuba, but because I disagree with what is not said."
"I feel that it is intellectually and politically unjustifiable to assess Cuba's position without considering the unremitting aggression instigated by the United States and endured by the island for the last 40 years. That aggression has been made manifest in all kinds of acts, including terrorist acts, which have been condemned by the international community."
"This policy of aggression has intensified recently, giving rise to justifiable concerns on the part of the Cuban authorities, especially now that pre-emptive war has risen to the status of a White House doctrine and the invasion of Iraq has taken place."
"The threat of virtual war, endured by Cuba for so many years, has thus grown into the threat of real war."
"We might criticise some of the reactions to this threat ? we have done so ? but that does not mean we should not try to understand them."
"The Cubans are convinced of two things, and I agree with them: the first is that the European Union treats Cuba differently from any other country in the same economic circumstances as Cuba, and even from any other country with a similar regime to Cuba."
"The Cubans are also convinced, as I am, that this discriminatory policy is not a matter of coincidence. Rather, it is encouraged by the United States."
"I believe it is essential to rethink our policy towards Cuba, with the immediate aim of regaining credibility and trust among all the Cubans with whom we have dealings."
"That does not mean we should hide our worries, our criticisms and our hopes of seeing the Cuban people progress. It does, however, mean that we should express those thoughts with the same respect, independence and coherence we show other countries, from Israel to Morocco, Russia to Latvia, Argentina to Guatemala, and even from China to the United States."
"Only if the European Union restores trust and credibility, shows understanding and solidarity, will it have the necessary influence to help things get better in and with Cuba."
"Resolutions like this one do nothing to help us in that task of restoring credibility and trust, either in Cuba itself or in the rest of the developing world, for which Cuba is still an important point of reference."
"The debate on Cuba demonstrated that the objective of the ?U is identical to that of the USA: to use various means, to use economic aid and diplomatic relations as a lever in order to bring about a change in the system 'peaceably', methodically, to impose the market economy and to overturn socialism."
"It became clear that what the selectively over-sensitive Euro-unifying hypocrites cannot forgive socialist Cuba is not the so-called authoritarianism of the socialist regime or any weaknesses in it, but the fact that Cuba, despite the open war and the forty-year criminal embargo by the imperialists, is maintaining and continuing to improve the standard of living and education of its people, which is the highest in the whole of Latin America, that socialist Cuba and Fidel Castro are a beam of light, a source of fighting inspiration to the peoples in the area and mankind as a whole."
"That is why, while they turn a blind eye and acquiesce to the daily executions and the thousands of political prisoners, including Cubans, in the USA, Israel and elsewhere, while they support dismal dictatorships and genocide, they shed crocodile tears about the fate of the paid agents of the imperialists in Cuba."
"They cannot forgive the determination of the Cuban people, as expressed on a daily basis with their fighting unity, to defend their socialist homeland to the last."
"We stand at their side unhesitatingly and express our admiration and our gratitude to them."
". (FR) We obviously denounce the heavy sentencing and the attacks on freedoms in Cuba, without forgetting, however, the immense responsibility of the US, with its economic embargo, its political pressures, and its military threat, the objective of which is not to ensure more independence for the Cuban people, but to strangle this small country which has dared to escape from its direct hold."
"The majority of Members may well have voted for this resolution against the arrests in Cuba, but how many of them remain silent when the great power that they represent supports, finances and arms authoritarian regimes or dictators, in particular those in former colonies, that is to say in its spheres of economic influence now?"
"Being selective, the virtuous indignation against these attacks on freedoms in Cuba does not merit the slightest credit."
"They should start by clearing up their own back yards!"
"We, though, denounce our own state, France, which, whilst claiming to be a country of human rights, keeps troops in several African countries and defends, with weapons if necessary, as in the Ivory Coast at present, authoritarian regimes that have infinitely less legitimacy towards their own people than the Cuban regime towards its people."
"We had no part to play in this masquerade."
". (PT) The political and social situation in Cuba is hard to understand without a sufficiently broad sociocultural or historical perspective."
"The Cuban threat, moreover, may have been very real in the 1960s, when at one point Soviet missiles were trained on Cuba's powerful neighbour, but it is now no more than a fiction, a pretext justifying a political confrontation. That confrontation is at its most bitter between Cubans living in Cuba, who defend Castro's regime, and Cuban exiles in the United States, who exert considerable sway over the Bush Administration."
"An EU presence in Cuba is indispensable for monitoring how the Cuban political regime really operates, and to what extent it is hampered by a commercial blockade which has tragic effects on the people while, in some ways, supporting and sustaining the dictatorship."
"Even now, after the Cuban dictator took advantage of 26 July to blast European policy, it cannot be said that every door has been closed or every possibility exhausted."
"The stance adopted in Parliament by Commissioner Nielson on behalf of the Commission is, therefore, justified."
"Since I am in agreement with the resolution's main points but feel it does not go far enough, I abstained from voting on it."
"(PT) This resolution is one of a range of initiatives responding to the recent escalation in the campaign of interference and aggression conducted against Cuba by the USA over the last 40 years. The actions of the new US representative in Havana, James Cason, stand out within this process."
"They openly violate Cuban sovereignty through their support and funding of 'members of the opposition'. Their aim is to destabilise Cuban institutions and even propitiate conditions which could act as a pretext for a military attack on Cuba."
"The resolution does not say a single word about the terrorist acts and kidnappings which have been carried out as James Cason has continued with his exploits in Cuba. These represent a qualitative change in the process of intervention."
"The resolution does not condemn the US blockade of Cuba because it is illegitimate, illegal under international law and has serious consequences for the economy and quality of life of the people of Cuba. Rather, it condemns the blockade because it 'is not a constructive approach to promoting change or reform of the Cuban regime'."
"The measures adopted by the EU represent a supine acceptance of the Bush Administration's policy."
"'Cooperation' should not be used as a means of interference."
"On the contrary, the EU should adopt and develop a mutually advantageous cooperation policy, one which respects Cuban sovereignty and independence."
". (NL) In 1955, I saw for myself the abject poverty and inequality in South America."
"This turned me into a supporter of Fidel Castro even before he took over state power at the end of 1958."
"I still think that the alternative society that has been created since then in Cuba, which has managed to assert itself surprisingly well in the face of American attempts to starve and destroy this alternative, is valuable."
"It is neither money nor economic power play the lead in that country, but solidarity and the equality of all people."
"This solidarity and equality cannot, however, justify the long-term prison sentences and death penalties that are meted out to silence those who, in the eyes of the regime's supporters, do not display solidarity or who threaten equality."
"Even if the present Cuba were some kind of paradise, which it is not, paradise cannot be defended in that way."
"Such violations of human rights do not convince anyone, but only lead to bitterness among those who they wish to eliminate."
"They are the wrong answer to the undermining campaign organised from within the USA."
"Serious violations of human rights cannot be condoned, not even if they are perpetrated by people who originally had similar political objectives."
"I have already voted for condemnation during an earlier debate on urgent subjects."
"It is a pity that Cuba should unnecessarily isolate itself from its friends in Europe."
". (FR) I abstained in the vote on the resolution on Cuba."
"Whilst fully sharing the criticism directed at the current regime as regards its serious violations of human rights, I cannot join in singling out Cuba when things remain the same in dozens of other countries with comparable regimes."
"It is high time that the Council, the Commission and the Parliament provide a human rights' policy that is rigorous and uniform, which does not take into consideration the size and geographical location of a country, nor the state of its relations with the European Union or the US."
". (PT) I voted in favour of the joint resolution on Cuba."
"I did so because the Cuban people still lacks the most basic civil, political and human rights, just when we thought we had seen the last of the ramifications of the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"The European Parliament had to take a firm political stand against Fidel Castro's regime."
"I wanted to contribute to that goal, because the Cuban people live under a dictatorship which has chosen to turn in on itself rather than open up, to imprison rather than set free."
"If there is one people still asking to be set free in 2003, then, it is the Cuban people."
"The dictator's latest pronouncements, in which he displayed the irresponsible attitude we have come to expect from him by spurning all European Union assistance, are thus all the more deplorable."
"More importantly, I would like to conclude by recalling that the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas in 2002."
"In doing so, it sent a political message to the Cuban regime: we in Europe were also watching to see how matters developed."
"In 2003, the regime responded to that message by taking more political prisoners, by continuing to violate human rights and trample the rule of law under foot."
"This resolution requests that Mr Payá Sardiñas come to Europe and explain in person what is happening in Cuba."
"The regime will not let him."
"It is our duty not to abandon him."
". (PT) I am delighted with the compromise resolution, which was approved unamended."
"I found it particularly satisfying, moreover, to see what we are calling the 'Sakharov Initiative' finally ratified, and thus approved by an overwhelming majority in Parliament, in paragraph 2. Under this initiative, it is proposed that we once again invite Oswaldo Payá, winner of the Sakharov Prize 2002, to Europe, and welcome him at the highest level."
"I am proud to have been responsible, together with other honourable Members, for launching this initiative in May. Little by little, it attracted growing support in Parliament, with 205 individual signatures by July, until its eventual adoption and ratification in plenary."
"I hope that the Council and the Commission will now follow it up properly."
"Along with many of my fellow Members, I really believe that the great symbolic significance of the support eventually mobilised by this 'Sakharov Initiative', combined with its ratification, may result in a marked, decisive improvement in the situation in Cuba. It may be just the catalyst for change that has been lacking."
"Mr President, for the first time I regret seeing you in your seat, as I would have liked what I have to say now to have been addressed to your predecessor. I have, out of conviction, voted in favour of the van den Bos Report, but I will emphatically not endorse Amendment No 16."
"I am also grateful to the rapporteur for showing magnanimity in helping the President out of a tight spot and finally giving ground, but there was no moving this particular horse."
"The President's right to have the last word in certain matters is founded upon him, or the Vice-President in question, enjoying the confidence of this House."
"I must say at this point, and to my great regret, that the Vice-President who previously occupied the chair no longer enjoys my confidence, as he abused the trust placed in him in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I have voted in favour of the van den Bos report, but there are two things I would like to explain."
"First of all, I would like to clarify that in the Gujarat massacre of March last year, many of the victims were also of Indian origin."
"Furthermore, it is wrong to refer to the threat of increasing Hindu fundamentalism."
"This gives a distorted view of the situation in India."
"After all, that country is the only country in southern Asia that has opted in favour of a secular and pluralist state model."
"A choice of this kind clearly demonstrates tolerance for the different population groups."
"There are exceptions in every society, but this is no reason to generalise and brand the Indian society as a whole as fundamentalist."
"India is an open, tolerant and pluralist society in which religious freedom forms part of the constitution."
"It is on the basis of this argumentation that I have voted in favour of the van den Bos report."
"Today, Mr President, we have voted on two reports on human rights."
"Even though it is in fact the issue of human rights that leads me to sit in this House, I voted against both of them."
"The reason for this is the fact that the issue has, unfortunately, been misused for ideological reasons."
"My criticism is primarily aimed at the way in which, with the van den Bos report, we have taken an unambiguous stand for religious freedom throughout the world, whilst at the same time treating the statement by Cardinal Ratzinger and the Catholic Church on same-sex partnerships as some sort of violation of human rights."
"This just shows the ideological misuse of the issue of human rights."
"European society is founded not only upon the inviolable dignity of the person, but also upon the inviolable dignity of marriage and the family, the defence of which is one of our tasks as politicians."
"Future reports on human rights should protect marriage and the family, rather than calling them into question."
". (NL) The annual report on global human rights in 2002 and the European Union's human rights policy by Mr van den Bos (D'66) broaches so many topics that it is difficult to see the wood for the trees."
"The rapporteur is getting under the EU Member States' feet with the suggestion that human rights policy should be dealt with at Community level."
"The report should have confined itself much more to enforcing human rights clauses in association and cooperation agreements, and to assessing their effectiveness."
"In this respect, the European institutions - the Council, the Commission and Parliament - should definitely search their own hearts."
"The report is right to denounce increasing extremism and fundamentalism, but fails to separate these expressions of perverted religion from religion itself."
"Anyone who does draw this distinction need not make a forced effort to keep religion out of political debate."
"Moreover, it then becomes immediately clear that the ideologies of socialism and liberalism are also subjective philosophies."
"Non-belief - not adhering to any faith - is also based on a choice of faith."
"Democratic politics is therefore never impartial."
"Finally, it is important to note that international human rights standards, however valuable they are, are not the ultimate standard against which human action will be judged."
"After all, the basis of this law lies in the human person, as if man were autonomous and made the law for himself."
"This subjectivity puts the universal claims of such law into perspective."
"According to my political belief, objective and universal law are only based on the Ten Commandments given to mankind by God, the Creator of all life."
"It is fortunate that a huge number of legal standards that apply in our European societies to this day are based on this."
"It would be sensible simply to recognise this."
"Only then can something positive be expected from an inter-religious or inter-cultural dialogue."
"(PT) Although there are aspects of this report with which I agree, I feel I must draw attention to what I would describe as the appropriation of a report - on the situation of human rights in the world, of all things - as a tool of political coercion. In it, countries listed as 'friends' are defended, while those listed as US or EU targets are criticised, thereby applying double standards."
"I cannot understand why, for instance, the report makes no mention of Israel's invasion of Palestine, or the invasion of Iraq by the USA and its allies. I therefore support the proposals for amendments tabled by my group, which condemn the following:"
"human rights violations carried out by Israel in pursuit of its policy of attacking and oppressing the Palestinian people through murder, imprisonment, destruction of housing and the building of an unacceptable and illegal wall designed to enforce the occupation and colonisation of Palestinian territory;"
"the concept of pre-emptive war, as well as any resort to war as a means of ending international conflicts;"
"the invasion of Iraq, instigated by the USA and involving EU Member States, in flagrant breach of international law and the United Nations Charter."
". (NL) Protection of human rights outside the EU ceases to be credible if, in a number of cases, the human rights situation in the EU itself is in poor shape, if a European sense of superiority underlies everything or if others are judged by double standards."
"Europe should look at America to see how things are not done."
"For years, American human rights policy was geared to punishing countries that strayed off course and to rewarding governments in countries where America had military and economic interests."
"In the former case, minor human rights violations used to be put under the microscope while in the latter, major violations were hushed up, denied or glossed over as much as possible."
"In the developing world, human rights were therefore put on an equal footing with the ability to follow the 'American way of life', particularly the existence of free competition, to which the involvement of all in democratic government, equality and solidarity were made entirely subordinate."
"Oppressive dictatorships were backed for fear of mass rebellion."
"Although the European states have not gone to such extremes in most cases, its current relations with the dictatorships in China and Iran are very clearly based on its own self-interest."
"For the governments in Russia, Turkey and Israel, it will become easier to oppress Chechens, Kurds and Palestinians when the EU wants to be on good terms with them."
"This report is a valuable contribution to change, but will anything actually happen?"
". (FR) The report by Mr Fodé Sylla on the fundamental rights situation in the Union, full of extreme proposals, gives an idea of what threatens to happen if the Union were to gain greater competence in this area, which is what the Convention has proposed."
"It is enough to list the proposals relating to immigration: expanding the right to asylum, broader legal immigration channels; relaxing naturalisation procedures, expanding the concept of European citizenship to non-EU legal immigrants, granting them the right to vote in local and European elections, and it goes on."
"These proposals are accompanied by harsh and peremptory judgments on this or that named European country, which is enjoined to redeem itself by making amends."
"In addition, France was asked to ratify the Charter on Regional and Minority Languages that the previous socialist government signed."
"I hope that they will never do it."
"We can see that if the Charter on Fundamental Rights were to become obligatory then the Union would have, thanks to this Charter and to Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, the right to impose real enforcement of rights, oriented, or rather disoriented - towards destroying our societies."
". (FR) What the European authorities pompously call fundamental rights is, at best, but the vaguest of notions, the content of which boils down to precious little for workers and the most vulnerable inhabitants of Europe."
"Apart from a few rare exceptions, the report does not show any steps forward, but instead steps backwards in this area due, more often than not, to the required policies applied by the States that want to make us believe that they are guaranteeing real rights for the people of Europe."
"Those who are denied the most basic of individual, economic, social or political rights by this society are firstly the minorities and those that it is most hard on are women, children, disabled people, the elderly, homosexuals, asylum seekers, immigrants, members of national minorities etc. For millions of workers, the prospects are unemployment, inadequate wages, arbitrary employers, exploitation, and death in the workplace."
"For them, where are the fundamental rights on which the European Union is holding forth?"
"Our vote in favour of the report was motivated by the accuracy of the critical description of the actual state of human rights in Europe, but this does not mean that we share the illusions of its author regarding the capacity of the European Institutions to fundamentally change things."
". (IT) The serious lack of competition rules regulating conflicts of interest and the concentration of monopolies to protect the rule of law and citizens' freedoms is due to over 50 years of cronyism and over 30 years of complete monopoly by RAI-TV, which has gradually been replaced by a duopoly over the last 15 years."
"Even in this last period, this has been the choice of the left alliance, at least as much as the right."
"In fact, the world of audiovisual information and its immense power to influence the situation in Italy are dominated by groups of influential journalists, generally centre-left but also far left, who constitute a genuine political force that has dominated RAI-TV to date and is present at the highest level in Mediaset."
". (PT) The European Parliament's annual report on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the EU is an important tool for understanding how fundamental rights are being respected and protected in Europe as a whole and within each of the Member States."
"We need a rigorous and effective assessment of the quality of that protection, enabling a clear overview of the current situation as regards fundamental rights. Then we will be able to take decisions in this field."
"I am sorry to say that this year's report does not fulfil these requirements."
"The first draft of the report might have met with a broad consensus, but this final version is totally unacceptable."
"The rapporteur has opted to draw up a sort of shopping list in which he criticises a selection of EU Member States at the same time as suggesting unrealistic and irrelevant proposals."
"The following proposals are completely unacceptable:"
"granting the right of asylum to victims of persecution by non-government agents;"
"granting access to education to all children present in a given country, even if they are there illegally;"
"passing European legislation on homosexual marriage;"
"allowing third-country nationals to vote in local elections and elections to the European Parliament."
". (FR) The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was obliged not to vote in favour of this text despite the importance that our group attaches to the respect and protection of fundamental rights."
"All of the Charter, yet nothing but the Charter."
"Once again this principle, approved by the Parliament, has not been respected."
"From the shopping list to the militancy, as well as personal opinions being put forward, this report is a catalogue of ideological yet irrational wishes."
"Many of the points raised concern neither fundamental rights in general nor those at the heart of the European Union."
"The European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not agree with the alleged progress in certain areas (notably regarding the right to asylum) nor the tendency to extrapolate the letter of the Charter on certain issues relating to discrimination."
"Furthermore, quoting countries only serves to weigh down the text and to awaken pointless nationalist reactions."
"Has the Charter, as it is written, been respected during the course of the year in the territory of the EU?"
"That is the subject of the report that Parliament should produce, and ensure that it is given a broad political basis."
". (IT) Only the Radical Party has, since the beginning of the 1960s, placed the fight against abuse of truth and information, at every legal and political level of large-scale non-violent campaigns and successful referendum initiatives."
"Silvio Berlusconi and his enterprises are certainly responsible for choosing, since the 1990s, to turn his media empire of humble origins into an instrument not unlike RAI TV to boost his declining political career."
"His attempt only succeeded in part and his greatest media representatives 'moderate' and support large demonstrations, both electoral and non-electoral, of his political enemies."
"This is typical of the Italian situation, of this 'Italian case'."
"Silvio Berlusconi is someone who, if anything, continues rather than opposing or reforming, as he promised to do in his electoral campaign."
"As a result, the Radical Members abstained in the vote that 'deplores...a situation is continuing in which media power is concentrated in the hands of the Prime Minister' of the Italian Republic."
"I am afraid that we may well now be facing savage power struggles which could go 'to the death', struggles within systems which are not only political but economic and, quite literally, criminal too."
". I welcome the Sylla Report on fundamental rights and in particular its conclusions about the treatment of asylum-seekers and their children."
"The report is correct to be critical of the UK's record on this and my knowledge of the Dungavel detention centre in my constituency of Scotland illustrates the UK Government's failures."
"The UK Government is failing to protect the rights of asylum-seekers' children by holding them for prolonged periods in the Dungavel centre and the devolved Scottish Government, which is responsible for the provision of education in Scotland, has failed to ensure that they are given access to mainstream education while resident in our country."
"The Scottish people have been appalled to learn about the long-term detention and lack of educational facilities for families like Yurdigal Ay and her children who were deported to Germany earlier this summer having spent a year at Dungavel."
"The UK Government's record on asylum-seekers and their children at Dungavel is a disgrace and I trust that the Sylla report will be heeded by UK ministers and that steps are taken to ensure that the fundamental rights of refugees at Dungavel and throughout the UK are not infringed."
". (EL) The European PASOK group decided to vote against the entire motion, considering that the positions on the ban on women entering Mount Athos, conscientious objectors and the right of Muslims to mosques and cemeteries are unjust, unacceptable and, at the very least, demonstrate ignorance for the following reasons:"
"1."
"Mount Athos enjoys special status, which was secured in Joint Declaration No 4 on Mount Athos in Greece's Accession Act to the EEC."
"2."
"The Annex to the Final Deed of the Treaty of Amsterdam contains a declaration recalling the Joint Declaration on Mount Athos attached to the Final Deed of the Accession Act of Greece to the European Communities."
"3."
"Greek legislation on proselytism was found to be in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights."
"As far as Muslim mosques are concerned, it is a known fact that there are currently 350 mosques and 250 Muslim cemeteries, while the procedure to found an Islamic centre and mosques in Paiania in Attica is advancing."
"4."
"Article 18 of law 2936/2001 makes provision for a reduction in unarmed or civilian service for recognised conscientious objectors, who will complete reduced armed service."
". (EL) 11 September provided an opportunity to speed up measures to apply the most anti-grass roots choices of the monopolies."
"It was followed by a sweeping charge against human rights and personal freedoms in the ?U. Workers' rights and the right to a free state education and health service were cut back even further."
"The standard of living of the working classes has fallen."
"A typical example is that over fourteen thousand people died from the heatwave in the France of ? respect for human rights."
"The reactionary legal arsenal is being reinforced with new provisions."
"Political parties, such as the Communist Party, are being prevented from operating freely and unimpeded, especially in the countries under enlargement."
"Violation of the freedom of expression is being accompanied by violation of the right of assembly with the ban on and the prevention of the participation of citizens and the bloody suppression of strikes and demonstrations."
"In the name of the fight against terrorism, electronic records on citizens under the Schengen system prevail, personal data are being channelled to the USA, mass 'repatriation' of immigrants is multiplying."
"Europe has appointed itself as the sheriff of the USA, especially after the signing of the agreement on cooperation in criminal matters and extraditions to the USA, where there is capital punishment and Guantanamo."
"This report however, will not go unanswered."
"The workers are opposed to this policy and are fighting to overturn it and for real respect for human rights."
". (NL) It is easy to reach agreement across the political spectrum when it comes to denouncing terrorism and trafficking in human beings."
"It is somewhat less easy when criticism is aimed at obsolete and over-full prisons, power concentrations in the media, the infringement of privacy and discrimination against homosexuals, immigrants or people with a disability."
"Major differences of opinion, however, remain about the ambition to ban political groupings on account of 'extremism' or 'separatism'."
"In the future Member State of Latvia, people who had failed to resign their membership of the then governing Communist Party eight months prior to independence were denied any political rights."
"In the Basque country in Spain, a newspaper and a popular political party are banned, and the results of elections are heavily doctored because the excluded political grouping cannot in any way put forward candidates."
"In Turkey, a potential future Member State, it is a matter of course that organisations and publications are banned, opponents end up in prison and regions are destroyed in order to be able to control them more efficiently."
"We notice attempts are being made everywhere to adapt the electoral systems in such a way that there is only room left for the two largest political groupings, to the more or less total exclusion of all others from the work of parliaments."
"It is unwise to leave to their own devices large groups of people who do not have any prospects, are outside parliamentarian democracy, and who become susceptible to violent alternatives."
". The British Labour Members have voted in favour of the Sylla report, which serves a valuable purpose."
"All Member States must be strong and confident enough to accept criticism."
"This does not automatically mean that every criticism should be accepted as valid."
"We reject the rapporteur's assertion that the detention powers in the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 are being used improperly."
"Where we are dealing with potential threats to national security exceptional measures are sometimes necessary."
"Tough safeguards ensure that these detention powers are not abused."
"The decision to detain individuals is made on the basis of detailed and compelling evidence."
"Only 15 Foreign Nationals have so far been detained under this Act."
"Detainees are free to leave the UK at any time to return to their country of origin, and have a right of appeal against the decision."
"The UK Government agrees that the detention of the children of asylum seekers should be avoided and is seeking workable solutions to prevent this situation."
"As regards the right to a fair trial, the vast majority of decided ECHR cases concern events occurring prior to the enactment of the Human Rights Act."
"Individuals are now able to enforce their ECHR rights directly in UK courts."
"(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (FR) Among the numerous annual reports adopted by the Parliament, there are many that are of genuine interest."
"This is not, however, the case with this infamous report on fundamental rights in the Union, which, far from serving the European cause, emphasises the worst in community federalism."
"The reasoning behind such a report is in itself rather strange since, for the Parliament, it consists in denouncing alleged attacks on fundamental rights, attacks supposedly committed by the Member States of the European Union."
"In fact, it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that anyone consulting this indigestible document would inevitably have the impression that the European Union, made up of what are as good as banana republics, has become an area of lawlessness. Overcrowding in prisons, attacks on the freedom of conscience, discrimination against minorities, (economic) control of the media, an increase in the number of racist acts, restrictive migratory policies, etc.: no Member State is spared and, in fact, it is the whole of the European Union that appears to be an area where freedoms are killed off."
"Clearly, all this is but fantasy."
"It remains, nonetheless, that, controlled by powerful lobbies agitating for human rights; the Parliament would make a fool of itself by adopting this report."
". (PT) The tone of my speech in yesterday's plenary did not leave much room for doubt that I would vote against this report today."
"Indeed, apart from anything else, the ideological slant of the Sylla report makes it unbalanced and partial in terms of fundamental rights."
"Notwithstanding, there was one important argument which I could not put forward yesterday due to the scant speaking time available to me."
"It relates to the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which the rapporteur claimed was the central principle of his report, is aimed at the institutions and agencies of the Union, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and also at the Member States. The charter only applies to the latter however, when they are implementing Union law, as Article 51 makes clear."
"We would therefore have liked - though this was not the approach favoured by the rapporteur - to see this report aimed directly and primarily at the institutions and agencies of the Union. In other words, we wanted an appraisal of those actions of the Council, the Commission and Parliament itself which had an impact on fundamental rights in the EU, and which decided or implemented policies affecting those rights."
"As we have seen, that was not what transpired."
". (PT) The rapporteur steered a straight course towards this one-sided and partisan assessment of the situation as regards human rights, choosing to ignore the common interest and the institutional assessment which should guide work in this area."
"He has fostered an alliance of isolated, minority claims, on the pretext, as convenient as it is vague, of combating 'discrimination'."
"The multifarious libels with which he besmirches the Member States lack any kind of foundation in truth, and are at one with the over-inflated verbiage spouted by organisations of doubtful credibility, engaged in the messianic task of replacing the current social model with a different one."
"We are looking at a castle which has been razed in the interests of the widespread obsession with elevating political correctness to the status of a science."
"This annual report has been hijacked in order to trumpet causes which unite no social consensus, which contradict and assail eternal principles and values with deep roots in Western civilisation. That means that its presentation and the debate on it have become an exercise in propaganda, a mere glossing and recapitulation ad nauseam of a sort of template of irresponsible ideas, devoid of the dignity and reflection demanded by the seriousness of this subject."
"This is a deplorable annual ritual which the European Parliament will have to abandon some day if it wants to retain a minimum level of integrity and responsibility."
"I could do nothing other than vote against this report."
". (FR) This explanation of vote relates to Article 15, referring to the question of decriminalising active euthanasia."
"Given that the annual report on fundamental rights in the EU plays a part in monitoring adherence to the Charter, the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote against this article."
"It follows that there is no objective reason why the question of decriminalising active euthanasia should appear in this report."
"Mr President, I voted against Amendment No 5 to the Lannoye report because of assurances given by the Commission that it was not factually correct and that it had not asked developing countries for binding commitments in relation to privatising their water industry."
"Developing countries should be free - as we are - to choose whether or not they have privatised or public utilities to provide their water services."
"I hope the Commission is making sure that remains the case and is not asking for such binding commitments."
". (FR) The issue of water services will not be raised at the WTO meeting in Cancun."
"This is unfortunate."
"The Lannoye report dissects the Commission proposal, which, in particular, aims to create a European Water Fund for ACP countries."
"These countries, we must remember, are key commercial partners."
"They are equally affected by a cruel lack of access to drinking water and purification services."
"Now, access to water is a right, as is the ability of the inhabitants of the rural areas of our Member States to have access to basic public services such as post offices, education and clinics."
"This is why access to water should remain a public service and not be managed on a strictly commercial basis."
"The 1980s saw the failure of IMF and World Bank subsidies policies."
"Only the countries that privatised their water and electricity distribution networks benefited from aid from international institutions."
"The Commission is preparing to make the same management mistake with the European Water Fund."
"I support the Lannoye report in its critical diagnosis of the Commission's programme."
"(FR) I voted in favour of the Lannoye report on water management in developing countries because it rightly emphasises the urgency of the problem: today, out of six billion people, 1.7 million do not have access to drinking water, and 30 000 die every day as a result."
"The Johannesburg Conference fixed the objective of halving the number of people without access to drinking water by 2015, and it is imperative that Europe cooperates to realise this aim."
"This is why we are particularly in favour of the establishment of a European Water Fund for the ACP countries in general and the African countries in particular."
"Decisions on which projects are to be helped by this fund should be taken, not from above, but by the national authorities, jointly with the peoples concerned."
"Priority should be given to a management model based on a public-private partnership, in which the public sector fixes the general framework for action of the private sector, as well as its objectives."
"The Lannoye Report, however, remains suspicious of the action of private enterprises."
"I believe the opposite, that privatising water management, even on the smallest scale, would allow more rational management if it is well utilised."
". (FR) In abstaining, we have finally refused to vote in favour of this report because of the adoption, at the time of the vote, of an amendment, Amendment No 15 from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which is favourable towards the private interests of large water operators."
". (FR) The summer heatwave and the thousands of deaths it caused confirmed one thing in Europe and the developing countries, something of which the 30 000 people who die each day of illness linked to a lack of drinking water remind us: water is the most crucial problem threatening humanity."
"Climate change will make this situation worse."
"It is therefore urgently necessary that mass action plans are drawn up, targeted and financed."
"Mr Lannoye and the Committee on Development and Cooperation have given us some minimal proposals, which we must quickly implement."
". (PT) Access to water is essential for life, health, food, well-being and development."
"Water should not therefore be considered simply as a good, but as a public asset."
"It is particularly shocking that 1.7 million people have no access to drinking water, causing 30 000 deaths per day through related diseases."
"While the shortage of drinking water in developing countries has worsened, however, the privatisation of water utilities continues apace, particularly as a result of the conditions for receiving loans imposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and structural adjustment programmes which weaken public services and induce under-investment in this sector."
"The liberalisation or privatisation of water utilities has helped deprive poor communities of access to water and has driven prices up. A serious assessment of the socio-economic and environmental effects of liberalisation is therefore needed, as are guarantees that Articles VI and XXI of the General Agreement on Trade in Services will be revised, in order to protect the right of each developing country to decide freely on its method of water supply."
"The establishment of a European Water Fund is a good initiative in principle, as long as it supports the water policy of the beneficiary countries by ensuring public ownership and management so that, as a result, everyone will have access to water, without discrimination."
". (FR) The draft resolution presented by Mr Lannoye is a very complete response to the scandal of the drinking water shortages experienced by hundreds of millions of people in developing countries."
"It questions the responsibility of large international organisations that dismantled public services, leading to this situation."
"It has, however, found a majority in this House by getting rid of some of the content of the resolution through amendments that refuse to point the finger and, therefore, beyond good feeling, has used its influence to push for a real improvement in the standard of living of those affected."
"The adoption of Amendment No 15 which 'stresses that the key issue is not whether water provision is organised by a public or private entity but rather the specific obligations provided by the policy framework; considers that it is up to the public authorities in developing countries to define the legal framework for regulating the work of private operators', changes the essence of the report."
"It is the commercialisation of this common good that is at the root of these inequalities of access, of the shortage and excessive cost in developed countries as in developing countries."
"The adoption of this meant that I was obliged to abstain in the final vote."
". (PT) More than 2.5 billion people in developing countries have no drinking water, and 3 million die every year from water-borne diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, hepatitis, malaria, trachoma, fluorosis, and Japanese encephalitis."
"We must ensure that the water objectives of Monterrey and Johannesburg (a 50% reduction in the number of people without access to drinking water and sanitation by 2015) are implemented as soon as possible. It is just as crucial, however, to encourage the EU water initiative launched at Johannesburg, costing EUR 700 million."
"Finally, I welcome the proposal for the establishment of a European Water Fund to help the ACP states."
". (EL) In principle we agree with the rapporteur's finding that drinking water should be a social resource, accessible to all, and not a commodity subject to speculation."
"We disagree, however, with proposals that recognise a positive role in water management for the private sector, be it in the form of mixed management by the public and private sectors or with the state defining a legal and institutional framework within which private agencies operate in the water sector."
"Our disagreement is based on the fact that, irrespective of intentions, legal and institutional frameworks and restrictive mechanisms, the private sector is being activated on the basis of the profit criterion, automatically converting a social resource into a commodity with all that implies, especially for poor nations."
"We would stress that, as with the food problem, the problem of drinking water is primarily political and secondarily technocratic."
"That is why radical social changes are needed in order to deal with it effectively."
"The failings of the various programmes applied within the framework of the current system, which in certain cases have exacerbated rather than mitigated the problem, confirm our reading and anticipate the impasses and the exacerbation of the problem which will be caused by the application of the terms and conditions being set by the International Monetary Fund for funding similar activities in developing countries."
"(FR) Although access to water was recently declared a human right, the number of people in the world without drinking water today stands at 1.7 million, a figure whose increase has been uninterrupted in recent years."
"We need to recognise the causes of the lack of drinking water and fight them: whether it be high productivity and intensive farming, economies directed towards growing crops for export, which often compromise the development of the local economy or the liberalisation of public services in the water sector, a condition often imposed by the World Bank or the IMF on countries in the South to benefit from loans."
"The costs of water services have also become inaccessible for the poorest people."
"To remedy these discrepancies, we want new patterns of production and consumption to be implemented, in the North as in the South, based on long-term water management."
"We want to advance environmental farming and new irrigation systems."
"In light of the tragedy that people have gone through and the totally insufficient responses given to date, the establishment of a European Water Fund for the ACP countries is a good initiative."
"Access to drinking water and purification services needs to be determined by national authorities with the involvement, through associations and civil society movements, of those people affected."
". (PT) To quote the rapporteur, who is a member of my own political group, if we want fairer trade, contributing to sustainable development and to the fight against poverty, concrete measures must be introduced at the forthcoming WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun to take account of developing countries' requirements as regards world trade."
"The insufficient production capacity of developing countries and their continuing dependence on primary and low-value-added products must be combated, in order to ensure the diversification of production and technology transfers."
"The problem of suffocating debts must be addressed, the aim being to cancel such debts. Dumping in agricultural trade must be abolished, the principle of agricultural self-sufficiency promoted, development assistance increased up to the agreed 0.7% of GNP, and the right of access to medicines protected."
"Just as important, however, is the need to safeguard public services, in particular by banning the liberalisation of such services."
"It must be borne in mind that the liberalisation of world trade has led to a deepening of the divide between rich and poor countries, and a reduction in participation by the latter in world trade."
"The injustices of world trade are the fruit of the development and global expansion of the capitalist system itself."
". (FR) The Morgantini report rejects the logic of the Commission Communication 'assisting developing countries in benefiting from international trade'."
"Indeed, the Commission advocates the liberalisation of services, aid to the private sector and an increase in trade meant to help the development of less well-advanced countries."
"We know now that these 'recipes' of a capitalist economic system daily increase the shocking gap between the revenue of rich countries and that of poor countries!"
"On the eve of the Cancun Summit, whose objective is to increase world trade, we support the proposals aiming to cancel out debt, to establish fair trade regulations, to remove from a commercial sphere a response to the needs of the people, to limit the incentives for rich countries to export farming production."
"We have, therefore, voted in favour of this report, even though we believe that the WTO, the rich countries' instrument to dominate others, should not be democratised but removed."
". (PT) Given the indicators of developing countries' social and environmental unsustainability, the impartial Economist acknowledged a year ago that it would be impossible for living conditions in the southern hemisphere to improve unless the northern hemisphere relinquished a small part of its wealth."
"If we want to be credible partners in the eyes of developing countries, therefore, and if we want to bridge the shocking gulf between living conditions in the two hemispheres, both the EU and the United States must, above and beyond attaining the Monterrey and Johannesburg objectives, take advantage of the next round of WTO negotiations, due to take place in Cancun, to move towards the abolition of trade barriers and the gradual removal of agricultural and energy subsidies."
". (PT) Although the rapporteur was able to propose several interesting and valuable strategies in response to the challenge of 'assisting developing countries to benefit from trade', I felt obliged to abstain from voting."
"The observation that the key to development lies in liberalising trade should, rather than earning enthusiastic applause or violent condemnation (both of which lead only to ideological squabbles with short-term effects), be nothing more than a point of departure and a frame of reference."
"Given this inescapable truth, therefore, the best approach is to link certain obligations into trading relationships maintained with developing countries."
"In other words, it is better to impose conditions on aid offered by the EU and/or its Member States to those economic agents who, by acquiring raw materials or by selling goods and services, establish trading relationships with developing countries. These conditions would involve providing instant attendant benefits, which might consist, in practical terms, of obligatory technology transfers, building local capacity, providing medicines, building basic infrastructure, providing services to help reduce the costs of managing debts, and the like."
"History tells us that attempting to change the 'economic' climate by imposing legislative restrictions has little effect."
". (PT) The figures on the situation as regards health in developing countries are tragically eloquent."
"This emergency situation requires rapid, robust, supportive and effective European action."
"This should ensure, firstly, that the most highly-developed countries increase their contributions in order to comply fully with the commitments made at the Monterrey Summit (the Millennium Summit) and the Johannesburg Summit (the Sustainable Development Summit)."
"Secondly, it should raise standards of effectiveness and transparency of aid through a strategy which respects precise goals and timetables; is monitored and evaluated; ensures that the programmes and goods made available are comprehensively and continuously distributed; promotes the use of local human resources, thus avoiding heavy reliance on foreign technical assistance and developing local capacity."
"Thirdly, it should send clear messages to the markets, both by means of European legislation and through strategies implemented within the World Trade Organisation, to the effect that, in the long term, ever-increasing quantities of medicines must urgently be made available at affordable prices in developing countries."
"Fourthly, it is time to extend the debt relief initiative to more countries."
". (PT) This report makes clear the relationship between poverty and disease, disease and poverty."
"The health statistics for developing countries are horrifying: 28 000 children under five die every day, 2 million people die of tuberculosis each year, a million die of malaria, and so on."
"I support the proposal for greater health investment in developing countries and effective monitoring of the results. The effectiveness of that investment should be maximised through a simultaneous strategy of good resource distribution."
"I would also highlight the pressing need for a more productive debate on the question of access to medicines for communities in developing countries, since the scale of the disaster demands more creative, bold and determined responses."
"I therefore agreed with most of this report. I abstained from the overall final vote, however, as I deplored the rapporteur's failure to resist the temptation to include in the final resolution a paragraph written in that coded, ideological language which, like that of other reports produced by this Parliament, aims simply to enlist EU development policy in the international pro-abortion movement."
". (PT) I voted for this report, which advocates, in general terms, a 'reinforced culture of consultation and dialogue' with Non-State Actors (NSAs) as a means of increasing the effectiveness of European Union development policy."
"Interaction between the different actors - local, institutional and others, such as civil society - is indeed increasingly important, at national and international levels. It is one way of obtaining the answer which is still urgently needed if we are to help the world's least-favoured regions."
"Having made this general observation, I must nevertheless point out, in relation to the rapporteur's comments on the ever-greater cuts in Community assistance to various NGOs, that the participation of non-state actors is not in itself a guarantee that development policies will be effective."
"We must encourage greater participation and involvement on the part of actors who neither support ideological or programmatic campaigns nor promote their own agendas, but rather are truly generous, disinterested and altruistic in their aims, and whose actions consequently bear the most real and tangible fruit on the ground."
"It behoves us, then, to put a premium on the 'quality' rather than on the quantity of participation."
"(PT) I share the rapporteur's conviction that the goals set out at the Lisbon Summit will not be attained without granting due importance to the role played by audiovisual communications media. Care must also be taken to consider the state of today's technology, since it allows television content to be disseminated using different technological platforms, and therefore requires the relevant legislation to be adapted and updated."
"The decision to adopt a flexible approach to regulation and set minimum regulatory standards for the sector is equally pertinent and correct, in my opinion."
"I share the rapporteur's concerns about the concentration of ownership and control of television broadcasting, since I see these developments as a challenge to pluralism and cultural diversity."
"I take particular exception, however, to the establishment of a Pan-European Children's Network."
"I feel that the task of 'welcoming' our youngest viewers into the audiovisual world should be left to national channels."
"I do not believe that a 'European consciousness' can be created by suppressing national languages and identities and indoctrinating babes-in-arms with artificial 'European' values. The European Union should resist the temptation to 'mould' the loyalties and characters of the citizens of the Member States."
"Despite this, I feel that this report as a whole is positive."
"I voted in favour."
". (FR) We have not voted in favour of this report, because we do not want to support capital investors, whether in the cultural sector or in other sectors."
"Besides, they are often the same: a good many capitalists, who are profiting from investing in private television, in the cinema or in publishing, profit the most from public works, the monopoly of water distribution, even from manufacturing weapons."
"What we want, on the contrary, is to protect those, thanks to whom this 'cultural industry' works."
"As a result we give our complete support to those employed in the entertainment industry without steady employment who have been fighting for many months to defend their living conditions."
"The French Government, which makes such a big case of the 'cultural exception', is not making an exception for workers in the entertainment sector: on the direct recommendations of the major employers, it has just launched an attack on their social protection, as it prepares to launch further attacks on the social security of all employees."
"(PT) This report contains positive elements which deserve to be supported, such as the proposal to reinforce Community initiatives in support of culture, the concern to promote cultural diversity, reading, publishing and protection of copyright, and support for those SMEs active in the field of culture. It also, however, has negative aspects."
"Most importantly, it should be said that the report subordinates culture to the market in general, and to the rules of the European Union internal market in particular. It privileges the commercial dimension of culture, and competition in the context of so-called 'globalisation'."
"This report is characterised by various ambiguities, and does not clearly indicate or suggest any actual proposals or measures, such as defending or promoting public national systems to fund and support the production and dissemination of culture, aimed at protecting our cultural heritage and cultural production from subordination to the laws of the market, to the logic of commercial gain and to the promotion of mass- and consumer-orientated cultural models."
". (FR) Great prudence should always be shown each time that the EU intends to vest itself with a new area of competence."
"This is precisely the case with this report, which aims to strengthen cooperation between European cultural industries."
"In principle, this objective does not raise any major objections."
"It is worth, however, expressing strong reservations on certain points contained in this document."
"In a document in which everything or almost everything could be considered 'cultural', there is no clear definition of the idea of cultural works, something that opens the door to much abuse."
"It is also necessary to emphasise the danger of exploiting culture for European propaganda purposes and, in fine, the possible challenge to national cultural identity (which means exactly the definition of culture as an 'essential and unifying element (?) of the citizens of Europe'?)."
"Finally, what about the risk of misappropriation of public funds for projects with no real cultural or popular interest - money from European taxpayers cannot be used to subsidise elitist productions, destined for a 'privileged' minority."
"For all of these reasons, I will not vote in favour of this report."
". (PT) I agree with the rapporteur's observations that 'Europe's cultural industries reflect its national diversity and thus represent an added value to European identity' and that 'culture is an essential element of European integration', contributing to mutual understanding between Member States and their people, which is essential and desirable."
"I agree with the contention that SMEs are privileged media for disseminating culture, deserving the support of both Member States and European institutions."
"Given the very great number of cultural agents, I doubt whether the existence of an overall EU strategy, or of any policy deriving from such a strategy and all-embracing enough to implement it, would be beneficial or feasible in this field."
"In the same way, I feel it is acceptable to protect and promote some aspects of a country's cultural production at national level, to avoid the risk of concentration, criticised in other areas of economic and social life, from spreading to the sphere of culture."
"This may confront us, under the pretext of challenging US hegemony in this area, with the prospect of cultural industries in countries possessing greater means and larger markets wielding an undesirable degree of control. That would jeopardise the very diversity we want to maintain and encourage."
"While I understand the rapporteur's intentions and support many of the proposals she suggests, I was unable to vote in favour of this report, and therefore abstained."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the Commission's statement on the application of the EU-Israel Association Agreement."
". Mr President, the European Union policy towards Israel lies in partnership and cooperation."
"It aims to contribute to a resolution of the ongoing conflict, along with other international partners, and in close collaboration with the parties involved."
"The Commission is aware of the difficult circumstances in which the business communities are currently working in the Middle East region."
"At the same time, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaty, is responsible for guaranteeing the full and correct application of Community law, including international agreements concluded by the Community and therefore the implementation of the EU-Israel Association Agreement."
"I can confirm then that in applying the EU-Israel Association Agreement, the EU relies on international law for the territorial definition of the State of Israel, thus excluding the territories under Israeli administration since 1967 in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights."
"Therefore, products originating in these areas are not entitled to benefit from preferential treatment under the EU-Israel Association Agreement."
"Following confirmation from Israel that its customs authorities certified goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, the Commission published a notice to the importers in the Official Journal of the European Union in November 2001, in order to inform them of the situation."
"According to the provisions of the bilateral agreement, it is the responsibility of the customs administrations of the EU Member States to check the origin of goods with the Israeli authorities through the post-verification procedure."
"It is also their responsibility to take the necessary precautions where a customs debt is due."
"It is in this context that the recovery of duties is now undertaken by the customs administrations of the Member States."
"These measures, initiated by the Commission, aim to protect the financial and legal interests of the Community."
"At the same time, I can only reiterate that the Commission has always declared its willingness to cooperate and examine any technical proposal from the Israeli authorities to find a solution for this issue which would respect the terms of the Association Agreement."
"In other words, one can conclude that the Commission has taken the necessary measures to ensure correct application of Community law."
"As a result, Member States are imposing duties on products from the settlements."
"We keep this regularly under review with Member States' customs authorities and we are also continuing to talk to Israel about technical issues related to customs certificates."
"Mr President, it is a very sensitive time to be discussing an issue like this."
"Firstly, let me put on record my total abhorrence of the terrorist incidents that have happened all too often in the Middle East."
"Not only do I condemn the actions of suicide bombers, I also condemn the actions of the security services of the Israeli state when they act outside international law, making the resolution of that problem even more intractable."
"However, some people may feel that this issue should not have been raised because it could complicate the peace process."
"Those of us who have taken the initiative on this particular issue believe that, unfortunately, such an approach has resulted in insufficient action on the part of the Commission and Member States."
"The Commissioner himself has already outlined the important issues at stake."
"No one summed up the implications better than Commissioner Patten himself in a debate in this House in May 2001."
"It is important to put it on record again, and I quote him: 'The European Union's position on settlements is clear: all settlement activities in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and on the Golan Heights are illegal, under international law, and constitute a major obstacle to peace."
"The Commission communication (of 1998) made it clear that preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights 'contravenes agreed rules of origin since these territories do not form part of the State of Israel under public international law'.'"
"That says it in a nutshell."
"I listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said."
"The impression we get is very different from what he said in this House today."
"One does not get the impression that this issue has been pursued vigorously enough by the Commission as a whole nor, indeed, by Member States."
"It must be said with regard to Israel that at the moment at best it is not being as cooperative as it could be in providing full details on the origin of all products and their component parts to customs authorities."
"At worst, it could be said that Israel is defying its trade agreement with the EU."
"Given the clarity of the comments initially made by Commissioner Patten, to some extent echoed today, we need to have more assurances that Member States are taking sufficient action."
"Therefore, while I welcome what the Commissioner has said, I remain unconvinced that this issue has been enforced at a Member-State level in the way that it should be."
"Mr President, the cavalier attitude the Israeli authorities display towards their obligations to comply with international law with regard to their trade relations with European Union is an indicative example of its attitude to international law in general."
"The fact that the European Union is so weak in exerting its pressure on Israel to comply with international law is reflected in the fact that new agreements have been made with Israel in recent times."
"I would like to touch on those."
"I have enormous respect for the efforts of Mr Solana, on behalf of the European Union, to reduce tension and to encourage a process of peace negotiations, but the European Union is undermining his efforts, in my view, by failing to demonstrate its determination to Israel that agreements made to Israel's commercial and trade advantage must be fully complied with or will be terminated."
"I have no doubt that the current EU-Israel Association Agreement should be suspended."
"The actions of the Israeli Government that deny the Palestinians their human rights are in breach of that Association Agreement."
"Despite repeated calls by myself and others to have a full review of Israel's compliance with human rights provisions, nothing tangible has been done, to my knowledge."
"Several months ago the Community agreed with Israel to expand its preferential import quotas on a number of agricultural products that are largely or mainly produced in its illegal settlements, and these are for export to Community markets."
"The Community took this measure without requiring that Israel stop violating its agreement by issuing proofs of origin for settlement products."
"This is not the way to defend or preserve the Community's legal right to require the correct implementation of the agreement by Israel."
"The Commission is now saying that it will not be possible to include Israel in the pan-European cumulation agreement, while Israel continues to misapply the origin rules protocol in its existing agreement."
"The Community's political will to maintain this position is not convincing to Israel and certainly not convincing to me and many others in this House, while it fails to ensure the correct implementation of the existing agreement."
"It is my view that the current crisis in the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is such that the European Union has to exert the greatest possible pressure on the Israeli Government."
"In the economic sphere two things need to happen: steps to suspend the Association Agreement need to be initiated on the basis of breaches of human rights obligations contained in the Association Agreement; and legal steps should be initiated to recover duties due because Israel has misrepresented the origin of its exports."
"Both these steps require the political will of a united Commission."
"I am not convinced that the Commission is united on this matter and the consent of the Member States is needed."
"I call upon the Irish Government to make this a priority for its presidency of the European Union."
"I should like to emphasise that in making these comments I acknowledge that the responsibility to make peace is shared with the Palestinian leadership."
"It must ensure that all possible steps are taken to end the vicious suicide bombings that have caused so much Israeli anguish and hardship and have hardened attitudes behind an irresponsible Israeli Government."
"Likewise the United States must exercise its enormous influence on Israel to cease its assassinations and abuses of human rights in the occupied territories."
"I should like to address two points made by the Commissioner."
"He said that Member States are applying duties on settlement goods."
"My understanding is that only happens in a small number of cases where Israel has actually declared these goods to be settlement goods, and it does so only to relieve the pressure of the Commission and this House on them in relation to this matter."
"Regarding the post-delivery verification system, once Israel declares where the goods come from, there is no way that a Member State can legally challenge that verification."
"I would like the Commissioner to address those two issues."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group suspects that the government of Israel is applying the origin rules of the Association Agreement in a way that derives from its settlement policies."
"No other explanation can justify the proofs of origin being issued to both manufactured and agricultural products - produced in settlements - which we consider illegal and therefore not covered by the agreement. These include chives, non-woven textiles, wine, snack foods and so on."
"Although they are given customs access by the EU, they are actually produced in West Bank settlements such as Barkan, the Golan Heights settlement of Katzrin and the Gaza Strip settlement of Gush Katif."
"This is not a new issue."
"We know that the Member States are unable to reliably distinguish which consignments are eligible and which are not."
"We know that the Commission has compiled a list of settlement products and exporters, and is trying to expand the list."
"We know the list is incomplete and that Member States have not found it possible to identify, when shipments are presented for clearance, what products they contain."
"The situation cannot continue for two reasons."
"Firstly, Liberals attach great importance to rules; here we are seeing a consistent, persistent breaking of the rules."
"We recognise there are difficulties."
"The Commission and the Member States bear separate and full responsibility for this, since they both have obligations to act to solve the problem."
"It may be that those in the Commission who want to discharge their guardianship responsibility have insufficient political support within the Commission."
"The Member States that want to help have insufficient support in the Council."
"That is why this Parliament and the Member State parliaments need to act."
"Above all, it is the duty of the government of Israel not to play tricks with a signed agreement."
"Israel should understand that this is not the time to do that."
"Unless they respect the clauses of the Association Agreement, the Israelis will have difficulty in convincing the rest of the world that they are acting in good faith in issues such as the peace process as a whole."
"Mr President, my colleagues have already made many of the points that I wanted to raise in an extremely clear and precise way, and so I will not repeat them."
"I would, therefore, just like to ask myself - and you - some questions."
"I wonder, firstly, whether the European Union's efforts to pursue political dialogue and the participation of the quartet will be strengthened or weakened by the genuine reluctance on the part of the Commission to ensure that the protocol on origin rules and the territorial clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement are enforced correctly."
"I am raising this point as I believe that it is fundamental."
"We have been debating this issue for years and there is no doubt that progress has been made, yet we are, once again, facing a blatant violation of this agreement."
"There are enormous obstacles to the peace process which, in my opinion, are due, firstly, to the policy of the Israeli Government, which is continuing with its settlements, following a policy of annexation and erecting walls."
"These obstacles are also, however, the result of the increasing violations of fundamental principles and the rules of international humanitarian law in Israel and Palestine."
"I believe that we should not give aid that allows agreements concluded not to be enforced."
"I would also like to consider the reasons why Israel is violating the agreement, Article 2 of which calls upon Israel, and us, to respect it."
"We are responsible for ensuring that, on the basis of the agreement, our relations are founded on the respect for human rights and not on the violation of international humanitarian law."
"I believe that a politically appropriate, measured response from the Union to Israel's persistence in issuing certificates of origin for products from the settlements should ensure that no product can continue to be given preferential treatment as an import into the European Union."
"If we give due weight to the statements of the Commission regarding preferential treatment of products imported from the settlements, then we see that Israel's practice of issuing certificates of origin for these products is considered by the Commission to be a violation of the agreement."
"Nevertheless, this practice still continues."
"The agreement - the Commission has said so too - is not being enforced resolutely."
"I would like this issue of relations and legality to be addressed, because we need to end the situation of 'anything goes' that exists in Palestine and Israel."
"Israel needs to learn to enforce the agreements that it signs."
"Mr President, as deputy chairman of the delegation to Israel, I set great store by the European Union's desire to remain on good terms with that country, but if the friendship is put at risk by non-compliance with important international rules, I wonder what will become of the trust between us."
"In the past, the Commission has communicated on a number of occasions that the European Union does not accept Israel's illegal occupation policy."
"The Commission has also taken every opportunity to denounce the illegal application of the Association Agreement."
"A number of weeks ago, we received a response from Commissioner Patten to the effect that 'the Member States have informed the Commission that in a number of cases, import duties have been levied on goods that originated from the settlements and were imported with Israeli proofs of origin.'"
"This illegal and incorrect practice nevertheless remains in place."
"This is unacceptable."
"The Association Agreement with Israel has been drafted and must be observed with due regard to international law and to fundamental values."
"If you make sound agreements, you make your friends, provided these agreements are observed correctly."
"Mr President, at the beginning of this week, Monday in fact, the Dutch Foreign Minister gave his response to nine parliamentary questions about the possible irregular application of the trade agreements between the EC and Israel."
"In his balanced and lucid reaction, I read that for most of the products that carry Israeli proof of origin, the Netherlands can assume that the conclusions by Israeli customs regarding their origin have been reached in a lawful manner."
"This means that they meet all the conditions of the origin rules protocol."
"Commissioner, do you subscribe to this conclusion for the other EU Member States too?"
"Also, Mr President, Article 79 of the Association Agreement between the EC and Israel stipulates that in the event of possible non-compliance with this Agreement by one of the parties involved, both are required, via the Association Council, to reach a mutually acceptable solution."
"I trust that the Commission will make every effort to reach a compromise with regard to the interpretation of the origin rules protocol."
"Thank you, Mr President. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly explain that I am one of the signatories of this question;"
"I did so as a democratic service for Mrs Sandbaek who asked me to do so."
"I do not agree with the opinion of the majority of the speakers but this question has been around for a long time in this House and it was important to clear the air and see clearly in this history of enforcement."
"Indeed, it is the question of the application of the Agreement and not of challenging it that is in the question from Mrs Morgantini and others."
"The response from the Commissioner was very precise, completed further by the important clarifications given by Mr Belder."
"The Commissioner indicated that the application came from the customs authorities of the Member States."
"Mr Belder gave a very precise example of a Member State, which considers that this Agreement is being applied."
"Furthermore, there are appeal proceedings, which is the association council."
"If you have accurate details, Mrs Morgantini, you can communicate them to the Commission, who will not fail, I am sure, to mention them for the next Association Agreement."
"The rest are words and threats, which are founded on nothing."
"I am slightly worried, Mr de Rossa, that you are using this occasion to challenge the Association Agreement with Israel, because that is not the aim of this debate at all."
"I am also astonished that you want the US to put pressure on Israel to respect human rights more, whilst you do not mention the pressure that the European Union could and should exert on the Palestinian Authority to stop the terrorist attacks."
"We all heard Mr Arafat lamenting the current situation and transferring all the blame onto Israel, forgetting once again the fatal attacks of recent weeks."
"Now we all know the role that Hamas plays."
"The European Union, just like the European Parliament, could give its support to Mr Mazen through budgetary aids or parliamentary incentives."
"Mr Mazen seems to show a genuine desire to reach a peace agreement."
"We can back him instead of continuing to back those who, like Mr Arafat, think that the terrorist attacks are part of normal policy in Palestine on its romantic road to freedom."
"What freedom?"
"That, I will leave you to imagine."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will quite openly admit that this issue rather tends to pull me in two directions at once."
"From the legal point of view, on the one hand, it is quite clear that pacta sunt servanda - treaties under international law are to be adhered to."
"We know which territory is internationally recognised as being Israel's, we know which areas are occupied; we also know that products from Israel can be imported and that produce from the areas occupied by it cannot be."
"In practice, gathering evidence is very difficult; so, in practice, is knowing where to draw the line."
"The Commission's answer has this to say on the subject: 'These principles do not apply to products which have been sufficiently processed within Israel's internationally recognized borders.'"
"Does that, then, mean in practice that oranges harvested on the West Bank are processed in Israel, the juice bottled and exported to the EU?"
"Is that what is meant by 'sufficiently processed'?"
"Or is it 'sufficiently processed' only if the juice is blended with that of apples and bananas in a mixed fruit cordial with the orange juice making up less than 50%?"
"I think this shows us how difficult it is in practice to draw a distinction, even where the proportions are concerned."
"That is why, in this context, we should ask ourselves the important question as to whom this is meant to benefit."
"Does it do the Palestinians any good when an Israeli orchard, or a factory on the West Bank, is closed down?"
"The workers there are laid off, and then the same production operation restarts in the Israeli heartland with immigrants from Russia."
"This, of course, does the Palestinians no good at all, but at least the position is clear-cut in legal terms."
"We have then maintained the legal position, but we have not necessarily helped the Palestinians."
"We should ensure that the actions of the Commission or of the European Union do not make overall relations between Israel and the Palestinians worse than they already are."
"I am therefore in favour of the Commission continuing to act in these matters with the same caution and conscientiousness that it has demonstrated so far, never losing sight of the overall framework within which relations between Israel and the Palestinians are developing."
"Mr President, last July I tabled an oral question to the Commission on renewing the scientific and technical cooperation agreement with Israel."
"In substance the reply said that the Commission believed that the development of relations with Israel would make a significant contribution to the Middle East peace process."
"You have said more or less the same thing to us today, Mr Nielson."
"Although I share the idea that knowledge and an exchange of knowledge help build a better world, in the same ways as economic cooperation, I am particularly stupefied by this answer."
"Indeed, this position completely disregards the Parliament's Resolution of April 2002, of which it is obviously right to remind you here given the general title of the debate."
"We all know that in paragraph 8 of the Resolution, Parliament asked the Council and the Commission to urgently convene the association council to give its position to the Israeli Government, by asking the latter to respect the UN resolutions, and, in this context, called for the suspension of the Association Agreement."
"Where are we, a year and a half after this demand was worded?"
"When the Agreement began in 1995, just after the process in Oslo, some regarded it as helping to build peace."
"The situation now, however, is radically different."
"What type of cooperation is the Commission talking about?"
"Partnerships can only be devised on the basis of mutual trust, and of shared rights and obligations."
"Now, the criminal attitude of the Israeli Government shows every day that it not only flouts the concerns of the Union, but also that it outbids the other in this fatal situation."
"More than a year ago now, Israel erected a wall in the West Bank allegedly for reasons of safety."
"In actual fact, it is an iron curtain that massacres the Palestinian territories and drives tens of thousands of inhabitants in their homes."
"In this way, new territories are being annexed."
"It is time to give Parliaments' Resolution tangible form."
"There are precedents."
"In 1990 the Commission enforced Parliament's recommendation that scientific cooperation be partially frozen until the Palestinian schools and universities that had been closed unilaterally by the Israeli authorities were completely reopened and remained so."
"It was at least a few months before it was possible for them to reopen."
"Today, given that the clause on the respect of fundamental rights has been brutally violated, and in the sight of the whole world, in what way is this demand for suspension excessive?"
"In what way is it excessive to ask that this law is applied and respected?"
"Finally, and I conclude Mr President, I am aware that the responsibility of the Council, shamefully absent today, is enormous."
"As, in theory, a member of the quartet, the Union has the means to carry weight. What it lacks is the political will to do so."
"Mr President, the Commissioner is right; it is up to the customs offices of Member States to check whether products come from Israel or from Israeli settlements in the occupied territories."
"However, the Commissioner also knows that once Israel has said that a product hails from Israel, there is very little customs offices can do about this, even when we know that we are being led up the garden path."
"Member States are not individually capable of enforcing what, in my view, is to be done, namely for Israel to stop labelling products which we know originate from settlements, but which are still given the label 'from Israel'."
"How difficult this is was once again demonstrated in this very Parliament when the Israeli Ambassador stated quite clearly that he challenges the EU's right to draw a distinction between products from Israel and those from the settlements."
"As long as this situation persists, I do not think it is up to the Member States, but up to the Commission, to do battle with the Israeli Government in order to force the latter into action, which Member States are not capable of doing."
"It is also up to the Commission to draw the necessary conclusions if Israel does not appear prepared to do what it is required according to EU legislation."
"Mr President, it is a fact that the definition of territoriality applied by Israel to determine the origin of its exports to the European Union is not legal."
"The Commission has publicly announced that Israel improperly issues proofs of origin to settlement products, but why has the Commission done nothing effective about it?"
"The legal settlements are the main obstacle to peace."
"At present, Member States which do not want to violate the trade agreement in giving preferential treatment to exports from such illegal settlements have only been able to recover some limited duties, mainly relying on Israel to refrain from answering verification questions."
"Why has the Commission not explicitly notified the Member States that Israel's definition of territoriality is illegal?"
"Only when that has happened can the Member States draw the logical conclusion that they have to ask for verification for all Israeli products exported to the European Union."
"Mr President, the first EC-Israel Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1975 and for 20 years the location of exported products was never questioned."
"However, now it is being used as a political instrument to bash Israel and the settlements."
"The author of the oral question has gone as far as calling for the suspension of the more recent 1995 agreement, even though the Commission has controversially agreed with her and imposed tariffs on goods allegedly exported by the settlements in the Occupied Territories."
"This is a technical dispute on trade and, although I am a friend of Israel, I support an eventual two-state solution and a dismantling of most of the settlements."
"Palestine is not yet a state competent to have its own trade agreements, which, controversially, the EU ratified in 1994."
"The Commission did this in spite of the fact that Israel had the signed agreement of the Palestinian Authority that Israel was responsible for customs matters for goods exported from the settlements."
"Nevertheless, there is also an EU-Palestine Free Trade Agreement."
"Therefore, whichever way you look at it, these goods should have EU tariff-free access as they come from territories covered by one or other free trade agreement."
"All trade agreements refer to the territory where the goods are produced, not the nationality or the religion of the producers."
"This whole dispute is now subject to a technical resolution under Article 79 of the Association Agreement, which is where it rightfully belongs."
"It should not be the subject of political manipulation within this House."
"The debate is engendering further hostility to trade with Israel and undermines Israel's faith in the impartiality of the EU as a vital component of the quartet in the quest for the Roadmap for Peace and the end of terrorism."
"I am sure that all sides of the House desire that outcome strongly."
"Mr Nielson, let me take this opportunity to remind you that on 10 April our Parliament voted on a Resolution to freeze the Association Agreement."
"Now, eighteen months later, this Resolution is still being ignored."
"Could we see this as unwavering support for the Israeli state's policy despite its violations of human rights and international law?"
"We could, for we are talking about economic, commercial agreements, about financial interests, but we also about the right to life."
"This colonial war claims more and more victims."
"Even though the roadmap made provision to colonisation to be put on ice, the Jewish colonies continue to grow and roads around them are still being built."
"In Israel the situation is tragic."
"The discrimination against some Israeli citizens is increasing; they are persecuted, denied certain rights because they are Arab Israelis."
"The Knesset enacted a law to prevent Palestinians from obtaining Israeli citizenship by marriage."
"This is a discriminatory and racist law."
"A recent report by FIDH, the International Federation for Human Rights, has revealed to us a modern form of slavery of migrant workers."
"Even Mr Abraham Burg, a former President of the Knesset, raised the alarm."
"He said that Israel is a framework of corruption, based on foundations of oppression and injustice, which reduces itself to a colonist state, headed by a clique of individuals who are without morals, are above the law and corrupt."
"In the occupied territories the situation is tragic."
"A wall of shame embodies the apartheid and injustice, and the Palestinian society is living a tragedy."
"We are not, of course, going to count the deaths."
"Who are the victims of terrorism though, of this State terrorism that assassinates refugees on a daily basis?"
"To conclude, Mr President, I will say that we cannot remain silent."
"Is it not our duty to put pressure on the Israeli Government, with all the means that we have at our disposal including economic and commercial ones?"
"Why not paralyse the Association Agreement as we courageously did before in South Africa against the apartheid?"
"Mr President, my position is rather different from some of those expressed here."
"In my opinion, this Parliamentary question is inappropriate and imprudent."
"We are in the midst of a peace process, the European Union is a member of the Quartet, and I believe that if we in the European Parliament and in the other institutions really feel solidarity with the Executive and with the figure of Mr Solana in his capacity as 'Mr Common Foreign and Security Policy', our representative, then we should support a rapprochement between the countries and not seek conflict between the parties."
"Let us not forget, furthermore, that this question implies a direct condemnation of the occupied territories."
"All of us in Parliament have done this before now: it is a commonly-accepted practice, and we also know that, in accordance with the Taba agreements on the devolution of the territories, many of those territories, which were once desert and will now be habitable, will pass into Palestinian hands."
"What worries me most is that this speech goes against the Palestinian Authority."
"Since Arafat and Abu Mazen are making constant demands for Europe to take a firmer stance in the peace process, and for that process not to remain in the hands of the United States, and if, as Mr Solana says, Europe really is one of the biggest contributors to Abu Mazen's profile, why do we not, instead of creating divisions between the parties, devote ourselves to upholding Abu Mazen and his policies, to upholding the prestige of the European Union against the other side?"
"In my opinion, it does the peace process no favours for one of the parties involved to pick a fight with one of the other negotiators."
"Why are we not asking Mr Solana and the Palestinian Authority to strengthen the administration of the latter, and helping them both to achieve that aim?"
"Why are we not demanding, and why is Europe not showing greater support for, public health and education services? That would prevent education from remaining to a large extent in the hands of a group like Hamas, which has been condemned for acts of terrorism."
"Why are we not making a real contribution to strengthening the Palestinian Authority?"
"That would be the answer."
"I would like to know what impact this question will have, since it will probably go against many Palestinian workers in the occupied territories."
"Mr President, the Commission's declaration is a confirmation of the European Union's aim to maintain peaceful and stable relations with the countries in the Middle East region."
"This is the only possible approach and does not prevent the EU from presenting its own opinions and objectives within the framework of global partnership."
"In practice these are complex situations."
"What is more important is to understand the ordinary basic mechanisms which either hamper or encourage stability, just as Mr Schuman did when he put forward his brilliant genesis of an idea for the Communities that served as a basis for the EU."
"I would in this connection like to highlight one basic mechanism that has an effect on stability and peace: a clean environment."
"Clean water, as was shown in Jordan recently, is a vital necessity, and to attain it all the countries in the West Bank region must find a solution both separately and together."
"Unfortunately, the international community is still not even aware of the environmental destruction which is a reality in the West Bank."
"Excessive water extraction, conducting untreated waste water to Jordan, and the uncontrolled dumping of community waste have led to unthinkable health risks and a shortage of water."
"The West Bank environment project is a multicultural and multilateral project which aims to solve major problems threatening the health and welfare of the inhabitants of the region."
"The project is not, however, making adequate progress."
"The reason is not low levels of finance or a lack of know-how and technology."
"The reason is chiefly that, for a project which is under way in a region occupied by three countries, there exists no political forum to agree on practical matters that are essential for its implementation, even though all the parties involved are agreed in principle on the needs and the measures to be taken."
"One may without exaggeration say that the EU is at present the only player in the world that could offer a political forum for attempts like the West Bank environment project to build stability and peace through action on the part of the inhabitants of the region."
"A neutral mediator is needed to initiate decision-making that overrides political controversies."
"If it were not for examples of voluntary action like the West Bank environment project, all the other work the EU does to implement the Middle East peace plans would be in vain."
"Mr President, I was interested to hear Mr Tannock remind us that these agreements between the European Community and Israel have been in operation since 1975."
"I have been in Parliament for 19 years and this issue has regularly come up as a political flashpoint."
"In fact it was one of the first major flashpoints when I joined Parliament in 1984, yet we still have not reached a satisfactory conclusion."
"But, as several speakers have already said, we are not really here today to start arguing about the whole question of who is most at fault in this sad and extremely tragic country."
"I have visited Gaza, because my daughter worked there for several years with the UN, and I know that when the kind of trouble that everyone in Israel is suffering from occurs now, when the borders are closed, Palestinian produce cannot move out of the Gaza Strip."
"I have spoken before in this House about the dramatic sights I have seen on the streets of Gaza city, where animals were eating the flowers and strawberries that were part of the Palestinian exports from Gaza to Europe."
"There is a wonderful climate."
"It is potentially a great source of economic value to the Palestinian people, but every time there was trouble the borders were shut down and the produce was simply left to rot on the streets of Gaza."
"That makes it different from produce coming out of Israeli settlements - and that is a very real difference."
"Only the Israeli authorities have the means to eliminate the substantial distortions of the origin rules involving settlement products without causing further inconvenience to the EU, the Member States, Community operators and Israeli exporters."
"Perhaps without Israel's cooperation the only lawful and effective solution for the EU, short of suspending the agreement, is for the Member States to hold in doubt the origin of virtually all Israeli exports."
"."
"Mr President, firstly, a general remark: as I see it, in the way we are conducting this debate we are behaving like generals fighting a war that has already been fought."
"Personally, I share the view that it was quite some time before the EU got to the point where these rules were being clearly applied."
"But we have been doing this for some time now and this fact needs to be clarified."
"I would also add that the political need for discussion and energy to be injected into the subject has more to do with what to do now than with the starting-point of the discussion which related to the actual administration of the customs regime."
"As a member of the Commission I do not recognise anything in our discussions or handling of this in the Commission that resembles what some have said here about questioning the unity of the Commission in relation to this issue."
"This has never been a divisive issue inside the Commission."
"Others have mentioned that Member States have to agree."
"That is absolutely correct."
"Mrs Sandbæk asked why the Commission has not officially informed Member States about this and what it is going to do."
"I will repeat what I said in my first contribution to this debate, namely that following the confirmation received from Israel that its customs authorities certified goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, the Commission published a notice to the importers in the Official Journal in November 2001 in order to inform them of the situation."
"So almost two years ago the Commission did what Mrs Sandbæk asked."
"This is one element on which I based my first remarks."
"It sounds as if this debate is about a war that was waged some time ago."
"In February this year - which was the time that the last internal Member States customs authorities met on this issue - about EUR 100 000 had been collected as permanent duties on these product categories from the beginning of 2003."
"We expect new figures to be available at the end of this month when the next meeting takes place."
"The amount of guarantees taken on these products by EU customs authorities at that time was as much as EUR 1.7 million."
"When we are certain that the goods are coming from settlements, duties are applied immediately by Member States."
"Where there is any doubt, or where there is unclear or insufficient information about this from the Israeli authorities, we also apply duties after having checked as far as we can."
"This is being regularly reviewed within our Member States through the Customs Committee, which will meet again at the end of this month."
"This is something which is not just handled by putting a notice in the Official Journal; it is an active, ongoing process."
"Finally, Mr Gahler asked about the modalities and principles of assessing the accumulation, and how much processing is necessary before it becomes an Israeli product."
"This is not the only place in the world where we have to decide on these matters."
"We follow general principles and criteria as regards how much processing is necessary before the origin of a product is decided."
"There is no special rule for Israel on this point."
"The continuing occupation of territories by Israel, the repeated murderous operations by the Israeli army, its terrorist presence in Palestine and the arbitrary arrests, in conjunction with rough conditions of detention, the denial of the existence of a Palestinian state and the constant violation of the right of self-determination of a nation have created an explosive situation in the Middle East and a generalised climate of instability and insecurity, which is being maintained and incited by US and EU imperialism, causing the justified reaction of the Palestinians and intensifying the suicide attacks."
"The proclamation of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital is the sine qua non to any real effort to bring about peace and restore a climate of security for Palestinians and Israelis."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece take side unreservedly with the fighting Palestinian people and condemn efforts to maintain the current situation and perpetuate the problem, as contained in the Quartet's road map, which has obviously collapsed."
"The peoples of Europe are fighting for peace against imperialist military intervention, as in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, and against cooperation with and support for Israel in its bellicose strategy of violation of the rights of the Palestinians, and they will overturn with their fight the militarisation of Europe which will strengthen imperialism against the peoples even more."
"The next item is the report (A5-0164/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the Special Framework of Assistance for Traditional ACP Suppliers of Bananas (Council Regulation No 856/1999) - Biennial Report from the Commission 2002 (COM(2002) 763 - 2003/2091(INI))."
"Mr President, this Commission communication comes in response to the provisions of the Council Regulation on the Special Framework of Assistance for traditional ACP banana producers, whose objectives are to improve the competitiveness and support the diversification of agricultural production in those countries."
"I would like to emphasise that significant sums, about EUR 44 million, were allocated to this aid project in both 2001 and 2002, and that the Commission has told us the results of the programme for those two years."
"It gives me particular pleasure to say, firstly, that efforts to diversify production increased during that period, and, secondly, that those efforts were based on incentives for agricultural and rural development projects."
"Both of these achievements fulfil or express desires noted as objectives by both the Commission and Parliament when this programme was approved."
"I ought to mention, however, that some problems have been encountered. The Commission is undoubtedly aware of them, but they should be solved through the prompt adoption of certain corrective measures."
"Firstly, there have in some cases been significant and repeated delays, not attributable to any individual's deliberate wishes, in mobilising and implementing appropriations over the last few years."
"These delays, however, have as a rule created significant difficulties for farmers in the producing countries, some of which are among the 40 poorest countries on the planet."
"Some of these farmers have told us of their doubts and, particularly in the case of West African farmers, of their disagreement with the methods used by the Commission to assess farmers' competitiveness, on which the Commission's criteria for allocating appropriations are based."
"This assessment method takes into account average production costs, insurance and transport fleets as detailed by Eurostat."
"These figures, though, do not constitute a single definition. That causes mistakes of more than minimal significance in some cases."
"They are sometimes very significant mistakes, to the detriment of some of these countries."
"Commissioner, I am concerned at the decline in the amount of assistance allocated in the 2003 budget, especially as we approach the changeover from the current system to a tariff only system. That changeover may have very negative effects, not only on production in traditional ACP countries, but also on European banana-producing regions, if, when the moment comes for us to move from the current system to the tariff only system, we are unable to adopt the right measures."
"I will conclude by appealing for two concrete changes which are very important to Parliament and also, I hope, to the Commission: greater efforts to avoid any delays in payment from now on; and assessments of growing and production methods, with the aim of withholding funding from those projects having a negative effect not only on the environment but also on the health of banana workers in producing countries."
"The use of biodegradable substances in the banana-growing process should become a priority here."
". Let me start by say something about the evolution of payments."
"I agree that this has been quite a problem in the start-up phase, but I can also inform you that the amount invoiced in 2002 was nearly EUR 41.5 million."
"This represents nearly seven times more than the amounts invoice in 1999 and more than three times the amount invoiced in 2001."
"Although we cannot draw clear conclusions yet for the current year, the overall trend is quite positive and a similar disbursements of some EUR 40 million is expected for this year, taken as a whole."
"We are now at a level of activity that corresponds reasonably well to expectations."
"All this is quite complex, there are so many different interests deserving protection, many historical, social and political factors in everything that relates to bananas."
"The Commission is well aware of the difficulties in combining the principle of equitable market access with consideration for the structural problems faced by small vulnerable economies."
"The Special Framework of Assistance stems from those concerns and addresses them in a tangible manner."
"Also it should be noted that this was not something imposed on our partners in this area but reflects thorough negotiations."
"After the undeniable difficulties of the start-up phase, substantial progress can now be observed in the implementation of the scheme: I have just given these figures."
"Now we have reached a satisfactory rate in terms of payment."
"In response to the repeated suggestions by the Commission, several ACP banana suppliers are changing their strategies and seeking more financial support to fund diversification where the banana industry is no longer sustainable."
"It is expected that this process will continue, with the least competitive banana suppliers using the available funds exclusively for diversification and social compensation."
"As far as the possible increase in imports following enlargement, which is an important discussion, is concerned, it was agreed at the Copenhagen summit that appropriate arrangements would be made in order to ensure a sufficient supply of bananas to EU consumers in conformity with WTO rules."
"Any increase in the banana quotas, which would be subject to negotiations in the WTO framework, would take account of the interests of these producers."
"The Commission is well aware of its obligations resulting from the Cotonou Agreement including those relating to ensuring the continuing outlet for ACP bananas on the European market and we are of course committed to do anything we can to respect this."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank Mr Fernández for producing this report, which is an assessment rather than a legislative report. I also thank Commissioner Nielson for his statement."
"As the rapporteur says, we have reached the final stages of a regime for protecting banana imports, which will come to an end on 31 December 2005. The European Union has managed to maintain special privileges for 12 small countries, as Mr Fernández has told us."
"Some of those countries, such as Somalia, Jamaica and Dominica, are among the world's poorest, which is why they need our help."
"That date, 31 December 2005, is very close."
"A guarantee and a tariff preference are laid down in the Cotonou Agreement; they will have to be honoured."
"Clearly, though, these banana producers will find themselves in trouble as the date approaches."
"What I mean to say is that there is every chance of the Community market becoming flooded with bananas marketed by multinational companies."
"Most importantly, the rapporteur has pointed out another danger, namely that enlargement will be used to justify granting even more preferential treatment to those multinational companies, opening up our markets to the detriment of both Community and traditional ACP producers."
"I believe that Commissioner Nielson is at present aware of those problems."
"He mentioned that the amount of aid has remained at approximately the same level, about EUR 40 million, in recent years, and I do not know to what extent that amount could be altered to accommodate the needs arising as an inevitable consequence of the transition from a protective banana regime to an open regime subject only to the tariff restriction."
"I therefore reiterate my group's support for Mr Fernández's report, and hope that the Commission will continue to protect this small group of impoverished countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, bananas are extremely important products for the economy and for the land use of several European regions, particularly in the Atlantic archipelagos of Macronesia, but are also crucial to some less developed countries towards which we have binding legal and political obligations."
"I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fernández Martín, and offer my support for his conclusions and ideas on the matter now under our consideration. I also offer my support to my friend and colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, who is also a fellow countryman of the rapporteur."
"I wish, however, to take this opportunity to raise a few basic points about the transparency and clarity of procedures in the way current legislation is implemented."
"It is unacceptable that the funds we are looking at should be allocated by Commission decisions that are not made public and which are based on an unnecessarily complex system of calculation, on the basis of somewhat erroneously defined concepts, using data of dubious rigour and comparability that are spread across two regulations and several articles and annexes."
"The aims of Community legislation must be clear, as simple as possible to enact and transparently implemented."
"As the Ivory Coast Banana and Pineapple Producers' Association has rightly stated, however, this regulation does not fulfil these criteria."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will inform Parliament of the decisions it has taken on funding organisations in the beneficiary countries, as well as the calculations informing these and the data it has used and even the legal basis and what it has done with the unused appropriations from budget line B7-8710."
"A simple and transparent legal framework is a crucial instrument, in this and in other fields, for developing a positive and lasting relationship between the European institutions and their partners."
". Mr President, in reply to the last remarks by Mr Casaca, this does not correspond to the way in which we are doing these things."
"None of the beneficiaries has ever disputed the correctness of the calculations of the individual yearly amounts."
"This is also being discussed at meetings with representatives of these countries."
"I would add that the representatives of the producers from the Côte d'Ivoire stated at one of these meetings that in their view the Commission has always applied the method prescribed by the Commission regulation in a correct and fair manner."
"If these criteria are complex it only reflects the fact that we are where we are as a result of negotiations where contradictory and many different special interests had to be reconciled."
"That is the source of the complication."
"For once it is something we in the Commission are not guilty of."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be at the end of the debates today."
"Mr President, the world today is more interdependent than ever before."
"Problems are shared problems: poverty, hunger, military conflict, immigration, transmissible diseases, ecological disasters and the like."
"Here the question of development aid has become more important than ever."
"Now is exactly the right moment, to my mind, for the Commission to have produced its communication to the Council and to Parliament, which we are debating today."
"The report I am presenting today, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , is the fruit of work and contributions from political groups and from my fellow Members, for which I am particularly grateful and appreciative."
"As we know, the European Union and its Member States constitute the world's leading donors of government development aid."
"The traditional mechanisms of the European model have not, however, allowed the desired aims of cooperation to be achieved with complete success."
"It is difficult for us to ensure that the results are monitored or to assess them accurately, because the implementation of the programmes and projects is dispersed among both national cooperation agencies and fixed procedures which tie the receipt of aid in different ways to the acquisition of goods and services obtained by means of that aid in the donor countries."
"According the World Bank's figures, released here in this Chamber during a speech by the bank's President, Mr Wolfensohn, the untying of aid would result in a reduction of transaction costs by up to 25%. We therefore welcome the Commission's initiative, which may help to enliven the debate on this issue."
"That debate is currently being conducted among Member States and multilateral organisations. They are far from reaching an agreement which would be binding on all parties, and on the main donors in particular."
"I am convinced of the need, in this debate, to uphold the idea that aid priorities should suit the interests of recipient countries."
"That idea would seem almost too obvious to any observer, but it is not currently being put into practice."
"As a result, some European countries play a significant part in cooperation as official aid donors, but the money they make in return for delivering that aid exceeds their own contributions to the aid programmes, sometimes by a long way."
"This practice is known to all of us, I believe, and it is clear proof of a degree of cynicism among the donor countries - in other words, our own countries."
"We must make an effort, therefore, to try and remedy this state of affairs."
"Of course, events do not take this kind of turn through a deliberate and evil desire for them to turn out badly, but for a whole range of reasons which cannot be gone into here."
"The main thing is that we use the experience we have acquired to push for these ideas to be implemented, bearing in mind certain considerations, such as those mentioned in paragraph 4 of our report, in order to ensure that our objectives are achieved and certain undesirable effects avoided."
"In other words, for example, it would be helpful if the Commission were to bear in mind the need for horizontal and geographical or regional budget lines to be treated equally, so as to introduce and guarantee open, transparent calls for tender, which do not always come about."
"These calls for tender will apply to all Member States and candidate countries, all developing countries and all developed countries, on condition that they are reciprocated by third countries and approved by the recipient countries."
"I will conclude by making express mention of a request made by many developing countries and NGOs."
"That request is that priority be given to the award of contracts to local suppliers or service providers in both the recipient country and neighbouring countries in the same region, on condition that provision is made for sufficient training to ensure that the projects are brought to a satisfactory conclusion rather than left frustratingly unfinished."
"The reasons for this are many and plain to see; it would be almost too obvious to list them, but they can be summed up by evoking the desirability of contributing to the development of local markets in those countries."
". The communication about the untying of aid dates back to 18 November 2002 and we still have quite some work to do, even though we have made good political progress on the issue since last year."
"This issue may appear to be very technical and difficult to address, but it can have quite an impact in the field concerning the effectiveness, the value for money of our aid and also the dynamics of the cooperation with our partner countries - exactly in the way Mr Fernández Martin has made clear."
"I am grateful for the work he has done on this subject."
"His report reflects broad agreement between us."
"We have achieved consensus in Council on the untying of Community aid, and with the resolution on the table now in Parliament we can start working on implementation."
"We will focus on concrete proposals to change the different relevant legal instruments."
"The proposal to implement changes in the existing regulations will fall under the co-decision procedure and therefore Parliament's role in moving this forward will be fundamental."
"I look forward to discussing it with Parliament during the course of this coming year."
"We will continue our work on establishing the facts relating to untying."
"One of the problems is that it is very difficult to find concrete, reliable data on the impact of untying."
"We will begin a study on this before the end of the year."
"We will try to convince other donors who are still reluctant to join us, particularly through the work of the OECD 's Development Assistance Committee and its new Working Group on Aid Effectiveness."
"While welcoming the Council's agreement on the untying of Community aid, I would like to express disappointment at the reluctance of some Member States - and especially that of one Member State - to commit themselves to untying bilateral aid."
"This has two dimensions; one is the well-established discussion as to whether or not official development assistance and the procurement there is part of the Single Market."
"This is an internal EU discussion."
"In the Commission's view the answer is clearly 'yes', the public procurement directive does indeed cover development aid."
"Some countries that have been doubting this over the years, including my own, clearly no longer doubt this."
"However, one Member State still maintains a different view."
"My reply would be 'okay, we will meet in Court'."
"The other element where a discussion is more open and more legitimate is what Member States do in the broader global discussion in the framework of OECD about the untying of aid."
"There we have an agreement to untie aid to the group of least developed countries."
"The volume of what has been agreed on corresponds to about 2% of global ODA - not a big deal."
"The Commission is complying, and in fact over-achieving, in relation to what it has to do in order to carry out this agreement."
"But we take a different view: one reason being that we do not want to discriminate between least developed countries and the rest."
"We are ready to untie all aid and we have legal obligations vis-à-vis the ACP countries, for instance, which means that as a group, they have access to bid on everything relating to all seventy-eight countries."
"In preparation for the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development, the Member States committed themselves to continue discussions on the further untying of bilateral aid."
"The Commission recognises that we need both to increase the volume of aid and its effectiveness through measures like those we are discussing today."
"I am really pleased to have the signal from Parliament and I look forward to moving this forward."
"It is true that we have to insist on some reciprocity, because this issue is also about taking care of trade interests opening up on our part, if, for instance, the United States is not doing the same thing."
"It is clearly not something we have a mandate to do."
"Our policy is now clear we want to go for the big solution on this issue."
". Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent and timely report."
"As he said, we now live in a world that is totally interdependent, and the problems of one country are problems for all of us, problems such as poverty, hunger, disease, ecological disasters and crime."
"It is our joint responsibility to resolve these problems and to work towards a consistent and coherent strategy."
"Development aid can play a pivotal role in working towards solutions, but only if it is free of trade commitments."
"The proposals we have in front of us are a positive step towards achieving greater effectiveness of development aid."
"Untying aid is a direct way of increasing that effectiveness, but we need to acknowledge and recognise, as the Commissioner has made clear, that among certain Member States tying aid is still common practice."
"We must therefore take immediate action to address the inadequacy of our current practices."
"Commissioner, may I say 'more power to your elbow!' when you see the recalcitrant Member State in court, because we cannot have one Member State playing a different game from the others."
"We have, as you say, a single market."
"I support the need for reform."
"It will lead to increasing transparency and accountability."
"It is a complex process, and we welcome the intention of the Commission to bring forward the legislative proposals and the changes to existing legislation, hoping that this will not result in more bureaucracy."
"I should like to stress that this untying of aid from trade is not a final step, but it is one means of increasing the effectiveness of granting aid."
"The main purpose of granting aid is poverty reduction."
"So it is not an isolated concept, but part of an ongoing debate which will be pursued to some extent in Cancun next week."
"Mr President, I wish to express my sincere thanks to my colleague, Fernando Fernández Martín, for the pithy though balanced report he has drafted."
"I would also ask Commissioner Nielson to convey my thanks to those involved in drafting the Commission communication."
"The text is clearly written and big-hearted in its tone."
"The practice of tying aid may in theory even turn development aid completely on its head, with the donor benefiting and the country intended as the recipient becoming poorer than ever."
"Although this extreme paradox, which is well-known in economic theories, is not necessarily very easily possible in reality, it is nevertheless a reminder of the sort of reduced effectiveness and perversions of aid which still occur and are furthermore permitted in real life."
"Estimates by the World Bank and the OECD of savings made through increased effectiveness are of the order of 25%."
"Our rapporteur estimates that the net benefit of untying could be the equivalent of as much as USD 5 billion in terms of cash."
"As we know how even small sums of money can work wonders in development cooperation, an increase of several billion euros of that sort is staggering."
"The European Union's willingness to take the initiative in this matter is significant as the EU and the Member States are responsible together for half the world's development aid."
"Reduced effectiveness in development cooperation is therefore by no means a trivial matter when measured in real terms."
"It is important to implement the conclusions arrived at in Barcelona swiftly."
"It should be self-evident that simple market economy principles dictate that the EU Member States should untie donor aid."
"The key competition principles agreed in the EU will work to the advantage of the developing countries in this."
"Then local sourcing and sourcing from other developing countries will also be possible, as we have already seen, resulting in a multiplier effect on the effectiveness of aid."
"In addition to the benefit in terms of welfare achieved in the developing countries, the liberalisation of procurement will also be important within the EU, because the practice of tying aid which still goes on in many Member States also distorts competition among the Member States themselves and is against the rules on competition in the EC Treaty."
"Mr President, aid which is conditional on the acquisition of goods or services originating in the donor country has repeatedly been condemned as an immoral and inefficient practice by recipient countries and the worst-affected NGOs on the one hand, and on the other by the majority of agencies involved in development issues. Among the latter are many intergovernmental organisations."
"In 1996, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a strategy document entitled 'Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Cooperation'."
"Since then, that philosophy has gradually taken on a definite, solid form through a series of important declarations and resolutions, such as the DAC's recommendation, approved in May 2001, demanding that aid to the least-developed countries should be untied."
"More importantly, the international community adopted the Monterrey Consensus at the International Conference on Financing for Development in March 2002, committing itself to supporting initiatives designed to phase out conditional aid."
"In its communication of November 2002, entitled 'Untying: Enhancing the Effectiveness of Aid', the Commission responds to just those promises made at Monterrey."
"All these recommendations are still gaining ground, under pressure from lobbying by the general public and by NGOs."
"They have not, however, made a great impression on a large number of countries, which are continuing to grant tied aid, either openly or covertly. This is unfortunately also true of various EU Member States."
"The result is a significant discrepancy between the policy advocated by Parliament and implemented by the Commission on the one hand, and the policy put into practice by some Member States, such as Spain under José María Aznar, on the other."
"It comes as no surprise that the report presented by Mr Fernández Martín, a Partido Popular deputy in my country, should list a series of initial misgivings about the progressive approach urged by the Commission, an approach favourable to the untying of development cooperation policy."
"In the rapporteur's favour, however, it should be said that he showed understanding and flexibility by accepting the amendments tabled to his first proposal, which have yielded substantial improvements in his final text."
"That text includes a motion for a resolution approved by the Parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation. We will be reasonably happy to vote for it, since it favours the complete untying of development aid, both European Union aid and aid granted by each and every one of the Member States."
". Mr President, I should like to make just a few points."
"With regard to Mrs Korhola's comments, it is true that many years ago the World Bank and UN stated that up to 25% of development assistance was wasted from the point of view of the recipient countries because of tying to the donor countries."
"This figure is not acceptable to the Commission because we have open competition between the 15 Member States, and adding a sixteenth does not really change the name of the game in terms of ensuring competitiveness when we are tendering."
"Therefore, the dynamics of this mainly revolves around a classical case of a single bilateral donor country tying or not tying."
"For the Commission, the dynamics of this, economically speaking, are not fantastic."
"I would add that as a result of access to ACP countries, these countries have the right to bid on anything we tender relating to them."
"About 25% of all tenders are now being won by ACP bidders."
"This is good and is part of what Mr Fernández Martín talked about as being important to attain."
"Finally, it is true that food aid and the transport of food aid has - at the insistence of the US and via the decision in the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD - been excluded from what should be covered by untying of aid."
"This is very sad and this is why we specifically refer to that problem as one of the elements in the broader topic of the untying of aid."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be at the end of the debates today."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on the bomb attacks in Mumbai:"
"B5-0371/2003 tabled by Gerard Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group;"
"B5-0376/2003 tabled by Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"B5-0379/2003 tabled by Jean Lambert and Reinhold Messner, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0381/2003 tabled by Margrietus J. van den Berg and Maria Carrilho, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0386/2003 tabled by Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli and Esko Olavi Seppänen, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group and"
"B5-0387/2003 tabled by Charles Tannock and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"Mr President, I am surprised that for once my political group is the first to be called in the debate."
"I recently had a long and interesting conversation in Scotland with the Consul General for India and we were reflecting upon the problems in trying to constitute a polity which is continental in scale and multilingual in character, with citizens of many faiths and of none, with memories of historical antagonism between religious communities and which tries to sustain a working democratic constitution and to live at peace with its neighbours."
"We were thinking both of Europe and of India and it is humbling to us in the European Union, as we work towards improving our constitution, to think that India has achieved this continent-wide polyglot democracy in a secular polity for more than 50 years now."
"We have a lot to learn from India and we should approach today's debate with a certain sense of humility in that regard."
"However, evidently, as the horrifying events in Mumbai show us, all is not well in India."
"The issue of the capability to sustain a secular state with religious tolerance is now before us, as is the question of whether the tension with Pakistan will be cooled and whether intercommunal relations in India will become peaceful."
"That sets the background to this admirable resolution which is before us today."
"Some of it in a sense merely states the obvious: of course we condemn the bomb attacks in Mumbai; of course we deplore the targeting of civilians; of course we feel great sympathy with the victims."
"We support the Indian Government in its fight against terrorism, but there is more to be said than that and some of it is said in my group's amendment to the resolution where we call for further steps to be taken to enforce Indian constitutional law properly and to prevent communal violence inside India."
"We are particularly aware, for example, of recent Amnesty International reports on problems in Gujarat and the responses to the 2002 massacre there."
"The Indian National Human Rights Commission has itself called for improved vigilance by the Indian authorities and for effective protection of constitutional rights."
"At the same time we welcome the Pakistani Government's assurance that it also deplores and has no time for the terrorist act in Mumbai."
"Times are critical, but we must also be critically sympathetic to the Indian state."
"Things are going wrong which will call for resolve in India to make them better."
"We should carry this resolution and the amendments to it tabled in the name of my group and of the ELDR Group."
"For a long time, India was a stable country with Hindus and Muslims coexisting peacefully alongside one another."
"Last week's terrorist attacks in Mumbai might well spell the beginning of increasing violence between representatives of the religious communities. I certainly hope it will not."
"One of the suspects has already indicated that with this act, he wanted to take revenge for last year's anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat, which claimed the lives of 2 000 Muslims."
"Developments in India over the past fifty years had been typified by cultural diversity and a heterogeneous society."
"Over the past ten years, however, we have witnessed increasing alienation between Muslims and Hindus."
"The immediate cause is the issue involving the temple of the god Ram."
"The root cause, however, is to be sought more in the area of looming Hindu nationalism, where faith and national identity coincide."
"Hindus fear Muslims and Christians, particularly demographically speaking."
"Finally, needless to say, friction with Pakistan is continually placing a heavy strain on relations between them, including in India."
"The Indian Government should take the problems seriously, and it appears now to be doing so."
"An escalation must be avoided at all costs."
"I have tabled an amendment in which the Indian Government is urged to draw up a plan of action in this respect."
"India is not the only country that is facing tension between religions."
"Almost half of the recent violent conflicts in the world have a religious dimension."
"Consequently, I have expressly asked for this issue to be highlighted in my human rights report."
"An institutionalised dialogue should be set up between the most important world religions."
"The European Union should also look into this issue."
"For a long time, India was a good example of the peaceful co-existence of religions."
"It should pull out all the stops in order to again become the peaceful, stable country which it had been for such a long time."
"Mr President, I wish to start, as other speakers have done, by conveying my condolences and those of the Group of the Party of European Socialists to the Indian authorities and to all the relatives of the victims, for the appalling attack perpetrated in Bombay."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to say - as Mr MacCormick said - that there is indeed more to be said on the matter, although it is crucial to start saying exactly what he said, but not, I believe, if this means raising further problems, albeit very real ones, concerning human rights in India."
"I do not believe that this is the appropriate time, place, or way to raise such issues, because what we do not need is an attempt to justify any form of terrorism against civilians, which is what has occurred in this case: we must condemn all such terrorist activities, whether the attack in Bombay or those that have placed Israel in a continual state of mourning, or, for example, the attack that took place in Buenos Aires, which the British judicial authorities are only now beginning to deal with, and are doing so extremely well, in a way that should be noted by all and which should, in fact, be the standard for all European political authorities."
"This is not, unfortunately, always the case."
"We must not hesitate to condemn terrorist attacks of this type and not attempt to justify them. Our condemnation of fanaticism must be clear, unequivocal and resolute."
"This is the message that I would like to make extremely clear, and this is why I do not believe that the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are appropriate."
"Mr President, as the founder of the European Parliament Friends of India group, this resolution is intended as a gesture of solidarity with the people and government of India against the mindless violence perpetrated by a small number of fanatics drawn from Islamic extremists."
"They believe the killing in Bombay with the bombing of innocents, including children and members of their own Muslim faith, to be justified and a way of destabilising the largest multicultural, democratic success story in the world."
"I also salute the professionalism of the authorities, not only in their early success in apprehending the suspects and hopefully eventually securing convictions, but, most of all, preventing an escalation of further inter-communal violence."
"I also welcome the response of the government of Pakistan, but it must crack down seriously if any evidence emerges of connections to Lashkar-e-Toiba and if any of its operations are shown to have been launched from Pakistani territory."
"However, I particularly welcome their condemnation of the bomb attack."
"It is essential that the political stability of India as a nuclear, regional superpower is upheld by all EU Member States and all other democratic nations of the world."
"India is a country in which all groups have reached the highest offices, as illustrated by its current President and Head of State, who is a Muslim."
"Within 20 years it will in terms of population be the largest country in the world, overtaking China."
"Terrorism is a negation of all the values of those who seek to build rather than destroy."
"This House condemns it everywhere, all over the world."
"Mr President, the bombings at the Gateway of India and the Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai on 25 August 2003 killed and injured scores of innocent civilians."
"These devastating and cowardly terrorist attacks remind us all that the scourge of terrorism is a threat faced by all democracies."
"It is a challenge that we must face together by intensifying security cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral basis."
"The United Kingdom in particular has strong historical ties with India."
"I trust that the British Government will offer India all the support that it can in combating terrorism."
"The Indian authorities and people have shown commendable restraint in the face of these latest outrages."
"That, of course, is the right response."
"The terrorists seek to stir wider hatred and animosity and undermine not only the secular democracy, which has been part of our legacy to India and India's great strength and example, but also the hopeful signs of rapprochement, which have been seen recently between India and Pakistan."
"Pakistan should now clearly demonstrate its willingness to take effective action against terrorists on its borders with Afghanistan and now, even more urgently, on its borders with India - in cooperation with the Indian security authorities - before there is another conflagration."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"We support the joint resolution, but, at the same time, I would endorse Mr Casaca's comments that we should not be widening this resolution outside of its original terms."
"Therefore, we will not support the two amendments by the Liberals and the Greens."
"Of course the PSE Group condemns the cowardly 'twin towers' bombings of the Gateway of India and of the Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai on 25 August 2003 that killed and injured so many people."
"Under no circumstances can any terrorist attack that targets civilians, resulting in the loss of innocent lives, be accepted by the international community."
"These terrorist bombs were clearly designed to cause maximum civilian causalities, to destabilise Indian society and weaken the Indian economy."
"Yet members of both the Hindu and Muslim communities in India died in the attack and worked together in the rescue efforts."
"We have seen a degree of restraint that we have to welcome."
"At the same time, we welcome the statement by the Pakistani Foreign Minister expressing sympathy with the victims and their families."
"We urge the Commission, the Council and this Parliament to do all they can to ensure that the current rapprochement between India and Pakistan is not damaged by these incidents."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the European Union must not pass over in silence the terrorist attacks in Mumbai."
"Not only did these bombings, which hit India's financial centre, claim the lives of 52 people, they also threatened to jeopardise the peace process in the region."
"It is regrettable that this should happen precisely at this moment in time, jeopardising the peace negotiations between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, a much-wanted region by both countries."
"India has been making major efforts for some time to bring this conflict to an end."
"After all, the Indian Government's policies are geared to the peaceful co-existence of the different nations, as illustrated by the number of Muslims occupying high government positions."
"India is, moreover, the only country in southern Asia that has opted in favour of a secular and pluralist state model."
"A choice of this kind is a clear expression of tolerance with regard to the various population groups."
"It goes without saying that this raises very important issues, which must be viewed in terms of India's importance, not only in Asia but also in the world."
"After all, we should not overlook the fact that India is a superpower boasting great economic potential and is also one of the European Union's important trading partners."
"The objective of the violence was to destabilise society and deliver a blow to the Indian economy."
"The international community should concern itself more with increasing Muslim fundamentalism in the world."
"The recent attack against the UN headquarters in Iraq is a dramatic example of this."
"This incident underlines once more the enormous threat that is emanating from ever increasing fundamentalism."
"I take the view that the European Union and its Parliament have every reason to continue to support India as a constitutional state, where Hindus and Muslims are treated equally, in a bid to ensure respect for the principles of democracy."
". The Commission agrees with Parliament's concerns and shares its view on the gravity of the recent bomb attacks in Mumbai."
"These attacks are proof that terrorism can strike in any part of the world and have disastrous consequences."
"The Commission condemned in the strongest possible terms the bomb attacks that caused much loss of life and many causalities in Mumbai on 25 August 2003."
"President Prodi reacted immediately by sending a message to the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Vajpayee."
"He condemned the attack, offered his condolences and assured India of EU support in the fight against terrorism."
"The EU and India have stood and stand side by side in their fight against terrorism, as spelled out in a Joint Declaration issued at the 2001 Summit in Delhi."
"Cooperation in this matter is part of our regular political dialogue at all levels, and we have set up a working group that has already met four times since May 2001."
"A strong signal from the European Parliament is thus a very welcome contribution to the EU's expression of solidarity with India."
"It will emphasise our common resolve to fight terrorism, wherever it occurs and whatever its motives."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be at the end of the debates today."
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the peace agreement signed a Accra on 18 August 2003 under the authority of ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States."
"We are concerned that while this is holding in the capital, there are still problems in the rural areas, with reports even today of tens of thousands of people fleeing into Monrovia from Totota in Central Liberia."
"That is hardly surprising, with the alleged massacres of hundreds, and possibly thousands, of civilians perpetuated in Nimba County since the signing of the agreement."
"Fourteen years of violence and misrule in Liberia resulted in immense human suffering amongst civilians, as well as gross human rights violations, a breakdown in social and economic structures, and now 85% of the population is living below the poverty line."
"The arrival of the peacekeeping force has enabled the peacekeeping process to start, but there is still a long way to go."
"We look forward and call upon all the parties to the agreement to implement it in good faith and to establish a transitional government as promised on 14 October 2003, that will hopefully lead to free and fair elections."
"We welcome the fact that the European Union has provided aid to that process, amounting to EUR 15 million to date."
"We recognise that more may be necessary."
"The problem is that at the moment the peace agreement is holding in Monrovia, but less well outside."
"Part of that problem is that there is still a shortage of troops on the ground."
"There are only 1 500 out of a promised 3 500."
"Those troops are required as soon as possible."
"We equally ask that all the states in the region refrain from any actions that might contribute to instability in Liberia and on the borders between Guinea, Sierra Leone and the Côte d'Ivoire."
"We ask that these neighbouring states act with discretion."
"Mr President, corrupt and ruthless dictators continue to exploit and impoverish many countries in Africa."
"Decades of international aid, especially EU aid, have been undone and destroyed."
"Consequently millions suffer from avoidable diseases or are maimed and shot."
"The EU must condemn these dictators and it must be ready to act promptly."
"In cases like Liberia, where ECOWAS and Nigeria have taken the initiative."
"I hope the EU will do more than just provide the EUR 15 million that it is has pledged."
"I am pleased, of course, that the EU is involved and I want to ensure that this Parliament is aware of the continuing problems in Africa, because it is European taxpayers who in the end become impatient if we are seen not to take appropriate action."
"I hope Commissioner Nielson will do his best and keep Parliament informed, because we need to show that Liberia can recover and can perhaps be a model for other African countries."
"We need to build it anew and ensure there is prosperity and peace."
"Mr President, West Africa provides examples of the extent to which this region is rent asunder."
"On the one hand, it is where there are the best opportunities for a regional market to grow and develop, and some states have done well by African standards in making progress in recent years."
"On the other hand, there are states - of which Sierra Leone is one example, and Liberia is another - where not only is the state in crisis, but where every vestige of the rule of law threatens to disappear."
"We have to consider how we are going to respond in the face of this situation."
"We have to be clear in our own minds that Liberia started out with a congenital defect, as the descendants of black African returnees from America were in violent conflict with the indigenous inhabitants from the word go and the state has never been internally united."
"Today there are also violent conflicts, organised criminality, powerful raw materials interests, and the danger, despite all current efforts and even though some period of time without war can be achieved, that the real problem, the establishment of a constitutional state that functions to some degree, will not actually be tackled."
"Important though troops are, they cannot do it on their own."
"What the country needs is the establishment of a state, the building of institutions, and the truth that a state does not come into being automatically is demonstrated in Somalia, where there has been no rule of law whatever for the past ten years."
"It is a characteristically European conception that well-ordered states must always and everywhere be in place, even though, in the aftermath of the Thirty Years' War, it took us decades to re-establish a functioning state order."
"For a start, then, we should not take an arrogant approach to these matters; secondly, we need to apply a certain healthy realism."
"We must first put a stop to the violence and must alleviate the direst need; then, though, will begin a process, which will last decades, of re-establishing political institutions that work to at least some degree."
"That will not happen without massive help from us, but nor can it be successful unless the people want to help themselves."
"It cannot happen without support from the country's neighbours, without regional cooperation, without the establishment of a regional community in West Africa."
"There are however two sides to this, as the state borders and ethnic boundaries do not coincide, resulting in the danger of aid to neighbourhoods being misused - as it was in the Congo - in order to strengthen the hand of related peoples in internal politics on the other side of the border and to upset the balance of nationalities."
"A healthy combination of external help, help aimed at enabling people to help themselves, and regional cooperation offers the only chance for this region, racked by crises, to get back on its feet, at least in the medium term."
". Mr President, the Commission welcomes the peace agreement signed by the belligerent parties, civil society and political parties of the country on 18 August 2003."
"We are still concerned about the ongoing fighting."
"It is very important that ECOWAS fully deploys its peacekeeping troops to ensure that the peace agreement is respected on the ground."
"The figure available to me as to how many troops have actually been deployed is 2127."
"ECOWAS is doing what it is expected to do."
"We hope that the presence of this force will permit a rapid resumption of humanitarian assistance and an end to the atrocities that, especially for women and children, have been terrible in Liberia."
"We have been informed by ECOWAS that deployment should be completed by 9 September 2003."
"It has appointed a special representative for Liberia to oversee the conduct of the peacekeeping force and monitor the implementation of the peace agreement."
"ECOWAS is not in a position to carry the financial burden of these operations alone, and following the proposal from the Commission the Council decided to make EUR 50 million available to support the peace process broadly defined in Liberia."
"This money comes from allocated funds for Liberia that were never used: because of the situation we could not work there normally."
"For both the 7th and the 8th EDF, Liberia was more or less out of the circuit."
"Some things were possible, but only very little."
"About EUR 8 million of the EUR 50 million are earmarked to support the ECOWAS peace-keeping operation and for the creation of the office of the special representative."
"The remaining funds should be used for a demobilisation and reintegration programme as well as for institution-building and the restoration of democratic structures."
"In this regard, I was pleased to listen to Mr Posselt's contribution."
"These were wise words warning against the arrogant approach of taking it for granted that a rapid process of elections does it."
"This, unfortunately, is not the case."
"We need to be pragmatic and rediscover the practical value of the notion of governance."
"First stability or peace, then governance, then democratisation and then democracy itself."
"We have to be pragmatic and not allow ourselves to surrender to the temptation of prescribing those nice things that we take for granted here in our environment."
"We have to show confidence and be a more realistic partner."
"Liberia has been going through the most terrible, traumatic times."
"We also welcome the UN Security Council decision to establish a stabilisation force for Liberia to take over responsibility from ECOWAS as from 1 October 2003."
"Also, the contributions from Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom for the peacekeeping force in Liberia are very welcome and we see a strong case for mobilising what I would now call 'partnership stamina'."
"We tried, over the years, to do something meaningful in Liberia, but with Mr Taylor around this was almost impossible."
"Regionally, it is extremely important that the opportunity now at hand is not missed."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on Burma:"
"B5-0374/2003 tabled by Bob van den Bos and Anne André-Léonard, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"B5-0378/2003 tabled by Patricia McKenna and Marie Anne Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0383/2003 tabled by Enrique Barón Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group"
"B5-0384/2003 tabled by Marianne Eriksson and Fausto Bertinotti on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group and"
"B5-0389/2003 tabled by Geoffrey Van Orden and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"In Burma, generals have for years been keeping their own people in their gunsights, and the opposition in captivity."
"If the new Prime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, is really serious about his roadmap to democracy, he will immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues and give them an important role in this process."
"He presented this roadmap a few days ago behind closed doors, without the presence of the media or foreign diplomats."
"The plan is supposedly to set up a convention for a new constitution, which should lead to fair and free elections."
"As no information was given as to the how and when of this plan, the only conclusion I can draw is that the military regime is trying to sidetrack the West and is hoping to break out of its isolation."
"As it must not, of course, be allowed to succeed in this, I support the Council's decision to tighten the sanctions."
"Any remaining business contacts should be completely severed."
"The Commission and the Council, in cooperation with the United Nations, should continue to appeal for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues."
"She has been held illegally for more than three months, during which time she has gone on hunger strike."
"The international community must make the Burmese authorities responsible for her well-being and the Red Cross must gain access to her."
"Pressure from the neighbouring countries in the ASEAN - China, India and Japan - must be stepped up."
"Fortunately, the United States has also been very forthright in its opinion about the current situation and has expressly pledged its support to Aung San Suu Kyi."
"Burma is still the pariah of the international community."
"The military junta sees the enforcement of its own power as more important than the suffering of the Burmese people."
"The generals' roadmap to democracy has so far only led to prison."
"This is not only about the liberation of Aung San Suu Kyi, but also about the liberation of the Burmese people as a whole."
"Mr President, I have had two opportunities to visit Burma since I became a Member of this House."
"On the first occasion I carried a letter from President Klaus Hänsch informing Aung San Suu Kyi of the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to her."
"Khin Nyunt, the current Prime Minister, played a central role in ensuring I did not have the opportunity to deliver that letter in person."
"On the second occasion I was able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi clandestinely."
"On that occasion my colleagues and I were able to obtain her clear support for sanctions against the military regime in Burma."
"I hope the Council and the Commission recognise that is the view of the National League for Democracy."
"30 August marked three months of detention at the end of 13 years of open prison for Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy."
"The State Peace and Development Council - the former SLORC - has harassed the people of Burma, the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi."
"The last time she was visited was in July."
"On 31 August the United States reported she was on hunger strike."
"The regime denies that."
"If that is the case, the absolute minimum the authorities can do is to enable the international community to reassure itself of her wellbeing."
"As for free and fair elections, the problem in Burma is not free and fair elections - those took place 13 years ago - but that the military regime is not prepared to accept the will of the Burmese people."
"We welcome the fact that ASEAN started to get involved in this process at its ministerial meeting in June."
"We welcome the pressure they put on Burma and note that the current military regime has refused to allow them to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi."
"We demand her immediate release and that of all political prisoners, which would be a major step towards the restoration of democracy."
"We call on the Council and the Commission to show their readiness, in collaboration with the United States, to help facilitate the national reconciliation process in Burma."
"In the meantime, we ask the Council to introduce tough further measures targeted against the regime, its members and their interests."
"They should be imposing smart sanctions that hurt those people in power."
"We call on the Council and Member States to ask the United Nations Security Council to urgently address the situation in Burma."
"It is now more than three months since Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Sakharov Prize winner, was - to put it purely and simply - kidnapped by the Burmese junta, who have been holding her in detention ever since."
"The UN emissaries and the representatives of the Red Cross have not been able to visit her regularly."
"Last July a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross was probably the last contact that Aung San Suu Kyi had with the outside world."
"No one has seen her since."
"Today, in the same way that the dictator denied secretly holding the young woman, the Burmese authorities are denying her hunger strike, made public on 31 August by the US State Department."
"The imprisonment and arrest of militants of the National League for Democracy in May quite rightly gave rise to much feeling in the world."
"The US took the opportunity to reinforce their economic sanctions on the Rangoon regime."
"Today, the - no doubt demagogic - use of this announcement by the US cannot, however, hide the severity of the regime nor its hypocrisy in promising an official roadmap destined to restore democracy."
"This programme, which includes, and I quote, 'free and fair elections and a new Constitution', still does not fix a timetable and remains silent on the release of the leader of the opposition."
"It happened after the junta showed its desire to not respect any of the democratic demands of its people, and this is a bad omen."
"The results of the 1990 elections which, let us remember, were a landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi's party, were not recognised by the armed forces."
"The Association of South-East Asian Nations now threatens to exclude Burma from its members."
"It had hoped for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi before its next summit in Bali in October."
"As for the European Union, it should do everything possible to compel the military junta to free the Nobel Prize winner."
"In collaboration with the United Nations, the Council and the Commission should now show their determination, through strict sanctions, to do something practical in the process of democratisation in Burma."
"Political pressure should increase."
"Under the rule of one of the fiercest dictators, in the hands of a head of government who has held the duties of head of services of the military information for forty years, the Burmese people need all our solidarity."
"The worry such as that for the lady of Rangoon is a genuine one."
"Let us listen to the opposition, which has just declared that this hunger strike is a declaration that the Burmese generals are slowly but surely poisoning her."
"Mr President, before the House today is a resolution on Burma, drafted with the support of all major political groups in this Parliament and therefore backed by representatives of all fifteen countries within the European Union."
"It is absolutely unequivocal in its demand: the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi."
"I hope this message is now being heard by the Burmese regime."
"Aung San Suu Kyi is a symbol of resistance to tyranny and personifies the hopes of the people of Burma for freedom."
"She has spent eight of the last thirteen years under some form of detention or restriction and on 30 May 2003 she was seized again and has been held virtually incommunicado, to all intents kidnapped by the regime in a military barracks in the Ye Mon district of Rangoon."
"Four days ago it was reported that she was on hunger strike and that she was in a serious condition."
"The International Committee of the Red Cross must be given immediate access to her in order to assist in the provision of emergency assistance."
"Given the policy of the ICRC not to reveal the detention conditions of those that it visits, Aung San Suu Kyi should also be seen by Italian Ambassador Miniero, on behalf of the European Union, or by Her Majesty's Ambassador to Burma, Vicky Bowman."
"These should be just the preliminaries to her release and to the release of scores of other National League for Democracy members and organisers, elected Members of Parliament, senior Party officials and students detained following the violent attack on opposition elements on 30 May 2003."
"Each member of the State Peace and Development Council that runs Burma must be held personally responsible for the health, safety and wellbeing of Aung San Suu Kyi."
"They must be put on notice that action will be taken against them."
"General Khin Nyunt, the newly-appointed Prime Minister, has talked about a roadmap to democracy."
"Let him show that he is serious, lift the barrier on that road, respond to our calls for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners and recognise the results of the 1990 elections which gave a landslide victory to the National League for Democracy."
"To encourage him, much more needs to be done to increase the pressure on his military dictatorship in Burma."
"Action should now be taken to strengthen the EU sanctions with moves to deny Burmese dictatorship the hard currency it uses to fund its repression."
"As we have seen in other countries such as Zimbabwe, quiet diplomacy does not work."
"Neighbouring ASEAN countries need to do more to bring about change in Burma."
"I call on the Council presidency and the Commission to take urgent action, to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, to bring about her immediate release and, in case the SPDC does not respond in a positive way, to draw up new measures that can quickly be taken against the Burmese regime."
"Mr President, what is achieved by this House's resolutions on human rights and debates on matters of urgent and topical importance?"
"In the case of Burma, not very much."
"In June, we called for the speedy introduction of democracy and for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained in what was at the time a secret location."
"She has, since 1988, been campaigning for more democracy, and was awarded our Sakharov Prize in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991."
"It was partly through our pressure that representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross were able to visit her."
"There is, however, no prospect of democracy being introduced with any sort of urgency."
"Although the new Burmese Prime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, published, on 30 August, a roadmap for free elections by secret ballot, no firm date has been set for them."
"My fellow Members are right not to set too much store by promises of democracy and such things as the summoning of a constitutional convention, for it is the armed forces who take decisions on all important matters, and the convention will have no influence on them whatever."
"Aung San Suu Kyi has been on hunger strike since 31 August in order to make a forceful protest against her detention."
"Let us, too, have done with half measures!"
"The EU's imposition of a visa ban and its freezing of the overseas assets of Burmese associates of the regime are nothing like enough."
"As a community of values, one that exalts the maintenance of democracy and human rights as its supreme principle, the EU must take a hard line with the junta in Rangoon."
"Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters must be released from detention at last."
"The results of the free elections in 1990 must be accepted, power must be handed over to the forces of democracy, and the roadmap must be implemented, but under international supervision."
"Commissioner Nielson, I urge you to press for tougher action to be taken and for further sanctions to be imposed."
"These should, I believe, include an embargo on goods imported from Burma and a boycott of tourism in that country."
"That, perhaps, will be the sort of language they will understand."
"Mr President, as we are all deeply concerned for the personal safety of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi we have to remember her own words: 'investment that only goes to enrich an already wealthy elite bent on monopolising both economic and political power cannot contribute towards egality and justice, the foundation stones for a sound democracy'."
"The SPCD's announcement to restart the National Convention that would lead to free and fair elections has to be taken with caution."
"In the 15 years the regime has ruled Burma there has not been a single democratic reform."
"In fact the human rights situation in Burma has become worse."
"There has to be a very clear message from the European Union that relentless pressure will be applied to the Burmese regime."
"Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi and the other political prisoners must be released immediately."
"We should be prepared to strengthen our sanctions to encourage the SPDC to relinquish its grip on power and fully respect the results of the last elections."
"Exports of oil, gas, gems, minerals and timber which provide the majority of the regime's income, could be targeted. as could the refusal of visas and freezing of assets."
"Dictators and their regimes and families should not be allowed to leave their country or to acquire any assets abroad."
"As well as increasing the sanctions against the regime, it is vital the EU should try to secure the cooperation and support of Asian countries, in particular Burma's neighbouring countries."
"International pressure is necessary to force the regime to respond positively."
"With Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi reported to be on hunger strike, the EU should intensify its actions to secure her release and the release of other detained NLD members and to support democratic change in Burma."
"We should use our liberty to promote theirs."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I support what Mr Van Orden said."
"He has set the problem out very well."
"There is clearly a very serious problem, and Aung San Suu Kyi should be released immediately."
"It is unacceptable that a delegation from this Parliament is not allowed, and has been refused, permission to visit her."
"There is a real need for the other states in the region to maximise the pressure for her immediate release and to ensure that free elections concur with that."
"I have to ask how long will the European Union and the United Nations drag their feet and stand back before they increase the pressure for the early release of those held in prison?"
"There is an urgent need for immediate action."
"Words are easy, what we need now is for the roadmap to be implemented."
". Mr President, the Commission is deeply concerned by reports that Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy, may be on hunger strike."
"A statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rangoon dismisses this information as 'groundless'."
"Other sources indicate, however, that the pro-Democracy leader is indeed on hunger strike."
"Therefore it is of the utmost importance that an independent body be given the opportunity to immediately visit Aung San Suu Kyi."
"The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is completely unacceptable."
"The regime's argument that her detention was 'temporary' and 'protective' lacks all credibility."
"The EU has repeatedly demanded immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other leading representatives of the Burmese National League for Democracy and will continue to do so."
"The junta has to understand that her release will serve the interests of the regime, as it has declared its desire to move on in the process of national reconciliation."
"The EU has declared itself ready to actively support the process of national reconciliation in Burma/Myanmar."
"But as long as Aung San Suu Kyi and other activists of the National League for Democracy remain in prison, the basic preconditions for this process do not exist."
"Any serious plan to bring about political change in Burma will need to incorporate a timeframe which gives a clear perspective for the process of national reconciliation."
"We fully agree with the honourable Members of Parliament that this process will also need the support of the international community."
"In this context we would like to reiterate our support for the efforts undertaken by UN Special Envoy Ambassador Razali."
"It is high time for the regime in Rangoon to act."
"If the new government under Prime Minister Khin Nyunt truly has intentions to work towards democracy and political reform, the first step would be to release Aung San Suu Kyi now and to immediately start a dialogue between the various parties concerned."
"The next item is the vote."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of this report because I believe that, in order to increase the effectiveness, transparency and coherence of aid grants, we must endeavour to give all developing countries the option of allocating the aid they receive as they see fit, providing they fulfil the criteria of transparency, adequacy and proportionality."
"Given the lack of definitive conclusions on the effects of such a process, what is needed first of all is a vote of confidence in the ability of the beneficiary states to act responsibly."
"Such a move could enable these countries, if they see fit, to promote competition between suppliers of goods or services, thereby potentially reducing additional costs and the risks of corruption inherent in tied aid."
"Despite adopting this principled stance, I would recommend caution, a gradual approach and the phasing in of the measure, because to do otherwise could lead to some States refusing to grant aid to developing countries, despite having the desire to do so, on the grounds that they cannot simply donate funds without receiving any form of compensation in return."
"I suppose that, given the ambiguous nature of some political powers and public administrations, the corruption that we are attempting to prevent through the proposed untying could be perpetrated in other ways."
"I would, therefore, recommend that that the Union monitors and keeps a close eye on the way in which this measure is implemented, in order effectively to assess the good that it does and to deter any potential distortion of it."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of the report currently before us because I believe it is important to uphold preferential access to EU markets for bananas from the ACP countries, as is the need to reduce, by means of diversifying production, the economic dependency of these countries on the profits made from the sale this fruit."
"I note and share the rapporteur's concern about the environment, and I would suggest a gradual and appropriate approach to withdrawing support from farms that are not 'environmentally friendly'."
"I endorse his call for the Commission to pay particular attention to the needs of those countries such as Cape Verde and banana producers in Member State territory that, in this regard, do not even make use of the appropriations to which they are entitled. We must continue to give them our support."
"in writing. (FR) The reason why we abstained in this vote is twofold."
"Firstly, under the terms 'protect ACP bananas' or 'the supplier countries', protection really goes to the capital invested in this sector, often though large financial groups in Great Britain or metropolitan France."
"Nothing, on the other hand, protects the real producers, the banana workers, against low salaries imposed on the pretext of competition, or against lay-offs carried out by both the winners and losers of the trade war."
"Secondly, this vote is destined in the end to be biased in favour of one or other of the players in the global competition of this sector."
"We refuse to support one or other of the camps in this rivalry, the winner of which will be one of the multinational groups and certainly not the workers in this sector, nor consumers or taxpayers."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 September 2003."
"Just ten days ago, on the morning of 11 September 2003, Members heard the news of the tragic death of Anna Lindh, the Foreign Minister of Sweden."
"As a former President of the Council and as a friend to so many, she was well-known in this House."
"On behalf of the European Parliament and in my own name I sent our most deeply-felt condolences to Anna Lindh's family, her friends and colleagues and to the Swedish people, for an insupportable attack on her person and on freedom and democracy in Sweden."
"All who met Anna Lindh came to know and appreciate her exceptional qualities of warmth, intelligence and openness of spirit: she was the exemplary face of modern European politics."
"Today many will recall moments spent in her vivacious and always stimulating company."
"Many, I expect will recall her direct and unpretentious personality and style."
"She was one of the very best."
"Our hearts and thoughts go out to her family, friends and loved ones."
"She will be greatly missed."
"I would ask you to observe a minute's silence to mark our respect."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Mr President, thank you for your sincere words concerning Mrs Anna Lindh."
"We grieve for Anna and miss her, in Sweden, Europe and throughout the world."
"As you said, our thoughts go first and foremost to her family, husband and two sons."
"Anna succeeded in combining the things we often talk about, namely family life, parenthood and a politically very active life."
"She had daily contact with her two sons. She went home for parents' evenings arranged at the school attended by her boys."
"She was an unusual politician of the very best kind: one day she was at the UN, the next day she was meeting other foreign ministers, and the day after that she was standing in the market square with immigrants to Sweden or engaged in a discussion with school pupils."
"She was sincerely committed, not only to domestic policy and to the world, but also to European cooperation."
"She did a lot to gain grass-roots support for European issues in Sweden."
"She also did a lot for Sweden in Europe and was Europe's voice in the world."
"It was a privilege to be able to work with Anna."
"She was well-informed; she was committed; she was almost always happy; and she was considerate."
"We best honour Anna's memory by fighting for democracy, human rights, a more open society and the enlarged EU that was one of the most important issues for Anna."
"She fought for wider and deeper European cooperation, as well as for a more active foreign and security policy."
"It is by doing the same thing that we honour Anna's memory best of all."
"(Loud applause)"
"Before we move to the order of business I should like to mark and welcome the positive vote this weekend in Latvia, which showed an overwhelming majority in favour of EU accession, with a very high turnout of voters."
"This brings to a close a round of successful referenda in nine of the ten Accession States."
"The Cypriot Parliament ratified EU membership unanimously on 14 July 2003."
"I am sure colleagues will wish to join me in marking this milestone towards the target of an EU of 25 Member States on 1 May 2004."
"We look forward now to the completion of the process of ratification in the parliaments of the Member States."
"Mr President, we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are emphatically in favour of hearing what the Commission has to say on this point."
"This presupposes that the Commission has at length come to a decision enabling it to set out its position tomorrow, as there would be no point in initiating a discussion if the Commission were still engaged in deciding what to do."
"It is perfectly clear that this company's immense economic significance for the French, and indeed the European, labour markets, and the particular technological dimension involved, mean that everything possible has to be done to keep the company afloat."
"We in the Socialist Group back the motion."
"By way of qualifying that, though, I would like to say something that I discussed with Mr Wurtz earlier, namely that we should take the trouble to listen to the Commission, and dispense with a resolution;"
"I do not think it would make much sense for us to draft one under extreme pressure of time."
"If that proviso were to be accepted, we would support having this item on the agenda."
"Mr President, I believe that Mr Schulz's reference to the need for preliminary investigations, as well as his serious approach to the problems, indicate that a debate on them would be premature."
"At the moment, I do not see that the conditions he has enumerated for a serious debate have been fulfilled, and it is for that reason that we oppose the motion."
"The fact is that we should not have a debate if it is to be conducted only on the basis of an emotional response to day-to-day politics, in the absence of the necessary conditions for a debate, and without us being able to complete it with a resolution."
"Mr President, I regret that the PSE Group made no attempt to contact me or my office about this proposal they were going to make."
"The Committee on Petitions would very keenly wish to respect and observe the Rules of the House and that is why our Chairman, Mr Gemelli, took careful legal advice."
"The legal advice we have received from the Parliament's Legal Service is that we can most certainly proceed with the report on Thursday."
"I myself have submitted an amendment which I will commend to the House on Thursday."
"It simply says that this House reserves its right, if it does not receive information from the Commission, to carry out further parliamentary inquiries."
"I regret that Mr Cashman is seeking to make this so contentious."
"The first petition came to us in 1997."
"There is no good reason why this House should delay debating that report."
"Thank you, Mr Vallvé, you clearly have a very active interest in this matter."
"Mr President, I will be very brief."
"I would just like to bring up a matter which has already come to the attention of this House several times. I am referring to the drama in which the Nigerian citizen Amina Lawal is embroiled."
"Amnesty International recently circulated an appeal suggesting that her sentence had been confirmed."
"The latest reports, however, also from Amnesty International, suggest that that is not the case and that her appeal will be heard at a hearing on 25 September."
"I therefore call on my fellow Members to use this week to make further demands for the Nigerian authorities to bring this absurd persecution to an end."
"I would also ask you, Mr President, to pass on the feelings of outrage (which have been expressed several times by this House) awoken in us by the persecution, on perfectly absurd grounds, of this Nigerian citizen."
"Mr President, on this European Car Free Day we discover that the direct train between Brussels and Strasbourg has been abolished."
"This means that once again hundreds of people have had to use their cars to get here."
"It is an absolute disgrace - dangerous for the environment and for the image of Parliament."
"It is our job to set an example."
"I therefore call upon you to start negotiations immediately with the French and Belgian railways to solve this problem soon."
"Every session there are complaints about the accessibility of Strasbourg."
"We are tired of it!"
"We must cut the Gordian knot with regard to the seat of this Parliament once and for all."
"Mr President, I should like to denounce the fact that, last week, another two workers died in Greece and two others were seriously injured in the mines belonging to the president of the Association of Hellenic Industries, Mr Kyriakopoulos."
"These two deaths come in the wake of another six deaths as the result of similar accidents at work, together with dozens of injuries in September alone."
"It would appear that workers in the countries of the European Union - and I am speaking of Greece in particular - are indeed considered to be expendable resources and their health and their lives are being sacrificed by big business to the quest for maximum profit."
"It is my impression that this intolerable situation is not manifesting itself in Greece alone."
"The evidence proves it, perhaps more intensely in Greece."
"Hundreds lose their lives and thousands are injured every year in my country alone."
"Imagine what is happening in the European Union as a whole."
"If you think this is in keeping with generous proclamations about employment, about securing health and safety in the workplace, then we really are mistaken."
"That is why we believe that this is yet another sign of the system under which we live and the barbarity of that system towards people trying to earn an honest living."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to a serious matter."
"The Preparatory Committee for the World Summit on the Information Society is sitting in Geneva."
"Firstly, two non-governmental organisations - the organisations Reporters Sans Frontières and Human Rights in China - have been denied access to this committee."
"Secondly, the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society is to take place in Tunis."
"Now, the World Organisation Against Torture informs us that Tunisia has appointed as president of the Summit none other than General Habib Ammar, a former Commander of Habib Bourguiba's National Guard and former Minister for Internal Affairs, the creator of the national headquarters of the Special Services in Tunisia, famed for its use of torture in the country."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you to intervene to prevent responsibility for the UN World Summit on the Information Society being given to a person whose hands are stained with blood from torture, which would thus, as a result, penetrate the Internet and the information society."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since I have not had the chance to engage in a proper political debate on the Commission's actions, I will use this one meagre minute to express my disappointment with the Commission's actions, which should be criticised in three areas, to my mind."
"The first area is budgetary policy and the Commission's ongoing inflexibility in interpreting the criteria of the Stability Pact."
"This runs counter to the interests of the European economy and stands in the way of economic recovery."
"The second cause for complaint is linked to the inflexibility of this Commission's actions with regard to competition policy, an inflexibility which is impervious to industrial logic and the interests of European industry."
"The third reason is linked to the Commission's behaviour regarding the Intergovernmental Conference: while all those who champion the draft Constitution are closing ranks to defend it, the Commission has proposed a renegotiation of that draft Constitution at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I am disappointed with the Commission, which has ceased to be the driving force behind Europe and become a burden, but I will now stop criticising it!"
"You are unanimous in that."
". (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the many Members who contributed to this report."
"I would like to thank everyone who provided us with information during the hearings in Parliament and during our visits to Galicia and Brest, but also all those people who spontaneously sent us information by email or by letter, or who sent us entire files."
"All these cases were very interesting and they helped us a lot."
"I would like to make it clear, however, that the intention of this report is to improve safety at sea as much as possible."
"That is the only thing we were working on."
"First of all, we had to find out as much as possible about the Prestige in order to learn lessons from it."
"We then had to go through all the regulations, both European and international, in order to see where we could make improvements."
"It is clear that the Commission did not wait for our conclusions, although we had enough contact with the Commission during our work."
"Suggestions were made, and I think that the Commission worked quickly and well in this case."
"What went wrong with the accident involving the Prestige?"
"One of the initial conclusions of the report was that there were no safe havens in the area where the accident happened."
"For me this is one of the two most important conclusions."
"The ship was moved away from the coast, and by moving the ship away from the coast they made the consequences of the accident, at least in geographical terms, more serious than they otherwise might have been."
"The Erica II package contained a guideline on safe havens."
"If we had applied this, the whole thing would probably have looked different."
"I am pleased that the handling of the system of safe havens has been accelerated."
"I hope that there will be a proposal for compensation very soon - the Commission has in fact promised that."
"We are also asking for clear management structures - and this is very important - for safe havens."
"The Member States had to report on the system in their countries by 1 July."
"As far as I know, they have in fact all done that."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission to give its opinion on the quality of the documents it has received."
"What are they like?"
"Would this have made cases like the Prestige less serious?"
"Are we now establishing an effective system?"
"That is the first question I have for the Commission."
"Another lesson I certainly learned from what happened to the Prestige is that we have to inspect old ships better."
"Either we have to take them out of service if we think that they are dangerous, or, if we think they are still OK, we must check them very thoroughly to establish whether they are in order or not."
"If all the reports are to be believed, in the case of the Prestige the inspection of one or both of the ballast tanks was certainly not performed entirely according to the rules."
"I think that it is important for us to also cross-examine the classification company and ask them whether they might not be able to tighten up their rules on that point."
"It is not sufficient to only look at the state of a ship at a particular point in time and inspect it every so many years."
"We also need to look at the way in which the ship is used."
"In the case of the Prestige, there may have been a problem with the ship being used as a mobile reservoir, and that could have weakened the ship's structure."
"This was not taken sufficiently into account as it was not in the rules."
"We must make sure that this kind of thing does not happen again in the future."
"One solution we have put forward - or at least a decision that was taken very quickly - concerns the decision to allow the sort of material that was being carried in the Prestige to only be carried in double-hull ships."
"I agree with that in principle, but we must not regard this as some kind of miracle solution, as new questions are arising in connection with double-hull ships."
"What happens to double-hull ships when they get old?"
"At the moment, all the ships are still new and everything works perfectly, but will these ships still be OK when they are 20 or 25 years old?"
"Some specialists do in fact say that there will be problems with rust and weakening."
"The same things that happened to the Prestige can also happen to double-hull ships."
"We must watch out for that very carefully."
"I would like both the classification company and the Agency to monitor that properly."
"We also have suggestions for tightening up port state control and we have suggestions for following up the guideline on monitoring properly."
"There are so many things in the report and I cannot go into detail about all of them."
"When it comes to handling emergencies, I think that it would be a good thing if we were to have a proper European coastguard."
"I also think - and I think that the Commission's proposal is a sound one - that there should be an anti-oil pollution fleet that is managed by the Agency."
"We must not forget, however, that there is a great deal of expertise in the sector itself at the moment, and we must not duplicate the effort."
"We must make use of existing expertise."
"What I also find important is that there should be an independent body that investigates accidents in the maritime sector like the one in the aviation sector."
"At the moment it is particularly unclear who is undertaking such investigations."
"There is always somebody who is party to a case or who has submitted a claim or who must pay damages."
"There is never a higher, impartial body that investigates exactly what has happened."
"There is such a body for the aviation sector, and I think that there should be one for shipping too."
"I think, Commissioner, and I assume you are in agreement with me on this, that the role of the European Union in the international organisation must be strengthened."
"The Commission should actually be a member of the IMO and put its full weight behind it so as to ensure that we never act in disarray again."
"I do not think we have a major difference of opinion about that."
"The freedom of shipping is not absolute."
"A coastal country must be able to take action against a ship that forms a threat."
"If it is necessary to amend the international rules for this, then we must do so."
"We must ensure that safe havens are made compulsory in the IMO."
"We must regulate shipping in congested and sensitive areas."
"We must do that better than we are currently doing."
"It makes no sense to automatically tow ships 200 miles offshore, as this does not reduce the risk."
"This will not make the ship any better, and it will not make a bad crew any better, but the ship is further away so we think that the situation is safe."
"Mr President, you are being particularly strict;"
"I hope that you will give me a bit more time."
"We must be able to exercise better control over flag states."
"We must pay more attention to the quality of crews."
"We must not criminalise the captain."
"This is important."
"This man is still under house arrest and must report to the police every day."
"I would like to call on the Spanish authorities to take another look at this case."
"In my opinion, and, I hope, in the opinion of most of this Parliament, this man is not a criminal, but he is being treated as one."
"Then there is the wreckage. There is confusion about this."
"There is much less oil on board than we thought."
"I have just received information from the consortium under the direction of REPSOL that is carrying out the work."
"There is still 14 000 tonnes on board, 13 300 in the stem, 700 in the stern."
"The central tanks, which we thought were still full, do not contain any more oil, just water."
"The difference between what we thought in January and what we now think is not the result of leaks but probably came about because more oil was lost when the ship broke up in the disaster."
"Preparations are continuing."
"As the leaks are small, no oil will be brought up to the surface this coming winter; this will be done in the spring."
"There are two more things I would like to say, if you would allow me, Mr President, and I thank you for your indulgence."
"I have asked for a separate vote on a number of paragraphs, because some things have been duplicated in the report."
"I hope that my fellow MEPs will be able to follow me in this."
"I made compromises on seven subjects;"
"I am not going to list them, but I would like to ask everyone to look at them and to endorse them, otherwise we will end up with a document that is much too long."
"My final point is the temporary committee this Parliament would like to appoint to examine at this matter in more depth."
"I note that there is broad agreement on the principle."
"Both my fellow Members on this side and those on the other side of this House have submitted an amendment concerning the establishment of a temporary parliamentary committee."
"The argument is about its mandate."
"I will try to find a compromise tonight or possibly tomorrow morning."
"If I am not able to do so, I hope that this report will not be allowed to bite the dust on account of this, as only one of the 108 paragraphs is about the temporary committee."
"The other 107 are about safety at sea, and that is what we are dealing with here."
". (ES) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Sterckx for the magnificent report he has drawn up as well as all of Parliament's committees that participated in this work over many months."
"I would like to remind you of the current situation as regards the fight against marine pollution."
"It is important to note, Mr Sterckx, that before the Prestige, there was the Erika, and in the same way there was no safe haven then to provide shelter for a vessel in difficulty."
"Unfortunately, too, before the Prestige and the Erika there were many other cases where not only was there no safe haven, there was no political will, either on the part of this Parliament or the Council, or on the part of anyone, to adopt measures that would prevent what happened with the Erika or the Prestige."
"That is the first thing that must be said."
"As you know, the measures we proposed known as the 'Erika I and Erika II packages' have been approved, with the exception of the European Compensation Fund for Tanker Pollution."
"Nonetheless, progress has been made on this last point over the last months and years, thanks to the impetus provided by the Commission - with the support, it must be said, of the EU members of the International Maritime Organisation - to ensure that the maximum ceiling of the IOPC Fund is increased to EUR 920 million, which more than triples the current fund."
"In addition to the Erika I and II packages, other proposals were put forward by the Commission just after the Prestige disaster and they are at present being examined by the Council and Parliament. I must point out, however, that one of these has already been adopted and will enter into force 20 days after its publication, which should be at the end of this month or the beginning of next month."
"This proposal requires the use of double-hull oil tankers for the transport of heavy fuel oil and calls for an acceleration of the timetable for the phasing-out of single-hull tankers."
"In my view, if this had been proposed and implemented after the Erika disaster, we could have prevented the Prestige accident."
"The result, ladies and gentlemen, is that we cannot rest on our laurels because, regrettably, the Prestige accident was not prevented after what happened with the Erika."
"However, we can say something very important and that is that this time we have taken decisions, this time we have acted."
"That is the major difference between what has happened on other occasions and what is happening now."
"The Commission is indeed watching and monitoring the implementation of the measures we have adopted, in other words it is following the actions of the governments of the Member States and adapting them to what has been adopted."
"In that respect, I must tell you that we have had to initiate 10 infringement proceedings against 10 Member States that have not sufficiently incorporated the new provisions on monitoring by port state control and by classification societies."
"This in fact relates to two of the key elements in resolving this issue: port control, which thus enables prevention."
"As regards the situation on the ground, the Member mentioned that various methods of recovering the oil still inside the wreck are being considered and that, according to the two formulas that exist, the competent authorities will adopt measures in the near future."
"I would also like to point out that the beaches affected have been cleaned. This does not mean, however, that there are no longer spillages from the Prestige floating in the sea, in particular around Vizcaya, along the Atlantic coastline, which move with the currents and the winds and can result in pollution along any European coast at any given time."
"I would like to refer briefly to some of the points raised by the honourable Member."
"He asks what went wrong, and he replies that there was no safe haven."
"I think that before the lack of safe haven something else went wrong: a vessel in a poor state of repair was sailing through dangerous seas."
"Then, after that mistake, we found ourselves without a safe haven, just as there was no safe haven in the case of the Erika accident but, much more seriously, just as there was no safe haven a month and a half later in the case of the Vicky accident, when we faced another dangerous situation."
"Thank God it was not a major disaster, but this was purely because the sea was calm and there was the possibility of decanting the cargo on the open sea, not because we had a safe haven available to shelter a fuel-laden vessel in difficulties, a little more than a month and a half after what we had experienced with the Prestige."
"Therefore, it is absolutely vital that we establish safe havens and establish emergency plans to shelter vessels in difficulties."
"The EU Member States made the political commitment to send those plans to us by 1 July of this year, although legally they have until February of next year."
"They have all responded, although inconsistently."
"They refer to different interpretations of the Community regulations."
"What was said here, what was discussed and what was decided upon within the Council of Ministers and this Parliament was extremely clear: they must, at a given time, provide a safe haven, a place of refuge for a vessel experiencing difficulties."
"We are currently assessing the plans drawn up in accordance with the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation and at the next Council I intend to raise this point with the transport ministers and tell them that if they have not fulfilled what the Commission considers to be the requirements in the approved text by 5 February 2004, we will certainly initiate infringement proceedings against those states that do not demonstrate full compliance."
"Therefore, we are going to require in all cases, as we are doing now, full compliance with the regulations currently in force and transposition of the regulations into the various national legislations."
"On several occasions we have talked about the need to improve maritime safety and the European Union's capacity to intervene in cases of serious accidents or pollution."
"To this end, there are the proposals to make changes to the Agency in order to broaden its remit; there is the proposal, and I want to thank Parliament for the support it is going to give us in principle, for the Agency to have resources available, specifically anti-pollution vessels that can operate in rough seas and that are not obliged, as in the case of the Prestige, to stay moored due to the size of the waves but can operate in waves of over four metres."
"The question of the EU's presence within the IMO is absolutely vital, as pointed out by the good Member."
"We are calling for a negotiating mandate for the full incorporation of the European Union in the International Maritime Organisation. On that basis, we want to work, together with the Member States, to promote safety standards, to see to it that flag states take greater responsibility and to ensure better protection of coastal states."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate Parliament on the support it has lent us and continues to lend us over the years with regard to this matter."
"I feel that the outcome is important."
"Once and for all, the European Union has decided to face these problems rather than just waiting for the next disaster along our coast."
"We are working in the post-Prestige period, as I have said, but even next year we will put forward new proposals to improve port controls and to strengthen the Directive on the monitoring of maritime traffic, with a view to introducing a harmonised European traffic information and management system."
"We are also already in talks with our neighbours, for example the Russians, on issues such as this, the establishment of a legal framework for investigations following accidents and the application in the European Union of minimum criteria for flag states."
"I thank you for the work you have done and would like to point out that as regards the issue of crew, there is the aspect of safety where a crew does not speak the same language: safety in an extreme situation is seriously compromised when orders cannot be given or received adequately."
"This is something we are looking at and we have proposed some measures to this end."
"Once more, ladies and gentlemen, I hope I can count on your support to help us to continue to make progress in this area."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank my colleague Mr Dirk Sterckx for his efforts and also to congratulate him on the result he has achieved."
"Initially, we already had good cooperation in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and it now looks as if we can find social support for this."
"The preparations proceeded practically and effectively: people went to Galicia and also to other places to gather information."
"Information from the people on the ground. Information from people who have been thinking about these issues for longer than we have here in Parliament."
"I sincerely hope that the support we have received in our committee will be reinforced tomorrow."
"The next step is naturally for the European Commission to build on this and for the Council of Transport Ministers to provide the necessary support."
"There is still one point which I am worried about and which I have set out in Amendment No 10 together with the rapporteur."
"It concerns the problem ships that have been banned and phased out in Europe."
"We want these single-hulled oil tankers out of service sooner than the IMO currently considers necessary."
"We should not allow these ships to automatically end up on the shores of poor countries and people without facilities to dismantle these ships, with all the associated risks."
"It would be inexcusable if the higher European standards were to result in potential environmental damage because we do not want to face the problem."
"The oil tankers we do not want here any more must not end up on the beaches of the Far East in large numbers."
"The pollution this will cause will be anything up to several times greater than the pollution caused on our own coastline by the Prestige."
"It is my conviction that Europe should introduce a maximum life span for ships."
"This would require European shipowners and European flag states to dismantle their ships properly."
"In my amendment I ask the European Commission to examine whether this is feasible in the short-term on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she will express her support for this."
"I even have concrete indications that environmental protection and economic considerations are running in parallel in this matter."
"The business sector is already formulating initiatives to give concrete content to the chapter on 'corporate citizenship'."
"It is extremely important that we do not stop after today but that we keep going so as to prevent disasters from occurring more frequently both inside and outside the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today finds us again devoting our attention to analysing the causes of the wreck of the Prestige, and its grave and far-reaching consequences."
"This detailed report by Mr Sterckx, to whom many thanks for his excellent work, provides a first-rate basis on which to do this."
"Both the rapporteur and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as a whole have attempted, with great care and thoroughness, to give sober and objective answers to the questions as to the causes and consequences of the disaster and the lessons to be derived from it."
"I lay such weight on that in view of the past political campaign waged by many Members of this House with the objective of getting Parliament to set up a committee of inquiry."
"I am able to say today that, despite all the differences of political opinion in the committee, our real and overriding concern was to bring the facts to light and, above all, to come to the conclusions that are needed if we are to avoid such a disaster repeating itself."
"It was quite remarkable how the Spanish officials, when they appeared before the committee, appeared to misread how things stood in this House and to believe that they did not need to cooperate actively with us in our work."
"This attitude had changed by the time of the on-the-spot visit in Galicia."
"The rapporteur nonetheless - and I quote from his explanatory statement - comes to the conclusion that 'a number of fundamental points remain to be clarified or are the subject of contradictory testimony'."
"He also points out that various investigations into the precise cause of the disaster, and into the question of who was responsible for it, are still in progress."
"These observations were made in mid-June, when the report was being completed."
"In the meantime, several months have elapsed, and new details have become public knowledge, including the fact that the Spanish and the French consulted each other on what was to be done with the stricken vessel; the contradictions in the statements by the Spanish authorities about the quantity of oil disgorged by the wreck and the original quantity of oil that the tanker was carrying; analyses of the effects of oil pollution on the environment and initial assessments of the social and economic consequences after the summer break."
"These confirm what we had feared about the provisional nature and consequent inevitable incompleteness of the Sterckx report's recommendations and conclusions."
"It was for this reason that my group decided to demand that the results of the inquiry be updated, and joined with the other groups in tabling the motion for the setting up of a temporary committee in this House, although we knew full well that there is little time available for this."
"This House's political responsibility demands that, if we are to come to the right conclusions for the future, we must do so with the greatest possible clarity and in full knowledge of the causes, and this can only happen if we act on a joint basis, with close cooperation at national and European level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this issue is, as you know, of immense concern not only to our group but also to me personally, as a Portuguese Member of this House."
"Portugal is one of the countries most vulnerable to this type of incident."
"The Prestige spill almost reached our shores and, a few years ago, an incident with immense repercussions struck Porto Santo."
"Portuguese waters (by which I mean both the waters off the mainland and those around Madeira and the Azores) are subject to intense maritime traffic. That is why we always participate in these debates."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, just as I previously congratulated the Commissioner on her response to this incident and on the determination with which she produced the Erika I and Erika II packages."
"I would say that if the Erika I and Erika II packages were fully implemented and all the measures this report proposes for the future applied over the next two years, we could rest secure in the knowledge that things had finally taken a turn for the better."
"We need to devote our political energies to this, however, because these words cannot sink beneath the waves as the Prestige did."
"They must remain on the political decision-making table."
"This report contains measures still aimed at dealing with the consequences of the Prestige disaster. These measures must not be forgotten."
"I am referring to the explanation for the disaster, the social and economic consequences, and the ongoing environmental consequences, which must be avoided in future. The report also contains more general measures on which, of course, I would like to focus: specific shipping lanes, the question of safe havens, the question of adequate resources for providing assistance in this type of emergency and, above all, a more determined stance on the part of the European Union and all the Member States within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)."
"It is time that all of us went to the IMO together and called for an end to this game of cat and mouse which international shipping seems to have become."
"Only if the Member States adopt a very determined political stance will we be able to make the seas around our countries - around the Community - safe from incidents of this kind, once and for all."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the consequences of the Prestige disaster affect us all."
"Neither the crew, nor the coastal inhabitants in Spain and France, nor the Members of this Parliament can get this drama and its consequences out of their minds."
"For some, this report means the end of the Parliamentary debate on the matter of the 'Prestige'."
"There is much that we do not yet know, however; there are many questions that remain unanswered, and that is disappointing."
"It has been suggested that the Spanish authorities could have limited the damage."
"That is why we support the request to carry out a more in-depth investigation into these facts in order to put paid to the gossip and smears once and for all."
"This investigation is also needed to help us take the best possible precautionary measures to prevent a disaster like this from happening again."
"The rapporteur deserves much praise for his report."
"It is extremely complete and contains a great deal of knowledge about the events."
"I particularly agree with the need for suitably equipped safe havens."
"I also agree with the requirement for oil tankers to be double-hulled and the requirement for an emergency action plan."
"I do, however, have considerable difficulty with the way in which the damage is recouped, partly because we are still unaware of the motivation of certain parties."
"We would have to mobilise all the Community resources to obtain compensation."
"These do, however, form an excellent enhancement of the initiatives of the various Member States."
"There are also international rules for this type of compensation."
"For the time being, I do not consider contributions from the Solidarity Fund to be appropriate."
"Mr President, before I begin I would like to say that I am surprised at this last intervention, because Mr Sterckx is not the only one tabling an amendment."
"The Socialist Group is also tabling an amendment and, of course, what we want is to create a temporary committee, and I do not think that this is the time or the place to call into question the admissibility of this amendment, as tabled, and this refers to both our own amendment and that of the rapporteur."
"Nunca Máis was the cry we heard from November onwards in my region, Galicia - in other regions they were listening much further away - but also in other European regions that were affected by the Prestige disaster, not the Erika disaster, the Prestige disaster."
"Unfortunately, it is not a new cry."
"As someone pointed out, it was a cry that was heard after the Urquiola, Aegean Sea and Erika disasters."
"The world moves quickly, consumer information, a product of our society, requires, like Saturn, new children to devour and new tragedies to hold the attention of the people."
"Clearly, after each tragedy the same thing has happened: some months after, the public's attention moves on to other issues and the promised changes remain just that, mere promises."
"So we are here now in this Parliament with the opportunity to ensure for once that that does not happen."
"We are here to ensure that for the first time a temporary committee is established - which my group has been calling for since the beginning of the tragedy - to analyse the causes and effects of the Prestige disaster, to examine the Community and international regulations concerning maritime safety and to ensure the application of the petitions this Parliament will make tomorrow when approving the report we are debating today."
"I would like to thank Mr Sterckx and congratulate him on his report on my own behalf, on behalf of my group and on behalf of many Galicians who have a great deal of respect for your work, Mr Sterckx, thanks to your dedication, your political sensitivity and, above all, your impartiality."
"The Socialist Group has made very clear its reasons for wanting the temporary committee."
"It has a vision of Europe that goes far beyond the sum of the 15 national realities."
"We believe that it is up to the institutions to promote certain policies, including maritime safety, and it is up to this House to ensure political control, which up to today - and even today - some people have tried to deny it."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur and the Liberal Group share this view and I call on the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in this House to unite with us rather than remaining alone on the sideline."
"Indeed, what was the problem in this tragedy?"
"Was it the lack of places of refuge?"
"No, of course not."
"The person or persons who decided to move the vessel further out to sea have never said that they moved the vessel because there was no place of refuge."
"On the contrary, what they say is that if the same thing happened again today, they would move it out to sea in the same way."
"What was the problem with this tragedy?"
"Well, I believe it was the fact that it was played down."
"It has been said today that a temporary committee for the Erika would be accepted but not a temporary committee for the Prestige."
"Mr Hatzidakis has said things that were much worse, for example that this was a Spanish problem."
"We will talk about that later."
"Thus, two Erika packages were drawn up and yet you do not want to admit that a Prestige package is required."
"The tourism minister in my region, Galicia, says that this is more of a media disaster than an ecological disaster, and he says this with 51 000 tonnes of waste collected from the sea, 79 000 tonnes of waste collected from the land and in France 31 000 tonnes collected from the land and 1 500 tonnes from the sea, solely along the French Atlantic coastline, and he said this 10 days ago, on the same day that the oil reached the Belgian coast."
"That is what the minister says."
"We want a Prestige committee, we want a Prestige package and we want us to go on talking about the Prestige for one simple reason: because the people who are unaware of its history, ladies and gentlemen, are destined to repeat it, and we do not want this tragedy ever to be repeated again, either in Galicia, in Greece, or anywhere else."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I personally have been following this matter very closely from the start, as I, and many others like me, experienced this disaster as an attack on Europe."
"Ten months on, we are debating the resolution which is the result of the investigation carried out by our fellow Member Dirk Sterckx."
"It is a thorough investigation, as he even went to speak to the captain of the Prestige who was not, let us remember, permitted to attend the hearing of the transport committee."
"I was on the fact finding mission to La Coruña and Brest."
"I would like to mention that there were very great differences in the openness shown by the various maritime authorities concerned."
"Openness is evidently still a difficult issue."
"The resolution provides a clear analysis of the facts that resulted in the Prestige disaster."
"It clearly sets out a number of actions which the European Union will have to undertake."
"It mentions the difficulties, such as port state control, and provides a good analysis of the necessary environmental measures."
"I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done."
"I and my colleagues in our group are satisfied with the result."
"As the Council and the Commission are dealing with what is written here meticulously, the call 'nunca mais' (never again) will be heeded."
"The work of the Commission shows that the message has been received."
"The European Agency for Maritime Safety is being given the mandate and the resources to act."
"The resolution also indicates the limits of the procedure to be followed, however."
"My group was initially unhappy with the procedure that has been followed in this matter."
"From the start we have argued for a parliamentary investigation committee or a temporary committee which will 'get to the bottom of the matter'."
"How unfortunate that expression sounds in this context!"
"The facts that have come to light over the past few months are confirmation for us that we were on the home stretch."
"Now we have new arguments."
"First of all, there is still a lack of clarity regarding who was responsible for the decision to tow the ship further out to sea and for the inadequate dispatch of emergency assistance."
"Statements from the French parliament reveal that France was also involved in sending the Prestige into Portuguese waters."
"These facts reopen the whole discussion. The debate on the way in which we in the European Union make arrangements and take decisions about cross-border emergency situations."
"Secondly, we can only now begin to assess and calculate the overall extent of the economic and ecological damage."
"Only now, after the summer, can estimates be made of the damage to the tourism sector."
"I was in Galicia this summer and I saw that there were fewer foreign tourists on the coast, that blobs of oil were being washed up on to the beach every day and that there were still rocks hidden underneath the oil and there were still no warnings about pollution from the ever-present people from the Environment Ministry."
"Finally, the establishment of a Temporary Committee on the Prestige is a matter that also affects the credibility of our institution."
"I personally find it extremely inappropriate that some representatives of the Spanish Government appeared as witnesses in the French parliament, but are not attending the hearings in this Parliament."
"The International Maritime Organisation did not feel obliged to appear before the European Parliament either."
"They evidently think that that is beneath them!"
"This cannot be permitted, something must be done about this!"
"The quickest route to further investigation is the compromise amendment that Mr Sterckx himself submitted in this regard."
"Our group will support this."
"In doing so we are sending a signal to the Commission and the Council that we are closely monitoring what they are doing, and that this Parliament is itself playing an active role in maritime safety."
"Mr President, the aftermath of the loss of the Prestige is frightening."
"I cannot forbear to emphasise that, in Denmark and especially in areas near the coast, including the small islands, there prevails a good deal of frustration at the fact that an increasing number of single-hulled tankers with both light and heavy fuel oils pass through our waters."
"It is grotesque that the EU should invest billions in obtaining a cleaner Baltic Sea, at the same time as there is an increasing amount of oil being transported in ways that constitute a danger."
"The aid to the countries in the area of the Baltic Sea should be linked closely to a rapid halt to voyages undertaken by single-hulled vessels."
"The Danish islands and the area around the Baltic Sea are especially vulnerable to the pollution that can be caused by just one shipwreck."
"Russia's development of its oil terminals, resulting in many instances of oil being transported through the area of the Baltic Sea, is therefore extremely worrying."
"In very practical terms, the EU can do three things."
"Firstly, it can campaign for the Baltic Sea to be classified as a particularly sensitive area."
"Partly because of the limited quantity of water flowing through it, the Baltic Sea is just such an area."
"By classifying it in this way, it would be possible to take the necessary preventive measures to protect the area against dangerous transports of oil through its waters."
"Finally, the EU can also lobby within the IMO for the phasing-out of single-hulled tankers globally."
"Last but not least, it can allow the phasing-out of the single-hulled tankers to be part of the deliberations concerning the allocation of aid to environmental development so that maximum pressure is exerted upon Russia to persuade it to introduce bans on single-hulled tankers putting in at the country's ports."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if contact has been made with the Russian authorities and if there is any news - ideally good news - from them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let me start by warmly congratulating Mr Sterckx, the author of this report; it is outstanding, it is superb, and I would almost be prepared to accord to it the status of holy writ as regards the safety of ships and maritime transport in the future - provided, of course, that it includes those things for which we are pushing, as it is very comprehensive."
"We were told, let me remind you, that the Prestige had set off from the Baltic, and that - leaving Austria and Luxembourg out - it had, at least in theory passed by every one of the Member States, so that what happened could have happened anywhere."
"This means that we need not just technical improvements but also safer shipping lanes."
"We have been told more than once about the blackspots in the Baltic, such as, for example, the 'Kadetrinne', where what basically happens is that ships end up travelling in the wrong direction, so that near-accidents are an almost daily occurrence."
"That is why there is an urgent need for mandatory pilotage there, and that is something we want to bring up in this House."
"It is the Russians who are refusing to accept this, so I would like to see us in this House make explicit reference to it when we vote, and put more pressure on Russia in this matter, as mandatory pilotage is inordinately important."
"My second point is that there of course have to be emergency measures, with clear responsibilities and adequate provision of tugboats."
"Perhaps Commissioner De Palacio will again give some thought to what was said at the first meeting about the issue of linking this with compensation, as this may simplify the practical side of any emergency measures."
"Quite apart from the disasters, we must not forget the mess that is made in European coastal waters on a daily basis."
"In 2001, 390 oil slicks were illegally deposited in the Baltic, with another 596 in the North Sea."
"Commissioner, I think it right and proper that you have put something forward about once and for all categorising this as criminal wrongdoing and dealing with it by means of criminal law."
"Fines are not enough to deal with this; no longer must it be possible to pay them out of the petty cash."
"Such pollution of the sea is a crime, and must be punished accordingly."
"Technology, though, is not the decisive factor."
"I very much welcomed your commencement, in July, of proceedings in respect of infringements of the Treaties against ten Member States that have not yet transposed even the measures decided on after Erika."
"It is, basically, sad that this should be so."
"Those ten Member States should be ashamed of themselves, and the country holding the presidency being one of them is a bitter pill to swallow."
"We need port State control and classification societies."
"The Member States did not need the accident that befell the Prestige to make that clear to them."
"That was what we decided post-Erika, and you yourselves all signed up to it."
"I think, Commissioner, that you will have every support from Parliament in these matters - on which both Parliament and the Council have come to decisions - in pressing for this to be transposed into national law, failing which this whole Council will remain a bunch of hypocrites, and we will be unable to make any promises to the public about safety."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the rapporteur on the amount of work he has done and on the quality of it."
"The report is a balanced assessment of the events surrounding the Prestige disaster and contains sound recommendations, whether on the prevention of such problems in the future or on ways of managing them more effectively."
"The rapporteur is right in stating in today's debate that his report deals with safety at sea, now and in future."
"I always see it as a problem when we discuss an investigative report that it appears, and becomes, a discussion after the event about something that should have been prevented."
"It is a logical step to call for new rules and measures."
"As always where the topic of safety at sea is concerned, there is a considerable risk that nothing else will get done."
"I shall return to this in a moment."
"A major problem in the area of maritime safety is not so much the lack of an international legal framework, but rather the enforcement of the rules and the tracking down of infringements."
"The rapporteur is right in noting that Erika legislation has not been able to prevent the Prestige disaster, which is painfully similar to that involving the Erika."
"Prevention is paramount."
"It is inevitable that the rules will be tightened, although in my view, we should, above all, make a critical assessment of the implementation of existing legislation."
"Our first priority should therefore be a swift and complete introduction and, most of all, a strict enforcement of this legislation by the Member States."
"I therefore believe that it is the role of Parliament to bring this issue to the Council's attention, and I naturally rely on the Commission's support, but I fear that legal procedures in this matter are not all that effective because they take such a long time."
"Of great importance is the designation of safe havens, as well as the use of reception installations for excess oil in ports, which presuppose adequate payment schemes that are uniform throughout the European Union for effective use."
"Major problems result from this latter not being done, and from these installations being used infrequently."
"Moreover, I also have in mind a prevention measure such as the monitoring of dangerous situations and infringements by means of a more extensive application of voice-data recording systems."
"These offer scope for prevention, monitoring and assessment of the situation after the event."
"And last but not least, criminal sanctions with a deterrent effect."
"The Commission proposal on criminal sanctions for environmental offences, on which I am rapporteur, is very much in keeping with the Sterckx report."
"Even though my report focuses on illegal dumping, the implications are sadly the same."
"My fear, expressed earlier, that we will not move beyond the talking stage is, unfortunately, well-founded."
"In the immediate aftermath of the Prestige disaster, the government leaders called for measures and sanctions."
"What has become of this willingness to take action?"
"Now that the proposals have been tabled, we see a very inadequate implementation of the measures in the Member States, and I find out that the Council of Ministers has unanimously rejected the introduction of criminal sanctions."
"My work on a report will therefore be in vain."
"The question that will dominate the next couple of weeks is, how the Commission, Parliament and the Council can be persuaded to adopt a consistent policy."
"An open debate with the Council would be a good start."
"Fortunately, the Commissioner has said that she did not want to be on the sidelines."
"Commissioner, we are watching a game where the players seem to be standing still."
"The above demonstrates that I am in favour of action, and this is why I do not identify all that well with the amendments that have been tabled in favour of setting up a committee of inquiry about the past."
"As I have already stated, we have inquired long enough, we must now implement the measures we have been talking about."
"What we need is a task force."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work, and the Commissioner for her tenacious efforts in this field."
"It makes sense, almost a year after the Prestige incident, to assess the situation and see what lessons can be learnt."
"First of all, with respect to the environment, credit is due to the efforts made by the Spanish authorities, with the invaluable help of fishermen and thousands of volunteers, to extract the remaining fuel oil, minimise the risks, clean up the coastline and repair ecosystems, though it is regrettable that pollutants are still leaking from the wreck every day."
"Secondly, with respect to assigning liability, it is deplorable that, a year on, investigations should be so faint-hearted."
"This is a matter not simply of investigating, trying and punishing the polluter, but also of assigning liability at other levels: firstly, at the level of those who should have inspected the ship and failed to do so and, secondly, at the level of those who conducted inspections and then failed to act on them."
"Lastly, it should be determined to what extent those who managed the crisis are liable. Assigning liability may be an uncomfortable process, but it is an essential one."
"Rather than set up a belated temporary Parliamentary committee on the Prestige, however, our responsibility is to implement, on a daily basis, all the democratic controls falling within our competence, as, indeed, we have today."
"Thirdly, with respect to legislation, I welcome the Commission proposals to shorten the implementation deadlines for the Erika I and Erika II packages."
"The Member States are now responsible for ensuring full and speedy compliance with the regulations enshrining the ban on single hull vessels, more thorough inspections of vessels in our ports, monitoring systems, the list of safe havens and contingency plans in case of accidents."
"Above and beyond these initiatives, however, it is vital to go further and implement new rules, such as establishing shipping lanes further away from the coasts, inspecting ships carrying dangerous substances within the 200-mile zone, drawing up a code of conduct for manufacturers and freight companies, establishing a European fleet of pollution-fighting ships, laying down minimum requirements for resources and equipment for providing assistance, rescue and preventive measures."
"Finally, a clear timetable for introducing changes to international maritime law must be established."
". (NL) Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner a question in connection with what she said a moment ago about the Viking."
"As far as I know, the Viking was not denied access to a port of refuge."
"The ship sailed to Rotterdam because it is a double-hulled ship that had sunk deeper because the double hull had flooded."
"The ship then sailed under its own steam to Belgian waters, which, strictly speaking, is already against the rules, and was denied access to Zeebrugge and Ostend."
"The owner refused to conclude a contract with the salvager."
"So there was a problem."
"This is the information I have."
"It would perhaps be useful if a temporary committee were to institute inquiries into incidents that have not resulted in disasters."
"After all, we could learn a great deal from them about how we should organise things more effectively."
"However, I think that the Belgian authorities, in the case involving the Viking, did not make the kind of errors that we can observe in the present case."
"Thank you very much for your words, Commissioner."
"I wish to join with everyone who has congratulated the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, on the quality of his work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, many thanks."
"Security of supply in the natural gas sector can certainly be an issue for the European Union, which, taken as a whole, is dependent on imports for some 75% of its natural gas, although - unlike with oil - there is no suppliers' cartel."
"I might add that the supplier countries are themselves dependent on exports to the EU, as natural gas is of any value only if it is transported and sold."
"On the other hand, the countries supplying us are Russia, Algeria, Libya, and the countries around the Caspian Sea, the stability of which is a matter of concern to the EU."
"It is regrettable that the Commission does not discuss all this in its proposal."
"What is behind the proposal instead is, in essence, interruptions in supplies to the EU market."
"I regret having to say, Madam Vice-President, on behalf of the lead Committee, that the proposal, as it stands, has found no supporters in this House, and that some of us reject it outright."
"That is not the position taken by the main Committee, which proposes that the plenary should send a message to the Commission, the Council, the participants in the market and also to the supplying and producing countries by dealing with the issue in a new and different way, turning the proposal upside down and - let me say this with particular clarity - refraining from creating a category of dirigiste European actions."
"This, then, is about three things: one is not seeing management so much as being primarily about holding and administering reserve stocks, that is, deterring investors from doing what they are actually meant to do and emphasising the responsibility of state agencies, but rather doing the precise opposite by encouraging businesses to invest, by emphasising the role they play and taking into account the fact that they already do a great deal towards securing supply; the ways in which they do this are various, including the diversification of sources of supply, international pipelines and storage tanks, long-term supply contracts and the like."
"Above all, the Commission proposal fails to engage at a fundamental level with the fact that supply as a whole does indeed have a price."
"Parliament cannot approve the handing over to the European level - represented by the Commission - of instruments that suspend the market price, prevent markets from signalling prices and shortages and make no reference to the prices obtaining in the system of supply as a whole."
"The second essential approach should involve addressing the responsibilities of the Member States, which have done, and are able to do, a great deal in this area."
"I must at this juncture, Madam Vice-President, make the straightforward point that as recently as 1998 - which is only a couple of years ago - the Commission shared the general consensus that what the Member States do in this area was quite sufficient."
"That was, indeed, stated quite officially by the Energy Council."
"In this, the different actual conditions in the Member States also have to be taken into account."
"My third point is that, at EU level, it could then be our task to create a framework for obligations on enterprises, with which we could equip the Member States, so that these in turn could impose this as an obligation on their own enterprises."
"At European Union level, provision could also be made to empower the Member States in crisis situations, conditional upon business not being able to respond itself, or else not in good time."
"Only in extreme cases and grave crisis situations could European law oblige the Member States to take specific measures - I emphasise that it would be European law that would oblige them to act."
"I hope I have not misunderstood what you have just said, but we emphatically repudiate your suggestion that the European level should intervene directly in the government of the Member States, of which there will soon be twenty-five; it cannot do that."
"That Parliament must not under any circumstances approve such a thing was the unanimous opinion of all the committees that have considered this."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, energy is among the key issues for the EU."
"We must take charge of the environmental dimension and security of supply, develop new, and above all renewable, energy sources and use the energy we have more wisely and efficiently etc. Oil too is part of the overall issue, including the security of oil supplies."
"Does Europe need common rules governing oil supplies, together with increased coordination?"
"That is how the debate on the proposal for a directive on security of supply for oil in Europe might briefly be formulated."
"For most people, the answer is no doubt obvious."
"Clearly, it is good for us to have more solidarity in Europe, including where energy supplies are concerned, but, at the same time, we are entering areas in which the Member States believe that each country must have sovereignty in determining the level of common commitments."
"My report makes an attempt to balance these conflicting requirements."
"Most people agree that it is necessary to bring about better coordination of energy supplies in Europe but, at the same time, the Member States want, to a large extent, to maintain control."
"That is especially clear when it comes to oil supplies."
"My report changes a number of points in the proposal for a directive."
"Through a range of amendments, I have tried to find that balance between the Member States and the common interest that is required if we are to achieve a solution that can work well for the oil market and in terms of the needs of the various countries."
"The proposals for increasing oil suppliers' readiness to build up larger reserves - for 120 rather than 90 days - may appear sound, but also contain disadvantages."
"It costs a fair amount to increase the reserves, and both transport and storage affect the environment."
"I therefore choose to retain the present commitment involving 90 days."
"The proposal for enabling oil reserves to be released, even if there is no physical shortage, may appear sound at first glance, but it is clear, where this too is concerned, that such an arrangement would entail large problems and risks."
"The market is not always right."
"That is something we have seen for ourselves in many oil crises, as they are termed."
"At the same time, it is incredibly difficult to develop regulations and agree upon clear and objective criteria that apply in all the various situations we can imagine ending up in when oil prices rise quickly."
"I therefore reject the Commission's proposal to facilitate the release of oil reserves, even where there is no physical shortage."
"My proposal is based upon the need for increased coordination and the sharing of responsibility for oil supplies within the EU."
"This requires changes to the present regulations, without impairing the arrangement that currently prevails whereby countries outside the EU and Europe also participate."
"Existing structures and commitments must apply in the future too, but coordination must be improved."
"The committee has adopted a number of amendments that balance Community and national interests."
"The majority of my own amendments - the most significant - were adopted."
"Some of my amendments were rejected."
"I choose to reintroduce only one of the amendments rejected by the committee."
"This is about the way in which responsibility for security stocks is organised."
"The Commission wants a public body to be given this task."
"At present, the arrangements are different from one Member State to another."
"Nor do I see any reason why, in the future too, they should not be different."
"My amendment is aimed at giving the Member States the opportunity to choose the methods they consider best suit their own countries, without attendant disadvantages for other Member States."
"In Amendment No 28, I therefore propose that it should be up to the Member States to choose whether it should be a public body that has the task in question or whether it is for the individual Member State to opt for another arrangement."
"Two amendments suggest that the proposal for a directive be rejected."
"This is because the proposers believe that proper regulations already exist and that no changes are needed."
"There are quite a few reasons for objecting to this."
"First of all, it has in many ways been shown that there are defects in the present regulations when it comes both to coordination within the EU and to the sharing of responsibility in a crisis situation."
"Secondly - and this is something I think MEPs should reflect upon - rejection would probably mean our depriving ourselves of the opportunity of exercising influence over this important area."
"That is something I think worth noting."
"Madam President, if Parliament were to adopt this report on the proposal for a directive, including the proposed changes, we should, as a result, also have to cancel a number of previous directives, namely directives 68/414/EEC, 98/93/EC and 73/238/EEC."
"- (NL) Madam President, it is a sound initiative on the part of the Commission to table proposals to safeguard security of energy supply."
"We in our society have become dependent on the supply of oil and gas, products supplied to a large group of consumers by a small group of producers."
"It goes without saying that when major interests are at stake in the supply of energy, the proposals must also be well considered."
"This is exactly where the problem lies in the Commission proposal on the security of natural gas supply."
"The first problem is the proposal's legal basis."
"The Commission takes Article 95 on the internal market as its basis."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has specifically recommended having the legal basis examined."
"I am not aware of anything having resulted from this."
"A second problem is that there is no need for this proposal."
"Parliament has recently discussed, at second reading, the gas directive, which deals with security of supply."
"The Commission proposal is not consistent with this; quite the contrary, in fact - it even appears to contradict this gas directive."
"Finally, partly as a result of this, the Commission proposal is ambiguous and leaves many questions unanswered."
"Apparently, these questions must be answered in the implementation phase, and this is not the purpose of a directive."
"A directive aims to provide direction and offer a solution."
"The Commission proposal, however, raises more questions than it can answer."
"Particularly in Articles 3 and 4, the wording is unclear and can be interpreted in more than one way."
"These objections lead the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to recommend unanimously that the proposal be rejected, and in line with this recommendation, I have tabled an amendment for consideration by plenary."
"On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I suggest that the proposal be sent back to the Commission."
"I thank you for your attention and count on your support for the amendment to reject the Commission proposal."
"Madam President, as has already been noted, the EU is at present dependent on imports for 75% of its crude oil."
"If we stick with our policy of burning crude oil in an uncontrolled way, this dependency will increase to 95% by 2020."
"If we were to draft a treatise on the risks and dangers of such dependency and on it effects on the economy and the environment, such a treatise would run to thousands of pages."
"It seems likely that we will shortly reach the limits of the world's capacity for supplying oil."
"The various prognoses by partisan institutes that essentially exist to do work commissioned by the crude oil interests should be regarded with the greatest suspicion."
"What is beyond doubt is that the overall availability of crude oil has decreased worldwide since the year 2000."
"The fact that we in the EU are starting to think in terms of solidarity and about security of supply is therefore something to be welcomed as a matter of principle."
"The problem needs, though, to be seen in the medium and long term context; it will not be capable of being solved without the development of alternative fuels and alternative propulsion technologies, or without changes in our overall patterns of mobility."
"The EU must develop independent technologies to exploit bio-energy fuels derived from renewable primary energy sources, and, at the same time, make full use of the potential for 18% savings in energy."
"This is where it would, without doubt, make sense to make the optional goals binding."
"The amendment following up the idea of the crude oil price being fixed in euros in future is a very interesting one, but there will have to be some serious thinking about what that means in terms of global politics and economics in general."
"I think it likely that it will not be an easy route to take."
"The EU's consumption of natural gas is also increasing steeply."
"If crude oil becomes a scarce resource, that is to say, if it is no longer present in sufficient quantity, the demand for natural gas will increase by even greater leaps and bounds, but those who believe that natural gas can simply replace crude oil as a resource are in a state of perilous error."
"We cannot solve our energy problems by changing from oil to gas."
"Recent years have, however, seen great progress in the development of renewable biogas."
"The essential fact is that we have not yet sufficiently registered this."
"As the technologies are comparatively new - indeed, for that precise reason - they need massive support from the EU's research funds."
"Biogas is a storable and renewable energy source and hence of especial strategic usefulness and value."
"Biogas can be extracted on a local and decentralised basis from biogenous materials such as grass, biological waste, and wood."
"Today, we take relatively low prices for gas and oil for granted, but I believe that, now that shortages are becoming apparent - and oil and gas prices have trebled in recent years - locally-produced renewable energy sources will become a much more competitive proposition."
"Let me now turn to security of supply."
"In terms of the way things hang together generally, I believe that the question as to whether the EU should require security stocks of 90 or 120 days' worth of crude oil is a relatively insignificant one."
"The argument that cost considerations militate against keeping sufficient security stocks for 120 days is one that we could certainly discuss."
"Quite apart from that, however, it strikes me as illusory to believe - a belief expressed by the Commission in its proposal - that increasing security stocks from 90 to 120 days' worth will help enable us to pursue a proactive crude oil price policy."
"If there were to be a real shortage of crude oil, even 120 days' worth of it would bring only minimal relief."
"Here, too, it has to be stressed that we have to set out how - on the one hand - we are going to reduce overall consumption of crude oil and natural gas and, on the other hand, to push through the production of substitutes on a sustainable basis."
"In conclusion, I would like to reiterate something of which I am profoundly convinced, and which has manifested itself in the last few years, that the price of energy can change dramatically over the coming years as a consequence of decreased availability and of the increasing instability in the crude oil-producing countries."
"We see this now in the Middle East, we can see it happening in Central Asia, which is a potential trouble spot, and we see it in Africa too."
"I therefore basically welcome all three positions as provoking thought - an expression that has, I believe, already been used by those on the other side."
"For thought-provoking is what each of them is - whether in the right or wrong way I consider less than crucial - and from them we must develop a long-term energy strategy for Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the principal rapporteurs, Mr Mombaur and Mr Karlsson, have already set out the course that this House's debate has taken."
"I do not share Commissioner De Palacio's optimistic view that her proposal will enjoy the support of a broad majority in this House."
"It will not!"
"Not only the committee's hearings with experts - over which we took a great deal of trouble - but also the debate with Commission officials and our own reflections have led us to the conclusion that these two proposals from the Commission may well have the right objectives in mind, but the means will not command majority backing."
"There is no dispute about the great extent to which we are dependent on imports of crude oil; that much is obvious."
"This is not, though, about the Commission acquiring additional competences in order to influence prices and perhaps retain its own capacity for intervention."
"We take the view that, although there is a need for more solidarity between the Member States and the Commission can certainly do more as regards coordination, the use of Article 95 on the internal market to justify additional competences for the Commission in relation to petroleum products is not appropriate."
"We have therefore considered at length what we should do about this."
"The committee was divided on whether we should reject the whole proposal or accept it as modified by the amendments submitted by Mr Karlsson."
"A single-vote majority on the crucial issue of sending this proposal back does not make for a broad basis, and our group - that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - has discussed what we should do with this proposal; our group took the view that at least the directive on crude oil should be sent back."
"This would give the Commission the chance to take on board the arguments adduced by Parliament in the Committee debates, whilst directing it, in unambiguous terms, to thoroughly revise the directive."
"During the discussions with the experts, I listened very carefully to the arguments against increasing the reserves from 90 to 120 days, which made clear not only the relatively high cost involved, but also expressed a desire for the reserves to be, in future, provided by the Member States and no longer in collaboration with the oil industry."
"I am, for my part, convinced that the proposal for the reserves to be used to influence prices when these change in certain ways does not indicate extensive knowledge of the market realities; such a scheme would fizzle out, cost a great deal of money, and be ineffective."
"On the other hand, we are sure that, whilst the International Energy Agency, whose instruments were fashioned in the 1970s, is unable to make full use of the opportunities presented to it today, the strategic reserve, along with what the USA does to increase it, combined with the International Energy Agency's instruments, would provide quite adequate help when conflicts occur."
"We therefore reject the idea of additional competences at EU level and hope that a majority in this House will back us in doing so."
"Your speech, Commissioner - whatever my undisputed regard for you - did not make it apparent that the Commission has started to do any thinking since the debate in this House and the hearings of the experts."
"I got the impression that it was as if we were only at the beginning of the debate."
"As regards your objectives, we are right behind you, but we do believe that it is the Member States rather than the Commission to whom responsibility and resources should be given."
"Although your role is to coordinate the action they take, this must not be on the basis of a new kind of competence to which - according to the articles on the Internal Market - you are not entitled."
"This leads me to believe that your proposal must be sent back, thus giving you the chance to present a new and revised one."
"Madam President, in my contribution to this debate, I want to concentrate on the subject of the gas supply directive, as Mr Karlsson, the rapporteur on crude oil, has had his group's agreement when dealing with this topic."
"I do not therefore think that there is anything further to be added to what he had to say."
"Commissioner De Palacio, you threw into the scales a very weighty argument in favour of the directive: the protection of the consumer and of security of supply."
"Faced with so substantial an argument, one is almost inclined to shrink back and deny that any criticism of this directive was intended."
"After all, who would object to the consumer being protected or to the security of the energy supply?"
"The question does not even arise."
"I get the impression, though, that this is where the Commission has chosen the wrong track."
"I have to tell you, Commissioner, that I believe that we achieved a good result when we worked together on the directives for streamlining electricity and gas, but I think that we have less common ground on this one."
"I want quite explicitly to refer back to what the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, has told us."
"I can agree with it almost without reservation."
"I think that the reason why you chose the wrong track was that security of supply simply cannot be defined and organised supranationally."
"Security of supply has to be adapted, on a regional basis and dynamically, to incessant fluctuations in demand, which increases and diminishes."
"The differing framework conditions existing in the Member States call for individually-tailored measures on the part of the Member States themselves and of the supply companies involved."
"What is decisive is not the imposition of a single European standard, but flexible use of the infrastructure, diversity of sources, and the way contracts are framed."
"What I find particularly disturbing, though, is the false political message that I believe this draft directive is sending out."
"What, then, is the actual occasion for a directive of this kind?"
"Unlike with oil, there have been to date no major crises in the supply of natural gas, nor is there any cause for concern that one is to be expected in the foreseeable future."
"As has already been said, it was only a few weeks ago that we adopted, with a great deal of consensus, the directive on the internal market in natural gas."
"There were those who said that, by opening up the market, we were jeopardising the security of energy supply; are we not now proving that they were right?"
"Why do we not let the opening up of the market do its work?"
"It is itself a contribution to the security of supply and directly involves enterprises in sharing responsibility for it."
"It appears to me that the draft put before us undermines the elements in the internal market directive that deal with competition."
"I include myself among those who took the view that the draft directive should be sent back."
"Now, for tactical reasons, I recommend another course of action."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we had a discussion with Mr Blokland, and came to a broad agreement."
"All I fear, ladies and gentlemen, is that the Council is not entirely to be relied on, in that members of it are always signalling that they do not want the directive the way it is, but we never get any firm statement to that effect."
"For that reason, I fear that, if we now send the directive back and the Council nonetheless adopts a Common Position - which it can of course do - we will be pretty defenceless when it comes to Second Reading."
"That is why I recommend that we should take the approach to the gas supply directive suggested by the rapporteur, and which, after all, we agreed on with an overwhelming consensus in committee."
"Then we will see what further progress we can make at Second Reading stage."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in June of this year, we voted for the so-called energy package which included, among others, the directive concerning an internal market for natural gas."
"In my view, we succeeded, in June, in adopting legislation not only facilitating the further liberalisation of the energy market but also safeguarding the security of energy supply."
"If this new directive is implemented properly and enforced consistently, Europe can avoid situations of the kind experienced in California."
"According to the new legislation, it is the Member States that are required to offer security of supply."
"This is why, according to the ELDR, the current gas market proposals go way too far."
"After all, the subsidiarity principle applies at all times."
"Commissioner, this applies all the more to the supply of oil."
"Consequently, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I would call for the Commission proposal on oil supply to be rejected and returned to the Commission."
"We have a number of reasons to substantiate this view."
"The legislation already in force is adequate to safeguard security of supply."
"Directive 98 requires Member States to maintain a stock level of 90 consumption days."
"The Commission would like to increase this obligation, but fails to make it clear why a higher stock level is necessary."
"The Commission has failed to explain the expected benefits derived from a higher stock level, let alone how it can justify the expected costs for the Member States."
"It is unacceptable for this Parliament to issue legislation for which any basis is lacking, while current legislation is sufficient and as long as there is no proof demonstrating the need for new legislation."
"This is something that we in this House must emphatically reject."
"I would therefore urge you to support the ELDR Group's position and thwart this superfluous legislation."
"I am given to understand that people from different political quarters in this Parliament are adopting the same reasoning."
"I think that we will be able to reach an agreement during the vote tomorrow."
"I would thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work and I thank you all for your attention."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nobody denies the fact that, given the EU's considerable dependence where the provisioning of natural oil products is concerned, initiatives must be taken to guarantee the continuity of supply of these products."
"Indeed, in this respect, the Commission proposes a number of measures that guarantee a continuous supply of natural gas, but one is right in questioning, as many of my fellow MEPs have done before me, whether the intended goal can be achieved with these measures."
"I do not, in any event, support the most essential measures from the Commission proposal, which I will list below."
"The first measure concerns the increase of the level of stocks from 90 to 120 days."
"Why would the European Union increase its stocks when the International Energy Agency has a global emergency response mechanism at its disposal?"
"Furthermore, the increase in stocks entails considerable expenses, including the construction of storage facilities."
"Needless to say, this would also result in a huge burden on the environment, and costs would undoubtedly be passed on to the consumer."
"In addition, the Commission wants to set up a public body for sustaining natural oil supplies."
"This body would be responsible for at least two thirds of the required stock levels."
"It would, in my view, take more than setting up a new body."
"It appears paramount to me that a sound political relationship should be established with the natural oil producing countries."
"Finally, the proposal also seeks to use market intervention to curb price fluctuations, so that the Commission would henceforth be able to release stocks in the case of expected physical interruptions in supply."
"This, to my mind, serves no purpose whatsoever."
"When you know that even the OPEC countries do not manage to maintain the desired price level, this measure can only be described as wishful thinking on the part of the European Union."
"Finally, I should like to remark that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, together with the rapporteur, has worked very hard on reaching an acceptable and realistic compromise."
"Despite this, it seems more helpful to me to withdraw the proposal."
"The discussion could then be re-opened on the basis of the many well-founded observations that have been made in Parliament."
"Madam President, let me start by saying that, two or three years ago, I prepared a report on the European Union's oil supplies, and I have to admit that what I asked for then was the same thing as what the Commission is calling for now."
"At that time, I called for the reserves to be increased in order to be on the safe side in the event of supplies being interrupted."
"That sounds like a plausible thing to do, and that, in any case, was the policy we introduced in 1974."
"I have, however, learned in the meantime that any benefit from this bears no relation to the cost involved, and the United States' experience with its Strategic Petroleum Reserve demonstrates that emptying the reserves has remarkably little effect on steeply rising prices."
"That should give us pause for thought."
"What this means is that costs are running high and the benefit to us is relatively small, so I would like to say that I agree with my fellow-Members that this is perhaps not the right road to take."
"Perhaps we would have something different to say if supplies really had been interrupted; we would probably be in a state of shock and attacking the Commission, asking why it had not responded to a crisis situation of this kind."
"The only thing is that I see such a situation as highly unlikely."
"It is far more probable that the greatest risk is the economic one set out by the Commission itself in its proposal, that of prices rising, probably creeping upwards."
"That is what our main problem will be with gas over the next ten or twenty years."
"The end result of Europe's increasing dependency on gas will be a slow rise in prices, which we will be completely unable to influence unless, in twenty years' time, we have managed to persuade the Russians to be nice to us and reduce them."
"That will be the real problem."
"Dealing with it will require, not a directive such as this one, but dialogue with Russia and also with OPEC."
"That is what the Commission has already made a start on, and that makes a lot of sense."
"I would like to close with an observation on the networks."
"If we extend the networks, as we plan to do, the effect of this will be similar to that of maintaining reserves, as networks - the ones for gas, at any rate - are a sort of reserve, and extending them produces the same effect."
"That, thank God is a point on which we can agree."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the committee for their helpful cooperation."
"The committee as good as unanimously rejects the Austrian initiative to set up a list of what are known as safe third states."
"All of us want European asylum and refugee policy to be based upon humanitarianism and legal certainty."
"Most of us want to see regulated immigration and an asylum policy that offers protection and sanctuary to those who are persecuted or tortured or whose lives or health are in danger. Unscrupulous traffickers in human beings must not be protected by the EU's asylum policy."
"Nor, however, can asylum policy mean our using gunboats to command vessels containing refugees to heave to or even, as one Italian minister said, using them to fire on such vessels. Nor can it mean treating people who make their way to our part of the world as second-class citizens, moving them around and assembling them in camps outside the borders of the EU."
"If, Commissioner Vitorino, the EU cannot successfully integrate immigrants and refugees and provide a framework for an asylum policy characterised by humanitarianism and legal certainty, we have a time bomb ticking away that is just waiting to explode into social and economic tensions within the EU and into external pressure from all those who are outside and want to come in."
"Let us never forget that the Geneva Convention gives every person his or her own unique right to seek asylum in a foreign country in order to escape persecution and suffering."
"This proposal defines a safe third state as one that has ratified the Geneva Convention, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"The list of European safe third states includes the current 15 EU Member States and the 12 accession countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Switzerland."
"Of the 15 countries that are mentioned on the list, only Switzerland should, however, actually remain on it."
"Why?"
"On 16 April 2003, the ten Member States signed the accession treaty in Athens whereby the Dublin II Regulation and the Schengen Regulation would, in future, apply to them."
"Romania and Bulgaria would not be covered by the Dublin II Regulation until the Council had made a decision 'at a later date' (Article 6. 2 of the proposal)."
"With regard to Norway and Iceland, the Regulation will also only be applicable, via the Dublin II Regulation and Schengen Acquis, once they have given notice that they accept its content and are incorporating it into their national legal systems."
"For these reasons, Mr President and Commissioner, only Switzerland would remain on the list, that is to say the list would be very limited."
"Moreover, the Commission is called upon to monitor developments in the third states included on the list with regard to their compliance with the aforementioned principles, but the initiative fails to put forward any specific procedure for removing countries from the list or adding them to it."
"The committee points out that, respecting the subsidiarity principle, any criteria for drawing up a list of safe third states must be seen as minimum standards, which allow the Member States to enforce higher standards."
"Only four Member States - the UK, Germany, Finland and Denmark - currently have lists of safe third states, either by law or administrative practice."
"The committee therefore questions whether a regulation is the most appropriate instrument, forcing many countries to implement changes without a political debate on the principles involved."
"The committee also emphasises that the issue of safe third states is dealt with in the Directive on Asylum Procedures and should be dealt with there in the future too."
"My remarks about whether a common list really is desirable - which is something I very much question - are of a personal nature."
"The Italian Presidency, which should be present in this House, has promised that the framework Directive on Asylum Procedures will be ready during the autumn."
"That was also stated in Thessaloniki."
"We, in this Assembly, have conveyed that we wish to be consulted again once the directive has been redrafted."
"What is the situation regarding this matter?"
"I had thought of putting the question to the Italian minister, but I cannot see anyone in the minister's place."
"It would have been interesting to know whether we shall be consulted on this issue, but that is something Commissioner Vitorino may be able to answer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would - all in all and in the light of these arguments - ask Parliament to reject Austria's initiative tomorrow."
". (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Schmidt for the concise and clear report he has presented on this Austrian initiative."
"I would also like to make it clear that this is not a Commission initiative."
"This is an initiative by a Member State. It is an Austrian initiative, drawn up by the Austrian Government, and, in consequence, some of the questions put to me by the honourable Member cannot be answered by the Commission, because this is not a Commission proposal."
"The Austrian initiative, however, poses a complex problem related to the use in the European asylum system of the concept of safe third countries."
"The Council has consulted experts who have analysed this issue, and I can say that there is an agreement in principle within the Council in favour of discussing this matter more thoroughly during the next Council meeting on 2-3 October."
"As the honourable Members know, five Member States made a joint declaration in June, calling for the Council to draw up a joint list of safe countries of origin."
"What the Council is discussing at present is precisely the possibility of including a legal provision on how to define such a list, which could be incorporated into the proposal for a directive - this time a Commission directive - on asylum proceedings."
"Linked to this question is another, on which no initiative has as yet been proposed, but which will also be submitted to ministers for discussion on 2-3 October. This is the question of deciding whether a provision of this kind for safe third countries will be included in the directive."
"In any case, both the subject of safe countries of origin and that of safe third countries will be discussed at the next Council meeting at the beginning of October."
"From the Commission's point of view, moreover, the Council will have to consult Parliament once again on the asylum procedures directive as a whole, including in that consultation any possible provision on safe third countries or safe countries of origin which might eventually come to be included in that directive - which, as I said, has still not been ratified."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, applications for asylum are normally processed by the first country that we can describe as a 'safe country' with which an asylum-seeker makes contact."
"If this principle is indeed always adhered to, and if there are enough of what we term safe third states, then what will be achieved is the distribution of asylum seekers over many countries and, as a result, speedy decisions enabling a person to know whether or not he is actually going to receive the support due to a refugee."
"That is what we all want."
"The present situation is unsatisfactory."
"The Commissioner has himself presented EU statistics showing that a number of countries are at present having great problems with applications for asylum, whilst others have hardly any."
"Austria, with almost five applicants for asylum per thousand inhabitants, heads this statistical table, followed by Sweden and Ireland, whilst Portugal, Italy and Spain are at the bottom of the scale with 0.1 applications per thousand inhabitants."
"Comparison of these statistics reveals that Austria has fifty times as many applications to process as do the other states."
"So I ask you to understand why this initiative has been taken, and that it is to be welcomed, in that its intention is to speed up decision-making in the asylum process."
"The fact is that there is no stopping either time or the applications already in the pipeline."
"The Austrian initiative is therefore understandable, and it is also necessary."
"I take a favourable view of it, and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, too, fully supports the substance of an initiative that will give us, in future, a list of safe third states."
"It does for these two selfsame reasons, that we will both be speeding up procedures and, at the same time, sharing the burden."
"As things now stand, though, it can no longer be fitted in to its ideal slot in the timetable, and so I would welcome it if the attempt could be made - by you, too, Commissioner, I would ask you - to sort out this problem with safe third states, if at all possible, when we deal, as we shortly will, with the procedural directive."
"We will then not have to do it by means of a specific regulation, which would take up even more time, but would be able to achieve a quick and definite result by the end of this year."
"I therefore support the proposal that a better way of handling the whole thing would be for it to be incorporated in the directive, but, apart from that, I am very much in favour - and the Group of the European People's Party also has an interest in this - of sorting out the problem of safe third states as soon as possible, something that will, in due course, benefit refugees."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs voted to reject the Austrian initiative on a regulation establishing criteria for determining the states which qualify as safe third states for the purpose of taking the responsibility for examining an application for asylum lodged by a third-country national. That vote clearly reflects a broad consensus, at least a procedural one, to the effect that this instrument is not a useful one, and that seeing the initiative through to its conclusion would be a wasted effort."
"This consensus exists in spite of this initiative's good intentions with regard to the fundamental issue."
"Mr Schmidt has clearly understood that Parliament does not want to turn its attention away from really important matters, and that it is not prepared to take short-cuts which do not actually lead anywhere."
"That is why I, and my political group, support the rapporteur's position."
"In brief, if I may assess the initiative on its own merits and, to an extent, repeat what has already been said here, its overall scope seems extremely limited, both because 10 of the 15 countries classed as safe third countries on the proposed list have already agreed to implement Dublin II and the whole Schengen acquis, and because, as we all know, it is unclear when Bulgaria and Romania will be in a position to be covered by any Community regulation."
"That would make the regulation meaningless, since once Norway and Iceland have incorporated the Schengen acquis into their national legislation, only Switzerland would remain on the list presented by Austria."
"Besides, and here also I am reiterating points which seem uncontroversial, it is hoped that the Directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status will be approved rapidly by the Council, as Parliament demanded in the Watson report and as was promised, furthermore, in Seville."
"If that happens by the end of the year, as we hope, it would quickly render the Austrian initiative obsolete, since this Directive will resolve the fundamental issue of safe third countries."
"When all is said and done, then, Mr President, that is why today's debate took place."
"The fact is that even after Parliament had made a statement on the matter, we were not subsequently consulted about the revised Commission initiative, amended on 18 June 2002."
"The message we want to send today, therefore, is that we wish to make our point of view known through this debate on asylum procedures."
"In the final analysis, that is the crux of the matter, and Parliament cannot accept that a joint solution should be postponed and sacrificed in order to accommodate national prejudices or demands."
"Rather, we must set aside superfluities and hindrances, devoting ourselves without further ado to the task in hand."
"Precisely in order to avoid any further ado, therefore, I will thank Commissioner Vitorino, who has today shed some light on the matter and made our short debate entirely worthwhile."
"Mr President, the large-scale misuse of asylum is a very serious problem in the European Union, and it would therefore be misplaced to discuss ad infinitum the gender of angels."
"Indeed, a new directive should be laid down about standards for the recognition of the refugee status as soon as possible, and we should apply minimum criteria in this respect, whereby the Member States may, and can, apply stricter standards."
"Europe should have specially adapted instruments at its disposal in order to get the asylum problem under control."
"In Belgium, for example, more than 98% of the asylum applications turn out to be unfounded."
"The handling of all those cases requires time, manpower and resources that cannot be used to deal with genuine cases."
"The resultant backlog means that even more files are not dealt with, and, eventually, in that residence permits are granted without any prior investigation."
"Such inefficiency and laxness only lead to a further influx of bogus asylum seekers."
"Resources should therefore be found in order to separate the wheat from the chaff, and the list of safe third countries is one of those."
"It is therefore surprising that the report should question the way in which the list of safe countries relates to the principle of the individual treatment as enshrined in the Geneva Treaty."
"Well, it makes no sense whatsoever, on the one hand, to use a list of safe third countries and, on the other, to treat the files originating from those countries in exactly the same manner as the other files."
"We must have the courage to conclude and recognise that the Geneva Convention needs to be overhauled."
"This Convention dates back to 1951 and its principal object was to receive refugees from Communist dictatorships."
"It is a product of the Cold War, and no longer meets today's needs."
"Not only should we have a list of safe countries, the principle of territoriality should also be included in it."
"The places best suited to receive asylum seekers are neighbouring countries in their own regions, so that Europe's asylum policy is no longer misused on a large scale to circumvent the ban on immigration."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by emphasising my support for the rapporteur's rejection of this initiative."
"We understand the circumstances which led the Austrian Government to suggest it."
"Those circumstances are highly specific to Austria's situation, and were clearly explained during the debate by Mr Pirker."
"We have, on more than one occasion, however, drawn the attention of this House to the problems raised by this type of initiative on the part of Member States occupying the rotating Presidency, since they are often dictated more by internal political exigencies than by an overview either of Community interests or of the healthy development of the legislative framework of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I will also repeat something I have already said once before in this House. It is important to underline the Commission's role in intelligently implementing the scoreboard established for that area of freedom, security and justice."
"This initiative raises various complex problems, which have already been mentioned."
"They include the problem of the regulation itself, which does not really seem to be the most suitable framework for this legislation, for reasons which everyone has outlined; and the issue of compatibility with the Geneva Convention, which was mentioned just now, by which I mean the need for us to take great care to ensure that the existence of lists does not conflict with the logic of individual examination underpinning the principles of the Geneva Convention."
"What really seems important, however, is that we keep trying to define a common asylum procedure."
"It is with that goal in mind, moreover, the goal of the Directive on that procedure, that we must examine, analyse and debate all of these issues."
"It was important for Parliament to vote on that Directive, of which there is a new version on which we have not yet been consulted."
"I would, therefore, like to emphasise the words of Commissioner Vitorino, who mentioned the need for Parliament to vote on that new version in the near future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
". (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the keynote of the Council's action plan on repatriation, adopted last November on the basis of a communication from the Commission, is the need for closer operational cooperation between the authorities responsible for implementing legislation in the Member States."
"The German initiative on the table today, on transit for the purposes of removal by air, has been described as one of the implementing measures required to that end."
"The Commission does in fact believe that a common framework should be laid down for questions pertaining to transit during the repatriation process, which is why the Commission supports the German proposal."
"Airports in other Member States very often have to be used due to the lack of direct air links to the country of origin."
"It is important to establish a clear legal framework for transit procedure in such cases, relating, for example, to the use of escorts and the individual competences of the transit airport."
"This text, produced by the German Government, has already motivated the Italian Presidency to table initiatives advocating similar assistance in cases of land transit and joint removal operations. Negotiations on these initiatives have already begun among working parties in the Council."
"Despite the emphasis currently placed by the Council on operational cooperation, however, it should be observed that a genuine common policy for repatriation should also be based on medium-term legislative measures (such as compulsory mutual recognition of repatriation decisions, for example) which will not only facilitate cooperation between Member States but also establish a certain number of common minimum standards on deportation, detention and removal, ensuring humane treatment for repatriated persons, as the rapporteur mentioned a little while ago."
"The Commission, therefore, intends to table a proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards for repatriation procedures and mutual recognition of repatriation decisions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Kirkhope on the quality of his report, which deals with a vital point linked to the establishment of a common immigration policy."
"This is a subject we have debated many times over the years, arguing that any such policy should proactively promote legal immigration, running alongside an effective campaign against illegal immigration and the traffic in human beings. We have also championed a European asylum system which respects our international obligations on the one hand while, on the other, safeguarding the stability and security of the Union's Member States."
"This initiative relates to the mutual assistance which should be provided in situations giving rise to the need to remove third-country nationals who are the subject of removal orders ending their illegal residence, bearing in mind that air transport has become the most commonly-used means of removal."
"This proposal for a directive aims, therefore, to lay down measures that may be taken by the competent authorities to assist with escorted or unescorted removals at European transit airports."
"The requesting Member State must always ascertain, first of all, whether removal to the state of destination is possible using a direct flight. If that is not possible, the requested Member State must provide assistance with the transit of third-country nationals to be removed."
"Transit may be refused if the third-country national faces the threat of inhumane or humiliating treatment, torture or the death penalty, or if his life or liberty would be at risk by reason of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political conviction."
"In other words, Mr President, we must remain true to our principles: we cannot countenance violations of the principles and fundamental rights on which we base European integration."
"We must also remember that we cannot implement policies liable to encourage waves of illegal immigration, involving the trafficking and exploitation of individuals."
"With this in mind, then, a great many of Mr Kirkhope's proposals are brimming with good sense and relevance."
"Mr President, this is the second time that we find ourselves discussing this topic."
"The objective of Germany's initiative is to improve cooperation between Member States where the implementation of deportation orders is concerned."
"Although direct flights are always preferable, this is not always possible in practice."
"Sometimes transits through other countries prove necessary."
"As the rapporteur has already pointed out, this initiative goes about regulating this tricky topic in the right way."
"The deportation of people - as the minority opinion clearly demonstrates - remains a contentious topic, but, in for a penny, in for a pound."
"An asylum and immigration system is of no value whatsoever if it is not enforced from start to finish."
"This can lead to people being deported."
"In my view, the proposal safeguards the rights of these people and at the same time, facilitates cooperation between the Member States."
"Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to say something about the selected legal basis, Article 63."
"The appended opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is right to see this legal basis as consistent."
"This is a third-pillar procedure in which a Member State takes the initiative and Parliament has only an advisory role."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs often finds this difficult to deal with, and understandably so."
"In my view, though, a political wish for more power should not stand in the way of, or slow down, effective legislation drafted on the basis of the correct legal basis."
"We should let the political wish prevail, for then this will diminish our actual influence on the content."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will not be surprised to learn that my view of this differs from that of the Group of the Greens, and that I am at one with Mr Kirkhope in believing that this proposal for a directive is absolutely necessary as part of a policy on removals."
"If the European Union is to establish and implement, in a credible way, a policy on legal immigration and an effective asylum policy, it must ensure that illegal immigration and the abuse of asylum meet with consequences and that those whose applications for asylum have been rejected, who have gone right through the legal system and have not been recognised as refugees, must leave the country."
"This means, quite simply, that a common removals policy must form part of an EU immigration policy."
"The proposal that Mr Kirkhope has submitted is a very balanced one, demonstrating due appreciation of the concerns that individuals have and taking them into account, whilst, however, guaranteeing that the rules imposed by immigration policy are actually complied with in the way that they must be."
"A removal policy is an essential component of immigration policy and the proposal put forward today adds a piece to that jigsaw, enabling it to be properly implemented."
"Mr Kirkhope and his excellent proposal therefore have my wholehearted support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 10 p.m.)"
"Appointment of the ECB President"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I recommend that Parliament confirm the appointment of Mr Jean-Claude Trichet as the appropriate candidate for the office of President of the European Central Bank."
"The nominee has submitted a written statement and has given oral explanations to the committee in the course of a confirmation process."
"He has convinced the members of the committee not only of his personal integrity and professional competence, but also of his views on economic and monetary policy in the Eurozone."
"At the same time, he has shown that he is receptive to the demand for more transparency and democratic accountability for the European Central Bank."
"Five years after its foundation, the European Central Bank has come of age."
"Its independence - in political, economic, financial, organisational and staffing terms - is guaranteed and is not challenged by the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"Its high measure of independence, which exceeds that of America's Federal Reserve, means that the ECB has a high measure of responsibility for macroeconomic and social development."
"This requires the greatest possible transparency in the interests of democracy and integration policy."
"For this reason, the transparency of decisions and the decision-making procedure is integral to the European Central Bank's role."
"This effort to achieve transparency is reflected in the quarterly monetary dialogue with the European Parliament, in the regular publications and decisions, but also in reports, conferences and the inflation forecasts that are published every six months."
"A kind of cultural revolution has thus taken place in Europe."
"The culture of the national central banks in Europe did not have this kind of transparency."
"Incidentally, transparency is also in the ECB's interests because it is still a new institution, and is thus especially reliant on establishing and consolidating its legitimacy, credibility and trustworthiness as a European authority."
"Ultimately, a nation's monetary system reflects all that the nation stands for and all that it aspires to and endures, to quote Europe's leading economist Josef Schumpeter."
"I believe that at the current stage of the debate, incorporating the Maastricht Treaty in its entirety into the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was the right step."
"Over their centuries of existence, the role of the central banks has undergone radical change, starting with their private form of organisation in history to their changing status in the USA, the concept of combating inflation, and the role of an independent issuing bank."
"It may be too early to find answers to new challenges today."
"The task is to define the role of the Central Bank in a globalised world dominated by trade, commerce and international financial markets."
"That means not only dynamic markets, but also more and higher risks to international financial stability."
"What role, then, can and should central banks play in order to contribute to financial stability, to avoid financial crises and to provide assistance?"
"Is the ECB equipped for a role as a lender of last resort?"
"Is this what we want?"
"The euro has enhanced Europe's international status as well."
"The ECB will have to play an ever greater role in defining and implementing appropriate policies for the global economy."
"We are concerned about the dramatic imbalance in the US economy and the risks that may arise for every other part of the world in the mid to long term as a result."
"Many issues relating to the ECB's future policy are tied in with the appointment of its new President."
"They include the definition of price stability as much as the issue of monetary policy instruments."
"Maintaining price stability as the primary goal must not result in the ECB removing support for growth and employment from its list of tasks."
"Monetary policy is not neutral, so the ECB must play a role, as a macroeconomic actor, in coordinating European policies."
"This is where willingness to engage in ex-post coordination is not enough."
"Decisions will have to be taken on this issue, and fresh impetus must come from the new President."
"The European Parliament expects other measures towards greater transparency as well, from the publication of summary reports of decisions, with arguments for and against the decisions adopted, to the (anonymous) results of voting in the ECB Governing Council."
"What is important is an open and transparent monetary policy in which access to the decision-making process is a given, because this is in all our interests and in the interest of the common good."
"The future President is able to build on the successful work undertaken by the first ECB President, Wim Duisenberg."
"The Members of the European Parliament are confident that he will face up to the new challenges and be able to find the right solutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group has three economy and monetary policy criteria by which we also judge the proposal for the new President of the European Central Bank."
"Only last week, at our study days in Madrid, we redefined and laid down once again the crucial points of our policy."
"The first is a clear and unequivocal endorsement of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We regard the Stability and Growth Pact as the regulatory framework for the Member States' budgetary policies."
"We regard it as a prerequisite for price stability and therefore for sustainable growth and job creation."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is a driving force for reform, and it is the basis on which to achieve more transparency in the Member States' budgetary situations. It is also an orientation aid for the new accession countries as they move towards the common currency, in order to be able to fully accept the euro."
"Our second cornerstone is the independence of the ECB."
"This independence must be expressed through the continuation of the policies that were guided by Wim Duisenberg's steady hand."
"It must be expressed through continuity, trust, credibility, professionalism, team spirit, and vigilance towards change, as well as clarity in its decision and a considerable talent for communication."
"Thirdly, our group says a resounding 'yes' to the single currency."
"The single currency is the basis of a functioning internal market and the expansion of the internal market into a home market."
"These are also the criteria by which we judge the candidate."
"In both his written statements and oral answers, he voiced unequivocal support for the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact, price stability, independence and the single currency, and rejected any attempts to sabotage them as undermining currency stability, price stability, and a policy for growth and jobs."
"When asked about the most important guiding principles, Mr Trichet said, and I quote: 'The highest level of credibility in the pursuit of the objective of price stability, independence, enshrined in the Treaty, vis-à-vis any power or type of influence whatsoever; lastly, realism and pragmatism in the assessment of a financial and economic environment changing rapidly, due to new technologies and changes in the behaviour of economic agents'."
"Secondly, he said: 'Indeed, price stability is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation.'"
"He made it clear that price stability is not enough on its own, and that it must be supplemented by a judicious budgetary policy, by an appropriate balance of productivity gains and moderate nominal compensation growth, and by urgently needed structural reforms. He pointed out that the Stability and Growth Pact provides the overall concept and the common rules for the different economic policies of the Member States."
"In all his answers, he has thus clearly recognised and affirmed our principles as the correct ones."
"For this reason, my group, too, will endorse his appointment."
"(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vast majority of the Group of the Party of European Socialists will give its vote to Mr Trichet."
"Mr Trichet was one of the architects of the Maastricht Treaty and is clearly qualified to head the European Central Bank, but because he is to some extent one of the inventors of the Maastricht criteria which led to 12 of the Union's Member States adopting the euro, he knows better than anyone that there is nothing scientific about these criteria, which were transferred largely unchanged into the Stability Pact: they are the product of a political compromise that reflects the economic reality and balance of political power of that time."
"The Stability Pact is not the outcome of an exact science: like any agreement entered into freely, its terms must be complied with."
"Nevertheless, this pact is not as sacred as Mr Karas would have us believe."
"It can and must be improved, as Commissioner Monti stated in an interview: it is high time that we made what is an intelligent Stability Pact an even more intelligent Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists is in favour of a stability policy."
"The fight against inflation is crucial for protecting Europe's poorest citizens in particular."
"As, however, the Italian President, Carlo Ciampi underlined, there can be no stability without growth and no growth without stability."
"This dual policy is, therefore, necessary."
"The European Central Bank must fight against inflation, but also against recession."
"The Bank has objective criteria for combating inflation, but none for combating recession."
"Furthermore, the European Central Bank must support the Union's other economic policies: in this regard, combating inflation is extremely important but not enough."
"Europe must pull itself together."
"We cannot confine ourselves to constantly calling for stability."
"We must also invest in growth and allocate more money to research and development, to infrastructures in Europe, and to lifelong learning and training."
"We hope that the European Central Bank, with its new President, will give such a policy the appropriate support."
"Mr President, together with the majority of my group and, in any event, all the French members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD), I will be voting against the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the European Central Bank although I have been told that it is unusual to vote against one's fellow countryman."
"Nevertheless, as we all saw, Mr Trichet renounced his nationality in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, saying 'I'm not a Frenchman' - in order to gain the good graces of the Commission, in which he appears to have succeeded."
"The reason for our opposition, however, goes deeper. Jean-Claude Trichet is, as every French person knows, one of the instigators of a policy that sacrifices, which has sacrificed and which continues to deliberately sacrifice growth to the Malthusian dogma of stability."
"For ten years we have been paying for the Central Bank's monetary policy at a rate of one growth point per year and I must say that I am astonished, Mr Lipietz, that you have become such an ardent royalist."
"During the work of the European Convention, we and by 'we' I mean Mr Katiforis and many others, most of the socialists and the Greens, tried to change this dogma and to propose that, in the new European Constitution, as much ambition should be devoted to growth as to stability."
"We failed and I believe that this Parliament, at least those Members who took part in this struggle, would restore some pride by abstaining on Mr Trichet's appointment, because he is so emblematic of this policy which has caused and which continues to cause so much damage, as we see on a daily basis, to the European economy."
"Mr President, I shall be no more of a royalist than Mr Goebbels or Mr Lipietz, and I will therefore be supporting Mr Trichet's appointment on the basis of his professional skills."
"I believe that his qualities are unanimously recognised by the central bank governors within the euro zone."
"He has all the qualities to make a rigorous president of the ECB."
"He does not receive full marks for the monetary policy he will be implementing but I have yet to meet a central bank governor who is open to any other monetary policy."
"I would say, therefore, that if we are looking for the Eurozone's economic and monetary policy to be overturned, we should look elsewhere."
"I wish to add three observations to this statement."
"Firstly, I hope, and for the moment I have no way of telling whether this will happen, that Mr Trichet will be more open to what we must call economic policy coordination."
"Because he has been involved since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, he knows very well that this is founded on two pillars: monetary union and economic union."
"This economic union cannot operate without governments that are able to understand that their budgetary and fiscal policy falls within the realm of the common interest."
"The role of a central bank governor today, unless he or she wishes to be a permanent scapegoat, is to remind governments of this responsibility."
"Telling governments that they can avoid having to coordinate economic policies by simply having a monetary policy and instructing them only to undertake structural reform will not enable the Eurozone to tap into a real potential for growth centred on investment in research, development and education."
"My second observation is that, if we want to restore confidence, we will need this economic policy coordination and not just a central bank that applies the criteria strictly."
"Lastly, I shall take the opportunity provided by this morning's debate to express my astonishment and my concern to see the position adopted by the European Central Bank yesterday, calling for non-inflationist growth and price stability to be included in the objectives of the draft Constitution."
"I believe that the balance of the wording of Article 3 as produced by the Convention is quite satisfactory and that it would be dangerous to follow the lead of the Central Bank on this matter."
"Mr President, a hearing with the president or a governor of the Central Bank always leaves much to be desired, as this person has to be extremely careful in public on account of his position."
"For the rest, I enjoyed his expertise."
"Based on the response to the questionnaire drawn up by ECON, I have come to the conclusion that Mr Trichet is like a clone of Mr Duisenberg."
"I think it will be excellent if this comparison continues to be true in the long-term."
"The difference between the two was the use of language."
"You see, psychology is important in monetary policy."
"Mr Duisenberg never spoke Dutch because English is the main language of the ECB, and as far as I was concerned, Mr Trichet spoke French too much during the hearing."
"I hope that this does not mean that he will still be a little bit French from a functional point of view, because one would want him to defend the case of the euro in clear language in Paris."
"The euro will only exist if the people have faith in their currency."
"For this to happen, we need to have strict enforcement of the rules of the Growth and Stability Pact."
"I am extremely pleased that Mr Trichet is also of this opinion and is continuing Mr Duisenberg's policy."
"It is of the greatest importance that we adhere to the rules of the Stability Pact without political games and without interpreting the rules to promote our own interests."
"Those who argue for a flexible approach to the rules in order to stimulate growth - I am thinking here of Prime Minister Raffarin, for example, deny or do not understand, or even more seriously, do not want to understand, that the percentages mentioned in the pact already have a structural component which operates within all movements of the economy."
"I expect Mr Trichet to continue to follow this line in the future and to be consistent when it comes to the execution of the rules and to speak out clearly on this matter in Paris too."
"I expect the European Commission to do the same and if necessary to impose sanctions on Member States that do not abide by the rules."
"A tight policy promotes the credibility of monetary union and faith in our euro."
"According to the classical economy, die Massengewohnheit der Annahme [the mass custom of acceptance] is the basis for the functioning of money."
"Our willingness to use the euro in the European Union must be confirmed and increased every day."
"Mr President, taking Mr Duisenberg's place will be no easy task, since the current President successfully guided the Central Bank through the formative years of the single currency and, above all, since the need for a more generous monetary policy is becoming crucial for economic growth."
"In his answers before the Parliamentary committee, Mr Trichet emphasised, among other things, the fundamental role of realism and pragmatism in assessing the economic and financial climate at a time of such rapid change."
"That realism and that pragmatism are, indeed, exactly what is expected of the new president."
"The citizens of Europe are calling for more economic growth and more employment."
"Most of the politicians who represent them are calling for more budgetary flexibility and monetary understanding, given the economic crisis which Europe is experiencing."
"We fail to heed or respond to these worries at the cost not merely of leaving matters unresolved, but also of giving impetus to the collapse of the single currency's credibility, in the wake of which citizens' loyalty to Economic and Monetary Union will be weakened."
"The results of the Swedish referendum and the recent surveys of the level of commitment to Europe in Norway are a sobering warning."
"We can no longer gloss over the fact that citizens are starting to think that the cost of the euro is too high for Europe."
"The Stability and Growth Pact, of which the Commission is the guardian and the European Central Bank a fierce advocate, reflects a noble and fundamental ideal, but the way in which it is drafted is not satisfactory because it fails to address crisis situations such as we are in currently."
"Defining broad guidelines for public spending is more important than the level of deficit. The pact does not take this principle into account."
"Encouraging the deficit in order to lower taxes - a policy which when implemented in isolation brings only a few economic benefits, and always creates inequalities - is one thing; accepting the deficit as the result of investment policies that really do help the economy recover is quite another."
"The Keynesian benefits of increasing public spending dry up over a certain level, it is true; it is also true, however, that the launch of subsequent initiatives to promote economic growth, which is absolutely crucial to recovery, will never be possible without increasing public spending."
"Besides, it is very strange that there is so much talk today of economic growth initiatives, when the reforms and goals defined for that very purpose in the Lisbon Strategy are still so far from being attained."
"The ECB, then, is required to show the realism and pragmatism recognised as essential by its President-Elect if the economic system based on the single currency and the common monetary policy, which was constructed so laboriously and with such difficulty, is not to be threatened with collapse."
"That responsibility, moreover, is in the hands of Mr Trichet."
"Good luck!"
"Mr President, on behalf of the CSU, I too would like to voice support for Mr Trichet."
"This is due firstly to his professional competence and secondly to his personal qualities, for he will continue the tradition established by Mr Duisenberg. Although my highly esteemed colleague Mrs Villiers criticised Mr Trichet on the grounds that he did not have anything new to say, that is precisely what we are looking for."
"This applies especially to the ECB's core tasks - low inflation, a commitment to the ECB's independence, and the struggle to uphold the Stability Pact."
"In this context, I especially hope that, as a Frenchman, he will deal critically with his home country. I also hope that the two Commissioners who are our guests here in plenary today, Mr Solbes and Mr Bolkestein, will fight to uphold the Stability Pact."
"Sweden showed us how the wrong budgetary policy in the Member States can influence the vote."
"What I really do not like about this debate is the constant criticism of the ECB."
"The ECB is being held responsible for meeting the Lisbon objectives."
"The main responsibility for meeting the Lisbon objectives lies not with the ECB or indeed with the Commission."
"They can both contribute to the process, but the chief responsibility lies with the Member States, and a great deal of time has been lost here because Member States have not done their homework."
"I would ask all of you who regularly hold the ECB responsible and voice criticism of it to be equally or even more critical of the Member States' failures."
"I think that would take us much further forward."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
". Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs McCarthy, the rapporteur on this complex and technical but important matter, for her excellent work on this report."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteurs of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, who have also made a major contribution to Parliament's work on this issue."
"Computers are becoming ever more ubiquitous in our everyday lives and, quite apart from the box that sits in almost all our offices and quite a few of our bedrooms, microchips are now commonplace in everyday gadgets, such as electric razors, cars and microwave ovens."
"The question of how to define the patentability of computer-implemented inventions is thus becoming steadily more important, especially as such inventions are estimated to cover 15% of new patent applications."
"Indeed, the potential patentability of computer-implemented inventions is already accepted in current European Patent Office practice."
"The proposed directive does not aim to abolish this practice or extend it to cover the patenting of pure computer programs, as many opponents of the directive have claimed."
"The directive is not intended to cover the patenting of pure computer programs."
"Indeed, many have - falsely - claimed that the directive introduces for the first time the notion of patentability of software inventions in the European Union's patent practice."
"That is not the case."
"I am, therefore, all the more pleased that the rapporteur has been able to steer past these misconceptions and produce a highly constructive report which seeks to build on the objective of the Commission set out in its original proposal, namely to clarify the scope of patentability of inventions, which incorporates software, and to harmonise across the European Union, on the basis of existing practice, the proposal which seeks to achieve harmonisation and clarification."
"However, nothing will become patentable which is not already patentable."
"It is in this spirit that the Commission would welcome the amendments to the text proposed in the report by Mrs McCarthy as a further step to clarifying that objective."
"Opponents of the directive have mounted a very vocal and, at times, even personal campaign based on half-truths and misconceptions which play on legitimate concerns over competitiveness, especially for smaller firms."
"But the fact is that the proposal does not introduce software patents and will not have all the terrible effects that the prophets of doom would have you believe."
"It is a prudent, cautious measure which will clarify and, if anything, tighten the rules which already exist."
"I am aware that a large number of amendments to the McCarthy report have been tabled, many of which seek to reintroduce ideas and themes already considered and rejected by the committee during the preparation of the report."
"There are some interesting points but, in the main, I am afraid that the majority of those amendments will be unacceptable to the Commission."
"I am very concerned about this situation: many of these amendments are fundamental."
"There is a very real prospect that the proposal will fail if Parliament chooses to accept them."
"If that were to happen, I fear two possible consequences, neither of which, I suspect, has been foreseen by some Members of Parliament and neither of which would advance the objectives which seem to lie behind a number of the new amendments."
"Firstly, in the complete absence of harmonisation at Community level, the European Patent Office and the various national patent offices would be free to continue their current practice of issuing patents for software-implemented inventions which may blur or even cross the line in undermining the exclusion from patentability of software as such under Article 52 of the European Patent Convention."
"The result would be not only continued legal uncertainty and divergence for inventors, but also a roll-back of the position adopted by almost everyone in this Chamber and, above all, the Commission itself, namely to maintain the exclusion of pure software from patentability."
"We do not want that."
"The proposal rejects that."
"Secondly, in the absence of harmonisation at Community level, Member States are very likely to pursue harmonisation at European level instead."
"Let me explain what I mean by that remark."
"Unlike many other fields, that of patents is unusual in that, as a result of the existence of the European Patent Convention and the creation of the European Patent Office, there is already a supranational patent system in place which covers the whole of the European Union and indeed beyond."
"This system can be operated independently of the Community's legislative process."
"If we fail in our efforts to achieve harmonisation of patent law relating to computer-implemented inventions in the European Union, we may well be confronted with a renegotiation of the European Patent Convention."
"The process of renegotiating the European Patent Convention would not require any contribution from this Parliament."
"The situation is clear: there is a single objective but a choice of means."
"Either we proceed using the Community method or we take a back seat and watch while Member States proceed by means of an intergovernmental treaty."
"It is clear that proceeding via this Parliament would give European citizens a greater say in patent legislation, an area which is so crucial to our economy."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions before Parliament is not, as some opponents of the directive have suggested, a new phenomenon."
"Neither does it argue for the patenting of software, nor for extending the patentability and scope of protection in this area."
"The fact is that some 30 000 patents for computer-implemented inventions have been handed out by the European Patent Office and indeed national patent offices."
"Computer-implemented inventions are present, as the Commissioner has said, in everyday household appliances, from safety devices such as airbags in cars to mobile phones, washing machines and an endless list of other devices with relevance going well beyond the traditional computer industries to the heart of our manufacturing sectors."
"Let us be clear: without this directive, patents will continue to be filed."
"Out of over 110 000 applications received at the EPO in 2001, 16 000 dealt with inventions in computer-implemented technologies."
"In the USA, and increasingly in Japan, patents have unfortunately been granted for what is essentially pure software."
"An EU directive, by setting limits to patentability in this area, could stop the drift in Europe towards a US-liberal style of patenting software as such, and indeed of patenting pure business methods."
"One oft-quoted example of such a bad patent is Amazon's 'one-click' shopping method."
"Clearly this technology is not new, nor is it unique, and patenting of software business methods such as this is not good for innovation and competition."
"It is unfortunate that the EPO has granted it a patent: this is an example of bad EPO practice."
"Without a doubt computer-implemented inventions - genuine inventions which, in some cases, are the result of 10 to 15 years' R&D investment - are important for the European economy."
"At a time when many of our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East, we need to rely on our innovation and inventiveness to earn our living."
"I have seen letters from small companies across Europe which are supportive of this directive."
"A small Belgian company employing 12 people has written to me saying that it needs patents to get a return on its investment, to grow its business and to ensure that others respect its technology."
"It is important for many European companies to grow their businesses through revenue secured by patents and licences."
"This is also the case for a ten-person company in the south-west of England, located in an economic blackspot with high unemployment."
"This company granted a licence to a US multinational for its computer-implemented voice recognition patents, which shows that in the world of global patents there can be examples of David meeting Goliath."
"Without patent protection the small company could have found itself in a perverse situation where its R&D efforts would have been free for the multinational company which, with its team of patent lawyers, would have gained the patent in this area."
"Consequently, the European company would not have reaped the benefits and, indeed, there could have been an infringement of a patent owned by a multinational."
"I have tabled amendments in my report to underline my opposition to the patenting of software as such."
"We want explicitly to exclude computer methods, algorithms and mathematical models from patentability, as set out in a new Article 4."
"I have attempted to produce balanced legislation that takes account of the needs of all sectors of the industry, not just one vocal sector that is against this directive."
"I would be the first to agree that we need more debate on and refinement of the proposed legislation."
"I therefore ask the Commission to look at the crux of this debate: how do we get good patent law which rewards our most innovative companies for their investment in R&D while, at the same time, not allowing companies to use patents to abuse a dominant position, lock up technology and stifle innovation and competition?"
"I therefore ask the Commissioner to look at these amendments tabled in plenary today."
"They are very clear in suggesting that we need to limit patentability to genuine inventions in Articles 2 and 4."
"We want to ensure interoperability to enable computer programmers to engage in reverse engineering practices and to decompile programs for experimental purposes without risking infringement or legal action."
"It is vital that we address the perception that patents are only for big business: small companies can, and do, gain from patent protection."
"However, to have a fighting chance in such a competitive business they need access to affordable patents and assistance with legal fees to protect and enforce their patents."
"Other amendments seek to ensure that the granting of a patent does not allow monopoly or abuse of a dominant position."
"We also want to protect the open-source community which makes a vital contribution to competitiveness in the area of software development."
"Therefore, I ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the amendments and to recognise them in the spirit in which they have been tabled, as a genuine attempt to ensure that Europe develops good patent law in the field of computer-implemented inventions."
"This does not mean rubber-stamping bad practice in Europe, but developing good practice for the future, good law, good patent examiners, and a quick death for applications that are clearly not inventions."
"We also want to ensure that multinationals do not dominate in our EU markets."
"We need patents in order to protect our own companies and investments so that they can be effective global players in this fast-changing and rapidly developing software-development market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"First of all, I would like to comment that in the nine years that I have been working in this Parliament I have never been lobbied by any acquaintance so aggressively, so often, so impolitely or so freely."
"There must really be a lot at stake, although I can understand that people are worried."
"The aim of this proposal is to harmonise the European regulations."
"At present there is legal uncertainty on what is patentable and what is not in the area of software."
"This is because the rules of the European Patent Convention are interpreted differently in the Member States and are not being tested."
"This legal uncertainty has adverse effects in terms of the operation of the internal market."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is therefore positive about the aim of this proposal: recognition of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions and more transparent rules."
"It is illusory to think that no patents have been granted for software in Europe up to now."
"The European Patent Office has awarded more than 30 000."
"The directive now being proposed will not make patents for computer programs possible as such and will thus restrict the existing practices of the European Patent Office."
"In general terms, nothing will be made patentable that was not patentable already."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is of the opinion that the directive must be strictly limited to unambiguous cases."
"The condition of technical innovation is essential."
"This is characteristic of an invention, as opposed to an idea."
"Unlike in the USA, we want to prevent so-called trivial patents being awarded, for example on business matters."
"The possibility of linking equipment in order to achieve interoperability is a method of achieving an open network and preventing the misuse of dominant positions."
"I am therefore asking you to support the standpoint of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, article 6A of the report, and of course the other amendments as well."
"Finally, I am asking for your support for the introduction of a grace period."
"This will prevent an inventor from being cheated out of his invention if he publicises it in order to sound out interest in the market shortly before applying for the patent."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this directive and this debate are horrifyingly complex, and also doubly complex, in both legal and computing terms."
"The stakes, however, are extremely high: in economic terms, tens of billions of dollars, in philosophical terms, respect for human knowledge."
"Throughout the 6 000 years of our history, it is by means of copying that the enormous body of human knowledge has increased."
"The prerequisite was that access to the products of science, music, mathematics or of any other field should be free and without charge."
"Copyright compensates the author without calling these principles into question."
"When individuals use materials or harness natural forces, the costs change, the remuneration required is much higher, and patents make such remuneration possible by prohibiting the unremunerated use of the invention."
"A piece of software is nothing more than a collection of mathematical formulae; the creation of new software can use hundreds of pieces of existing software."
"Prohibiting or slowing down this creative development would constitute an attack on the dissemination of knowledge and nevertheless, in future, human knowledge will increasingly take the form of software."
"The 1972 Convention prohibits the patenting of any software but the needs of big business, which has taken advantage of the vagueness of definitions, have led to a surge in the number of such patents."
"The legal position of these thousands of patents is unclear and this is extremely dangerous for millions of individual creators or small businesses."
"You were right to want to put an end to this."
"We need a directive and your draft provides a good working basis, as you reiterated this morning."
"You were right to insist and to write that this is not about extending the scope of patentability, as you stated in some quite recent articles."
"We therefore support your motives, Commissioner, but as we have just heard, many of us, including my own group, consider that you have not followed your ideas through to their logical conclusion."
"You conclude your recent article by this admirable phrase which I applaud: 'existing users of free software can continue to use this free of charge, regardless of future patents filed in this area'."
"This is what we want to hear."
"The technical provision of your directive, however, does not guarantee this freedom."
"We have, therefore, tabled amendments that make a distinction between an invention and a pure product of the human mind."
"The reference to materials and natural forces is not universally accepted and that is the subject of this debate."
"And yet this reference is the only one possible for preventing companies that are powerful enough to create and protect an enormous portfolio of patents from capturing an infinitely expanding amount of knowledge."
"When I read your words, Commissioner, I had the pleasure of thinking that you will agree with us and that you will thank us for having clarified your text."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group does not believe that the amendments approved in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market reflect the current situation in the field of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions."
"We must work on the basis that this is not a proposal for a Directive for patenting computer programs."
"The system for those, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, Mr Rocard, has pointed out, is already regulated by means of a Community Directive."
"We are talking about the field of intellectual creation, which have very different rules from those which govern the field of industrial protection."
"Industrial protection, as Mr Rocard pointed out, relates to the application of industrial uses, and we already have well established rules."
"What has happened here has been a very dangerous tendency on the part of United States jurisprudence, which has allowed purely intellectual creations, which do not have industrial applications as such, to be patented."
"The attempt to establish a monopoly on computer programs by means of patents has caused justifiable indignation on the part of all those who are currently using the open network in Europe, and whose possibilities for action would be prejudiced."
"It would represent a backward step in terms of European progress towards the creation of an information society as laid down in the Lisbon Declaration."
"The Socialist Group therefore believes that the proposal for a Directive must be substantially modified, establishing very clear limitations, so as not to undermine the nature of industrial patenting."
"We cannot end up in a situation here like the United States situation, in which there are currently certain companies which in practice are able to prevent all work in the field of computer programming."
"As Mr Bolkestein has pointed out, the European Patent Office has allowed itself to take this dangerous route to a certain extent, as Japanese jurisprudence has also done, for example."
"And that is precisely why we need a Community Directive."
"We believe that intellectual property in the field of computers must be maintained and that we need a Community Directive which just regulates industrial applications, not computer programs, and which regulates it in a sufficiently clear way to prevent us from taking that route, so that the jurisprudence of the European Patent Office does not drag the countries of the European Union along the road of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions as such."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject we are discussing here is a difficult subject."
"There is a big difference between copyright and patent law."
"That this difference is difficult to define is evident from the amount of lobbying we have been experiencing."
"I therefore thank Mrs McCarthy, who has managed to clarify the line."
"Particularly in her briefing to aggressive lobbyists who I think have incorrectly interpreted this and who want to achieve exactly the opposite of what is intended with this directive."
"That is regrettable."
"The aim of this directive, in my view at least, is to prevent legal uncertainty."
"Mr Medina Ortega and many other fellow MEPs have already given examples of this."
"The European Patent Office in Munich is already using the United States method at the moment and is already patenting software as such."
"I believe that it is necessary to put an end to this by way of this directive, if we get it."
"I think that this is also what the lobbyists who want this directive voted down want."
"I therefore think it is odd that they are calling for this directive to be totally rejected."
"After all, this would make it possible for the US methods referred to by some fellow Members to remain in place and the Patent Office to continue to issue patents for thousands of software methods."
"I think that would be a bad thing."
"We have submitted a number of amendments."
"A large number of these have been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in the debate on the McCarthy report."
"A large proportion of them relate to the protection of small- and medium-sized enterprises, while the purpose of others is to achieve improved definitions."
"I therefore think that the report before us is already suitably balanced."
"I would like to see a number of improvements implemented, however."
"Among other things, I am referring to the grace period which my colleague Mrs Elly Plooij-Van Gorsel has already mentioned."
"I think it would be a good idea to establish this in the directive."
"I would even like to call upon the Commission to go further and include a grace period in all directives pertaining to intellectual property rights we may get in the future."
"It seems to me to be a good thing for the not-so-powerful inventors in particular to be allowed such a period of time so that they can find out whether there is a market for their products."
"I have also submitted an amendment concerning new inventions with software that is computer-implemented and which - to put it very clearly - is not patentable per se."
"This amendment intends to set a limited period for new inventions, if you separate them from the software, which - to put it very clearly - is not patentable."
"Why?"
"Because with a patent application, even if you do separate it and even if the product is not patentable per se, you have a number of legal procedures at your disposal with which you can keep businesses out of the market for a long time."
"I think that would be a bad thing."
"I am also of the opinion that such an approach does not conflict with the non-discrimination policy of TRIPS as it does not exclude a particular sector."
"I think that it will simply be sending a clear signal."
"Now a few words about interoperability."
"Interoperability is necessary, but we must make a clear distinction between standalone inventions and inventions intended for use in conjunction with other inventions."
"We have applied this distinction in our amendment."
"I call upon fellow Members to support the directive in any event, in order to prevent legal uncertainty in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the huge amount of work she has done."
"It does sound as if we, in actual fact, all have the same intentions."
"I should like to praise the Commission, and also the rapporteur, for having emphasised what the intentions are, namely to create still more development and still more investment in small- and medium-sized enterprises in this area."
"What is odd is the simple fact that small and medium-sized enterprises are not pleased with this directive when those are what the intentions are."
"Why are they not shouting with joy and, upon being consulted, using their answers to praise the proposal for a directive?"
"Why are small and medium-sized enterprises not demanding that we implement this directive in one go?"
"Why are all the software industry's innovators not demanding that we introduce this directive at breakneck speed?"
"Why are they doing almost the opposite?"
"That should, I think, in any case give rise to a certain amount of doubt as to whether we are in actual fact doing what we say we are doing."
"The ostensible purpose of the directive is to ensure that rights can be enforced."
"Being able, however, to enforce rights in this area or, perhaps, to protect oneself against others' maintaining that their own rights are being violated is so expensive that it is transparently obvious to small and medium-sized enterprises that this is not a method of progress for them."
"Legal cases of this type cost approximately one million euros and are not the kind of thing that small and medium-sized enterprises can get directly involved in."
"We say that we shall not extend the existing provisions."
"That, I think, sounds wise, especially since the European Patent Convention does emphasise that software cannot be patented."
"Let us, therefore, stick with that."
"We are not in fact without rights now."
"We have a legal basis in the form of the European Patent Convention."
"The fact is, moreover, that the European Patent Office has extended the scope of its activities slowly and gradually. If we were now to respond by legalising that extension, we should in fact be heading in the wrong direction."
"We should then be heading in a direction in which it was more and more usual to demand patents on software, but not on pure software."
"My question is therefore: how pure must software be before it is pure?"
"That is a question I have been in no position to obtain a clear answer to."
"Moreover, it is perhaps precisely such questions that should be clarified before we take definitive action in this area."
"I very much want to invite reflection. I very much want to recommend that we allow doubts to be heard and that we listen to what the small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe have to say in this area."
"Mr President, I am a trained architect and have worked as an architect all my life."
"The problem we face in this case is like that which would arise from the introduction of patents in my own field."
"Let us imagine that patents were taken out on stairs so that, in future, approval was needed and a licence had to be paid for before a house with stairs could be designed."
"In a way, that would be a very good thing, since we should not then have all these wretched skyscrapers."
"It is a grotesque idea, however, that an individual colleague of mine or a major firm within my industry should be able in some way to obstruct all development."
"In the design and architectural work I have done, I have of course been protected by copyright law so that my work cannot be plagiarised."
"In actual fact, it is the same with software and all other artistic activity which can of course be compared with the design of software programs in which the design itself is protected by copyright law."
"Permitting the patenting of software in the EU would have negative consequences for the consumer, small and medium-sized enterprises, the whole 'open source' movement and innovation within the industry."
"One would have to be more than usually naive to believe that innovation in the EU were being encouraged by allowing an American firm to take out a patent on the use of the special Danish letters æ, ø and å in domain names, or that it would be of benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises if, before they began to develop their product, they had to invest in a department concerned with legal matters relating to patents."
"It should not be possible to patent either particular items of software or software per se."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is rare for our legislative activity to be the focus of so much public attention at such an early stage as Mrs McCarthy's report."
"That has certainly not made it easier for her to complete her very demanding task, but it has generated a flood of information and arguments."
"Much of it was important and very informative, both for the rapporteur herself and for all of us."
"However, mountains of paper were destined for the waste paper basket from the outset."
"Our intensive work and the fact that it was monitored so closely by stakeholders has produced the compromise which I would encourage you to support and which is reflected in my group's proposed amendments."
"It aims to release us from the pitfalls contained in Article 2 and Article 4, where a new definition of 'technical contribution' opened the way for the patenting of software."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this loophole has now been closed to some extent."
"Admittedly, I would have liked to have achieved more, and the small and medium-sized enterprises in particular had hoped for more."
"Above all, I do not believe that we have made it sufficiently clear that we do not simply want to restrict software patents. We actually do not want to grant any more of them in future at all."
"This is because software patents make life particularly difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises, to whom we have always pledged special protection and support."
"To put it another way, anyone who patents software is playing into the hands of big business, not helping those with great intelligence."
"Let us therefore send out a clear message which goes beyond this compromise solution. Say no to software patenting!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I share the opinion of Messrs Rocard and Cappato and other fellow Members who think that software as such should not be patentable."
"Article 52 of the European Patent Convention excludes software as such and states that ideas and theories are not suitable for patents."
"It must be about technical innovation, and that is precisely the heart of the problem we are all facing. It is also the heart of the directive."
"The Patent Office recently concluded that all programs that run on a computer are technical by definition."
"Under the Patent Office's current practices, it has already awarded more than 30 000 patents, many of which are not actually legally valid."
"Mr Rocard has rightly mentioned that there is a difference between an invention based on the forces of nature and a product of the human intellect."
"I am of the opinion that we must therefore support some of the amendments, which have also been submitted to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and also the amendments submitted to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport in the past."
"These tighten the definition in such a way that, in my view, software as such is excluded."
"If these amendments are not accepted, I will vote against the directive."
"There is a good deal of disquiet among small- and medium-sized enterprises and the open source movement."
"Human knowledge and the dissemination thereof is an important freedom which we in Europe must preserve."
"This must be done if only on account of human dignity, but not solely for that reason."
"We will be even more competitive than the United States and the directive will have to rule out the US situation completely."
"I therefore hope that many of you will vote in accordance with this line so that we will get a directive that is workable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning's debate follows a turbulent period in which the world of computer users, inventors and innovators has been fighting tooth and nail to protect its right to difference, freedom and creativity."
"At the heart of this debate is patentability, with its advantages (when the patent rightly protects the inventor) and its major disadvantages, which involve often conservative monopolies being established to the detriment of young creators."
"Personally, I still support this movement, which I believe follows the same approach as all alternative movements fighting for a less rigid and less commercial society."
"Since this debate opened, we have scored points by tabling proposals for amendments that substantially improve the original draft."
"Recognising that in order to be patentable, a computer-implemented invention must have an industrial application is a step in the right direction."
"A statement to the effect that patents must not be granted for simple computer programs was needed."
"Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the shades of meaning that have been introduced as well as the excessive vagueness."
"At this point in the debate, even at the risk of seeing these amendments fail to receive the vote or then fail to be included, we must state that not all problems have been solved, by any stretch of the imagination."
"I personally shall, therefore, be vigilant during voting and I remain willing to vote against the draft if the improvements prove to be nothing more than a cosmetic attempt to conceal the hold that large companies have over creative minds."
"In this regard, Commissioner Bolkestein's last sentence, which smacks of blackmail, does nothing to alleviate my deep suspicion."
"Mr President, Commissioner, our starting point is also that we do not think that the patent is the right way to protect computer-implemented inventions."
"Up to now, copyright has offered reasonable protection for this."
"With the awarding of patents in this area we are running the risk of actually discouraging innovation and putting small- and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage, something that other people have already pointed out."
"Regrettably, this discussion has actually been overtaken by the practices of the European Patent Office."
"For years this office has been issuing so-called software patents, and these have already been enforced up to the highest international level."
"The proposal that is now before us is really a sort of emergency measure designed to keep the awarding of patents in Europe within certain limits."
"I have some sympathy for that."
"The question is whether there is any point in doing so any more."
"The European Patent Office has already awarded 30 000 patents on the basis of regulations which go further than the present proposal for a directive."
"As far as that is concerned, this directive comes too late in the day."
"On the positive side, the directive will lead to harmonisation and clarity in the Member States."
"The danger that small, innovative businesses will lose out to the monopolies of the big ones will not go away, however."
"This is inherent in the patent system."
"We are sorely aware of this."
"We therefore find the fact that the Commission and the rapporteur are laconically bulldozing over this here disturbing."
"It proves that they have little affinity with European small- and medium-sized enterprises, the backbone of our economy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is the real issue here?"
"The real issue concerns protecting the intellectual property that is the result of innovations in computing."
"There are two conflicting legal procedures in play: on the one hand patentability and on the other, copyright."
"We and I believe the vast majority of speakers in this House, Commissioner, believe that the standard form of protection is copyright."
"Whereas journalists or novelists know that their text is protected by copyright, they cannot then claim the syntax, the morphology, the vocabulary and the grammar of the language they are using as their own."
"The same must apply to software, because software also uses language."
"You claimed in your statement, Commissioner, which was extremely aggressive and even threatening with regard to the criticism inspired by your draft directive, that software as such was not covered by patentability."
"You must not, however, treat people like idiots."
"Furthermore, your directive is at best ambiguous, because your definition of a computer-implemented invention in Article 2(a), can just as easily apply to software."
"Of course, in Article 4 of the draft directive, you appear to limit patentability to inventions, and I quote, 'susceptible of industrial application'."
"This is a concept, however, that you have been very careful not to define."
"We all know that US multinationals have managed to patent aspects as trivial as clicking a button to close a window on a screen, or the idea of alerting users by means of a tune to the fact that they have received an email, or even using a colour to underline words that need to be corrected when a text is revised - and textual revision is susceptible of industrial applications in typography or printing."
"I will also mention the electronic 'shopping basket' used in e-commerce."
"Young creators have even managed to patent the 35-hour working week imposed by the previous government of my country."
"Why, then, is such a text being proposed in this Parliament?"
"Do the interests of the European Patent Office, which is funded according to the number of patents filed, have no part to play in this?"
"The fact is, Commissioner, that there was a strategic choice to make: either to fall in line with the patenting practice of US multinationals - which is what you appear to be starting to do - or to protect the specific characteristics of European law and refuse to let abusive patents have any effect."
"You have clearly not taken the latter choice and it would be reasonable to believe that your directive does not tally with the legitimate interests of European creators."
"Mr President, in all my time on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, this is the first time that I can recall that one of our major directives has received such prominence in the Parliamentary agenda."
"I hope that trend will continue."
"In fact the report was called so early that I was not here on time, and I apologise to both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for not being here to hear their speeches."
"I have listened with interest to what Members have had to say and at this stage in the debate I would like to reflect on what this report is really all about."
"We have an objective to create the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-driven economy in the world."
"Patents are an indispensable part of that."
"I want to remind all of you here, and everyone listening to this debate, that there are hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of people across the European Union working on inventions that have been protected by patents."
"That patentability has stimulated investment to develop those inventions into products that the world wants to buy."
"What we are talking about here is a regime that is legitimately going to encourage invention in all fields."
"Part of the problem we have had in dealing with this is that a lot of the issues that have been raised have come from one particular direction of creativity: writing elements of computer programs."
"Actually, patents are about protecting a genuine invention, a new way of doing something, something that is - as this directive says - susceptible of industrial application."
"I would like to remind colleagues that when you apply for and are granted a patent it does not have to include all the details."
"In today's world almost every technical and industrial innovation requires some form of computer-aided activity."
"Why should we deny protection to people who are working on inventions in that field?"
"The Commission has made a persuasive case, supported by a lot of research, that we need a consistent framework so as to ensure that people know that they can get patents for these types of invention."
"They will also know that they cannot get patents for trivial business process inventions that should not under any circumstances be patented, and will be discouraged from applying for them."
"We know this is difficult to do, which is why we have argued about the wording."
"That is why Mrs McCarthy has done such a good job as rapporteur on this directive."
"She has consistently seen the importance of this in a knowledge-driven economy and has led us in looking at ways of improving and making this work better."
"She has not allowed herself to be diverted by all the noise around her."
"I hope that you will support this directive, and that you will support the thrust of the Legal Affairs Committee's amendments."
"There will be some other amendments but I hope you will resist some of the complicated and abstruse concepts that have been put forward by some people which will make an inventor's life far harder."
"It is invention and creativity that we are here to support and nothing else."
"Mr President, this is a political chamber and I believe that as a political chamber the first question we should consider, as should the Commission, is why this proposal has caused so much commotion and so much reaction."
"It is not fair to discredit any person not agreeing with it and to say that there has been aggressive opposition on the part of lobby groups."
"Because, at least on the part of those who have been in contact with me, university teachers of information technology, experts in patents and industrial property and also representatives of small businesses, what I have heard, rather than aggression, has been concern; concern at the way things are progressing and the danger being faced in terms of the possibilities for inventions."
"The people who advocate this initiative tell us that the only intention is to unify practice on the part of the national patent offices, in a field in which there have recently been contradictory resolutions."
"And that is true; what is not true, or at least what is not certain, and please allow us to accept this intellectual doubt at least, Commissioner, is that this proposal for a Directive is going to resolve the problems which the intention is apparently to resolve."
"Because it is very easy to do so, the practice of the European Patent Office, in a break with what was the traditional approach of European law, has tended towards a practice very similar to that in United States law."
"All the honourable Members know, all the experts know, that European law demands that an invention must be of an industrial nature if it is to be patentable, which means that not only must the method be industrial, but also the result of the product must be industrial, while in US law it is sufficient for it to have a useful application."
"This has allowed certain innovations and certain patents of software programs."
"We therefore insist on this point."
"It makes no sense to say that with the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Commission's proposal these problems are resolved, because they are resolved by means of the amendments approved in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Therefore, if the amendments such as those proposed by the Committee on Industry and the Committee on Culture are not approved, it will be very difficult for us to support this proposal."
"Will we all still be able to use our computers in the future without having to pay patent rights to do so?"
"This is the question that is occupying all our minds."
"What we do not want is the United States situation, one in which patents can be granted on simple computer languages or software."
"We are, however, less able to agree with each other when it comes to describing this."
"We also often lag behind reality; you just have to look at what is happening at the European Patent Office."
"We cannot therefore afford to postpone this any further and must seek proper clarification of what is patentable and in particular of what is not."
"Personally I think that the right balance has been found in the standpoint of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and in the amendments put forward by my colleagues Mr Manders and Mrs Plooij."
"Any form of software is explicitly excluded from patenting."
"Only genuine inventions must be patentable."
"They must thus involve a worked-out technical process with industrial applications and not simply an idea or a language."
"The piece of technology that contains this new technical process must then be protected."
"Not the fact that you need a computer to use it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of things I do not understand."
"I am not sure, for example, that I understand the reasons for deciding to draft this directive."
"If this is simply a problem for the European Patent Office and for applications for patents, I believe that this is really quite a limited starting point."
"What is completely beyond me is that the European Commission, which is so concerned about preventing concentrations in industry, is proposing - if we are to believe a number of experts - support for industrial concentration."
"This appears to contradict the Commission's objectives."
"Nor do I understand the amnesia we are seeing here with regard to the disastrous directive on patenting life."
"No one knows how to implement this directive and its validity is universally questioned."
"Can one patent the cells of a leaf without patenting the leaf itself?"
"The problem of software and of technical contributions is identical."
"The legal uncertainty we faced with regard to the directive on patenting life reappears in connection with the patenting of software, programmes and technical contributions."
"I am struggling to find the right words because the directive gives no clear definition of a technical contribution."
"In light of these uncertainties, I find it hard, Commissioner, to understand what is happening here."
"Mr Rocard referred to 6 000 years of history, but history has speeded up as rapidly in the field of biotechnologies as in those of software and computing."
"Are we going to be able to pursue these rapid developments when economists are predicting that we will have a number of problems to face?"
"In the field of pharmaceuticals, we are told, it is easier to see what is an innovation and it is easier to determine what is covered by copyright or a patent."
"With regard to software, it is still extremely hard to tell."
"Publishers and teachers fear that this type of directive threatens the knowledge-based society, transparency and the circulation of information."
"I thought that the European Commission and Europe had made preventing such threats one of their aims."
"I do not understand what is going on here."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been heavy lobbying around this report because there is much at stake."
"I understand this very well and I share this concern."
"This directive, which is probably well-intentioned, is a threat to scores of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Europe who are at risk of losing their creativity as a result of all these patents."
"These small- and medium-sized enterprises are the avant-garde of the business sector."
"We must nurture these small- and medium-sized enterprises because they deliver innovation."
"This innovation enables us to maintain our position in the world market."
"We are against this directive because it represents over-regulation."
"The present protection offered by copyright is sufficient."
"We Greens are often reproached as being busybodies."
"Well, here is the proof that we are not."
"As a matter of fact, there is talk in the USA of toning down patent laws, which are regarded as counterproductive."
"So why should we have to approve an outdated law in Europe?"
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, and the rapporteur from our group, Mr Wuermeling, for the effort they have made to reach a consensus and, in the case of Mr Wuermeling, to explain the complicated proposal within our group."
"The protection of computer-implemented inventions by means of patents is not a new problem and it must be made clear, as other Members have said in this House, that there is no intention to establish rules allowing computer programs to be patented, but to extend the classic doctrine of patents to computer-implemented inventions."
"We want to apply the existing arrangements for patents to computer-implemented inventions."
"It is clear that we must expressly exclude, as certain amendments do, the patentability of inventions solely because they use a computer."
"With regard to the scope, I would like to focus on a very specific aspect: that of interoperability."
"Interoperability and communication between programmes should be excluded from the scope of this Directive."
"This aspect should be reviewed in a few years time."
"The exclusive use which the law allows holders of patents obliges the holder to explain their invention so that it may be comprehensible to an average expert in the field."
"I believe that in this case as well we must stress this aspect and oblige the person applying for a patent to sufficiently explain the object of that patent, though perhaps not until the publication of the source code, as Mr Harbour has said."
"That would be excessive."
"As I have said, it is especially important in this field to oblige applicants to describe their invention."
"Finally, many people have criticised this proposal and have said that it may harm small- and medium-sized businesses."
"However, what we are doing is applying traditional patent law to small- and medium-sized businesses, in the knowledge that patents have increased growth and have made it possible for all types of companies - including small ones - to carry out research and invest in new developments."
"We are competing today in a globalised market in which the United States and Japan develop many patents and inventions."
"We cannot be left behind and we must regulate here in Europe as well the possibility of registering computer-implemented inventions as patents."
"Mr President, our debate today is of the utmost importance not only for software developers in the European Union, but also for all those with an interest in knowledge."
"This is because, by proposing the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, the Commission is preparing the ground for the patentability of human knowledge."
"It goes without saying that human knowledge cannot become the birthright of large multinationals, which are almost synonymous with Microsoft in this case."
"We all know that this proposal for a directive responds neither to the economic, scientific and cultural challenges facing the software sector, nor to the imperative to promote innovation, technological development or the interests of SMEs."
"We know how important it is to maintain a supply of free software, and how important it is to give the public sector tools for developing a content and service industry, in order to protect the common interest."
"For that reason, and to give voice to the strong opposition of scientists and software publishers, this proposal for a directive must be rejected."
"I hope that this plenary will send a clear message by approving the proposal for a rejection, which I endorse and which was tabled by my group."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a directive which regulates the uniform application of the law by patent offices and patent tribunals is to be welcomed unreservedly in the interests of a well-functioning internal market and for the sake of avoiding distortions of competition."
"However, we must not forget that the development of new software must not be impeded, the position of SMEs must not be made more difficult, that we must create legal certainty, and that we want to prevent new distortions of competition."
"I took every letter and every discussion very seriously."
"Some fears are rooted in misinterpretations. Some points of criticism are based on American realities and not on the content of the directive."
"However, I do endorse some of the arguments."
"The European Patent Office is violating the laws between EPAT, the Member States and the European Patent Convention."
"The definition of 'technical contribution' is too vague."
"A clear distinction between technical and intellectual inventions is required."
"I therefore support some of the amendments and compromises proposed by my friend Mr Wuermeling and the rapporteur."
"I would like to thank my fellow Member Mrs Echerer for the large quantity of material that she supplied."
"I support some of the amendments proposed by my colleague Mrs Kauppi: Amendments Nos 107 and 108, which clearly define the term 'field of technology', Amendments Nos 112, 114 and 117, which make it clear that computer programs do not, in themselves, constitute patentable inventions, Amendment No 116 on the limits of patentability, and Mr Wuermeling's compromises in which reference is made to the current EPAT legal framework and there is a clarification to the effect that trivial inventions and business methods are not patentable."
"I hope that we can all live with these amendments."
"Mr President, in the absence of a clear legal framework, the rise of the abusive and opportunistic exploitation of legal provisions designed to protect patents, with the aim of profiting from advances made in information technology to do business, constitutes an unacceptable way of privatising human knowledge."
"Privatising knowledge in a field which cannot, even in the broadest terms, be confused with that of technical and industrial inventions simply means creating new business opportunities."
"Progress in information technology results, by definition, in advances which are as a rule unpatented, or which cannot be patented by anyone in particular, being added to the sum of knowledge."
"The right to make a profit of those who are most assiduous in appropriating common property should not be protected by law, much less should their interests take precedence over the interests of the general public, the interests of the economic and scientific communities, and the interests of civilisation, in knowledge not being commercialised."
"The application of true software inventions, resulting from investments, to the process of production should, of course, be protected."
"There is a world of difference, however, between protecting these legitimate interests and using that protection as a pretext to patent software indiscriminately."
"The proposal on the table today, with the compromise amendments suggested by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, manages to reconcile these different concerns in an acceptable way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by expressing my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, and our shadow rapporteur."
"Ladies and gentlemen, do we really need this directive?"
"Like many other Members, I too have received many worried letters expressing serious concerns about the Commission proposal."
"I have taken these concerns very seriously, because no one wants to stand in the way of innovation in Europe or impose additional burdens, especially on the small and medium-sized IT companies."
"After weighing up all the pros and cons of this directive, however, I am convinced that we will make the right decision tomorrow if we adopt this directive with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and various other clarifications."
"We need this directive."
"It is simply designed to harmonise existing practice governing the granting of patents in Europe, and in this context, more stringent criteria are to be adopted, particularly for the granting of patents."
"I have a number of reasons for supporting the directive. Firstly, the directive will ensure that we do not end up with US conditions in the granting of patents."
"Simple business methods and pure software will not be patentable in Europe."
"The directive states this quite explicitly, and it is also prevented by the fact that patent protection for computer-implemented inventions requires a technical contribution."
"I am grateful to Commissioner Bolkestein for stating this quite explicitly again today, and would like to reiterate that we have no doubt about this. This House should also not act as if someone might interpret the report in a way which conflicts with the clear statement by the Commission and the proposed amendments, which are also very clear on this point."
"Secondly, the directive is not meant to protect trivial software."
"Patents on trivial software, such as progress bars, are a cause for concern and are not desirable."
"The directive also makes it clear that we do not want to grant patent protection to trivial software."
"I would ask you, in tomorrow's vote, to support the proposed amendments in which we clarify a number of points, but also to give your endorsement to Mrs McCarthy's report as a whole."
"At a time when we want to encourage innovation, growth and competitiveness within the European Union, in the form of a simple legal harmonisation and clarification of the varying practices and interpretations in this area, this directive represents a real step backwards, a real change of approach in relation to the European Patent Convention and to the directive on software copyright, because it seeks to extend to the limit the possibilities of patenting this software."
"We should consequently reject this directive, because it contains too many vagaries."
"First of all, computers have become a crucial tool in transmitting ideas, thoughts and knowledge."
"Excessive private appropriation of this tool is, therefore, dangerous. Copyright is more suitable."
"Secondly, from the economic point of view, innovation in the field of software is often accomplished by SMEs or by independent researchers, for whom patenting is not a suitable instrument because it is too expensive, too involved and will create a legal nightmare."
"It has not been proven that protection will increase innovation, growth and competitiveness."
"Lastly, in the context of the economic rivalry that pits us against the United States, adopting this directive would allow some large corporations, which act as monopolies, to maintain their dominant position in the market."
"We shall, therefore, continue to wait for a directive drafted after a more detailed study has been undertaken into the economic effects on innovation, competition and intellectual property policy in this sector."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if it were up to the EVP (Evangelical People's party), there would be no software patents at all, and if it were up to you, Commissioner, there would not be any either."
"This is how I understood it, after I received the proposal and after I read the existing legislation - and the innumerable letters we have all been receiving - more than once."
"Many people in our group support the starting points and the objectives in the Commission's proposal."
"Commissioner, I hope that you will be able to support a number of amendments which have been submitted on behalf of our group and which - building on Mrs McCarthy's report and the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - define matters more clearly and put more flesh on the bones of the monitoring task."
"I do not believe the assertions that are persistently doing the rounds that this proposal would be a bad thing for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"More legal certainty and uniform application of the legal rules in the internal market are things small- and medium-sized enterprises have a particular need of."
"In my view, small- and medium-sized enterprises do not have a specific problem with this directive, but they do have a general problem with the patent system as such."
"Much of the criticism in the letters boils down to that."
"This is true both when they enjoy the protection of a patent themselves and when they have to deal with the patent rights of others."
"Hence my question, Commissioner, as to whether you and your administration could not think creatively about how we can achieve a European approach that will enable small- and medium-sized enterprises to improve their position in patent land."
"I have not submitted an amendment on this as I think that this text is not an appropriate place for this from a legal point of view."
"I do, however, think that it is important enough to make this suggestion now from a political point of view, and I would therefore appreciate it very much if you could give me an answer."
". Mr President, since there are many amendments, I do not propose to go through them all one by one, indicating the Commission's response."
"With your permission I should like to provide you with a list of the amendments by number, showing which of them the Commission can accept, which we cannot accept and which we could accept with suitable rewording"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Our rapporteur wishes to add a few words."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on which we are about to vote is not what it appears to be."
"What it appears to be is a set of amendments to the Sirene Manual, which regulates the exchange of information between Member States in relation to the Schengen Information System."
"Underlying this vote, however, is something a little more complex."
"This Parliament was initially asked to express an opinion on two initiatives, but was refused access to the relevant documentation, the Sirene Manual."
"At a meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Greek Presidency promised to grant that access so that we could express our opinion."
"The Council agreed to nothing of the sort."
"The Presidency gave in and the ban remained in place."
"The Council eventually agreed to reveal in committee the nature of the contents of the classified documents."
"On the basis of that information, I proposed the report which will be put to the vote today, approving the two initiatives with amendments. My committee accepted that proposal."
"By voting in favour, however, we are sending a political message to the Council, a message of good faith and collaboration, but also a message saying that it is time to stop playing hide-and-seek with the European Parliament."
"The Council has delayed opening talks with Parliament on how to deal with classified documents within the area of freedom, security and justice."
"This situation cannot continue."
"This type of information is usually available for Council work, but is not passed on to us in Parliament."
"There are other cases, too, in which information regarding a Member State is not passed on until the Member State in question decides that the information should no longer remain classified."
"If we are to prevent these situations from reoccurring, clear rules should be drawn up on dealing with classified documents in the legislative area, laying down an appropriate level of security and accepted by all the interested parties."
"That is the message we are sending the Council through this report."
"Therefore we will vote on the legislative resolution, the adoption of which will close the procedure."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Recommendation (A5-0307/2003) by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the appointment of Mr Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the European Central Bank (10893/2003 - C5-0332/2003 - 2003/0819(CNS) (Rapporteur: Christa Randzio-Plath)"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"

"(Parliament rejected the Commission proposal)"
"President."
"We must now ask the Commission if it intends to withdraw its proposal."
"Mr President, I do not know whether the procedure would be appropriate, but in Amendment No 3, relating to paragraph 5 of Article 8, there has been an error on presentation."
"If we take account of the justification for the amendment, which is aimed at increasing legal certainty and protection of holders of earlier trade marks or geographical indications, on drawing up the text, earlier trade marks have been mentioned on five occasions and on only one occasion are earlier Community geographical indications mentioned."
"I would therefore like, if possible, to introduce an oral amendment now, to the effect that each time the text of this Amendment No 3 mentions an earlier trade mark, it is followed by 'or Community geographical indication', because that was the purpose of the amendment, but for some mysterious reason, caused by printing gremlins or I am not sure who, Mr President, it has not been included."
"Mr President, Amendment No 11 concerns a temporary committee."
"It is an amendment which I submitted myself, because although the two main groups had submitted a proposal for a temporary committee, there was no agreement on the content."
"I am trying to keep out of a political discussion that is taking place in one of the Member States of the European Union."
"I have always tried to do so, and I am now trying to do so again."
"Hence this oral amendment, which I think should combine various proposals better."
"I will read it out in English as that is the language in which the amendment was drawn up."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Sterckx for his initiative and to say that I regret the stand being adopted by the socialists."
"Obviously, we shall return to vote on his initial amendment which, I am sorry to say, contradicts Article 193 of the Treaty and Rule 151 of our Rules of Procedure, because it basically makes provision for a covert committee of inquiry."
"Consequently, I think that we are voting for something which contradicts the Treaties and the Rules of Procedure."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Hatzidakis, that was not a point of order."
"It is quite clear that more than 32 Members objected to the oral amendment."
"It is therefore not accepted."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 3:"
", rapporteur. (NL) Mr President, on the basis of previous information I had written that there was still 13 000 tonnes on board the wreck."
"Yesterday I spoke to the people who are trying to bring this oil up to the surface, and they told me that there was still 14 000 tonnes in the wreck."
"I would therefore like to amend these two figures."
". (FR) Inserting new provisions on the legal position of political groups constitutes the umpteenth time that these groups have been recognised."
"In principle, there is no reason why the statute of the political groups in the European Parliament needs to be enhanced any further, although one can condemn the desire that has been expressed in recent years to eliminate any form of national representation in the Chamber, which would only lead to a highly partisan form of representation."
"Nevertheless, let us not go too far by making Parliament the seat of a future 'government of the parties'."
"The influence exerted by the major political groups in this Parliament is already very - or even too - large; it should not in future become a kind of monopoly, which would be inimical to pluralism."
"We have recently seen disturbing abuses committed by certain groups that are in a dominant political position, mainly due to their federalist ideology."
"I am thinking here of the dissolution of the TDI Group, which was an extremely serious political act given that even Member States no longer ban political parties!"
"There should be no more shifts of this type."
"I am concerned, however, when I see that the proposed text gives further consideration to this idea, which threatens people's freedoms."
"Let us show some moderation!"
". (FR) Austria, using the right of initiative that Member States still have in the field of immigration policy, has just submitted a useful proposal: to draw up a list of European countries considered to be safe in terms of their respect for human rights in order to determine whether to allow them to examine applications for asylum lodged in a Member State by persons that have passed through their territory first."
"This measure appears to simplify matters, to be common sense, to match the need for closer cooperation between European countries in light of the influx of refugees of all sorts."
"This Austrian initiative, which we supported, has not been fortunate enough to meet with the favour of the European Parliament which, in rejecting it, invoked various legal grounds, all of which are quite specious."
"One of the reasons given is that this text would anticipate a future, broader directive on asylum procedures."
"The real reason is quite different."
"As we can see from the explanatory statement, the European Parliament is clinging to a narrow interpretation of the Geneva Convention, which was founded on the principle of 'non-refoulement'. This principle is absolute and without shades of meaning or conditions."
"It is this narrow interpretation that must be called into question if we genuinely want to address asylum-related issues."
". (PT) The Republic of Austria's initiative, motivated by a need to respond to 'a dramatic increase in asylum applicants' in that country, 'contrary to the European trend', fits into the logic of building 'Fortress Europe'."
"The initiative aimed to produce a list of third countries which qualify as safe for the purpose of taking the responsibility for examining an application for asylum, on the assumption that the country responsible for studying an application was the country where the applicant entered the Union."
"Of the countries on the proposed list, Switzerland is the only non-EU Member State and non-Schengen country. It can therefore be deduced that Austria's immediate targets were the EU candidate countries with which it shares a border."
"As the rapporteur points out, however, there is a fundamental principle at stake here, namely that the Geneva Convention allows any applicant for asylum to have his or her case individually examined."
"Even if a list of 'safe third states' could be established, therefore, an application for asylum could not be automatically rejected because of the provisions of the Geneva Convention."
"Besides, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, a regulation would not be the right instrument to use in relation to such a vital aspect of the sovereignty of the Member States."
"The reasons for rejecting the Austrian initiative are more fundamental than those relating to the rapporteur's recitals."
"Basically, the concept of 'safe third States' runs counter to the international obligations arising from the 1951 Geneva Convention."
"This is most striking in the case of gypsies fleeing the racism and discrimination that they suffer in countries such as Romania or Slovakia - States that the EU considers to be 'safe'."
"As the rapporteur acknowledges: 'Even if a list of safe third states were to be established, an application for asylum cannot be automatically rejected, as this would override the Geneva Convention'."
"Declaring that a request for asylum is 'clearly unfounded' is already common practice."
"The list of 'safe States' will be used as a pretext for further encouraging a hasty examination and the systematic rejection of requests."
"The idea of keeping refugees in their regions of origin breaches the principle of non-refoulement."
"This is refoulement by another name."
"In France, the Villepin law calls this 'internal asylum'!"
"This means choosing refugee camps over welcoming refugees."
"The Austrian initiative must be rejected on the grounds that it authorises attacks on the right of asylum in Europe and anticipates the way in which, in the context of drafting European legislation, the Member States intend to abandon any consideration of the right of asylum and of the Geneva Convention."
". (PT) I support the rapporteur's arguments, since I believe that the scope of the Austrian initiative is indeed limited."
"The rapporteur observes that this regulation would only apply to Switzerland, which is clearly insufficient justification for drawing up such a legal instrument."
"At the same time, the inflexible nature of the proposal makes no provision for mechanisms allowing the list of 'safe states' to be revised and countries added or removed. That might lead to the proposed system being paralysed ab initio, without any benefits flowing from it, either for those making asylum applications or for those implementing the law."
"The rapporteur notes that underlying this Austrian proposal is the problem of a 'dramatic increase' in applications for asylum in that country, which is regrettable."
"Here, however, is where I part company with the rapporteur, since I have to say that I consider it normal and even positive for a Member State to try to exercise its rights and solve its specific problems even if, at times, this might breach the abstract principle of 'Community interest', which is very often elusive when it comes to security and justice."
"I also support the rapporteur's contention that the concept of safe third European states should not be targeted by a separate regulation, but should rather be dealt with as part of the comprehensive approach established by the framework of the Directive on asylum policy."
". (FR) We have voted against the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the European Central Bank because during his hearing he expressed no desire for there to be any political reorientation given the semi-stagnation in which the heart of the Eurozone is currently plunged."
"Instead, he stressed that there is no recession in the strict sense of the word, which is true, and that the Eurozone's key interest rates are ' the lowest for fifty years', which is also true."
"His implicit message was that he could not, in his capacity of president of the ECB, do much more than that."
"He is not completely wrong, moreover: the slowdown currently enveloping France and Germany probably cannot be corrected by the tools of traditional monetary policy, because this is the result partially of the single currency - a rigid framework applied in a uniform way to economies that are quite different."
"In light of this situation, the room for manoeuvre available to the President of the ECB is perhaps limited."
"Is entrapping one of the very people responsible for inventing the Maastricht Treaty, however, not a fitting punishment for history to mete out?"
". (FR) We have voted against 'the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the European Central Bank' partly because of the institution but also because of the man himself."
"The ECB is responsible, in the field of money and credit, for applying a policy which is entirely favourable to employers in the European Union and, consequently, entirely unfavourable to the working classes."
"We oppose the very purpose of this institution, whoever is in charge of it."
"Nor, however, did we want to let the man himself off."
"Before being nominated for this position, Jean-Claude Trichet was the governor of the Banque de France."
"In this capacity, he is responsible for a 'restructuring' plan at this bank that has resulted in half of the branches being closed and the loss of over 2 000 jobs, in other words more than a quarter of the bank's staff."
"A man who is happy to carry out such jobs deserves no more support than the institution whose reins he is about to take over."
". (PT) Predictably, Mr Trichet, President-Elect of the European Central Bank (ECB), has reaffirmed and reinforced the EU's current economic 'triangle', based on price stability, the Stability Pact, and the 'Lisbon strategy', despite the increasingly obvious incompatibility of this 'triangle' with economic growth and employment."
"In his answers to the questionnaire, Mr Trichet reaffirms that price stability is a prerequisite for growth, 'by limiting the rise in unit production costs' - in other words, through wage restraint, reductions in real wages and increases in productivity, but only for employers, in this case."
"Mr Trichet also mentions the consensus among EU governments on the 'Lisbon strategy', and the need to emphasise the approach based on structural reforms, by which he means liberalisation, increasing the flexibility of the labour market and gradually privatising pensions."
"Finally, he reaffirms the Stability Pact's 3% threshold, claiming that no government has called for it to be altered and that the Commission has shown it to be essential."
"This is rather ironic, given that France is about to fail, for the third year in a row, to comply with that very requirement."
"Mr Trichet also supports amendments to the ECB's voting procedures, which fundamentally distance countries like Portugal from the financial decision-making process."
"That is why we voted against this report."
". (FR) We have voted against the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the European Central Bank, because for fifteen years he has embodied the doctrine known as 'competitive disinflation', which has inspired the neoliberal policies that have been implemented in our countries."
"It is under his influence that salaries were frozen in order to allow an increasing share of the wealth generated to be channelled into financial profit."
"This policy has stifled growth and stimulated the rise in mass unemployment."
"We do not, therefore, want to see this disastrous dogmatism transferred to the European level."
"We are not making this an issue of personality, however: we would probably vote against any other candidate, because it is the concept of the European Central Bank itself that we dispute on two key points."
"An institution of this nature should not be given a needlessly rigid target of 2% for inflation, which blindly prioritises finance over employment."
"The ECB should also be placed under genuine democratic control that goes further than the caricature of democracy that consists, as it does today, of voting for full powers to be given to a man over whom we will henceforth have no control whatsoever."
". (NL) Today we have to choose a new president of the European Central Bank, but there is not really any choice at all."
"From the outset the intention was for the bank to be located in Germany with a Frenchman at the helm."
"As the Dutchman Wim Duisenberg had done the groundwork for the ECB, he was ultimately given the presidency for a short time."
"It was known when he was appointed that a compromise had been reached in which the eight-year term would be shared between Mr Duisenberg and Mr Trichet."
"Mr Trichet was thus assured of this post, albeit for only half the period, from the start."
"That threatened to go awry when it looked as if Mr Trichet was going to go to prison."
"It has now been suggested that he be given a further period of eight years."
"As an argument in favour of his appointment it is now being said that, unlike the government in his country, he will adhere strictly to the 3% ceiling for national budget deficits in the Stability Pact."
"That ceiling is turning into a recipe for disaster."
"Large Member States are not managing to achieve it; poor Member States will certainly not be able to."
"In the Netherlands, which is adhering to it, everything that is valuable is being cut back to nothing."
"Against this background I see no reason whatsoever to approve the candidature of Mr Trichet."
"(FR) The appointment of the next president of the European Central Bank is an act of the utmost importance because, in addition to the personality of the candidate, it is also, and above all, on monetary policy that we should comment."
"In the event, although I am clearly pleased that a Frenchman is soon to become president of the ECB, I cannot avoid the fact that Mr Trichet, for he is the person we are discussing, embodies a strict budgetary orthodoxy and demands that this be implemented."
"Mr Trichet put this quite bluntly during his hearing with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs: come hell or high water, he intends to continue the approach he has inherited from Mr Duisenberg, in other words, a form of monetarism that is as rigid as it is inappropriate."
"This decision should not be endorsed, however."
"At a time when many Member States are unable to comply with a Stability Pact, the limitations of which appear, in the current situation, to be completely out of step with the harsh realities of the economic climate, I cannot sanction the appointment of a candidate who is clearly afflicted by the same disease: autism."
". (PT) Unemployment is one of the main problems facing the candidate countries."
"In six of the 12 candidate countries, unemployment exceeds 10%, leading to social exclusion and poverty."
"Economic and monetary policies promoting economic growth and employment are needed, therefore, and should be driven by the public and cooperative sectors."
"This unemployment can be blamed on the rapid destruction of planned economies, linked to waves of privatisation and the complete opening-up of markets, which have caused severe disruption not only of economic activity but also of public services themselves, in particular in the field of social security."
"This very transformation is confirmed in the report's explanatory statement, where it is said to have 'further increased the proportion of the population who are threatened with poverty' and caused the rise of 'employment on insecure terms, e.g. on a temporary ? basis'."
"This Commission communication, then, aims to transpose the European Employment Strategy, in its 'post-Lisbon strategy' form, to the candidate countries."
"The latter do not appear to require greater occupational flexibility and mobility."
"Once again, the solution lies in a thorough revision of the EU's entrenched neoliberal economic and monetary policies."
"The EU's efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion should be redoubled."
"(PT) I voted in favour of this report on the Commission's communication on the progress made by the candidate countries in relation to their respective employment policies. Its aim is to ensure that the candidate countries define employment policies which prepare them for EU membership."
"As we know, employment, employment policies and their coordination constitute one of the main challenges facing the EU today."
"Above all, it is one of the demands of the people of Europe."
"The Lisbon strategy, indeed, defined the challenge of creating more and better jobs as essential to promoting truly humane progress, concerned not only with questions of economic growth, but also with the individual fulfilment of its citizens."
"Among the central messages of the European Commission's communication, I would emphasise those which lay particular emphasis on the strategic significance of education and training, from basic level up to the increasingly important lifelong learning."
"Lastly, I would also like to mention the importance attached to special programmes on equal treatment for disabled people and provisions to promote equal opportunities. These measures make it possible to reconcile family life with a professional career."
". (PT) The Commission's proposal aims to implement natural gas supply measures, in the wake of recent crises or impending crises, particularly as a result of the United States' attacks on countries like Iraq."
"There are so many relevant issues here that it is impossible to deal with all of them in this speech."
"The Commission even attempts to appropriate the right to intervene in the workings of Member States, an ambition quashed by Parliament, thus ensuring that the Member States retain their prerogatives in this area and in relation to their international obligations."
"As researchers suggest, the substance of these documents is not explicit but implied, the point being that world oil production has more or less peaked, or even passed its peak, and that although natural gas production may indeed continue to rise, it will peak in about 25 years at best."
"Both face inevitable decline."
"In view of these facts, the establishment of a European Observation System for supply of hydrocarbons, charged with solving this key problem, could make a contribution, in particular, to our knowledge of the state of world stocks and to essential research into other energy sources, such as renewable ones."
". (PT) As in the case of the concerns addressed by the Karlsson reports, which deal with a different set of substances, there can be no doubt that it would also be beneficial to begin aligning measures on securing natural gas supplies."
"The enforced harmonisation proposed by the European Commission is an altogether different matter."
"This harmonisation finds its highest expression in a power which the Commission would like to claim for itself: 'shall closely monitor the degree of new gas supply import contracts from non-EU countries' (Article 6(1) of the proposal)."
"Regrettably, the Commission's proposal is based on the assumption that, in a competitive market, security of supply cannot be entrusted to the sector responsible, an argument it takes too far."
"For my part, I agree with the rapporteur that market operators - businesses and Member States, in other words - are perfectly capable of safeguarding security of supply."
"Recent studies confirm this."
"For that reason, I was forced to abstain."
"I feel that the European Commission should respect the legal nature of the proposed legislation - a directive - and, therefore, suggest general minimum safeguards and precautions, which could then be adopted by the Member States and operators in this sector, with enough flexibility to accommodate the specific circumstances of each country, and with the political freedom to enact concrete legislation in that framework."
". (PT) As in the Mombaur report on natural gas supply, the substance of this report too may be found not in its explicit concerns but in the underlying ones, namely in the fact that world petroleum production has more or less reached or even already passed its peak, and natural gas production will go the same way in time."
"The report suggests various measures, which amount to a set of palliative steps. This approach does not get to the heart of the matter or tackle the larger problem, which is our falling capacity to produce petroleum."
"While the European Parliament's proposed Amendments Nos 2 and 5 point to the need to reduce the demand for petroleum, mentioning renewable energy sources, researchers claim that what is actually needed is a reduction in supply over time."
"Various researchers claim that there is a need to bring demand into line with supply capacity, to restrain demand according to the rate at which the resource is being exhausted, thereby avoiding any imbalance."
"Saying that demand 'must' be diversified and reduced is not enough."
"We need to find an objective basis to substantiate that reduction."
"A target for reducing consumption, something similar to Kyoto - not made into a mystery or a big deal - is a most essential and pressing requirement."
". (PT) I voted in favour of the proposal for an amendment whose approval by a majority meant that the European Commission's proposal was rejected."
"This really was the best solution, and will spare us a great deal of inconvenience and conflict."
"It is not so much that I opposed the overall aims set out in the proposal, which do in fact respond to serious current concerns."
"The problem, however, is that the European Commission was using those concerns to mask an attempt almost to assert its right to interfere directly in managing the Member States' energy resources and to nurture a desire to affect the market on its own account."
"True, the rapporteur nevertheless attempted to introduce some 'damage limitation': he proposed more realistic transition periods (2007), he left it to the Member States to decide what percentage of stocks should be held by private or public bodies, and he removed the right to intervene if prices rise significantly (that right will apply only during supply crises)."
"After everything that happened in the specialist Parliamentary committee, however, and after the various proposed amendments were tabled, stiffening opposition to the Commission's ambitions still further, this was a predictable outcome, and a fortunate one, particularly if the principle of subsidiarity is to be respected."
". (FR) I have tabled an amendment calling for the European Commission's proposal concerning the alignment of measures with regard to security of supply for petroleum products to be rejected."
"I do not believe that this proposal would provide an appropriate or effective response in the event of an oil crisis."
"Increasing the level of minimum stocks from 90 to 120 days would be an expensive measure to put in place in many States, due to the current inadequacy of stock infrastructures in the Union."
"Furthermore, increasing the level of these stocks would not make a difference significant enough to give the Union a greater influence over the oil markets than the producer countries."
"Lastly, setting up public oil stock bodies would impose substantial costs on the Member States whereas the European Commission would increase its intervention capacity for managing these stocks."
"Such an approach, which deprives States of their powers in the field of managing energy supply is, therefore, unacceptable."
"In rejecting this text, we have rejected an idea that wrongly appeared to be a good one, based on solutions that were both simplistic and ineffectual."
". (PT) I am glad that this report met the fate it did, after the European Commission proposal addressed by the other Karlsson report was rejected."
"I hope that the decision in plenary to refer the matter back to the specialist Parliamentary committee will allow for improvements to the text of the proposal for a directive. It will need to become more realistic if this legislative process is to continue."
"It is particularly important to consider the grave economic and financial repercussions of increasing the level of minimum stocks from 90 to 120 days, which would entail intolerable or unjustifiable management costs for various Member States."
"The best strategy might perhaps be to leave this matter as it stands today and concentrate above all on promoting real mechanisms for linking stocks together, for encouraging a community of interest and connections between European energy networks."
". (PT) This consultation procedure, which aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 40/94 on the Community trade mark, may seem unimportant."
"That, however, is not the case."
"There is in fact a relationship here between Community trade marks and designations of origin or geographical indications, which brings to mind the case of Limiano cheese, from Ponte de Lima, and even the question of wines."
"That is why Amendments Nos 1 and 2 in this report are dangerous."
"Although he states that a commercial trade mark may in no event be at the same time a geographical indication or designation of origin, the rapporteur also says that the indication or designation may be included in the trademark when the products covered have the right to bear it."
"The problem with this is that it may lead to trade protection for trade marks belonging to a titular holder, usually a company, thus threatening the designation of origin, as in the case of Limiano cheese."
"That is why we abstained from the vote."
". (FR) We have supported Mr Kirkhope's report on the German initiative to increase cooperation between Member States when measures need to be adopted on the removal, by air, of third country nationals residing illegally in the Union."
"These are useful, but relatively technical measures that, Mr Kirkhope, a former Secretary of State for immigration under the UK's last Conservative government, has nevertheless found it extremely difficult to admit to the Commission and the European Parliament."
"We have heard, from the benches on the left, unreasonable speeches denouncing the 'deportations', 'inhumane methods' and 'mass expulsions'."
"This is a view that is out of step with the reality of the situation, because these removal measures have a clear basis in the law."
"In particular, these are not mass expulsions (expulsion of an entire social group without taking individuals into account). These are individual expulsions, overseen by the legal system, of persons in an illegal situation."
"On this subject, the minority opinion of Mr Krivine, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and others, who see these expulsions as a 'violation of the rights of migrants', and who clearly wish to open Europe's borders to immigrants from the entire world, is quite enlightening."
". (FR) We share the minority opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs condemning this report, which proposes to organise more effectively the deportation mechanisms applicable to migrants 'residing illegally'."
"Parliament is asked to make the scope of the original initiative even harsher by removing a passage that rejects transit for the purpose of expulsion in the event that the expelled migrant 'faces the threat of inhumane or humiliating treatment, torture or death'."
"By voting for this report, the European Parliament claims for itself and endorses the policy of most national States seeking to expel migrants for whom the local authorities refuse to grant the necessary papers."
"We, on the other hand, call for a complete halt to deportations, the immediate release of all persons being detained pending deportation and for all those in Europe without residence permits to be given the permanent right to remain."
". (PT) This initiative by the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to adopting a Directive on assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air - which is to say expulsion by air of people accused of being 'illegal immigrants' - is one of a set of initiatives and measures whose aim is to build 'Fortress Europe'."
"As the group of honourable Members who put their names to the 'Minority Opinion' appended to the report point out, the real objective of this initiative is to make a cynical attempt to improve and render more effective the machinery for expelling people accused of 'illegal' residence, with as little resistance as possible."
"An amendment seeking to safeguard the rights described in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms has been tabled, by inserting a clause. This amendment does not change the fact that the status quo will now de facto - if not de jure - violate the rights of men and women migrating in search of a better life."
"It is impossible, and even intolerable in human terms, to address the tragic situation of thousands and thousands of men and women by applying repressive measures designed to increase security."
". (PT) I voted in favour of this report."
"Assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air is a sufficiently important issue to justify laying down a code of conduct and clear provisions on the rights and responsibilities of transit states, as well as of the escorts accompanying third-country nationals during expulsion."
"The state of 'legal limbo' in which both states and escorts accompanying persons in the process of being expelled found themselves was of no help in defining their roles and responsibilities."
"I cannot, however, support minority arguments which irresponsibly advocate lifting all border restrictions."
"If I may, moreover, refer ironically to one of the rapporteur's proposals, I do not consider it 'inappropriate' to refer to third-country nationals as 'persons', because that is what we all actually are, regardless of our nationality."
"That is exactly why it is justifiable to insert clauses forbidding transit when there is a risk of any third-country national suffering inhumane or humiliating treatment, torture or the death penalty, or when his or her life or freedom is threatened on grounds of race, religion, nationality, social group or political conviction."
". (EL) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, which makes provision for a series of important measures for safety at sea, such as:"
"the creation of refuges for ships in distress,"
"the creation of a European coastguard for strict monitoring, compliance with rules and prosecution of persons responsible,"
"frequent surveys of high-risk ships,"
"the creation of a special anti-pollution fleet,"
"the creation of special zones for ecologically sensitive areas."
". (FR) The sinking of the Prestige, which caused a large-scale environmental and economic disaster, is a cruel reminder of how crucial it is to attach the utmost priority to maritime safety at both European and world level."
"We must rapidly adopt an entire range of measures designed to prevent future accidents similar to that of the Prestige."
"Heading the list of these measures are implementing the Community and international legislation in force and monitoring compliance with these regulations."
"The measures set out in the two Erika packages must be implemented without delay."
"These agreements, which have already been concluded, can be built on and they will be built on more effectively if those working in the fishing and fish farming industries are involved in the negotiations."
"This disaster is not, therefore, as some would have us believe, 'just' a Spanish matter."
"I believe it is crucial to set up a temporary committee."
"This is indeed crucial if we are to prevent similar disasters from occurring again, to find out the causes and the consequences of what has happened as objectively as possible: what is at stake is Parliament's credibility and the dynamic role that Europe must play in the field of maritime safety."
"(PT) The Parliamentary committee incorporated some of our proposals into the report. They were:"
"the need for Member States to have at their disposal the appropriate means for carrying out checks, which should be achieved by increasing the number of inspectors and improving their working conditions and methods;"
"the importance of qualified seafarers, in order to ensure that the required preventive maintenance of vessels is carried out;"
"the existence, aboard vessels carrying dangerous goods, of means for instantly combating small-scale pollution;"
"providing safe havens with the appropriate means for implementing the relevant emergency plans."
"Some important proposals were rejected, however, including the following:"
"tabling a proposal on the social, living and working conditions of seafarers. These conditions are to be respected aboard ship;"
"delegating the authority to award qualifications to companies which have the technical expertise needed for the job, and which are independent of shipowners;"
"setting up a European Parliament committee of inquiry."
"The votes in plenary, however, went in favour of setting up a temporary committee, which shows that our stance did eventually prevail, in a sense."
"That is why we voted in favour of the report."
". (FR) I have voted in favour of this report."
"There is absolutely no question here of one Member State in particular being targeted; what we are trying to do is to become aware of the loopholes that exist in the implementation of the Erika I and Erika II packages, to discover the reasons for the delays in the texts' transposition and to resolve them."
"There is still a considerable risk of seeing 'floating dustbins' - genuine weapons of mass destruction - continuing to pollute our coastlines, destroy our beaches, attack our fisheries resources, massacre birds and bring our economies to a standstill."
"As we know, such destruction cannot be repaired simply by throwing subsidies at it."
"The European Union does, however, have a legislative arsenal at its disposal in the field of maritime safety."
"These texts must be transposed, harmonised and fully implemented."
"There has been too much shilly-shallying."
"Today, no State with a coastline should fail to respond to this call, and this is why I have voted the way I have."
"Lastly, I wish to make an observation on the possible establishment of a European coastguard service."
"I am in favour of such a development."
"- (FR) Let us hope that the provisions recommended by this report do not suffer the same fate as the Erika and the Prestige."
"Since 1999, there have been countless reports on safety at sea."
"The Erika packages only entered partially into force on 23 July 2003."
"It would have been heartening to see the European Union being as diligent in its fight against the 'sea thugs' as in its fight against terrorism."
"Now, the oil from the Prestige continues each day to pollute the whole of the Atlantic coast up to the Channel."
"Moreover, there are still more than 37 500 tonnes of heating oil in the wreck."
"We have supported the principle of a parliamentary committee of inquiry to shed as much light as possible on the ways in which responsibility for this disaster is to be apportioned."
"Above and beyond this, however, we have to outlaw the liberal logic that, thanks to the system of flags of convenience, permits the use of dustbin vessels and the exploitation of sailors outside the framework of any social legislation. We are voting in favour of this report because it strengthens the safety rules by demanding an increase in the number of ships inspected, the training of crews and the unlimited liability, in the event of disaster, of the oil companies and of the whole 'flagships of convenience' chain."
"What is missing, however, is a system of monitoring and penalties that gives effective expression to everything for which we are voting in this House."
". (PT) The sinking of the Prestige oil tanker off the coast of Galicia on 19 November 2002 caused a huge ecological and economic disaster, to which, I am very glad to say, Parliament devoted its full attention from the beginning."
"A Parliamentary delegation, of which I was a member, travelled to Galicia in March of this year and observed the scale of the disaster at first hand."
"I therefore share the concerns expressed by the Commission and by the Members of this House about maritime safety. I appeal to all parties to make firm commitments in the vital area of maritime safety, since the quality and safety of vessels sailing in European waters, and of European vessels the world over, depends on them, as does protecting the coasts and citizens of Europe from further disasters."
"Safety is down to us all and demands all our commitment!"
"I am speaking, moreover, as Member for a region where many of the shipping lanes running between the Americas and Europe come together, and which is thus extremely vulnerable to this type of disaster."
"The island of Porto Santo has already suffered the terrible consequences of such accidents."
"Let us hope that these measures will mean that my region or any other will experience them NEVER AGAIN."
". (NL) The world pays the price for keeping maritime transport artificially cheap."
"Ships from rich countries sail under the flags of poor countries, with minimum taxation and minimum protection for the crews, who are paid at developing-world levels."
"The ships are inspected on a commercial basis and by agencies who are in competition with one another and who fear that they will lose their customers if they are too strict."
"The coastal states try to limit the problem of cargo loss and shipping disasters by keeping transport in which they themselves have no interest as far as possible away from their coast."
"In the case of the wreck of the tanker Prestige off the coast of Galicia, the disaster was made worse by the Spanish authorities chasing the ship away from the coast instead of quickly accommodating it in a safe haven."
"Now, six months after the disaster, there is still oil coming up from the sunken wreck."
"The Spanish Government is persisting in its mismanagement and the rapporteur has largely chosen to ignore this."
"I support his proposals to promote safe havens, make guidance by pilots compulsory, encourage investigation, refrain from criminalising seafarers, make the polluter pay compensation and give money for cleaning up oil-covered animals."
"They remain inadequate, however, as long as companies chase after maximum profits and countries try to keep costs to a minimum."
". (PT) I supported this report and cast my final vote in its favour, in line with the speech I made during the debate."
"It is deplorable that the socialists and other left-wing Members should have rejected the proposal for an oral amendment, tabled by the rapporteur himself just before the vote on a sensitive amendment - Amendment No 11, on the setting up of a temporary committee - which might have produced an even broader consensus on the final wording of this excellent and comprehensive report."
"Sadly, the European left is still more interested in petty political chicanery, serving the interests of sectarian squabbles within Spain, than in serving the common interest effectively."
"Developments such as the adoption of Amendment No 23, whose partisan language is unmistakeable, prove as much."
"Despite all of this, I voted in favour of the report, and of Amendment No 11 in the rapporteur's original formulation."
"The coasts of Portugal are always vulnerable in these situations."
"This is true both of the mainland (which was nearly struck by the Prestige disaster) and of Madeira and the Azores."
"Clearly, we must always be in the vanguard in matters of maritime security, therefore, and in making progress and substantial demands in this field."
"Congratulations once again to the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"- (FR) Marine safety must be reinforced in Europe."
"It must even become a priority. Otherwise, there is the risk of seeing, in the near future, all our seas and oceans polluted, as the Atlantic coast is by the successive losses of the Erika and Prestige oil tankers."
"That is why the Member States must, as soon as possible, withdraw from service the single-hulled tankers that are often the cause of disasters, but also make port inspections more stringent and impose stricter rules upon the companies that issue certificates of seaworthiness."
"In short, they must apply the Erika package of December 1999 indefinitely."
"That is why, too, I have voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Sterckx."
"It includes a whole series of innovative measures to prevent oil slicks and effectively combat them: a European coastguard service, a victim compensation fund and ports of refuge made available for welcoming ships 'in distress'."
"I have also voted in favour of setting up a temporary parliamentary commission to cast as much light as possible upon the Prestige disaster, to discover who was responsible and to take action for the future."
"In this way, it will, once and for all, be the polluter who genuinely pays, as it is in the United States with its Oil Pollution Act."
"- (FR) I am delighted by the decision just taken by our Assembly to create, as I myself had requested, a temporary commission of the European Parliament devoted to safety at sea."
"This decision shows how important it is for us that this issue - which is of profound concern to our fellow citizens, particularly those on the Atlantic coast who have been doubly hit by the last two oil slicks - should be handled, at the appropriate levels, with all the rigour and consistency required, in order to prevent the occurrence of other, similar disasters."
"The mandate of this temporary commission would have been perfectly clear and would have appeared devoid of petty political ulterior motives if the oral amendment presented by the rapporteur had not been the subject of genuine obstruction by the socialist MEPs."
"On a subject as important as this, petty manoeuvring should not be acceptable."
"Whatever the case, it is, in actual fact, following the double disaster of the Erika and the Prestige that it appears necessary to take stock of the relevance of the measures adopted, of the initiatives taken by the Member States and regions affected by the oil slicks, of the issues of liability and compensation and, above all, of the persistent gaps in international law concerning ships in transit outside territorial waters."
". (PT) Water quality in seas and rivers throughout Europe and all over the world is crucial to people's welfare."
"Political decision-making should not be faltering, fragile or equivocal."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament should assume a united, clear and unbending stance to ensure that cases like the Prestige disaster do not happen again."
"Never again!"
"We cannot and must not underestimate the value of strengthening vessels' hulls, monitoring their routes (shipping lanes), a high degree of professionalism among their crews, moving shipping lanes further out to sea, and of using corridors correctly."
"- (FR) I voted in favour of the creation of a temporary commission, for it is evident that we must maintain absolute vigilance on the subject of safety at sea in Europe, so that the measures we adopt in this House might be fully and effectively applied in the Member States."
"That must be the purpose of a temporary commission, which will only be of use if it endeavours to improve Community legislation and to check that it is being applied."
"The Prestige disaster hit our coasts and our populations hard."
"A temporary commission will certainly have lessons to draw from this tragedy, but certainly not lessons to give to any government."
"This petty political objective, which has been pursued by a number of left-wing MEPs, has unfortunately sullied the conclusions of Mr Sterckx's report."
"I regret this all the more, given that, following the loss of the Erika, our Parliament had marked itself out by its non-partisan work."
"Out of respect for the victims, in Spain and France, of the oil slick from the Prestige, I hope that we shall fittingly pursue our work in the interests of safety at sea."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"I will certainly make sure that your complaint appears in the Minutes and is raised in the Bureau."
"I will point out to the services that you were present, but not voting, during the vote on the Sterckx report."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, we were all a little hasty because we did not want to delay the forthcoming debate on the submission of the budget needlessly."
"I have a genuine procedural motion."
"I am making a point of order as I think that the Conference of Presidents and the President of this Parliament are violating the Rules of Procedure, in particular Article 3 of Annex XIII."
"Yesterday, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, sent the President of this Parliament, Mr Cox, a letter setting out how the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the members of the Conference of Presidents should debate the documents on the current investigation into Eurostat."
"Mr Prodi drew up a form for this purpose in accordance with Annex 3, Article 3.2, Line 2."
"With one exception, that is the least strict rule, in accordance with which we will be looking at the matter behind closed doors tomorrow evening."
"According to the agreement between Parliament and the Commission, however, the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission have to negotiate on this."
"I would therefore like to ask Mr Cox and the Conference of Presidents to argue for a more favourable regulation."
"My second comment is that the meeting between the Conference of Presidents, the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is to take place behind closed doors next Thursday."
"All the people from the press in the room downstairs tell me, however, that Mr Prodi's spokesman said that if Parliament wants this meeting to take place in public, it can be."
"I think that it is befitting for our dignity and is also in our interest to ask most emphatically that this meeting be held in public."
"I think that all citizens of Europe are entitled to this and that it would be counterproductive if it were not to happen."
"I would therefore like to ask you, Mr President, to put these two questions to Mr Cox very emphatically."
"I will be extremely grateful to you for doing so."
"Mr Staes, I take note and naturally your comments will be communicated to President Cox, but I would remind you that that procedure is not a decision by Mr Prodi, but a decision by the Conference of Presidents of Political Groups, including yours, on the procedure for dealing with the issue."
"Your comments will therefore be passed on but please be aware what the basis for it has been."
"No, thank you, I will not enter into debates."
"Mr Parish has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I am sure you will be aware of the recent announcement by the UK Electoral Commission that the people of Gibraltar should vote in the South-West of the United Kingdom at the next European Elections, following a decision by the European Court."
"Will you join with me in welcoming an end to the historic wrong that has denied the people of Gibraltar a voice in Europe?"
"I should like to ask you to write, on behalf of this Parliament, to Mr Peter Caruana, the First Minister of Gibraltar, offering his citizens a warm welcome and congratulating them on their hard-fought campaign to secure their rightful democratic representation in Europe."
"Mr Parish, I take good note and I will be very happy when the citizens of Gibraltar can vote for the Westminster Parliament first."
"The next item is the presentation by Council of the draft general budget for 2004."
"Mr Magri, President-in-Office of the Council, will take the floor first."
". Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Magri for his speech."
"I do not need to remind Members that this is the last budget of this Parliament."
"If we look back over the last four years, we can see that there have been significant changes to the way in which the budgetary procedure has taken place."
"Those of us who have been here for a long time have seen many changes, not least in the relationship between Parliament and Council."
"We now have a minister who will sit here for three hours or so in a budgetary debate, as we had last year, which says a lot about the Council."
"At one time we never saw a Council minister here at this point in the budget process."
"I say that to be complimentary, not to be insulting."
"There have been a lot of cultural changes in the way the process has evolved."
"I suppose that we are now less confrontational."
"There is now more codecision between the two arms of the budgetary authority, especially when we talk about the flexibility instrument."
"The conciliation process that takes place in November each year is a real conciliation."
"I am not too sure whether the July conciliation still serves much purpose, but the November conciliation proves its worth."
"There has been respect on both sides for the fact that we are the two arms of the budgetary authority."
"I hope that the changes we have seen over the past four years will be taken forward when the Convention is finally ratified and Parliament given its rightful place as one arm of the budgetary authority, thereby maintaining its strategic role for future years."
"Over these last four years I have had the pleasure of being Chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"This will probably be my last budget as Chairman - I hear one or two boos at the back there - but I am looking forward to seeing this budget through."
"It has been non-stop ever since we were elected in 1999."
"The first thing we had to do was try to get an agreement on the flexibility instrument for the rebuilding of Kosovo."
"That was quickly followed by successive discussions and arguments with the Council about how to fund Serbia, Afghanistan, the notorious fisheries agreement, and even this year we had the problem of Category 5 and how we were going to fund the administration expenditure that was needed."
"This period has not been without its moments."
"At the beginning of this year, someone asked me whether there were any problems ahead for the 2004 budget."
"In a moment of weakness I said, 'no, not really'."
"That is, however, if we do not include enlargement, potential problems with Iraq later on or activity-based budgeting."
"But, since we do have to include these matters, we have to try and sort them all out."
"All those issues need to be resolved."
"The 2004 budget will be far from easy for a variety of reasons, firstly because it is in the ABB - activity-based budgeting - format."
"The fact is that we now have to vote in a different way for a different structure, and hopefully get it right, as well as deal with enlargement."
"We are voting on a new structure and then we will be voting for 10, 15 or 25 countries, depending on the way you look at it."
"It will be difficult because of the different amendments from the groups and committees, not least including the extremely interesting amendment by the PPE-DE Group requesting EUR 500 million for the rebuilding of Iraq."
"I will touch on that shortly."
"The new Financial Regulation is also complicating matters, especially the A-30 lines."
"Whilst these matters are just peanuts, they seem to take up a lot of time in the committees, as every member of the Committee on Budgets knows."
"There is also the real question of what the real needs of enlargement are, especially within the institutions."
"How do we determine that reality from the proposals of the Commission as well as of all the other institutions?"
"The two rapporteurs, Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill, have striven manfully to try to get answers to that - I am not excluding Parliament here either."
"The fact is that this budget has to ensure that enlargement is a success and that we treat the applicant countries as equal partners and not as second-class cousins."
"We have to ensure that this is done correctly."
"We also have to ensure that, within this new format, this debate is meaningful."
"Let us hope these next few hours give a real chance for dialogue and trialogue between our three institutions."
"In the pursuit of solutions, it is important to address questions to the institutions, rather than to produce formal set-piece statements."
"I should like to start that ball rolling in relation to the amendment from the PPE-DE Group that I mentioned earlier."
"I will be interested to know how the Commission and the Council would react if we voted through this amendment to give an extra EUR 500 million next year for the rebuilding of Iraq."
". (NL) Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks for the presence of the Council and the Commission."
"I see that both institutions are represented here by a very large staff."
"I have been allocated five minutes in which to speak."
"When I look at the budget before us, this means that I can speak for about three seconds on each billion euros of expenditure."
"That is not very long, so I will have to restrict myself to the main issues."
"Firstly, I am pleased that the Council has said - and Mr Terry Wynn has also emphasised - that 2004 is a crucial year."
"It is the first year of the enlargement and we must do everything we can to make the enlargement a success."
"Now that the last referendum in the ten new countries has taken place in Latvia, we know for certain that ten new countries will be joining on 1 May next year."
"We must immediately make them feel at home and that they are welcome."
"Mr President, you and Mr Böge have been given an important role in working out the budgetary envelopes for the codecision programmes."
"I think that it is of vital importance that we reach agreement on this before November of this year."
"There are signs of recession all over Europe at the moment."
"I think that we must try to develop more economic activity."
"I myself have high expectations of the initiative, which is even mentioned in the directives, to further develop the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector by way of guarantee facilities, via banks in Eastern Europe."
"If Parliament approves this, I hope that the Council will take a more favourable stance despite its policy of not changing the allocations for the ten new Member States from what was agreed in Copenhagen."
"This side may submit amendments asking for more attention to be paid to certain developments in the new Member States."
"Now the budget in general."
"It has already been said once or twice before; we want to be a responsible Parliament when it comes to expenditure."
"Unnecessary expenditure is something we do not need."
"As far as I am concerned, we should hold each item of expenditure up to the light to see whether the expense in question is justified or not."
"Last year's expenditure pattern will play a particularly important role in this."
"I think that this is especially important, now that there is strict budgetary discipline in all Member States."
"It has been said once or twice before, but the Iraq question casts a shadow over Heading 4 of the budget."
"What do we do about Iraq?"
"I think that the Commission must come up with a very clear proposal and must indicate clearly why it thinks a specific amount is necessary and how it intends to finance it."
"I do not only mean certain amounts that are going directly from the Commission to Iraq."
"Would the Commission be able to look into what other facilities there may be at some stage?"
"Could there be a role in the long term for the European Investment Bank to encourage businesses to invest in Iraq?"
"Could there be a role for the European Investment Fund and other businesses of this kind?"
"I understand that change is not possible from one day to the next, but perhaps the Commission could make a statement about this."
"We will have to try to finance this mainly from the 2004 budget, but I think - I do not know - it is going to be close in that area."
"What role does the Commission envisage for the flexibility instrument, and what is realistic in the attempt to reach agreement with the Council?"
"Perhaps the Council can say something about this."
"One point that affects the whole budget is that it has been customary over the years for Parliament to include certain amounts in the budget for preparatory activities, trials and so on, and that the Commission was then free not to implement them."
"Other actions that were also proposed in the budget were not financed by the Commission."
"We want to try to avoid this state of affairs this year."
"We should therefore put certain amounts of money in the reserve and only release them if we have the impression that the Commission - in other words the budget authority - is taking Parliament's decisions seriously."
"A lot of discussion will also be needed on the Commission's human resources policy."
"The Council has announced that it does not agree with the Commission's proposals regarding additional human resources."
"Parliament's position is not yet clear, but it might be possible for us to put specific items in the reserve and only release them once the Commission has met certain conditions."
"One of the interesting things this year is that this is this Commission's final year."
"In this case it is often customary to give various people in the Cabinet of Commissioners attractive positions in the Commission administration, the practice known as 'parachuting'."
"We would like the Commission to give us an overview of the promotion policy over the past few years and the plans they have in this area this year."
"My last point; may I say how impressed I am with the good cooperation with the Council, the rapporteurs of the various committees and the Commission itself thus far."
"I hope that this good cooperation will last until December."
". Mr President, as we have heard, the 2004 budget will have some profound changes as a result of the historic enlargement due to take place in May 2004."
"My objective has been to balance the needs of the institutions so that they can fulfil their tasks and equip themselves to meet the challenges that will be presented by an EU of 25 Member States."
"At the same time, however, we must ensure that the principles of budgetary rigour and prudence are at the core of all our budgetary decisions."
"The budget will present the other institutions with major challenges, because it will significantly change many of them."
"Some of the institutions will receive additional 50% increases in their budgets, which will lead to doubling or trebling of the staff within them."
"This will require sensitive and intensive management to absorb this change seamlessly."
"Therefore, I would like to start by welcoming the submission of the Third Report of the Secretaries-General on the evolution of Heading 5."
"This has become a useful tool for the decision-making process, and although we have an annual budgetary procedure, it is important to be aware of the likely multi-annual situation, so that the right strategic choices can be made, for example in buildings and staff policy."
"I would like to remind everybody that we call upon the Commission and the other institutions that we have this annual report submitted to us by 1 September every year."
"The Council's reading of the 2004 budget has been quite a surprise."
"I am totally perplexed by the Council's approach: there does not appear to be a clear strategy other than the doubling of the margin."
"On the one hand, the Council continues to apply an across-the-board approach, of which the Parliament has always been critical."
"In the past we have said that the Council made horizontal cuts in the institutions without looking into real needs."
"This has happened again this year on the Commission's budget."
"On the other hand, however, the Council has been surprisingly generous, to the extent that I have to question whether all requests that it has endorsed are well justified."
"This year it will be for the Parliament to ensure that the budgetary rigour is applied and a more critical examination of needs is undertaken."
"Therefore, I would like to ask the President-in-Office's opinion about the approach that I have taken on his decisions."
"We will be proposing to put money in reserve for two committees - about a million euro for each committee - and to cut back further posts in most of the other budgets."
"My concern is that the Council has agreed to everything to do with enlargement, and enlargement should have resulted in greater economies of scale."
"I am a firm supporter of enlargement, but that does not mean that everything that is demanded is required."
"It is important that we do not have 'carte blanche' as regards enlargement and at the same time reject existing posts and existing staff policy issues - such as upgrading - which are important for the staff who are already working."
"We need to have a balance here."
"I do not wish to go into detail on all of the Council's decisions, but I do want to ask about buildings, which is the second biggest item of expenditure after staff."
"I want to understand the Council's strategy."
"We have always agreed on a policy of purchasing the premises of European institutions because it tends to give greater value for money to the European taxpayer, therefore we need to look at building expenditure, taking a multi-annual approach rather than a piecemeal approach, and to try to purchase the buildings as soon as possible."
"We know that the margin in Heading 5 will be under pressure from 2006 or 2007 onwards."
"However, we have a considerable margin in 2004."
"I was disappointed that the Council rejected my proposal to use this to finance buildings to cater for enlargement."
"This would lead to more savings, including savings for taxpayers."
"On buildings we do not need piecemeal solutions, we need to take a multi-annual strategic approach."
"My next question is to the Commission."
"It is about the importance of the adoption of the new Staff Regulation."
"This issue has been dragging on for some time and it has implications for all institutions and for our staff."
"However, all the establishment plans in the budget pertain to the old Staff Regulation, so I call on the Commission today to confirm that it will propose an amending budget for the implementation of new Staff Regulations and what the likely timing of this may be, because next year, with the elections, the parliamentary calendar will be restricted."
"Finally, I would like to call upon all the other institutions to take account of some of the changes and demands affecting them in the light of enlargement."
"They should start planning now and start introducing controls that are absolutely essential."
". (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, honourable Members, overall, we are living through a very exciting time for the European Union, involving a great many changes, especially for the European Union's budget policy experts."
"We are jointly preparing the historic 2004 budget - the first for a European Union of twenty-five Member States."
"All the lights are now green, as the last referendum has also produced a positive result. In most cases, the general public in the accession countries has said a resounding - indeed, a very forceful - 'yes' to the European Union."
"Next year, the priority for policy-makers will be the successful launch of common policies in an enlarged Union."
"Together, we - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - have put the conditions in place for this enlarged budget by adapting our financial planning to the needs of enlargement."
"The budgetary framework for the next three years is therefore fixed and the 2004 draft budget naturally operates within this new framework as well."
"Promoting stability in Europe and encouraging sustainable economic development - these are the further priorities for new initiatives in 2004."
"They include, for example, immigration policy measures, the new Intelligent Energy for Europe programme, and measures to improve safety in the transport sector."
"My fellow-Commissioners Mrs de Palacio, Mr Fischler, Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino will tell you more in their own contributions about these initiatives and about the specific programmes which have recently been agreed, such as the financial assistance for the closure of nuclear power plants or the assistance with compliance with the Schengen Agreement, which, after all, are new initiatives for the accession countries. Of course, my colleagues will be pleased to answer any questions posed during the course of the debate."
"The Commission's priorities for the budget proposal are in fact very much in line with the priorities set for 2004 by the European Parliament and, indeed, the European Council."
"It is a good procedure. The method by which priorities are discussed and elaborated jointly at such an early stage has proved its worth."
"This is undoubtedly one reason, Mr Wynn, why the budgetary procedure is no longer confrontational and has become far more constructive in tone."
"I would like to convey my thanks to Mr Mulder, the general rapporteur, for his excellent cooperation, as well as to Mrs Gill, the rapporteur, and especially the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn."
"I would like to thank the other members of the Committee on Budgets and, of course, the other committees' budget policy experts as well."
"I would also like to express my gratitude to the President-in-Office of the Council for his cooperation and the swift completion of the budget's first reading in the Council."
"As far as it is possible to sum up the most recent budgetary procedures at this stage, I too would like to say that it really is time for the European Parliament to have a stronger role in the budget process, as envisaged, indeed, in the Convention's draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. I certainly do not share some finance ministers' fears that it would be contrary to budgetary discipline if this House had the final say on the overall budget."
"On the contrary, my experience over recent years has shown quite clearly that Parliament fully respects the guidelines on budgetary discipline in its proposals and decisions."
"The Commission's preliminary draft budget for 2004 envisages expenditure of EUR 100.7 billion."
"The increase compared with this year would thus be 3.2%, which demonstrates that all the fears about enlargement being unaffordable were entirely groundless."
"Indeed, next year's European public budget ratio will be even lower than this year's, showing that the necessary scope to fund enlargement has been created in the financial planning process. At the same time, we can be certain that all the new Member States will be net recipients."
"The fears of some new Member States that they would be net contributors are quite groundless, especially in view of the decisions that have already been taken, as well as the adjustment of the Financial Perspective and the proposals now on the table, which were not challenged by the Council in the first reading."
"In its first reading, the Council made relatively few changes to the Commission's preliminary draft budget compared with previous years, and I would like to thank the Council for that."
"However, there is one point where I must register the Commission's complete opposition, and that is on the issue of staff increases for the Commission."
"We face the imminent prospect of enlargement and the accession of ten new Member States with 75 million people, and the Commission must guarantee, from the outset, the full integration of the new Member States by all the means at its disposal."
"Surely it is obvious that more staff will be needed?"
"My fellow-Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, will take up this issue as well, and Mrs Gill will talk about the budgetary implications of the new Staff Regulations. The Commission has certainly not been extravagant in its demands for new posts."
"Indeed, we have examined the situation very carefully and calculated very tightly. DG Budget, which is the directorate-general responsible, can be relied on to produce a very accurate calculation in this particular area."
"The 780 new posts are the minimum required to manage integration. I would like to thank Parliament for its very supportive position."
"I will of course ensure that all the additional questions and requests for information which you may have at this time are answered in as much detail as you require, for I believe that it is also in Parliament's interest to ensure that the Commission functions effectively."
"In the foreign policy field, we face a new challenge as a result of the situation in Iraq."
"Next year, we must also launch a strategy for closer cooperation with our new neighbours, but also with the European Union's old neighbours, as part of a genuine neighbourhood policy."
"Within the Union, the challenge we face is ensuring a new growth dynamic at a time when the general public also expects more vigorous measures to guarantee internal security."
"We also intend to push through the successful implementation of our common policies, such as the agricultural policy, in an enlarged Union and help the new Member States make up substantial economic ground."
"At the same time, we know that the Council is watching to make sure that there is no widening of the gap here."
"It is everyone's task to do our utmost to ensure that enlargement is a success, that the Union offers the stability which is sought by old and new Member States alike, and that through sustainable growth, positive living conditions are safeguarded for every citizen of the Union."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, it is certainly good, as Mr Wynn said, that we have this kind of generalised debate."
"We hope it will not be his last time for presenting this report to Parliament as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, but there may be life after 2004."
"We congratulate the two rapporteurs, as always, but we would like in this particular budget to take a cautious approach to the budget overall."
"As the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council said, there will be major changes as a result of enlargement, as well as activity-based budgeting."
"We will also have three different Commissioners between May and November 2004."
"It is going to be a turbulent year."
"For this reason, my group does not wish to see any opening of the revision of the Financial Perspective over the next 12 months."
"This would be an unnecessarily complex thing to start at a time when we will be out on election campaigns and the present Commission will be in its last year."
"We had great problems, in the last legislature in 1999, with negotiating a financial perspective which then tied not only the current Parliament and Commission, but also subsequent ones, to a situation where they could not revise it."
"It smacks of Soviet-style planning that we should start now to think of what financing will be like in 2013."
"We, as a group, would like to have a five-year financial perspective negotiated from 2005 to apply from 2006 onwards."
"I should like to refer to two points in particular."
"One is Commission reform."
"Last year we linked the Commission's request for new posts to a comprehensive review on what had happened on Commission reform."
"It produced a very impressive numerical report."
"What we would like this year - and we have tabled an amendment to this effect with one or two other points - is to have not only a report about what the Commission has done, but also a report showing what has gone wrong with the reforms and what still needs to be done to ensure that there is proper communication - Eurostat is only one example, though a rather high-profile one."
"The report also needs to show, quite clearly, where the reforms have not taken place."
"Is it true that, as Mrs Andreasen stated in a press release today, if the accounting systems had been put in place before, we might not have had this kind of problem?"
"Who knows?"
"We wish to clarify it and to have a document to that effect."
"The other point is the question of Iraq."
"Mr Wynn asked what the purpose of this amendment was."
"We believe that, at this stage of international development, Europe needs to show that it is not only capable of acting on the world stage and assisting with humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Iraq, but can also put a figure for this item in its budget."
"This figure pales into insignificance compared with the EUR 30 billion which the President-in-Office of the Council has said has been reimbursed over the last three years from the budget to Member States."
"A figure of EUR 500 million for next year focused on Iraq would show very clearly Europe's willingness to cooperate with the United States and others in bringing that country to the path of prosperity."
"In conclusion, we wish, as a group, to be able to be principled and responsible in this budget process."
"We want to ensure that parliamentary priorities will be maintained."
"All three issues which I raised are ones on which Parliament has the final say."
"You can expect us to be constant in the process which is now opening out ahead of us to the end of the year."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have a budget before us which - contrary to what we otherwise hear about budget proposals - is shrinking, not growing."
"That may be a response to conditions in the Member States."
"Certainly, this budget is equipped with fewer resources."
"As a response to what is happening in the Member States, we must undoubtedly say: yes, we must manage the taxpayers' money prudently, and as the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we will do that."
"However, we must also set priorities for the budget. That is something which we will certainly do."
"Let me start with an issue which - if Commissioner Schreyer is right, and I hope she is - will fall to us too as a task for the future."
"Let us talk about the revenue side of the EU budget."
"The revenue side - that means: where is the money coming from?"
"We pay from the taxpayers' money."
"As we have observed, some estimates in Europe suggest that as much as twenty billion is being lost as a result of VAT fraud."
"Anyone who accepts this VAT fraud also accepts the shortfalls in revenue at European level."
"We are not prepared to accept that - because all these shortfalls must be made good out of the ordinary taxpayer's pocket."
"During this budgetary procedure, we will therefore be proposing that the campaign against VAT fraud be stepped up in order to ease the burden on the ordinary taxpayer, so that the money that should be flowing to Europe can actually do so."
"We will have to debate this issue more often as part of the budget process from now on as well."
"In future budgetary procedures - including the next one - we will ensure that citizens can see for themselves that dependability is guaranteed as one of our fundamental values."
"This means dependability in combating the economic and social gap, and it means dependability in tackling unemployment."
"We have heard that the Council has slashed payments for the Structural Funds in particular."
"This raises a number of questions, in our view."
"On the one hand, the Member States are registering the substantial amounts of money which they intend to spend in the coming years, and especially next year. Yet at the same time, the Council has agreed, in its draft budget, that spending must be kept below these same figures."
"We wonder which of these figures is correct."
"We know that arrears have arisen in respect of commitments undertaken in the past, where payment has not yet taken place."
"The Council neatly sidesteps this issue and claims: 'We don't need the payments.'"
"We will not get involved in this game."
"Anyone reaching agreement, after tough negotiations, on the Financial Perspectives, especially in relation to the Structural Funds and therefore structural and economic development in the European Union, must also accept that when it comes to implementation, he will be reminded of his commitments and we will demand payment of the appropriate amounts."
"In the next budget year, we will take care to ensure that the European Union, as an economic area, is not just an economic area for major companies and corporations."
"We will push for intensive support for SMEs in future too."
"They are the backbone of the European economy."
"They are creative, innovative and willing to take risks, and we must give them our support so that even though they have no legal departments and no tax departments, they can benefit from the European Union and the internal market."
"Fourthly, in the budgetary procedure, we will ensure that enlargement is shaped on the basis of certainty."
"There have been various references already to the staffing issue."
"We will be looking very closely at what staffing levels are actually required in order to ascertain whether every one of the stated vacancies is genuinely needed."
"However, we will not allow enlargement and the accession countries to become the European Union's piggy bank."
"I agree with all the previous speakers here."
"There must be equality."
"Decisions like this are the best indicators of whether or not equality genuinely exists."
"Anyone can voice noble intentions, but it is the decisions themselves that show whether there really is equal treatment, regardless of whether an old or a new Member State is involved."
"We will monitor this very carefully."
"In other areas too, we will continue to maintain continuity to some extent, but we will also have to shape our policy in a future-oriented way."
"This applies especially to foreign policy."
"Here, it has been our frequent experience in recent years that whenever a crisis situation develops anywhere in the world, we have responded in the heat of the moment and immediately pledged to make additional resources available, sometimes at the expense of established policies."
"If we look at some parts of the world which we supported in the past, we see that fewer resources are available than in previous years."
"We have had to restructure. We have done so because we have also recognised, of course, that we cannot increase the funding indefinitely."
"However, I would like to cite two statistics which, while not relating directly to our budget, do give us food for thought. Today, the United States of America and the countries of the European Union spend 460 billion every year on defence."
"460 billion!"
"Yet we spend just 37 billion on development."
"Is this really a forward-looking policy, one that is aimed at conflict prevention? Is it the kind of policy that developed states should be pursuing?"
"The answer is 'no', which is why we want to develop European policy further within the bounds of what is possible - and that is modest enough. We want to work preventively."
"We want to develop conflict management strategies that will stop such conflicts from occurring in the first place."
"We are not so naive as to believe that there will be no more conflicts in the world."
"There will always be conflicts and our region, our Member States, must deal with that. Nonetheless, we will focus more intensively on prevention."
"A further area in which we must work preventively is demographic change."
"The European continent is changing dramatically."
"We see that the average population is ageing considerably, not only in individual countries but in all countries."
"That has an impact on all institutions and agencies."
"It not only means that there will, in future, be fewer kindergartens, or that we will need fewer kindergartens at local level."
"It will also have an impact on us."
"Let me once again give as an example the pensions burden, which we will have to shoulder."
"In many other areas, too, we will see that the numbers of young people are steadily dwindling and there are more and more older people."
"We must deal with this situation by shaping it positively. It should be viewed not as a threat but an opportunity."
"We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists will apply a number of criteria to this budget."
"The first is financial prudence, because we are dealing with our citizens' money."
"The second is dependability."
"Everyone must see that what we start, we finish, and that we do not drag our feet or drop it half way through."
"The third is this: we will shape European policies in a way which enables us to work preventively instead of being caught on the hop when situations occur."
"We will endeavour to monitor developments early on, structure them appropriately and thus shape the European Union, our European continent, so that we have a good and secure future together."
"Mr President, the European Union budget presented by the Council shows a very disciplined approach."
"Payment appropriations account for just 0.99% of GDP, or, in terms of cash, EUR 11.4 billion below the financial perspective."
"The Commission's budget has been drawn up as an activity-based budget concerning 31 policy areas."
"This has long been our group's clear objective."
"It will facilitate the monitoring of EU activity."
"The costs associated with each policy area are clearly visible."
"Administrative and operational costs are itemised."
"Efficiency can be more easily assessed, as can the relation between achieved results and money spent."
"Excessive bureaucracy is a glaring signal of immoderate administrative costs."
"The biggest problem with EU budgetary policy is outstanding appropriations."
"Year in, year out, Parliament struggles to adapt the budget to the financial frameworks."
"In the financial statements we state that arguments over a few euros are totally superfluous when there are billions in outstanding appropriations, easily exceeding as much as EUR 10 billion every year."
"Next year's budget will be dominated by the enlargement of the EU."
"The Council has had a strict view on posts in the Commission that are required for enlargement."
"It is the opinion of our group that enlargement requires an adequate number of posts but it must not be used as a pretext for swelling the ranks of officialdom."
"The administrative success of enlargement will depend not only on the creation of posts but also how existing resources can be reallocated and used more effectively."
"Our group supports the priorities that Mr Mulder has proposed."
"We are worried about funding for human rights, as we are too about funding in respect of the International Court of Justice in the Hague."
"We also hope that the Northern Dimension Action Plan will be taken proper account of in the budget headings."
"We should also step up cooperation with our new neighbours within the framework of the Wider Europe programme, and the administration of appropriations connected with that should be simplified."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr Seppänen, you have made personal references to several Commissioners."
"According to our agenda, some of the people you have mentioned will be present during this debate, but later on."
"For example, Mr Barnier, who you have referred to, is scheduled for this afternoon, but not for a little while."
"I mention this for your information."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that this debate is taking place as it enables us to put a number of questions to the Commission before we vote on the amendments in the budgetary procedure."
"In my first contribution of the afternoon, I would like to pause, as Mr Virrankoski did, at the implementation of the budget, as the political decisions which we take here with a lot of fuss often falter on that point."
"Money is shelved, or red tape hinders recipients of subsidies from spending the money properly and effectively."
"Mr Mulder, the rapporteur for the forthcoming budget, said just now that he wanted the Commission to be encouraged to increase the percentage of the money spent by putting part of the administrative credits in the reserve."
"Mr Mulder, and also possibly a majority in this House, are not yet convinced that all the items that the Commission asked for before enlargement are really necessary."
"A Commission official said the following in this regard: you are tying our legs together and still expecting us to be able to run the 100 metres faster."
"I think that the rapporteur's concerns are legitimate, but I have doubts as to the means."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she can give us her opinion on this."
"What are the consequences of the reserves?"
"How can you use them in a positive way?"
"Even more importantly, do you think that we are on the right track by spending the money slowly?"
"Up to now we have always put the emphasis on the quantitative side of this."
"Is it not time we focused more on the qualitative side of the solutions, like Mr Pittella is doing with the structural funds?"
"That means that procedures would have to be simplified, that we would need less paper and more responsible officials."
"My last point with regard to spending the money properly concerns the fact that we often find that projects that are financed with EU resources often do not respect European environmental legislation."
"What happens when you discover this?"
"Will the money be frozen or will some other more-or-less soft solution be found?"
"One example of this is the bridge over the Tagus River."
"This was a project financed with EU funds in which the bird and habitat directives were not respected."
"There are more examples like this."
"I would like to know what the consequences are if it is discovered that EU-financed projects are violating EU legislation."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, we welcome the proposed reduction in payment appropriations."
"In view of the economic recession, Member States are having to tighten their belts, and the European Union cannot lag behind in this."
"The Council has made a number of substantial reductions in the draft budget."
"We do not share the rapporteur's position of categorically opposing this."
"Particularly in Heading 2 - Structural measures, 3 - Internal policies, and 4 - External action, we do not consider it necessary to earmark more money than the Council is proposing."
"We must not close our eyes to the enormous payment arrears in several items of the budget in these headings."
"The arrears in the structural funds are impossible to explain to voters; they amount to more than EUR 66 billion, two-thirds of the current total EU budget."
"A Swedish market research bureau came to the conclusion that the effectiveness of the structural policy is clearly not up to the mark."
"Does the Commission know the results of this survey, and what is it going to do about this persistent problem?"
"The European Parliament must also look closer to home and check critically whether certain policy sectors do in fact belong at EU level."
"For example, the fact that some people in this House want to use money for the EU budget for tourism is just one example of something that is preeminently a matter for the Member States."
"Money for development aid is also going to countries in the southern hemisphere, whilst that is a duty of one or more Member States which have historical connections with these countries."
"We are of the opinion that the 8.4% increase in the budget for the common foreign and security policy is inadequately explained."
"The European Union must not set up an organisation in parallel with NATO."
"That is throwing money away."
"The EUR 18 million increase in subsidies to the Palestinian Authority is actually unwarranted as long as it refuses to unequivocally condemn and stop terrorist attacks on innocent people."
"Is the Commission aware of the IMF report, which shows that Arafat had USD 900 million deposited in secret accounts between 1995 and 2000?"
"Finally, the Commission must be more critical when supporting third countries in the Mediterranean region."
"We must apply the human rights clause consistently in such cases."
"We wholeheartedly support the amendment for a substantial contribution to the rebuilding of Iraq."
"At the same time we must stress that the extent of this necessary humanitarian aid should not be contingent on political differences of opinion between some Member States and the United States."
"My group thinks that it is a bad thing that the reformation of the European Commission will deliver much smaller savings than originally forecast."
"The difference of EUR 8.8 billion is really very substantial."
"How does the Commission explain that?"
"Where we could also make savings is on the supervisory boards of the agencies in which each Member State has three members."
"Would it not be excessive if these bodies were to expand to 75 members per agency?"
"I must also comment on the management of the budget."
"It concerns us that expenditure on audits has fallen by 6.4% in the common agricultural policy."
"This reduction is unwise, given the problems surrounding the management of this policy and the intensity of manpower required for proper control of agricultural expenditure."
"This spring the European Court of Auditors presented a report on support for the so-called 'problem areas'."
"What lessons has the Commission learned from this?"
"Is it, for example, willing to tighten up the vague definition of 'good agricultural practices'?"
"Finally, according to the people involved, the fraud at Eurostat is partly related to the limited resources the European Commission releases for proper statistics."
"Better cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistical agencies is certainly to be desired."
"Eurostat needs more independence for this, so that the impartiality and scientific objectivity of the statistics continues to be ensured."
"After punishing the fraud and improving administrative control of Eurostat, we need to pay attention to this."
"What is the Commission's response to this?"
"(NL) Mr President, the subject of the budget. The Council has 'only' cut the European Commission's original proposals for Heading 4, External action, which contained a 3.9% increase on the previous year, by 0.3%."
"As we all know, the European Union will be taking on more and more new commitments."
"These relate to the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the reconstruction of Iraq, badly governed countries such as Afghanistan and Congo, the enlarged Europe, conflict prevention in the Middle East, and so on."
"These are important matters and it is also clear that the people are in favour of a more assertive external policy: 67% of Europeans state that they support more European Union in the world."
"On the other hand, it is crystal clear that the financial limits of the possible commitments will have been reached unless more money is made available."
"In a few weeks' time the European Union will be participating in the international donor conference on the reconstruction of Iraq."
"Mr Patten is suggesting a possible EU contribution of about EUR 200 million in 2003-2004."
"Others are suggesting an amount of EUR 500 million."
"Either way, our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy does not want this to be at the expense of other geographical zones or commitments, such as Afghanistan, or non-geographical budget lines such as the rapid response concept and landmines."
"If the European Union wants to assume its share of responsibility for peace and security in the world, it must also be prepared to earmark the necessary financial resources."
"If not, Europe is at risk of becoming a political dwarf on the international stage."
". (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a couple of comments on the budget proposals for 2004 from the point of view of development cooperation."
"Although we are dealing with activity-based budgeting in this case, I cannot get away from the impression that this split has more to do with the Commission's internal structure."
"Funds intended for development cooperation should also fall under this section."
"Yet we have seen that budget lines for Asia, Latin America and the Middle-East have been placed under the heading 'External relations'."
"My committee finds this unacceptable."
"After all, fighting poverty is the main aim of European development policy."
"If these budget lines are placed under 'Foreign relations', this will be lost from sight."
"My second comment concerns our support for the reconstruction in Iraq."
"Regardless of the amounts mentioned, it must be made clear that this money cannot come from the pot for Heading 4, External action, which is limited as it is."
"In my opinion the flexibility instrument must be used for this."
"The third and last point I would like to mention is the target percentage of 35% for social infrastructure."
"The Commission has pointed out that it has achieved this figure in the last few years, but education and healthcare, which are after all two of the very important objectives of the Millennium Development Goals, still come off worst."
"I would therefore like to call upon the Commission to adhere to what was agreed at the social summit in Copenhagen in 1995."
". Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Mulder for the very collegiate and cooperative way in which he has worked with other committees, and Mrs Gill for the same reason."
"The budget lines dealt with by my committee are the most complex of any committee."
"We cover something like 120 budget lines with reference to ten different directorates-general."
"Because of that complexity, plus the changes in nomenclature, the activity-based budgeting and enlargement, it has been a difficult task to give an overall view."
"I would like to thank the Commission and those staff in its directorates-general who have been patient in their explanations and have explained their rationale for preparing the preliminary draft budget."
"I cannot offer the same praise to the Council of Ministers, because in our committee we have seen a whole succession of very large cuts with no rationale whatsoever provided as to why they should have taken place."
"I find it impossible to work on that basis."
"You cannot have a dialogue when one side does not explain its reasoning for what it is doing."
"There may be some sense behind the suggestions, but it is not at all clear to us."
"Let me take as one example the preparatory action for security research, of enormous interest to the citizens of Europe."
"Why has that been cut?"
"I am delighted that Mr Mulder is prepared to support us in reinstating the money which was suggested for this action, which many of us on our committee think is important."
"We want an explanation about Chernobyl."
"We lay great emphasis on SMEs, as you will see, and I look forward to some sort of rational discussion with the Council about its motivation for making cuts which appear to contradict every policy of the European Union."
"Mr President, the Commission's preliminary draft budget contains few surprises when it comes to those issues that fall within the area of responsibility of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"We therefore support its main features and have also clearly expressed our support for the amounts proposed by the Commission."
"I nonetheless wish to make a few comments and recommendations."
"Those measures that are supported within the framework of budget line 02 05 01 ('Industrial competitiveness policy for the European Union') - for example, for the purpose of analysing the effect of the information society on competitiveness and of stimulating the development of electronic trade - involve no genuine European added value and should therefore be discontinued."
"We therefore propose that these appropriations be transferred to budget line 02 02 03 ('Programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, particularly for SMEs'), where the funds could be of direct use to European businesses."
"We are also concerned about the problems and irregularities in connection with Eurostat and therefore want the European Parliament to ask for 25% of the appropriations to Eurostat's administrative expenditure to be placed in Title 31 ('Reserves') until the Commission has given Parliament sufficient assurance that the problems have been solved and that the people responsible have been identified and appropriately penalised."
"We also support the information campaign concerning the euro and welcome the fact that the Commission has proposed increases in the funding for this."
"These extra resources will be needed, given that the EU is to acquire ten new Member States that have all undertaken to introduce the euro as soon as possible."
"We are nonetheless still concerned about the implementation of this budget line in recent years and therefore want again to call upon the Commission to report each quarter to Parliament's relevant committee on the implementation of the programme in the current year and on the planning for next year."
"We also want to call upon the Commission to ensure that additional funds for the information campaign concerning the euro are available if further needs should arise, for example as a consequence of referendums in any of those countries that do not at present have the euro."
"As an aside, I regret that, following the result of the referendum last week, my own country, Sweden, will not be eligible for funds for the information campaign concerning the euro."
"The committee nonetheless supports the Commission's draft budget, but with the reservations I have expressed."
". (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, recent years have already seen the common foreign policy become a priority in the Budget debates, and that will be the case in the 2004 Budget too."
"The number of foreign policy areas in which the EU is involved in common action is reflected in its Budget."
"Together we have taken on responsibility for rebuilding Kosovo, and for bringing political stability to the Balkan States, and this is reflected in the Budget just as much as is support for the reconstruction work in Afghanistan."
"The 2004 Budget provides aid for the Balkans to the tune of some EUR 600 million and EUR 184 million for Afghanistan, which, together with other funds, means that the aid we are proposing for Afghanistan amounts to EUR 214 million."
"I might point out, by the way, that the European Union is doing all that it undertook to do at the donors' conference in Tokyo."
"I would also like to mention that the accusation referred to earlier to the effect that nothing happens for years after the European Union promises aid, is no longer accurate in such sweeping terms."
"It is here in the area of overseas aid that financial management reform has made a very positive and visible impact."
"This is one reason why the Commission greatly regrets the way in which the Council has cut the funding for the Commission's delegations, which play an ever-greater part in implementing the Budget."
"A major feature of the 2004 Budget will be the crisis in Iraq and the European Union's aid for the people there."
"This year already, the European Union has allocated EUR 100 million from the Community Budget for humanitarian aid."
"Reference has already frequently been made in this House to the fact that, on 24 October, the donors' conference on aid for the reconstruction of Iraq will be taking place."
"Commissioner Patten, who is today attending the UN General Assembly in New York, has made it clear to this House the great relevance of the budgetary constraints to effective aid in Iraq."
"An independent Trust Fund or a UN agency should guarantee that the aid given by the European Union is multilaterally applied."
"Next week - on 1 October - the Commission will propose the amount that we intend to pledge at the donors' conference, that being EUR 200 million."
"This proposal will provide for funds amounting to EUR 40 million to be mobilised this year, for the margin under heading 4 to be used next year and for the partial mobilisation of the flexibility reserve as well."
"That, then, will be our proposal for the donors' conference for up to the end of 2004."
"I believe that, in terms of its size, this promise of aid stands up well to comparison with the EUR 214 million for Afghanistan next year."
"Our promising EUR 200 million for Iraq has to be seen in context, in that Iraq is less populous than Afghanistan, which is a wretchedly poor country lacking access to income from oil reserves."
"Let me also take this opportunity to thank the budgetary authority for approving the support grant for Turkey, estimated at EUR 250 million for next year, and to be paid from the funds for pre-accession strategies;"
"I mention the amount for Turkey only in relation to our aid for Iraq. I believe that these things always have to be seen in comparative terms."
"The Commission's draft envisages a total of EUR 507 million for humanitarian aid."
"The Budget sets aside EUR 82 million for the fight against Aids, malaria and other communicable diseases, which have a catastrophic effect on many countries in Africa; this amount will also be used to fund our further donation to the Global Health Fund - that, too, will be the same amount as this year."
"The reason I mention this is that it figured prominently in this debate last year."
"Let me announce right now that my fellow-Commissioner Mr Nielson and I will, in a few days' time, be presenting a communication to the effect that, in future - from 2007 onwards, to be precise - resources for the European Development Fund will be incorporated into the normal Budget."
"Although the priority will still be the fight against poverty, the needs of the ACP States in particular require of us that we adopt a coherent policy approach."
"The simple fact is, though, that comparisons have revealed that the mechanism for implementing the ordinary Community Budget is much better than that for the European Development Fund."
"As part of the development policy measures, new resources are being provided specifically for the integration of gender issues into the aid programmes."
"Overseas aid in particular involves support for many projects particularly targeting the - often dire - situation of women in poor countries and crisis-hit regions."
"This is described in the reports on the aid programmes."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Van Hecke, for his work and his wonderful spirit of consensus and for his choice of the difficult priorities which have been included."
"What we need now of course is for these priorities to be accepted by the Committee on Budgets and by Parliament as a whole, with any modifications which the Committee on Budgets may have to make."
"Some speakers such as Mr Wynn or Mr Walter have explained very clearly the pressures which have been facing heading 4 of the Budget and the urgent issues which the European Union has had to deal with over recent years."
"We have had the case of Kosovo, of the Balkans, of East Timor, of Afghanistan and this year we have the problem of Iraq."
"Since this has been discussed during this debate, I would like to say that my political group believes that the European Union must make a significant contribution to the rehabilitation, reconstruction, pacification and democratisation of Iraq, because we believe that the democratisation of that country must not be the exclusive responsibility of the United States, but that it must also fall to the whole of the international democratic community."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, tomorrow the European Parliament is going to approve a resolution on Iraq which states very clearly, as Mr Van Hecke has quite rightly said, that the action in Iraq must not be funded to the detriment of other areas or other commitments made."
"I have listened with great interest to the comments that the Commissioner has just made and I note that the Commission's intentions or forecasts are not going to go as far as that EUR 500 million."
"I would ask you, Commissioner, whether you intend to consider the complete mobilisation of the flexibility instrument, which was not used last year or this year, and whether you intend to consider other very interesting possibilities such as those referred to by the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder."
"Next year, with the incorporation of the candidate countries, there will be lines within the external action of the European Investment Bank which could perhaps be used for that priority."
"It may perhaps be worth considering that possibility."
"Mr President, the problem we are facing this year with Iraq is a recurrent problem, we cannot live from hand to mouth, we must try to find a permanent solution to the urgent issues which arise in the field of external action and try to mobilise instruments which, in a flexible manner, allow us to assist with these priorities but without, I would insist, prejudicing others."
"Mr President, as the President of Romania said this morning, or as the President of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, said the other day in this Chamber, if our aspiration is for the European Union to play a key role on the international stage, we will have to seek permanent solutions to these problems, because otherwise we will have to be content with being a non-governmental organisation or a kind of international Red Cross which has no other purpose or job than to pay the bill for the great dramas of our times."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is not merely a project for the ruling classes, but will also, if it succeeds, be an enormous triumph for democracy."
"The EU will soon have 450 million citizens, and over half of them are women."
"If women are to take their share in building Europe, information must be targeted at them and they must be involved in specific ways."
"This parliamentary term has seen us developing our strategy for gender mainstreaming and finding room for it in the Budget process, but its successes are not as evident as they could be, in that women are still generally not visible in the policy areas and we still generally do not see them occupying positions of leadership in the institutions."
"Women make up only 14% of the observers from the candidate countries, only 17% of the members of the Convention, and only 25% of the Commissioners."
"Whilst women make up 70% of the staff in category C, not one of Parliament's Directors-General is a woman."
"Our resolution on gender mainstreaming proposes a whole range of actions to set benchmarks for the horizontal task of deliberately bringing women into the institutions, such as monitoring the success of leave for educational purposes, retraining, career and personal development, and so on."
"Commissioner, you are now encouraging high expectations of gender budgeting, the implementation of which will mean the professional 'gendering' of every committee, every policy area, and every one of the Directorates-General."
"We need to identify women as a target group when thinking in terms of the visibility of information campaigns, particularly in elections, and that we should involve women in every area of foreign policy - for example, in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq."
"DAPHNE was a good challenge, and so, of course, are the internal policy areas such as the Structural Funds, for example."
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to three different issues in relation to this debate. They are forest fire prevention, East Timor and economic and social cohesion."
"The tragic fires which have devastated southern Europe, especially Portugal, where 5% of the land area and 11% of woodland has been consumed by flames, makes clear the need to increase assistance for measures to prevent forest fires."
"Sadly, a retrograde step has been taken in the form of the new Forest Focus programme."
"In its resolution of 4 September, the European Parliament insisted that the amount of appropriations for the European Union should, within the framework of the draft Forest Focus regulation, be the same as in the previous 1992 regulation on the protection of forests from fires with a view to funding appropriate forest fire prevention measures."
"We have, therefore, made a proposal suggesting that another EUR 6 million be allocated to the programme and that prevention issues be clearly included in it."
"We hope this proposal will be approved."
"I would like to know, nevertheless, whether the Commission agrees with increasing the amounts and including preventive measures in the Forest Focus programme."
"Turning to East Timor: in its preliminary draft budget, the Commission has removed the specific aid line and reduced aid by around 70%."
"We have, therefore, tabled another amendment with a view to restoring the amount of aid to the EUR 25.5 million programmed in 2003."
"We hope that Parliament will support this amendment, as in the past, but I would also like to know how the Commission can justify this cut, given the discussions held on the budget during 2003 and the various difficulties and areas of instability still existing in East Timor."
"Finally, in view of the fact that this draft Community budget is the lowest, in relative terms, since 1987, representing less than 1% of Community gross national income, I would like to know how the principle of economic and social cohesion in the European Union will be safeguarded. I would ask, in particular, how we will fight for social inclusion and employment growth, given that enlargement in 2004 will see the accession of 10 new countries whose average per capita income is only about 40% of the Community average."
"As I believe it is impossible to achieve economic and social cohesion with this budget, I would like to ask the Commission whether it wants to abolish economic and social cohesion through future amendments to the Treaties."
"Mr President, various people have already complained about the Council's reduction of the money for Afghanistan."
"I think that this is primarily also an example of the short-term vision of many governments, who seem to be engaged in 'crisis hopping'."
"From Kosovo to Serbia - the money transferred along too - and from Afghanistan to Iraq."
"The Member States will therefore not keep the promises they made at the donor conference for Afghanistan, despite the fact that it is increasingly turning out that these promises were on the low side anyway."
"I assume that common sense will prevail in this House and that we will fix a higher amount than the Council has in mind."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner another question, this time concerning a different amendment from the one on Afghanistan, namely an amendment from the PPE."
"They suggest putting an amount aside until they stop growing poppies and start growing legal agricultural products."
"Is it not true, however, that the aid provided by the EU hardly reaches the remote areas where these poppies are grown?"
"How do you intend solving this problem?"
"I also note that the committees and groups have submitted amendments for external policy which amount to EUR 841 million more than the Commission's proposals."
"I would like the Commissioner to tell me how she can explain this discrepancy."
"Is it true that we simply agree massive amounts, or do you in fact adhere rigidly to the ceiling of the financial forecasts after all, conflicting with the EU's priorities in the process, because there are many more needs in the area of external policy than you suggest?"
"My last question - very brief - is about North Korea."
"The money for the KEDO project has been frozen and we are doing absolutely nothing else about energy provision there."
"Is it possible to use the money or part of the money which was previously intended for nuclear energy provision to subsidise alternative energy sources in North Korea?"
"Mr President, in the framework of preparing the priorities for foreign affairs, defence and security matters, the rapporteur, Mr van Hecke has had broad support from the members of our committee, in particular when he reinstated a portion of the Commission's proposal and further encouraged NGO activity."
"Our rapporteur placed the emphasis on the role of the European Union as promoter of human rights in the world."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists recommends that all the lines concerning countries benefiting from an association and stability agreement on the Balkans be transferred from the category of 'external actions' to that of 'pre-accession aid'."
"In addition, we request that realistic appropriations for the Israel-Palestine line be provided, instead of the practice being continued of a posteriori transfers."
"We fully support Amendment No 445 which proposes EUR 47 million for conflict prevention activities - and, in my view, prevention is always less expensive than cure - and Amendment No 118, which proposes EUR 2.5 million by way of additional appropriations for information programmes in third countries."
"An amendment by Mr Elles proposes establishing a line of EUR 500 million for the reconstruction of Iraq."
"There are two reasons why this amendment is unacceptable to the PSE Group."
"While remaining open to the creation of a new budgetary line, we cannot envisage providing funds in the absence of any mandate from the United Nations for the reconstruction of Iraq and in the absence of reliable estimates from the Commission."
"In our view, it is important that the UN have exclusive control over the reconstruction fund."
"Finally, I should like to invite the Commission to inform Parliament regarding the use of the funds in Latin America and to tell us if the considerable increase proposed by a series of amendments is realistic."
"Mr President, the solemn calls for budgetary rigour and discipline entail devastating constraints when it comes to development aid."
"The promises remain, but there is a difficulty in getting actions to follow. That, in the end, is the thought inspired in me by this 2004 budget on development cooperation."
"I agree, on this matter, with our rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, that any subordination to the external actions heading cannot but accentuate this phenomenon."
"Indeed, how is one to believe that the objective of eradicating poverty between now and 2015 will be achieved when - and this is only one example - the financial commitments to the Middle Eastern, Latin American, Asian and ACP countries that are the concern of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee have not been honoured by the Commission, particularly when it comes to the health and education sectors?"
"One is permitted to have doubts."
"The sums allocated still offer very little basis for fulfilling the declared wish of achieving the millennium objectives."
"How can approval not be given to any demand made of the Commission to give attention also to the rights of the most vulnerable people and to provide for a specific budgetary line when necessary?"
"I am thinking, for example, of the rights of children."
"Any reduction in, or financial pressure upon, the fundamental elements of Community policy, such as human rights or the duty to give assistance to those who are weakest, would have the effect of sending out a very negative signal indeed to peoples already largely excluded from the march of world progress - victims, no more nor less, of a globalisation that has more in common with the law of the jungle than with growth and the equitable distribution of wealth."
"Developing countries are waiting for the European Union's ambitions to change, a fact witnessed to, I think, by the reactions at the last WTO conference in Cancún."
"As a final word on the subject of development aid, I remain convinced that, without a serious review of the financial perspectives, the pressure upon this heading will become unbearable."
"As for the proposals concerning reconstruction in Iraq, they also call, at any rate in the long term, for an increase in overall resources to avoid the need to draw on the reduced sums for development aid."
"That being said, I agree with Mr Poos: the announcement of such a financial commitment cannot in any case precede Europe's indispensable adoption of an independent policy in favour of the sovereignty of the Iraqi people and of the role of the UN."
"Regarding the amendments, I approve of those that could favour an annual evaluation of the results and anticipate a joint dialogue between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the methods to be put in place in order to achieve the objectives."
"In the same spirit and in the interests of genuinely democratic and effective development cooperation, I am in favour of encouraging the widest participation, at all levels, of all those active in civil society."
"Finally, I am going to support my group's proposal aimed at creating a specific line of aid for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the territories under the administration of the Palestinian Authority."
"The Israeli army's destruction, to the tune of almost EUR 40 million, of the infrastructure funded by the EU or the Member States was the product of criminal fury."
"The Palestinian population's conditions of life have deteriorated considerably during the most recent period."
"We know that the Commission's delegation on the ground is doing a remarkable job in difficult conditions. If, however, the EU is to be an active member of the quartet in the manner suggested by the speeches, the EU would do well to accord its budgetary lines as it intends."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Schreyer, Mr Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by welcoming the fact that we are holding this new budgetary debate, which has already shown itself to be a useful and profitable experience for the Commission and Parliament."
"It is a good opportunity which we Members of the European Parliament are grateful for and take a very positive view of."
"From a general point of view, this is the year in which we should avoid the conflict between national and Community interests."
"The principles of budgetary austerity in national budgets, which are at the root of the Stability Pact, must be reconciled more than ever with the complete implementation of the Community policies contained in the objectives of the Community budget."
"It is perhaps we, as Members of the European Parliament, who have the greatest interest in the Stability Pact being complied with and respected."
"Compliance with it must not be an excuse to interfere in the development of the great areas of expenditure of the Union's budget, but it must be another incentive to improve its implementation."
"Providing our budget with sufficient payment appropriations does not mean failing to comply with the austerity objectives, but to help the European Union's growth by means of its policies."
"Otherwise we would be preventing the correct absorption of the leftovers or hindering the efficient implementation of the structural policies."
"The Union's best budgetary policy is not one that allows for a high budgetary expenditure, but one which implements the commitments in the Budget well."
"We would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she agrees with this approach and whether the Commission believes that the level of payment appropriations in the Council's draft budget is sufficient."
"On the other hand, our group has no particular reasons to disagree with the Council on this Budget."
"We would like, and this will be agreed in the sectoral debate, to go further into certain questions of agricultural or internal policy."
"In external policy we are still seeking a more active role for the Union in the world, because that is also part of the programmed objectives of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"This must be seen not only in relation to the strengthening of the common foreign and security policy - both its objectives and its budgetary appropriations - but to particular reconstruction actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, as part of the European Union's moral commitment to promote peace, security and human rights."
"We would therefore like to know, Commissioner, whether there is really sufficient room in the budget to be able to take account of the approach taken by the PPE by means of its amendment."
"Mr President, firstly, from a conceptual point of view, we legitimately wish the new nomenclature for the Budget to be a technical instrument which rationalises it, and not a cunning way to modify the political orientations of Community action."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation is therefore, under the heading 'Development', restoring the cooperation lines with Asia and Latin America, which had been diverted to the external relations heading."
"Development policy is not only directed towards the ACP countries, but towards all developing countries with a view to eradicating poverty."
"Furthermore, Commissioner, we thank you and we congratulate and support you, as well as Mr Nielson, in relation to the budgeting of the EDF."
"Secondly, our policy for assisting certain groups such as the Saharan people, who for years have been objectively in a situation of humanitarian need, should not be called into question for administrative reasons."
"And finally, the integration of the gender perspective into the Budget is one of our objectives."
"With regard to the figures, our priorities are the funding of actions to promote children's rights, funds for combating AIDS and malaria, increasing funds for Latin America and the Mediterranean: between the 2000 Budget and the draft 2004 Budget the funds intended for cooperation with these regions have plummeted; they have been reduced by 10.8% for Latin America (EUR 37.2 million) and 16% for MEDA in real terms (EUR 193.9 million), despite the new priorities for these two regions and the summit which is going to take place."
"Their reflection in the Budget should not conflict with the ceiling corresponding to us, provided that there is no intention to fund any other new action or initiative through development funds."
"And it is for this reason that we are also concerned about the reconstruction of Iraq or any other issue which may arise."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say something about some of this Budget's foreign policy aspects and will start by responding to Mr Poos, who said that the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is unacceptable in terms of the amount that it proposes for Iraq, as a UN mandate is required."
"Mr Poos has evidently not read this amendment, which takes as its reference value the resolution that this House will be adopting tomorrow, it being a minimum precondition for the European Union's involvement in Iraq that there should be a UN resolution, that the money should be put in a trust fund controlled by the World Bank and the United Nations, that the Iraqi people should be involved in the processes of democratisation, in the adoption of a constitution and of the establishment of institutions, all of which are now needed, and, above all, that the oil industry should be placed in the hands of the United Nations, in order that it may be a source of funding for the country's reconstruction."
"The budget allocation we have proposed is dependent on that condition, and, even if we are talking in terms of one single euro rather than five hundred million of them, it matters that we should get this general concept and these framework conditions right."
"From that point of view, the Budget today and Parliament's resolution tomorrow must be seen as very closely interconnected."
"Secondly, if this leads us to say that we want to get the United Nations more involved, then we must give more attention to it and to our relations with it overall - and that is what Parliament and the Commission are currently working on."
"I believe it is tomorrow that the Italian Presidency of the Council is signing, in New York, an agreement on crisis management and crisis prevention, but this needs to be mentioned in the Budget."
"At present, our programmes for the United Nations are all shared out between a whole load of items in the Budget, without there having been a policy debate to set priorities."
"As an issue in this House, the subject of the United Nations has been dormant in recent years, and the Commission's new document gives hope that we will now be defining our relationship with the UN in more political terms, even though the Commission has achieved the masterly feat of producing a document of nearly fifty pages that refers not even once to Parliament and the budgetary authority."
"I think that any redefinition will also necessitate dialogue between the Commission and Parliament."
"Now for a third comment, addressed to the Council. As we do in every Budget procedure, we have put a number of Budget lines in reserve, as the Council still refuses to provide the information agreed on in the November 2002 agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"This sometimes seems as if we are battering our heads against the Kremlin wall in the way we used to do."
"We are sure that we will overcome this obstacle and come to an agreement with the Council that will guarantee the public and Parliament greater transparency in future concerning what is going on in the common foreign and security policy."
"Mr President, firstly, and as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder, who are present at the moment, and the President of the committee, Mr Wynn, for the work being done at the moment in that committee, which we hope will have a favourable and happy outcome in December."
"I would like to refer to the agriculture chapter, and I would also like to thank Mr Fischler for being here and say to him that, despite the lack of success in Cancún, I am particularly grateful for his defence during these meetings of the interests of European farmers and breeders, of all Europeans and of the whole commercial world."
"The amendments proposed to the agriculture chapter are aimed above all, in my view, to the promotion and quality of European products."
"It is important to bear in mind the amendments I have presented, because one of our fundamental tasks is to protect and defend European products, because their production involves stricter methods with regard to quality and respect for the environment."
"We must also promote information in relation to the common agricultural policy."
"At this moment, when the whole of the common agricultural policy is being changed, it is important that the citizens know what this policy is and, above all, the opportunities it represents for European agriculture and livestock."
"I have placed particular emphasis on the introduction of agricultural insurance systems and I would like this to take place and for it to be reflected in the 2004 Budget."
"Finally, I would like to refer to the restoration of funds for the 'Forest Focus', for the prevention and combating of fires, because, as we have seen this summer, the absence of prevention and combating of forest fires may lead us into very dramatic environmental situations."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I do not propose to discuss agricultural policy, as much more has been said - by Mr Poos, Mr Laschet, and Mr Salafranca - on the subject of Iraq."
"I am glad to see consensus on the need for the conditions to be met."
"Aid, including that given by the European Union, must be provided under the aegis of the United Nations."
"The Trust Fund must not be confused with the fund administering the yields from oil deposits, but must be separate from it."
"I also believe that we can also achieve consensus on other points relating to the conditions."
"The EUR 200 million proposed by the Commission would also express well our sense of obligation, our awareness of the need for us to take on responsibility, and our willingness to do so together on the basis of the EU Budget."
"It is also very important that this aid for Iraq should be seen in relation to the shared commitments that we have made in other areas."
"Let me reiterate that EUR 214 million have been allocated to Afghanistan for next year, thus discharging in full the obligations into which we entered at the donors' conference in Tokyo."
"I would also like to again lay stress upon the fact that we are allocating, next year, EUR 250 million as additional aid for Turkey, Iraq's neighbour, with 65 million inhabitants, and that must also, of course, be seen in its context."
"Next week - on 1 October - we will have the opportunity to debate this in a joint meeting of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, when the Commission will be putting forward a proposal that the margin and also part of the flexibility reserve be used for Iraq, and will be submitting an amending budget."
"Mrs Figueiredo asked about the Forest Focus programme."
"For this we have allocated the same amount as this year."
"Both the Regional Development Fund and the Structural Funds can be used for reforestation measures and also for measures to prevent natural disasters."
"The question has been raised as to whether cohesion policy can be pursued at all successfully using a European Budget amounting to some 0.99 per cent of the Community's economic product."
"The answer to that is in the affirmative."
"The European Budget and its effects demonstrate that our support for cohesion policy is yielding fruit."
"Last week, I presented what we are calling the 'allocation report', which shows who is paying what and where the money goes."
"The four cohesion countries are the four net recipients from the EU's Budget, which is only right and proper."
"The two poorest countries receive the most funds expressed as a percentage of their gross national product, and the cohesion reports do indeed show how successful that is, and that the European Union is successful in its efforts to reduce the economic gaps between one country and another."
"Mrs Buitenweg addressed the issue of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation."
"This year, these funds - which, by the way, your House had blocked - will be reallocated to other purposes, whilst this breach of the agreement means that we have allocated no funds in the preliminary draft Budget for next year."
"North Korea is not, unfortunately, offering to abandon its atomic programme and to invest instead in renewable forms of energy."
"This is also relevant to Mr Dell'Alba's question on the human rights clause."
"Countries such as North Korea, in which humanitarian emergencies exist at the same time as human rights are being abused, always put us in a very difficult position."
"Indeed, the Commission had also decided to step up humanitarian aid for North Korea, concentrating this aid on mothers, who are worst affected by the terrible conditions in that country."
"The Commission did of course bear in mind administrations' capacity for implementing them when making its proposals relating to Latin America, but we will of course look at Parliament's various proposals as well."
"Next, Mr Garriga Polledo asked whether the means of payment cut by the Council are still adequate."
"As it usually does in October, the Commission will shortly be proposing a revision of the agricultural policy, with new assessments of market developments and taking due account of the exchange rate."
"We will also be submitting an estimate relating to the old Structural Funds programmes, but I can tell you even now that the Commission cannot accept that the means of payment for pre-accession aid should be cut back."
"Next year, although the candidate countries will be Member States, they will still be getting help with their pre-accession programmes, as these will still be in progress."
"It is fortunate that the pre-accession programmes are now at last being better implemented, and this of course means that we need the means to pay for them."
"We would be very glad if Parliament and the Council together were to restore the former amounts."
"Mr President, before discussing the budget, I would like to convey our good wishes to our Commissioner, Mr Fischler, on his birthday today."
"We are particularly pleased that he is here for the budget, but also that he is celebrating his birthday with us."
"We appreciate that very much."
"This is not the only support I am giving this Commissioner, as my words will also be critical of the Council and will contain support for the Commission's policy."
"For the sake of clarity, much has changed in the budgetary system."
"Amongst other things, pre-accession aid for the new members has been added to the agricultural budget."
"What is particularly striking, though, is that the Council has cut the Commission's original preliminary draft of the budget right down to the bone."
"For a start, a distinction has again been drawn between the old or existing Member States and the new Member States."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development regrets that."
"A linear reduction has also been made, however, which amounts to a considerable sum in many cases."
"A linear reduction has been implemented ruthlessly in budget amounts of more than a billion in particular."
"I would like to say this to the Council: you must realise that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development stands four square behind the Commission."
"It wants the approbations included in the preliminary draft of the budget reinstated."
"I can understand that the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, wanted to submit a block amendment that includes this."
"This is also urged in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's report."
"It would be a good thing if the Council were to realise this, particularly given the fact that next year will be a difficult year; a complete review of our agricultural policy and the accession of new Member States."
"The Council must therefore realise that it is essential that the Commission be given sufficient financial leeway to implement this policy."
"I would like to mention some of the various items."
"It is true that we are aiming for a more market-compliant policy, but at the same time the Council wants to make too many cutbacks, which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development considers unacceptable."
"To begin with the school market programme; we propose earmarking an additional 10.3 million for this."
"We also refer to the support for young farmers and for future-oriented and innovative projects."
"I am referring to the LEADER programme and the SAPARD programme."
"If it were up to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, there would be an extra 144 million."
"The same applies to promotion, control and prevention."
"With regard to the latter point, I would like to say that we must not allow more cutbacks on the veterinary funds and the emergency funds for animal diseases to be made."
"We want 30 million extra for these two items."
"Mr President, a number of amendments to the budget were adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"A main objective was to restore or increase the budgets of the agencies on which we rely to carry out statutory and other tasks set by Parliament, namely those of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, the European Environment Agency and the fledgling European Food Safety Authority."
"New tasks are continually being delegated to these agencies and it is vital that they are adequately resourced."
"Secondly, once again we expose the hypocrisy of a European Union that pays lip-service to health promotion by combating smoking-related diseases but continues to pour EUR 1 billion per annum into subsidising the production of low-quality tobacco, much of which is exported to developing countries."
"How can this be justified?"
"Lastly I turn to CAP reform."
"European Union and US farmers are subsidy junkies and although the agreement does not spell an end to this transatlantic addiction, it may be a step in the right direction."
"We applaud moves from direct aid to aid linked to environmental objectives, but we know very well that many environmental directives are not being complied with."
"For example, the Nitrates Directive, despite being 13 years old, is only being complied with in two Member States."
"Does Commissioner Fischler foresee individual farmers, regions or Member States having their cheques cut back because of this non-compliance?"
"Are we only paying lip-service to a link between the CAP and a cleaner, better environment?"
"(DE) Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Maat has already mentioned - amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are restoring the estimates for various Budget lines under heading 1a to the levels envisaged by the preliminary draft Budget."
"Although the Commission welcomes these amendments, I would like to remind you that, at the end of October, the Commission will be approving a letter of amendment to the preliminary draft Budget in respect of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund, in order to update the resources required."
"It would certainly be premature to give precise figures for the amendments that we will be proposing, but I am already able to tell you something about the important factors that make these changes necessary."
"These include, first, the depreciation of the US dollar against the euro, which has had consequent effects on certain export refunds or on aid; then, the decision to grant, as early as 2003 - that is to say, in the Budget year 2003 - certain advances against animal premiums for those regions that suffered particularly from the summer drought; and, finally, an agreement on the reform of the common agricultural policy, which, however, is expected to have little effect on the Budget for 2004."
"Let me now return to the amendments that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted."
"The amendment relating to subheading 1b on rural development increases the estimates to such an extent that they would exceed the upper limit in the Financial Perspective by some EUR 100 million."
"Whilst the Commission shares your view that there is an absolute need to strengthen the second pillar - after all, this is also the general tendency of the modulation agreed on as part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, and, moreover, funds will be reallocated from subheading 1a to subheading 1b with effect from 2006 - you will understand that, where the 2004 Budget is concerned, the Commission is unable to go beyond the upper limit in the Financial Perspective."
"Turning to SAPARD and to the introduction of a new Budget line for the funding of a sort of 'Leader East', I would like to say that, in the short time available, I see it as neither feasible nor desirable to provide, in the 2004 Budget, for 'Leader'-type measures in a new preparatory instrument."
"We are, however, currently examining how SAPARD's basic rules can be altered in such a way as to do justice to your concerns."
"Finally, I would like to discuss some of the priorities set by the general rapporteur."
"Firstly, the resolution on the Budget for 2004 states that funds are to be made available for the further development of opportunities for the use of environmental indicators."
"In this context, the rapporteur demands that a study be drawn up on how these indicators are worked out."
"I take a favourable view of this."
"The second point has to do with the implementation of a preparatory measure to promote the introduction of insurance schemes to cover economic losses resulting from epizootics."
"As the Commission is very much in favour of a public debate on this issue, to involve all the stakeholders, we are planning for next year a series of consultations and seminars, which will involve all the services and parties affected."
"As regards the development of marker vaccines and discriminatory tests for pathogens such as those causing foot and mouth disease or classical swine fever, let me say on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne, that the Commission is working on a directive in this area, which is to create the legal basis for funding to be made available for the development of standard serums."
"Once the Commission has approved this directive, there will be an invitation to tender for the manufacture of these standard serums."
"After evaluation, a decision will then be taken on the manufacture of other serums and the funding that this will require."
"Turning to the proposal for the examination of systems for the quality assurance and certification of what is termed integrated supply chain management, I am able to assure Mr Mulder that the Commission is in favour of budgeting half a million euros for the purpose of funding new studies and a conference."
"I would also like to respond to the accusation that we are continuing to fund the tobacco sector."
"Let me draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has today decided that we will carry out a reform of the tobacco sector, which will result in these financial resources being completely decoupled."
"As regards non-compliance, in certain situations, with the nitrates directive, let me point out to you that the Commission has for some time already been taking legal action on this, but this is primarily to do with the way in which the Member States have only partly complied with the requirements of the nitrates directive and have therefore not implemented it."
"It follows that this cannot be laid at the door of individual farmers."
"I would, finally, like to point out to you that the Council has reduced the number of posts for expenditure connected with enlargement."
"As you will all be aware, the common agricultural policy will be applicable in the new Member States from the day of their accession, with nothing left out."
"This makes it absolutely necessary that the Commission should have enough in the way of personnel resources to be able to effectively implement the common agricultural policy."
"Let me turn now - very briefly - to fisheries and to the report by Mrs Langenhagen, Mr Mulder and Mr Färm, the motion for a resolution in which I can very largely endorse, so that I would now like simply to pick up on only a few of its aspects."
"As long ago as March, when we had the resolution on the white fish sector, Parliament called on the budgetary authority to draw up a plan for allocating EUR 150 million to compensate for the losses sustained by coastal communities as a consequence of the crisis in white fish stocks."
"On several occasions, I asked the Member States to tell us how much additional funding they required."
"With the exception of the United Kingdom and Denmark, though, not one Member State reported itself to be in any need."
"The Commission is therefore unable to put before Parliament any proposal for additional funds."
"The same is true of the attempt to have scrapping funds funded to the tune of an additional EUR 32 million."
"That, too, proved unsuccessful, as the Member States did not provide the necessary data."
"Mr Färm asked why funds could not be reallocated to provide the EUR 32 million, and so I would like to remind him that there is no longer any margin in heading 2, quite apart from which, all funding commitments were finalised right at the beginning of the programme planning period in the national and regional programme planning documents for all four of the Structural Funds."
"There can therefore be no reallocation before next year's mid-term review."
"I can confirm that we will, in the coming weeks, be submitting a proposal on the Regional Advisory Councils."
"I agree with the statement in Mrs Langenhagen's report that fisheries agreements should be endowed with appropriate funding and that their budgets should be as transparent as possible."
"On fisheries inspections, I am able to inform you that we will, in the weeks to come, propose that the current Regulation on the Member States' expenditure on inspection work be extended to run until 2005, and provision is made for this in the draft of the 2004 Budget."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we Socialists welcome Mr Maat's report, on which I would like to make the following comments. As young people's health is always of very great importance to us, we should be building up the school milk programme, rather than virtually freezing its current funding in the way that the Council has decided."
"Existing funds will not be enough for ten new Member States, and adequate funding for rural areas and their development, along with assuring the quality of food production, are equally indispensable."
"This is another area in which money must flow, and it is also important that it should be possible to move from measures to regulate the market to support for rural areas, which, at present a fragile sapling, may thus be enabled to put down strong roots and to flourish."
"As rapporteur of the temporary committee on foot and mouth disease, I can see that the enlargement of the European Union means that there must be significantly more investment in the prevention of epizootics."
"I am glad to hear Commissioner Fischler tell Mr Byrne that more money should find its way into research, as a calamity such as the one we have witnessed in Great Britain must not be allowed to happen again."
"What I would say in general terms to the Council is that trimming budgets as if you were mowing the lawn serves no useful purpose whatever, for the agricultural budget is not a quarry to be worked for the benefit of this or that other project."
"The right road ahead does not go by way of across-the-board cuts, and this House wants what was provided for in the Convention's draft constitution - full powers of codecision and the abolition of the clear-cut dividing line between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"You can be certain that expert decision-making in both the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets would then be guaranteed beyond doubt."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, Commissioner Fischler, I want to focus on rural development."
"By topping up the funds for this area, the committee has made it clear that it is to this that we attach a higher value and that the cutting back of the market organisations demands that there should be compensation for farms that take themselves to market."
"We note with concern the evidence that the groups - and, so one gathers, the Commission - are discussing how to use long-term financial planning as a means of trimming this area rather than extending it, or the possibility of putting it under the Structural Funds."
"Commissioner Fischler, I see the fact that there is now a structural line devoted to 'rural areas' as a great triumph on your part."
"It would be fatal if the forces that want to put things back the way they were were to prevail, as the Structural Funds criteria for rural areas are not very favourable."
"When expressing your view of the 'Leader East' issue, you pointed out that you wanted to adjust the SAPARD programme accordingly."
"We have had this discussion before."
"I hear what you say, but I lack the faith to believe that the administration will actually put it into practice and that a sensible practice will be the result."
"A 'Leader East' programme should therefore be set up for Bulgaria and Romania, in order to involve the ordinary population in the development of rural areas."
"Let me conclude by saying that it was also with great disquiet that we heard - as we shall shortly do in the committee, when you will give us your comments - that the offer was made to make the Green Box a subject for negotiation."
"Such a development we really would regard as crazy."
"If something that is necessary from the point of view of rural development is now to be seen as a subsidy currently laid off and liable to be cut back, then we should discuss that in this House and make our position clear in the next round at the WTO."
"Mr President, the common agricultural policy remains the single biggest item of expenditure in the Community budget."
"Along with most colleagues, I welcome the fact that a series of reforms under the current and past Commissioners have brought agricultural expenditure under control."
"It is also welcome that the Council agreement in Brussels in October 2002 brought stability and predictability to farmer spending up to 2013."
"Furthermore, the most recent Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform ensures that payments will shift away from trade-distorting subsidies to payments based on services to society provided by our farmers in areas such as the environment, food safety and animal welfare."
"I strongly support this trend."
"I also strongly support the need to maintain export refunds as a crucial stabilising tool within the budget."
"The amount of money given has been a decreasing portion of farmer spending over the past number of years."
"Nevertheless, this will remain an essential mechanism for assisting heavily export-dependent sectors to maintain a position in export markets in periods when prices are plunging and markets are uncertain."
"In conclusion, I welcome the statement from Commissioner Fischler on the proposal to decouple aid for tobacco producers, which will hopefully lead to a reduction in the production of this health-damaging crop."
"Mr President, Commissioners, comrades, ladies and gentlemen, in the areas of environmental protection, consumer protection and health, we keep on, at European level, we keep on attempting to tackle very ambitious projects that are intended to improve the public's quality of life in every area: environmental action programmes, action programmes in the field of public health, consumer protection strategies, strategies for the environment and health, and so on and so forth."
"This is where the Commission's preliminary draft Budget is rather timid, characterised by willing submission to the Council's mania for indiscriminate austerity measures."
"How else is one to imagine the genesis of this PDB, which the Council or - to put it a better way, the functionaries in COREPER - have tightened up?"
"That, let me add, for a year in which the Budget is to be drawn up not for fifteen Member States, but for twenty-five, for which it must be adequate."
"That, though, is the Council with which we are familiar, ceremoniously signing treaties, but refusing to put its name to the budget appropriations for them."
"Just do not let the Commission get into the same way of doing things."
"We know that the ten new Member States' institutions are in need of a great deal of reconstruction where the protection of the environment, consumer policy and health care are concerned; these are areas in which, despite the funds made available under the pre-accession strategy, they have as yet achieved nothing of any substance."
"Not only have we learned that from the Consumers International report, but the Court of Auditors has also enjoined us to take good note of it."
"Of course we want 'greening of the budget', consumer protection as a mainstreaming principle in all European policies, and awareness at every level of Europe, but, to do that, we need operational resources and resources in terms of personnel, and these have to be made available."
"That will not be done only by pithy strategies or action programmes written down on paper - which, of course, does not blush!"
"Mr President, Mrs Langenhagen, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, has clearly communicated the concerns of this committee with regard to the draft Budget for 2004."
"In the view of the Socialists, and in my view as their spokesman, three of the issues of the many which the rapporteur indicates in her report are the most prominent and my group fully agrees with them."
"The first relates to the socio-economic crisis in the white fish sector, which results from the recovery plans for a series of species including hake and cod and to which we must now also add halibut in the fishing grounds of the NAFO."
"We agree with the sum of EUR 150 million proposed by the rapporteur."
"The second, ladies and gentlemen, relates to the scrapping fund, for which the Committee on Fisheries proposes a sum of EUR 32 million."
"I would like to say to the Commissioner that he, as Commissioner, and the Commission itself, has promoted a reform of the CFP of a highly destructive nature, scrapping fleets, and that the Commissioner for budgets should perhaps tell us now how much additional funding is going to be allocated by the Commission to pay for this policy of scrapping."
"The third issue I would like to focus on is the fisheries agreements."
"The new ones: Tanzania, Kenya, Libya, etc. for which additional funds will be needed, and the old ones, for which the Committee on Fisheries maintains its former demand that the part corresponding to compensation for fishing opportunities be separated in this budget line from the part corresponding to development cooperation with third countries."
". (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I do not want now to repeat all the things I said in my speech earlier, but just to deal with a number of the issues that have been raised."
"For a start, I believe that we are, in principle, in entire agreement where the issue of rural development is concerned, but we must, on the other hand, all abide by the boundaries set by the Financial Perspective."
"As regards what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf rightly described as a long drawn-out debate on additional measures in connection with a sort of 'Leader East', I do not know if I can now, so to speak, convert him, as he has said he lacks the faith, but I am quite serious in saying ?"
"... that we will rearrange the basic regulation in such a way as to do justice to your concern."
"Taking up your suggestion that we should discuss the things that were said in Cancún about the Green Box, I really would greatly welcome a discussion of this sort, which we could perhaps extend by inviting various representatives of NGOs to join in."
"I did in fact get the impression from Cancún that this is where what one might term the sustainability department and the development department in some of the NGOs sometimes put forward quite contrary points of view, and I believe that this is something we should really hammer out together."
"I have already indicated that the Commission can make a proposal on fisheries policy only if the Member States are willing to give us the necessary figures."
"Their needs are obviously not that great, or else they would have provided the figures."
"I am not, therefore able to say at present how much of the Budget is to be allocated additionally to the scrapping policy; my only guide is what we have actually been told is needed."
"We are meant to - and we will - draw a distinction between the development component and that element in which we pay for the acquisition of fisheries rights under an agreement, but no new subheadings are needed for this in the Budget; it can be quite sensibly organised within one Budget line, and that is what we are going to do."
"You will very soon find your requests being complied with in the proposals that we are going to submit."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, when dealing with the issue of European jurisdiction, limited itself to seconding the proposal for the Commission's preliminary draft, which provides for increases for two reasons; the first being in consequence of enlargement, and the second in response to new tasks for European justice, in which context more funds are allocated for the purposes of documentation and translation."
"What that means - no more and no less - is that the Commission's preliminary draft does not include any structural improvements in the conditions under which the European justice system functions."
"Nevertheless, we went no further than doing this, and I would like to urge the Committee on Budgets not to reduce this still further, for, if we allocate only the funding relating to enlargement, and not the funds for the additional tasks, the situation cannot fail to deteriorate still further."
"The Committee on Budgets will have to decide whether to take sides with the Council or with the Commission and the Court of Justice."
"The second point that I would like to address has to do with the Academy of European Law, the work of which, over the past ten years, has met with immense success."
"Its founding members, Germany and Luxembourg, have since been joined by Ireland, Poland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hungary and Sweden."
"Finland has announced its intention of joining."
"Over the past ten years, a total of 38 000 people from the European Union and the new countries have taken part in seminars and training courses."
"The Academy of European Law has, in that time, become the secretariat of the European Judicial Training Network, and it will, in future, be particularly involved in promoting cooperation between judges in Eastern Europe."
"All this justifies a commensurate increase in the grants to the Academy of European Law under the financial programme, not only for 2004, but thereafter."
". Mr President, I am extremely grateful to you and indeed to Mr Rothley for speaking long enough to enable me to get through the door."
"Mr Rothley did this without any pre-arrangement or knowledge, and, I guess, by extra-sensory perception."
"As the House will know and as my colleague Commissioner Schreyer has said, the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy for 2004 has identified three policy areas as priorities, namely enlargement, stability and sustainable growth."
"We also made it clear that on the second and third of those priorities the work is to be staffed by internal redeployment of Commission personnel."
"The Commission also decided that in the further implementation of reform, the redeployment of resources should be accomplished with the assistance of the time-and-numbers-limited voluntary early retirement scheme."
"In the case of enlargement, we recognised the reality that new human resources - new posts - were needed in order to meet the fresh and very substantial demands arising from the historic change."
"The rationale for the proposed increase is very straightforward: the accession of ten countries on 1 May 2004 will bring a 66% increase in the number of Member States, a 20% increase in the population of the Union and an 82% increase in working languages."
"The Commission will handle the very diverse and substantive new demands with just 13% more staff: 3900 extra qualified people recruited over a transition period of five years from the beginning of 2004 through to the end of 2008."
"For 2004 - enlargement year - after 500 deployments of existing personnel within and between existing services, the net addition needed is 780 new posts."
"To establish this figure, all current tasks performed by Commission services were classified on the basis of 'activity-based management'."
"Calculations were strictly based on the additional workload that we know will have to be borne by the Commission as a direct result of enlargement."
"This systematic approach was applied across all services and the information provided was then carefully screened for extra certainty."
"In short, we based our request for additional human resources on a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of real and proven operational needs."
"I am very glad that representatives of the Council are here."
"I thank them for their courtesy in attending this debate, but I have to say candidly that, against this background, the cut of 272 posts proposed by Council in its judgment on the provisional draft budget is unwelcome and, in the light of enlargement, unrealistic."
"I believe that it is vital for this Parliament to be made aware of the sombre reality that providing less than the 780 enlargement-related posts which we have proposed as essential for 2004 would have a major and very negative effect on the Commission's ability to manage the fresh task arising directly from the accession of ten new Member States which, universally and unanimously in Commission, Parliament and Council, we strongly advocate and stoutly support."
"In making our proposal we were not seeking to grab posts."
"We were simply being realistic about what has to be done in and for a bigger Union."
"I am therefore pleased to see the horizontal amendment - Amendment No 3053 - tabled by Mr Mulder, which would facilitate the re-establishment of the number of posts requested."
"However, the fact that those posts would be in the reserve would produce significant practical problems."
"By definition, it would mean that the new posts would be made available to the services later, thereby further delaying the recruitment process."
"In the meantime, the resulting uncertainty and delay would seriously inhibit proper fulfilment of the tasks of the Commission."
"I want to make it clear to the House that the list of criteria given by Mr Mulder in his Amendment No 3053 is realistic, but those criteria could usefully be clarified further."
"For instance, concerning the second criterion, I want it to be plainly evident that the proposed recruitment figures will enable the Commission to ensure geographical balance across the institution after enlargement."
"That is fundamental."
"In any case we want to avoid the addition of any further criteria which the Commission could not, frankly, feasibly meet in time for the second reading in this House."
"The Commission has manifestly shown great care and deliberation in calculating needs."
"The minimum necessary number has been proposed."
"No-one in this House appears to be motivated by any intention to destabilise the already demanding processes of fulfilling the tasks arising from enlargement."
"When all of those facts are self-evident, I hope that there will be further reflection on the proposal to put posts in the reserve with all that implies in practical terms."
"The House is also considering amendments which seek to make changes to the establishment plan."
"Amendment No 3502 proposes to reduce administrative and staffing costs by 10% in a number of policy areas and to place that 10% in the reserve with the aim of fostering the operational part of the programmes."
"I am bound to say that this would lead to a substantial delay in future recruitments."
"While I understand the political intention behind this amendment and realise that it is consistent with similar amendments in previous years, the Commission will have great difficulty in trying to fulfil the relevant programmes effectively without the appropriate level of administrative resources."
"I do not need to tell Members who have been involved in efforts to introduce activity-based budgeting and greater transparency that we are not debating a technical matter."
"The Commission's responsibility for allocating resources to activities and for accounting for those allocations is a profoundly political issue."
"As the internal allocation of human resources is decided, the Commission will give proper consideration to the concerns expressed by this Parliament in its budgetary resolution."
"But, for the sake of effective operation and responsibility, the administrative autonomy of our institutions must be maintained."
"That means that the conclusive decisions on establishment plans must, in the final analysis, continue to be for the Commission to make on the basis of properly calculated and manifest needs."
"I know that many Members will recognise the principle and its practicality."
"I have huge respect for the many qualities of Mr Mulder, but he is pre-eminently a practical man."
"I hope that those considerations will recommend themselves to him."
"I only give praise where it is due ..."
"... lavishly to Mr Mulder, but nevertheless, when it is due."
"Apart from the cuts relating to the appropriations for posts, the Council has made a number of other cuts in the administrative budget of the Commission relating to delegations, auxiliaries, missions, meetings and representation offices."
"Faced with that I want to be absolutely clear: cutting the budget of our delegation offices would damage the last phase of the deconcentration, which is a process strongly favoured by this House and by the Commission."
"The proposed reduction on missions, meetings and representation offices will also inevitably have a negative impact on the enlargement process."
"The Commission needs the preliminary draft budget to be re-established in order to meet the administrative challenges of 2004 arising inevitably and foreseeably from enlargement."
"Expenditure in that area is neither excessive nor decorative."
"It is absolutely essential to good performance."
"Also essential to good performance is the continuation of the normal transformation of posts needed for career development."
"If, as the Council had proposed, the transition to the new career structure - strongly and rightly supported by this House and indeed by the Council - was to be accompanied by the withholding of conventional patterns of promotion, the effect would understandably be confusing and demoralising for the staff of the European public service."
"However, I understand that the rapporteur proposes tabling an amendment to re-establish this routine practice."
"That would be a most welcome proposal and one that would give a reassuring and strongly cooperative signal to our staff, whose active and confident engagement in modernising change continues to be absolutely vital, as it always will be."
"Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to begin by telling you in public what I have already taken the opportunity to tell you in private, namely that I profoundly admire the courageous and direct manner in which you are facing up to your responsibilities in the Eurostat case."
"Allow me also, however, to say to you just as directly that I would describe the way in which the Commission is hiding the internal audit report from Parliament, and especially from the Committee on Budgetary Control, as a deeply irresponsible act. I must alert you to the consequences of that act as of now."
"We required that report as part of the discharge procedure, as the essential condition on which discharge was to be granted."
"The Commission itself, as a body, must consider where the responsibility lies here."
"I would also like to let you know, Commissioner, that I fully agree with what Mr Heaton-Harris has already said about the cuts in the amounts for both OLAF and Eurostat. I also believe that it is essential that the principle of political responsibility should be implemented, in practical terms."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Kinnock, I am glad that you have been able to get back to your roots as transport commissioner by delivering your speech to us just in time."
"When you took up your new responsibility in 1999, you promised to create the most modern and most efficient administration in the world."
"Now you are trying to get us to buy the idea that, as your term of office in this Commission draws to a close, you have actually achieved this exalted objective, but, Commissioner, things in the garden are not quite as rosy as the glowing colours in which you have depicted them would suggest."
"There are many dark clouds overshadowing it, and a number of points that I would like to take up."
"The first is that it is, in my view, unacceptable that the Commission's administration does not reflect what the budgetary authority wants."
"I am glad to see that Commissioner Vitorino has now arrived; we discussed this under the heading of information policy this morning."
"We have topped up the funds for this, leaving nothing in the reserves, but, at ground level, there is no administration and the decentralisation to which you referred does not work either."
"Agreements with the Member States are not concluded and there are no funds for things - like the outcome of the Convention - in which the Commission has no political interest."
"You have EUR 10 million at your disposal, and only EUR 1.5 million have been spent."
"It is not your job to decide for yourself how the Budget is to be administered, but to ensure that the administration actually carries out what the Council and Parliament have decided."
"You are failing to do so, and, as Commissioner for personnel, you share the responsibility for that."
"I could give you many other examples of this."
"Secondly, this is also about those areas in which the Commission itself bears financial responsibility."
"The excuse is always given that it is the dastardly Member States who administer 80% of the budget, but, where you yourself are responsible, you have to maintain order and, the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have given you the clear message as regards the way you do that: that is your responsibility and you have to answer for it!"
". Mr President, I am grateful to Mr Ferber for his kind remarks on my timely arrival."
"It reminded me of the time when I used to have to get to a 10 a.m. division in the House of Commons and narrowly make it in, practising my side-step around the policemen."
"It was not quite as complicated on this occasion."
"I am grateful for constructive contributions and I can reply very briefly but I hope reassuringly to the honourable Members who have contributed."
"Firstly, I am grateful for the kind remarks by Mr Casaca because they are based on very thorough analysis of everything we are seeking to do."
"I wish that was a universal characteristic, but I find that some people writing in the press, for instance, have a confidence and an assertiveness in what they write, which is in inverse proportion to the amount of knowledge that they have."
"I regret his understandable view that the Commission, to use his term, is hiding the internal audit report from Parliament."
"I understand the force of what he says when he reminds us again that the internal audit activity, the examination of contracts, was a direct product of the discharge resolution drafted, in fact, by Mr Casaca himself and some of his close colleagues."
"I fully recognise the force with which he puts the point."
"I only say this: we are having to use the Annex III procedure for a very basic reason which I am sure will be understood."
"We have to observe strict confidentiality whilst trying to maximise information to the people who are most entitled to know, including Members of this House, simply because those reports which are now being completed contain a potential for disciplinary and even more grave procedures."
"That is not an excuse, it is not an evasion."
"It arises from the proper observance of the rights of natural justice and the presumption of innocence, and also from our strong desire not in a precipitate fashion to release details into the public domain which could then compromise the integrity of a case or cases we may wish to bring against individuals."
"I hope that on examination it will be understood that I say this in a mood of explanation and transparency, not apology or evasiveness, and it is necessary simply because of the material we are dealing with."
"I realise that if there had been a historic background of trying to keep confidentiality to a minimum, and transparency to a maximum, then it would be easier for this House to understand that, when it is critically essential that we use confidential procedures, it is done for absolutely the best reasons."
"I hope that, amongst other products of activity-based management and budgeting and the transparency that Mr Virrankoski spoke about, we will see a further evolution of the readiness of the Commission to make maximum disclosure whilst trying to safeguard the integrity of necessary procedures."
"The report will be available under Annex III of the framework agreement procedure when it is ready."
"It is being finalised literally now, so that it can be available in the proper form at the time promised."
"As regards the consolidation of political responsibility I do not yet envisage the full implementation of the architecture that Mr Casaca desires, though I have a lot of sympathy for it."
"That architecture consists in the establishment of a full financial control unit, as it were, in the office of every Commissioner."
"But I consider that we have made substantial progress towards achieving that, on the one hand in the general ambit of the Financial Regulation, but more specifically in the reforms adopted by the Commission, in some cases as recently as July 2003."
"Those guarantee an absolute requirement for reporting on management conduct and financial operation in a DG at least twice a year, specifically to the responsible Commissioner, so that Commissioners will in future continue to be au fait with the practical operational management of the directorate-general, as well as bearing their straightforward and obvious political responsibilities."
"It will not diminish political responsibility, portfolio responsibility or policy engagement: it is likely to add to those."
"Commissioner Schreyer and I sent a letter to all DGs in July 2003."
"The response we got from the DGs - with very thorough analysis seeking to detect any practices remotely related to what we have observed in Eurostat - was rigorous and encouragingly thorough."
"I know that Mr Casaca, with his interest in these matters, and probably Mr Mulder, will want to examine that."
"That will be very welcome."
"Mr Virrankoski obviously shows great understanding and I know his background really gives him an authority in this area."
"I would simply say to him that I agree with his forecast for future structures and the practices that he anticipates, and express confidence that they will come to pass."
"Culture in an organisation of human beings is substantially a product not of ethnic or national origin or regional origin or language."
"Culture is a product of the systems and structures in which people work."
"By making massive reforms that radically change systems and structures, we foster the kind of culture of transparency and accountability which is fundamental to the successful operation of activity-based management and of the activity-based budgeting which reinforces that process."
"To Mr Ferber I would say: it is a matter of record that my promise at the outset of the Commission - and I am not trying to denounce or go back on any catchphrases about the best in the world, etc. was that we would strive to achieve, through radical modernising reform, a well managed, high-performance, service-orientated, independent European Commission in the service of the peoples of the European Union."
"I do not think that was modest, and yet we are accomplishing it."
"To use his phrase, I do not imagine that the sky is as blue as he says I have painted it."
"We acknowledge in our frequent progress reports the shortcomings, the target dates that we have missed, as well as the ones that we have bettered."
"We acknowledge where further development needs to take place."
"It was, after all, this Commission which - as soon as we had prima facie evidence that gave us legal security in undertaking certain actions - suspended contracts, opened disciplinary proceedings, established the strongest, biggest ever inquiry task force in the history of the Commission, increased the staffing of the internal audit examination of contracts from 9 to 24 persons and has had those reports coming in absolutely on schedule."
"This is not evidence of a slothful or lax Commission, but neither does it mean that we imagine that the sky is permanently blue, nor do these glasses have any rose tint."
"I am impatient for further change."
"I want to see total implementation."
"That ambition is shared universally by my colleagues and we could not have made the progress we have unless we had had massive cooperation from staff assuming these obligations in addition to their normal workload and if we had not had the full-hearted commitment of every single Member of the College of Commissioners."
"Therefore, I do not try to pretend that we have done more than we have."
"I simply ask for a factual examination of what has been achieved."
"For instance, automatic mandatory mobility for senior management and for people in money-handling, contract-handling posts will in itself provide a safeguard against a repetition of the double accounting that we have detected in Eurostat."
"More than any other measure, but in addition, reforms of structures and systems of audit control and management control that give us - insofar as any human organisation handling money can get it - real, strong safeguards against any form of repetition of what we have detected and are acting upon now."
"As far as the response to Parliament and the Council is concerned, I respect it."
"I come from a parliamentary tradition where an elected House of Commons obtained its strength by having the vote on the budget."
"Therefore I fundamentally respect and want to endorse that democratic procedure."
"I do not plead for us to depart from that."
"I do not make an argument for being insulated against the representations and judgment of Parliament or of the Council which represents the taxpayers."
"I do not ask for that for one second."
"I simply say that it is a practical reality that, without autonomy, it is difficult to exercise responsibility, and when we have autonomy our responsibility must be fully accountable."
"However, if we do not have the resources or the people whose presence, qualities and qualifications we can totally justify, then it is very difficult to see how the Commission can undertake the tasks it has now, let alone the ones that are to come as a consequence of this glorious enlargement, but which nevertheless we recognise to be additional obligations which we must discharge with efficiency and honesty."
"I would like to make a comment on the way this debate is structured."
"Our Rules of Procedure state that Commissioners may speak for as long as they wish."
"Personally, though, I feel that something is out of balance if a Commissioner speaks for twice as long as the three Members before him."
"Without wishing to restrict their rights under the Rules of Procedure, I would urge the Commission to give some thought to what I have said."
". I rise to do two things."
"First, I apologise if you feel that I have abused the Rules of the House."
"I would certainly not repeat that."
"I believe that people in this House know that my occupation of time is, generally speaking, very disciplined."
"There were fundamental points raised on a budget about which I feel passionately."
"We need people!"
"Do not take it personally Commissioner."
"It was just a general remark."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, along with continuity and accountability, planning a budget requires that any necessary adjustments and reforms be made; more than anything else, it also calls for political vision."
"In a constructive dialogue, this House's specialists in social policy have made a package of these objectives and adopted them by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Our priorities include industrial safety, by which I mean that our agencies should be adequately equipped and enabled, above all, to press on with the programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises and also micro-businesses, something that is especially necessary in the candidate countries."
"We also seek a moderate increase in funding for the Community initiative EQUAL and for non-governmental organisations."
"The Community initiative EQUAL is a specific instrument, within the framework of the European Social Fund, for realising our ideas and achieving our objectives, which are also those of the Lisbon process."
"We have to make progress towards these goals, and to do so, we have to guarantee that the initiative is endowed with the necessary funding."
"We need more jobs - sustainable jobs - and we also want to promote training - training with qualifications - and strengthen its role in the Member States, while at the same time offering businesses incentives to discharge their obligations."
"Until such time as there is any change, we will keep on criticising the flow of funds from the European Social Fund, which, this time round, is still a scandal - not one attributable to Parliament or the Commission, but, we believe, one for which the Member States bear responsibility."
"This is something that we want to change in the forthcoming reform of the Structural Funds, rather than taking action in the course of this Budget."
"Our political vision is of course not just about making enlargement a reality, but primarily about the creation of a social Europe, which is where we still have a lot of catching-up to do in amidst the other tasks that Europe has to accomplish."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which has presented a certain number of amendments that I can combine in several chapters."
"The first concerns the perspectives and priorities of the European Parliament, notably in the framework of the Prince programme."
"We talked about the subject this morning in the course of the meeting on the issue of interinstitutional information, and we are very concerned about the non-implementation of a fair portion of the appropriations made to the priorities that Parliament recommends, has already recommended and will again recommend for next year."
"I would appeal to the Commission to place this non-implementation at the heart of its concerns."
"Commissioner Barnier is well aware of the matter."
"I think that we are in a decisive year for the integration of Europe and for the image of Europe."
"The Constitution will, we hope, be adopted, and the elections are approaching."
"The credits in question must, therefore, be implemented and put to good use."
"So much for the first chapter of the amendments by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"There then follows another chapter of amendments that I would call 'image of the institutions'."
"We would put forward the idea, which we would ask the general rapporteur also to support, that the Internet should become the tool by which Europeans can really take an interest in, and get up to date with, what is happening in Europe."
"I am thinking not only of the written Internet, which obviously makes a lot of things possible already, but also of the broadcasting of debates such as the budgetary debate, the committee debates, the public meetings of the Council, when these take place, and the daily conferences of the European Commission."
"We think that this tool, which is actually very cheap to use, really can enable people to keep up to date with what is happening in the European institutions."
"Mr President, speaking about issues which concern the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to start with the issues touched on by Commissioner Barnier, the issues of regional policy, and to say here that, as far as the previous period from 1994 to 1999 is concerned, as he himself admitted, developments are not the most propitious."
"There is a delay in closing dossiers, the basic responsibility for which lies with the Member States, which are late submitting all the information required or, in all events, when they do submit it, do not submit it in the proper form."
"That is why there are funds which have not yet been paid to the Member States and that is creating a problem both with the Community budget and, of course, with the national budgets."
"By contrast, there are more positive developments in the new programming period from 2000 to 2006, although here too, of course, we must be very, very careful."
"I noted with satisfaction that this year we are doing better than last year from the point of view of the take-up of appropriations and trust that the n+2 rule, despite the criticism it sometimes receives, even here in Parliament, is a rule which will result in proper management on the part of the Member States as regards programming and managing the sums of money."
"Besides, we should not forget that it was the Member States themselves which, in unanimously adopting the current Structural Fund regulations, came to accept this n+2 rule."
"These, broadly speaking, are also the reasons why, in our committee at least, we propose to return essentially to the preliminary draft budget initially submitted by the Commission as far as category II of the budget is concerned."
"As far as the other matters are concerned, I should like to comment in particular on the trans-European networks and to say that, even after the van Miert report of 30 June this year, and pending the proposal to reform the trans-European networks, our committee wishes to note their importance and to stress that words and deeds must coincide at some point."
"If we want to promote the trans-European networks, we need to find ways of funding them and one of these ways is obviously the Community budget."
"I should also like to comment on the issue of the European Maritime Safety Agency, the headquarters of which have not been decided."
"The fact that the headquarters of this agency have not been decided should not lead us to conclude that we should also not fund it."
"We need to put sums of money in reserve so that, when the headquarters are decided, we are ready to fund this agency, which will play a particularly important role in these issues of safety at sea which we debated this morning."
"I should also like to underline the importance of two issues to which we are not, I think, paying proper attention."
"One is tourism, where we consider that a number of pilot programmes which will strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in particular should be funded and, the second, which is sometimes undervalued, is safe transport where, here too, we believe that we could proceed to increase the funds somewhat."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, still on the subject of regional policy, transport and tourism, I have to say to you that we are quite worried, not to say disillusioned, by our reading of the draft budget."
"The problem has been clearly explained: to see the budget lines for essential policies cut so drastically by the Council worries us extremely."
"I have to say to you that it worries us because it happens all the time."
"Whatever the decision-making procedures, whatever the reports highlighting the European Union's development needs, the same thing has happened for years: whenever budget time comes the Council makes the most astounding cuts to its programmes, which are nevertheless among the most important ones for encouraging development in the European Union."
"Time passes and nothing changes in this."
"Hence our concern and hence the Commission's unanimity in seeking to use amendments to get the level of expenditure provided for in the preliminary draft budget reinstated."
"I will return for a few moments to the issue of the Structural Funds and I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for all the explanations he has given us."
"We can indeed see that the simplifications made are bearing fruit."
"We also note a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the management of those funds."
"In short, we want the European Union's budget to take account of the reality of expenditure, which will avoid the Commission having to present supplementary draft budgets, which would be damaging to the peaceful implementation of these essential funds."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Barnier, I wish to begin by congratulating you, Commissioner Barnier, for the results achieved with the n+2 rule, by the efforts at simplification and by the fact that matters are now apparently such that, within structural policy, there is more success in implementing expenditure and getting money used."
"We do in fact see, however, how the budgets and the payment appropriations have been significantly cut back, both in the Commission's and the Council's proposals, and, in the light of what you are saying today, it has of course to be wondered whether it is right to take matters so calmly, confident that there are enough payment appropriations, and whether a proposal for the supplementary budget is enough to solve the problem, if it emerges that the money is being used up more quickly than we anticipated. In recent years, we have of course seen that there has been a huge amount of money left over from the agricultural budgets in the autumn, but will that continue, with a falling dollar and other growing expenditure?"
"That is a matter for reflection."
"I also think it right to look at the problem constituted by the fact that it is not possible to have confidence in the reports we obtain from the Member States."
"Neither the Commission nor the Member States' finance ministers have confidence in the reports obtained as to what needs exist."
"This is therefore worth investigating more carefully."
"I nonetheless think Mr Mulder has the right idea in saying we should increase the payment appropriations so that we might be sure that the projects can be implemented within the agreed time frames, even if those of us in my group have never supported large increases in the payment appropriations."
"I want to mention something else, namely the issue of the cutbacks we see in a range of budget lines where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned."
"In particular, we see how, within the action programme for the working environment, the budget is being drastically cut back, and that, I think, is a completely wrong signal to send out prior to enlargement. I want to attach a lot of importance to our being able to obtain an exchange of knowledge and development of experience in the area relating to the working environment, so that free competition in the EU is not at the expense of a good working environment."
"Mr President, I should like to make one or two observations with regard to social policy."
"I totally agree with what Mrs Jensen said on this subject a moment ago."
"It is regrettable that some areas leave something to be desired."
"I should particularly like to ask for attention to be paid to the European Year of the disabled which we are celebrating at the moment and which is also reasonably successful."
"It is, in my view, very important that we should provide an opportunity for follow-up next year."
"I also hope that provision can be made for this in the budget during the course of this budget procedure."
"I should also like to make a brief comment further to what Commissioner Barnier has stated."
"Needless to say, we have all looked into the figures."
"It is indeed satisfying to see that the situation has improved particularly over the past few months and that a little more money is being spent than during the period immediately preceding it."
"Despite this, I do think that we have not solved the problem by a long way."
"Neither am I completely convinced that we need an additional budget."
"I myself do not expect this at all."
"What can we see happening?"
"Countries are working out how much money they would need to spend in order to use up all the money that has been allocated to them."
"Those countries are saying: well, it should be this or that amount, which they subsequently find impossible to spend."
"They are far too optimistic and there is no monitoring procedure of any kind. I think that we ought to be extremely grateful to the Commissioner for having introduced all kinds of gentle mechanisms that will hopefully rectify the situation to some degree."
"For years, I have been indignant about the fact that everyone knows that there are too many payment credits and that the money is not being spent."
"The only thing we notice at the end of the year is that a great deal of money is retuned to the Member States."
"I think we should put a stop to this."
"This is probably more important than approving the occasional additional budget."
"Rule 19 in our Rules of Procedure states that the President shall possess all the powers necessary to preside over the proceedings of Parliament."
"Rule 120 (6) states that the President shall attempt to agree speaking times with the Commission and the Council."
"Commissioner Barnier, I will now agree to give you eleven minutes, the same that Parliament has had."
"As I took ten minutes, does that mean that I only have one minute left?"
"I do hope that that is not the case, but do not worry, I will not take advantage, I will answer as quickly as possible."
"I would like to thank everyone who has expressed an opinion on Structural Funds policy, for which I am responsible together with Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler, in particular regional policy."
"I am not going to go back over the figures I confirmed today and which I sought to give as the most sincere and honest answer possible to the questions put by the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Budgetary Control and Mr Hatzidakis' Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"The first assessment I outlined before you confirms what I said on 22 May about the period 1994-1999, which for me is the black spot, or at least the grey spot: the procedure used for this programming was so unwieldy that control and certification became concentrated at the end of the period."
"Mr Hatzidakis, what applies to this period is not n+2 but, you might as well say, n+11."
"That is the objective reason for the amount of work we have to do to process and check the 2 000 files received."
"I repeat that my colleagues and I will not skimp this certification period;"
"I shall have no hesitation in taking any measures that may be necessary."
"I do not want to lower the quality of the controls or the level of information and certification required by rules with which we are all familiar."
"Mr Hatzidakis is right when he says that the n+2 procedure adopted for new programmes in 1999 is more efficient and is already producing better results, creates an impression of continuity and results in a smaller number of regular cancellations."
"Mr Pronk, I am not satisfied either, even if progress has been made."
"I am not going to act self-satisfied in front of you, believe me."
"I am simply noting, like you, a better use for the period 2000-2006."
"This improvement is due mainly to the n+2 rule and our ongoing cooperation with the governments."
"Mr Hatzidakis, I will pass on your comments on the matter of transport and road safety to Mrs de Palacio."
"I would like to thank Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Jensen for their appraisal of our management under your supervision."
"Mrs Guy-Quint, we are at this moment making progress on programme appraisal."
"I am thinking in particular of the efforts being made by Mr Likanen, Mr Monti and myself to make it easier to use the Structural Funds to cover areas not yet served by mobile telephones or the Internet."
"Let us have less padding and more quality."
"We are doing so already, but with the future regional policy we are working on and for which I need your support we can go a lot further."
"The future objective 2 policy in particular will enable us, in partnership with the regions and governments, to implement directly the major objectives of Göteborg and Lisbon relating to competitiveness and sustainable growth."
"Mrs Jensen, I shall be continuing the efforts we have begun."
"The commitment appropriations that you regretted were cut do not fall under heading 2 for which we are responsible."
"They are transport appropriations, like those for small and medium-sized undertakings."
"I therefore think that Commissioner Schreyer understood those comments correctly, but I cannot answer this point because there is no reduction in the commitment appropriations, which, incidentally, were safeguarded for the whole period in Berlin."
"Mr Pronk, I have answered your question."
"I am not sure that we will need the supplementary budget I mentioned just now, but as I am being transparent with you I am mentioning it to you at this stage."
"So far as 2003 is concerned, we do need an amending budget."
"We may need a supplementary budget next year, but that is not certain."
"It is simply that we have to be able to pay when the time comes."
"I do not want States that are capable of consuming and implementing to be penalised on the pretext that there are some bad pupils in the class."
"Mrs Iivari, your comment was addressed more to Mrs Reding, but I have heard it."
"Regarding the cultural cooperation of which you spoke - even though it is not my subject, I am sensitive to what you have said in this regard - in the forthcoming debate on regional policy after 2007 I intend proposing an increase in our appropriations for Interreg and a simplification of that programme's rules, in order to target cross-border cooperation in transport infrastructures in particular."
"In that field, too, we need cultural and university cooperation."
"There you are, Mr President, I have taken more than a minute but less than 11 minutes and I thank you for your understanding."
"Mr President, I make this statement on behalf of the Committee on Home Affairs and as its rapporteur."
"I am very glad that this House's rapporteur, Mr Mulder, has noted that everything related to home affairs and justice policy in the European Union has a close connection with enlargement, and that he himself has already made some necessary proposals."
"It makes things much easier for those of us who deal with home affairs and justice policy if the rapporteur who understands us best is right alongside us. I must, secondly, extend warm thanks to Commissioner Vitorino for the excellent cooperation with his staff, which has gone outstandingly well."
"Although our proposals relating to the 2004 Budget were adopted unanimously, I must simply point out, now that we are debating them in plenary, that this year, we have a priority issue in the shape of our three agencies."
"What particularly makes our agencies in Vienna, Lisbon and the Hague very important to us is the fact that we will soon have ten new Member States, which will make more work for the agencies in the areas of combating racism, drug crime, criminal activities and terrorism."
"Our monitoring centres in Vienna and Lisbon, along with Eurojust in The Hague are three agencies in need of active support, and that will cost money."
"I take it as read that my fellow-MEPs who sit on the Committee on Budgets will join with us in seeing the need for this and in giving us their support in this House."
"Thank you."
". Madam President, I would like to place on record my appreciation to the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his attention to our concerns."
"This committee takes less than 1% of the EU budget, but I would not want anyone to think that we should see education, culture, media and information as optional extras."
"The creative industries in Europe contribute some 12% to Europe's GDP."
"There are two points I would particularly like the Commission to heed."
"Firstly, in its culture budget each year, Parliament helps a number of cultural organisations and networks such as the European Youth Orchestra and the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation."
"If these organisations are to survive, let alone flourish, then they not only need our financial and moral support, they need legal certainty."
"I am appalled that at the end of September, there is still no guarantee they will get their money for 2004 and sadly, as usual, some have not yet been paid for 2003."
"I urge the Commission to resolve this legal base problem."
"Secondly, if EU citizens are to know about the EU they require information."
"25% of Britons do not know their country is in the EU."
"31% of Germans have never heard of the European Commission and 90% of Spaniards do not know what the European Convention is!"
"The public learn about Europe through television."
"We have Euronews, an excellent independent channel, but like all public sector broadcasters, it needs funding."
"This year Parliament voted EUR 3 million for Euronews."
"As far as I am aware, that money has not yet been paid."
"We have proposed in our budget suggestion for next year that it should receive EUR 5 million."
"I am afraid that we could enter the year of enlargement - the year of European elections - with no European Youth Orchestra and no European television."
"I hope the Commission will take these points seriously."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time that the justice and internal affairs sector has been invited to this budget debate, but when it comes to figures those for which I am responsible seem so small that I almost feel ashamed to be standing here alongside my colleagues from agriculture or cohesion."
"Nevertheless, from a statistical point of view the budget for justice and internal affairs has increased by 252% this year."
"In reality, however, much of that increase is the result of the decision taken in Copenhagen to create the Schengen facility, at a cost of EUR 317 million, to help the seven future Member States to adopt and incorporate the Schengen acquis."
"Another EUR 13 million are for transitional measures for Lithuania in connection with transit to and from Kaliningrad."
"So far as justice and internal affairs are concerned, the most important changes from the budgetary point of view are therefore the enlargement-related increase in appropriations for programmes (EUR 16 million) and the increase in appropriations for control of the external frontiers, which has been a major European Union priority since the Seville and Thessaloniki summits."
"I would like to stress the importance of the ARGO programme in support of frontier control operations carried out jointly by the Member States; this is given an extra EUR 15 million."
"I would also like to highlight the creation of a new budget line for development of the VIS project, a visa information system, to which EUR 10 million will be allocated initially."
"This year 2004 will be marked by a number of important factors affecting budget management."
"It will be the last year of operation for the European Refugee Fund."
"We therefore need to learn from experience in making a new allocation after 2004."
"Then there is the doubling of the amount allocated to the Daphne programme, which will be 10 million for 2004."
"In this connection, I want to stress the importance of reaching a conclusion concerning the legal basis as quickly as possible in the codecision procedure between Parliament and Council."
"Finally, as rapporteur Ceyhun points out, the budgets for Eurojust and the Drugs Monitoring Centre in Lisbon are increased in particular in order to enable those bodies to adapt to enlargement."
"Regarding the proposed amendments voted unanimously by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - for which I want to thank Mr Ceyhun - I am particularly pleased about the increase in the budget for the European Refugee Fund."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that doing so today will allow voluntary return actions to be paid for and that there is absolutely no question of using this money for forced returns."
"There is therefore a contradiction between the fact that capacity is being increased and the comment."
"I would like to draw your attention to that."
"I am also pleased with the two amendments which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has proposed concerning the VIS system and the new generation Schengen information system, SIS II."
"Following the feasibility studies, it is in fact necessary to reprogramme expenditure for these two systems so as to spread the cost over the following three financial years 2004 to 2006, 2006 being the deadline for the SIS II system to become operational and therefore ready to fully integrate the countries that will join on 1 May 2004."
"Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for its idea of creating an Erasmus programme for judges; the Commission will try to conduct a pilot project."
"I turn now to the field of information and communication."
"Following the adoption of the Bayona de Perogordo report, 2003 was the first year in which we developed a new information and communication strategy for the general public."
"You will remember that the cornerstone of this strategy is cooperation with the Member States, the establishment of partnerships with the Member States."
"I am pleased to say that the interinstitutional group on information and communication has managed to reach broad agreement on what should be the priority subjects for such public information and communication campaigns."
"I am speaking not only of the euro, but also of enlargement, the future of Europe, the area of freedom, security and justice and, for next year 2004, the role of Europe in the world, including a specific line to support information campaigns in the field of defence."
"Let us be clear, however, and in saying this I am trying to answer the comments made by Mr Ferber just now."
"This is in fact the second time I have tried to answer him today, but he is never there to hear me."
"I nevertheless hope that the message will get to him."
"When we are talking about partnership, we have to rely on the Member States being available to take part in such a partnership."
"For example, EUR 4 million were reserved for such partnerships with the Member States for the information campaign on the Future of Europe."
"Up until now, however, only three Member States have said they are willing to reach an agreement with us in order to develop the campaign on the future of Europe."
"Since partnership is built on a voluntary basis, what the Commission has done is to allocate those EUR 4 million that were not used by the partnership with the Member States to other funds."
"Until the end of this year, therefore, we are covering the expenditure for the entire budget for the Future of Europe programme, including an invitation to tender for an audiovisual campaign on the future of Europe, amounting to EUR 4 million, and the reallocation of EUR 3.7 million for the production of printed objective information material for distribution at the end of this year and early next year on the conclusions of the Convention."
"I would also like to stress, as Mr Perry has said, that we attach great importance to the use of audiovisual systems."
"For this year 2003 we therefore have EUR 4 million for an audiovisual information strategy on enlargement, EUR 4 million for the Future of Europe and EUR 8.5 million for audiovisuals providing general information about the European Union, including the Euronews channel."
"I agree with you entirely, Mr Perry, that we should meet Euronews' request as Parliament agreed."
"What have we done?"
"We have granted Euronews EUR 1.5 million in accordance with the framework agreement signed with Euronews in 2001 and we have taken into account the further sum of EUR 3 million voted by Parliament."
"Having said that, Parliament has clearly said that those three million euros were not to finance Euronews's administrative costs but to pay for its activities."
"We have therefore suggested to Euronews that it submit to us programmes for information activities and we are perfectly willing to assess them and finance them by releasing the EUR 3 million by the end of the year."
"You raised the question of the legal bases."
"This aspect is not my direct responsibility but I do know that the Commission has already put forward proposals for the creation of legal bases for a number of entities, including Euronews."
"I think that will be the best way of proceeding and the best approach for giving stability to such funding."
"I will eagerly await Parliament's position on this matter."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, the way speaking time is organised is so mischievous and bizarre that I now have to speak again about transport problems and agencies."
"Having said that, I very much support what my colleague Mr Hatzidakis has said, namely that we must keep the lines as they were in the preliminary draft budget because there are no savings to be made on these policies for the present."
"I would like to take the opportunity, Commissioner, to respond to the problem of the policy of providing information to European Union citizens."
"This subject will really be one of the most important in the years ahead."
"You may know that several of us have tabled amendments to restore the lines to what they were last year."
"The most important thing, however, is that all institutional communication should get as close to ordinary citizens as possible."
"What worries me the most about the present communications policy is that we do not have the necessary tools to reach those who are going to vote."
"The citizen's ignorance of the present machinery and the institutions as they will be is quite appalling."
"You have the resources, Commissioner, but for goodness sake let us ensure that they go to the heart of our present-day society."
"That would be a great step forward for the democratic future of our Union."
"Madam President, I should like to talk about two matters: first, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group on various transport matters; secondly, as shadow rapporteur on the other institutions."
"So firstly, I should like to address Mrs de Palacio and secondly, Commissioner Schreyer."
"The TENs programme is a wonderful one, which allows transport, energy and telematics projects throughout Europe to be decided upon by the nation states themselves in order to connect the 15 countries now in the Union with the 10 countries coming in, embracing the whole of the European Union and making sure that each nation can build its part within the trans-European network."
"I have nothing but full confidence in that programme."
"I would just point out that there is an item of some EUR 225 million for studies relating to it in the budget, whereas the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, of which I am a substitute Member, says that they do not want more studies but more action and implementation on the ground."
"With regard to the Marco Polo programme on transfer to other modes of transport, away from road traffic and the congestion which it causes, I give that my full support."
"We need to have more telematics and computer information technology used to advance the efficient movement of goods and passengers throughout the European Union."
"Touching upon the Galileo project, we need to maximise the use of the private sector."
"I welcome this project."
"I hope that we will not use it for automatic levying of tolls on lorries, but rather allow individual drivers of private commercial vehicles to avoid congestion by knowing their best route from where they are to where they want to go: in other words, to help the motorists rather than tax and hinder them."
"On the other institutions, we have had useful discussions in the last day or two."
"I was delighted to attend the conciliation meeting in July and pay tribute to Mr Magri and his superb chairmanship of that committee."
"There was one matter that was left."
"That was where our rapporteur, Mrs Gill, thought that the Commission and the Council were being generous - I would say extremely generous - in their attitude to the budgets proposed by three of the other institutions: the Court of Justice, the Committee of the Regions, and the Economic and Social Committee."
"Whereas Parliament's budget is only going up by 13%, the Council's by 21% and the Commission's by 8% or 9%, the Court of Justice, for example, is asking for 57%."
"I am delighted the Council has knocked that figure down to 46%."
"But in an amendment that we tabled from the United Kingdom delegation, we are asking for a further, similar reduction."
"The same applies to the Economic and Social Committee."
"It asked for 33%, knocked down by the Council to 27%."
"We want it down by the same percentage again."
"The Committee of the Regions asked for 63% and was knocked down to 54%."
"We want a further reduction to 46%."
"We can afford these increases, but that is not the point."
"We must get the best possible value for money from these other institutions and ask them to re-examine their budget spending."
"Madam President, in the preliminary draft budget, a sum of EUR 39 million has been earmarked for the European Refugee Fund to cover the present fifteen Member States."
"This is EUR 3 million less than in the budget for 2003."
"This, despite the fact that the objectives of the fund are rather bold: promoting the integration of newcomers and organising solidarity between the EU Member States when receiving refugees."
"In actual fact, a much larger fund is needed to share the responsibility effectively and put an end to the negative policy rivalry between the Member States to adopt the strictest asylum policy."
"As long as three years ago, I, backed by this House, asked the Commissioner to make an assessment of how much money he would actually need in order to realise the Fund's objectives."
"As I have never seen this assessment, I should like to remind him of this request."
"It is particularly important to give this a lot of consideration, because the Commission will be presenting its plans for the financial perspectives in mid-November."
"Mr Vitorino, I therefore rely on your courage."
"Not only is there insufficient money in the Fund structurally speaking, the Fund's objectives are also at risk of being contaminated."
"Less funds for the distribution of the cost of reception, but more emphasis on sharing the burden of repatriation policy."
"In fact, the Member States now want forced repatriation to be paid for from the Refugee Fund."
"However, the question as to who can stay and who has to go is still the subject of a debate between Member States, and is simply a national decision."
"It therefore seems very wrong to me to pay European tax money for national decisions."
"As long as we have not reached agreement on who can stay on European territory and who has to go, it seems wrong to cover the cost of forced repatriation from the European budget."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I believe that today finds us again at an important and decisive point in the history of Europe."
"It is quite clear to us that small and medium-sized businesses are of particular significance in terms of Europe's economic development."
"Whilst we have heard that in many contributions to today's debate, we know that we are directly affected by many developments on the international stage, one example being Basel II."
"That is why we have decided to seize the initiative and introduce a pilot scheme facilitating guarantees through the European banks for especially small businesses."
"I believe that such guarantees will play an essential part in the future of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"Support of this kind is especially important when businesses are being set up."
"My second point is that we have just got through the failed assembly in Cancún, the failure of which is attributable to the presence in the ministerial conference of certain persons who make a very healthy profit from their own system and are therefore unwilling to do for their national economies something that we would see in a favourable light."
"This leads us to believe that there is an urgent need for a parliamentary assembly in this area."
"We want to lend our active support to this in future and to discuss the possibilities with parliamentarians from the countries in question, with the opposition in certain countries also being given the opportunity to state its position on international issues."
"With this in mind, we should concentrate on representing Europe on the international stage, taking a share in decisions rather than just sharing in paying the bills."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to say to Mrs Guy-Quint that I agree with her entirely."
"I think a successful information policy is a policy that gets as close as possible to the citizens."
"That is why we developed this strategy of partnership with the Member States, including regional and local authorities."
"It is an approach which also enjoys the support of the Committee of the Regions."
"But if this approach is to succeed, there must be the political will for a partnership."
"There must be at least two partners."
"That is why I hope, so far as the campaign on the future of Europe is concerned, that the European elections, the national debate on ratification of the Constitution and the referendums that will be held in some Member States will next year all be further incentives, further reasons for the Member States to join in partnership with us to conduct information and communication campaigns on the future of Europe, on the content of the Constitution, and to conduct those campaigns as closely to the citizens as possible."
"I am expressing here my complete agreement with the strategy that Commissioner Michel Barnier has just explained in answer to Mr Dell'Alba's question."
"Madam President, I am going to be very brief because Parliament has supported all the proposals I have presented."
"I would like to take this opportunity to expressly thank Mrs McNally and Mr Collins for their contributions to this work."
"We have been working in great harmony over all these years and this has been the case once again in the discussion of these budgets."
"I thank Parliament for its support for the proposals I have presented."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Pohjamo for his support, despite the fact that he is calling for more resources."
"I would also call for more resources, of course, but we must be aware that we are dealing - my colleague Commissioner Schreyer has just discussed this - with specific financial perspectives and we have specific limits."
"With regard to the support for renewable energy sources, as the honourable Member is well aware, we are dealing with this jointly with support for energy efficiency by means of the intelligent energy programme."
"The honourable Member will think that this is not much money."
"The truth is that we have approved it on a multi-annual basis and, in the end, we reached agreement with the Council."
"Once we have agreements, I believe that we must conserve them and maintain them and I would therefore refer back to what we approved and adopted at the time."
"With regard to the trans-European networks, I have said very clearly, with a view to the next financial perspectives, that the amount dedicated to trans-European networks must not be increased by 5, 10 or even 15%, but, in my opinion, by 600 or 700%."
"In other words, it should be multiplied by 7."
"As simple as that. We need some EUR 4000 million if we are really going to be able to act as the driving force behind the construction of networks of a trans-European nature, and not of a solely national nature."
"These trans-European networks of a trans-European nature are necessary in view of the reality of the internal market and for the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole, and I can therefore only agree with the honourable Member but, I would insist, this cannot be done by modifying budgets, but by reviewing the new financial perspectives, given the great importance of the issue."
"With regard to the transport networks, in relation to the energy sector, I have already presented specific projects for Euro-Mediterranean energy networks, which must allow, firstly, for the rationalisation of investments made in a series of countries and greater coordination and efficiency in investments, thereby achieving not just purely national benefits from certain investments, but providing a broader continental-type perspective."
"When I talk about these Euro-Mediterranean energy networks, I am talking about Europe as a continent, not the European Union."
"These networks also take account of neighbouring countries such as Russia, Belarus or the Ukraine."
"In other words, the whole ring of friends included by President Prodi in his strategy."
"Secondly, in the transport sector we are working on it, and I hope that in the near future we will be able to make it a reality."
"Specifically, I was in St Petersburg a week ago discussing these very networks, and in this case they were even Euro-Asian, because we should be seeking systems to better integrate, in a continental sense, the European Union with our neighbours."
"I would like to thank Parliament once again for supporting the proposals we have presented."
". (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, honourable Members, I too wish to be brief."
"The importance of enlargement goes without saying, and it has also become clear how important the other priorities are for the 2004 Budget."
"The debate has also, I believe, made it clear that the Commission must have the necessary human resources at its disposal."
"This is an area in which I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for being so frank in what he said."
"I am quite happy to provide any information required by the members of the Committee on Budgets, by the Council, or by Parliament, and the Budget Directorate-General is also at your service."
"If I might take up again the issue of the quality of public service at the European level, the Budget Directorate-General has a department with seventy staff to handle everything to do with drawing up the Budget - the drafting, the hearings, all the information, the transfers, the supplementary budgets, the lot."
"When I compare that figure with the numbers required in the Member States and compare the quality involved, I can say loud and clear and with a clear conscience that the service is first-rate."
"Those who have any dealings with it will, I think, be able to back me up on that."
"I would like to say how very grateful I am for this debate, and that I am confident that we will be able, once more, to produce a good European Budget for 2004, one that will do a good job of promoting enlargement."
". Mr President, I just want to thank those Members who have taken part in this debate."
"I thank in particular Mr Magri and his officials for being here all this time."
"As I said at the beginning, it is rare to have ministers here."
"The Danes set this trend, and I congratulate Mr Magri for keeping it up."
"I also congratulate the Commissioners who have participated in this debate."
"On the whole, it has gone quite well."
"However, occasionally we have strayed from the subject."
"The idea of having the Commissioners here is to question them directly on specific issues, and not all Members have done that."
"Perhaps we need to refine our act for next time."
"All in all, although it has been long, it has been well worthwhile."
"Thank you, Mr Wynn."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation of the Alstom Group."
"Before that, I am giving the floor to Mr Harbour for a procedural motion."
"Madam President, am I right in thinking that there will be an opportunity for questioning the Commissioner under the catch-the-eye procedure at the end of his statement?"
"You did not actually say so at the beginning, but I very much hope that I and other colleagues here will have the opportunity to do so."
"Thank you for your question, Mr Harbour."
"The decision has, however, already been taken: you will not be able to ask the Commissioner questions at the end of his statement."
"However, people have their names down to speak and will no doubt ask the Commissioner questions in the course of what they have to say."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament for inviting me this evening."
"I am always pleased to be offered the opportunity to examine competition policy issues with Parliament in greater depth, issues relating to which, incidentally, I have the honour to appear periodically before the Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The subject of your invitation this evening, Madam President, is a specific file which is currently under examination and about which I must therefore observe a measure of discretion."
"Within those limits, I am at your disposal to provide the explanations that will be asked of us."
"What has the European Commission done about the Alstom file so far?"
"It has taken a decision and it has decided not to take another."
"The decision to initiate the review procedure regards the support measures adopted by the French State on 2 August under an agreement with Alstom and a number of banks then the Commission was notified."
"This decision to initiate this procedure was taken by the college on 17 September."
"That was a perfectly normal decision."
"I come now to the decision that was not taken."
"It concerns one specific part of the support plan that was decided and announced on 2 August but has not yet been put into effect: state participation in Alstom's capital."
"The Commission was unable to agree to an immediate participation by the French Republic in Alstom's capital because a measure of that kind, unlike other contributions of liquid assets, was likely to have irreversible consequences for the markets on which the Alstom Group is active."
"On 17 September, the Commission therefore found that the conditions were such that the French authorities should be asked not to go ahead with a State holding in Alstom's capital."
"The Commission, however, wanted to give France one last opportunity before proceeding with that injunction."
"It therefore authorised me to adopt and execute, by 22 September at the latest and by agreement with President Prodi, an injunction for the suspension of certain aids unless the French authorities publicly agreed not to take measures automatically and irreversibly entailing a State holding in the capital of the Alstom Group without the Commission's prior approval as required by the Community rules concerning State aids."
"Following speedy and fruitful contacts with the French authorities, I was able to note yesterday that they had agreed to amend the support plan in a way that satisfies the Commission's condition."
"The French state will not therefore become an Alstom shareholder in the immediate future and will not adopt any measures likely to constitute equity capital, that is structural measures to which the Commission cannot agree without prejudicing the findings of the competition inquiry it will be conducting."
"The state participation in the capital increase will be replaced by a fixed-term floating-rate note redeemable in shares."
"It is a liquidity measure that may be converted into equity only if the Commission decides that the state participation in the capital increase presents no problems for competition on the markets in question."
"Since France had agreed not to automatically acquire a stake in Alstom's capital and had promised that it would no longer present the Commission with a fait accompli, there was no longer any need for me to exercise the power given me by the college of Commissioners to order a suspension."
"So that is the decision the Commission did not take."
"The Commission is pleased with the constructive attitude taken by French authorities and in particular, I would like to stress, by Mr Francis Mer, the Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industry."
"It was our duty to prevent the conditions of competition on the market from being immediately and irreversibly changed in Alstom's favour before the Commission had even been able to begin looking at the effect of the aids on the markets in question."
"The changes made would probably have entailed an increase in the overall amount of aid granted."
"This shows the knock-on effect of a capital increase and its irreversible effects."
"In other words, it would never have been possible to restore the status quo."
"I would like to point out that the amount of aids will also be one of the key factors that the Commission will take into account when examining the matter in depth."
"The fact that it is not necessary to implement the suspending injunction does not, of course, at this stage mean that the Commission has approved the aids."
"The measures as a whole are now going to be examined."
"We will be able to undertake the in-depth scrutiny in a constructive spirit and will do so as quickly as the complexity of the matter allows."
"The aim is to enable the undertaking to be restructured while at the same time preserving the proper working of the internal market, which is the only guarantee of sustainable employment."
"In the course of its assessment, the Commission will check the undertaking's long-term viability and the proportionality between the amount of aid granted and what France will be willing to accept in return in order to preserve the conditions of competition on the markets in question."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise that there is absolutely no position of principle involved on the part of the Commission concerning the system of ownership of undertakings in the Member States."
"You know as well as I do that the Treaty provides for and therefore imposes on us the strictest neutrality in the matter of public or private ownership of undertakings."
"I am therefore very much aware that the suspension was not designed to prevent the French state's entry into Alstom's capital as such."
"The Commission's desire was to prevent aid-constituting measures from producing irreversible consequences on the markets in question without the Commission's prior approval, that is in violation of the rules of the Treaty concerning state aid."
"Please do not let it be said that the Commission is against the public ownership of undertakings."
"As I have always stressed, it is not the Commission that asks a Member State to open the capital of public undertakings like the French Government is doing with Électricité de France, for example."
"Those choices are entirely up to the Member State concerned."
"What the Commission does have a duty to do under the Treaties is to ensure that undertakings, whether public or private, comply with the competition rules."
"As I said, I would like to stress the quality of our cooperation, based on a constructive spirit and one of confidence, with the French Government and Minister Mer in particular."
"Some of the reactions and remarks heard from French political and economic circles recently would benefit from a more detached analysis."
"I understand the feelings of the trade unions perfectly."
"I am well aware of the Alstom Group's importance in the European industrial and social fabric."
"On the other hand, I find it harder to understand the reference made here and there recently in the French debate to the European Commission acting like a lawyer and allegedly having no political awareness."
"Can people not see the political value of preserving a single market with no distortions of competition, a necessary, not sufficient, true, but necessary part of a social market economy?"
"Can they not see the political merit of preventing a State from bypassing the rules of the single market the chief beneficiaries of which are European undertakings themselves and the possibilities for growth, including growth in employment?"
"Can they not see the political necessity of inspiring confidence in Europe as a whole by demonstrating to the citizens of the small and future Member States that the Commission, in its role of guardian of the Treaty, is not strict with the small ones and weak with the big ones?"
"Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as I do on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to make three things very clear, especially to those who, following Commissioner Monti's statements, have forced today's debate upon us. Any criticism of the Commission is unfounded, and there is no reason to change competition policy; on the contrary, indeed, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Commission and, above all, to Commissioner Monti, whose actions over recent days have been marked by calmness, consistency and frankness, and who has been willing to engage in dialogue."
"On 17 September, we read in Agence Europe that Commissioner Monti had said, 'We are open to dialogue, and I am still confident that we will find a solution capable of safeguarding the integrity of the Common Market without distorting competition."
"This is a necessary condition for healthy European industry and for lasting employment.'"
"On 22 September, again in Agence Europe, Mr Monti had this to say: 'The Commission has never had negative prejudices against France and Alstom, but it was our duty to check that no direct and irrevocable change was made to conditions of competition in the market.'"
"He went on to say: 'I am happy to let it be known that the French authorities have fully complied with the Commission's conditions'."
"This is, of course, a sensitive case, but it is an issue of state aid."
"Yes, of course this company is of enormous importance on our continent."
"The Commission cannot, however, make adherence to EU law conditional on the size of a company and the number of people it employs."
"When questions are raised or something goes wrong, it has to intervene."
"All over the media, we read today's headlines: 'All banks agree rescue plan.'"
"'French industrial giant Alstom saved!'"
"'Alstom shares fall after initial rescue.'"
"'Paris urges Alstom industrial conglomerate to restructure.'"
"'Battle for the future of 110 000 jobs.'"
"This is a sensitive issue, but can we really claim that we would have wanted or expected the Commission to act in a different way?"
"I can speak for my group when I say that no, we would not, even though our hearts are in the right place where the associated problems are concerned and there is adequate awareness of the problems associated with it."
"Let me remind you of three articles in the new constitution."
"Article 3(2) will read: 'The Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, and an internal market where competition is free and undistorted'."
"In Article 4(2), we adopt and put on the record our prohibition on discrimination within the internal market as a domestic market."
"In Article 5(2) we lay it down that 'Member States shall facilitate the achievement of the Union's tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives set out in the Constitution.'"
"In Lisbon, we resolved to become, by 2010, the most competitive continent in the world."
"Let me emphasise that state subsidies need to be approved."
"Anything that distorts competition cries out to be investigated by the Commission, after conditions have been fulfilled and time limits have elapsed."
"Anything that goes against EU law must be prohibited."
"All discrimination is banned."
"Whatever weakens the internal market is irresponsible, as it damages growth and employment."
"My group has committed itself to the social market economy, and hence also to social responsibility."
"We are committed to the internal market and to competition, on which the creation of new jobs and growth depend."
"Commissioner Monti is its independent regulator."
"He has our entire support, and he has done the right thing."
"Madam President, Commissioner, at our initiative, the Alstom trades union representatives have visited the European Parliament on several occasions."
"As long ago as 1999, they condemned serious management errors committed by the group's directors."
"On 17 February 2000, here in Parliament, we adopted a resolution expressing a warning about the future risks facing the business."
"At the time, certain people stood up to speak and, in the name of the sacrosanct principles of liberalism, condemned this as an incongruous and, inevitably, incompetent intrusion of politics into economics - an experience that should give us all pause for serious thought."
"The coordinator of the Alstom Europe unions, Mrs Francine Blanche, was telling me yesterday evening that the employees were naturally pleased about the Commission's approval, in principle, of the rescue plan."
"However, they remember the many warnings given by their elected representatives, warnings that have never been taken seriously at any level."
"They are not about to agree to be the victims of this rescue now."
"Mrs Blanche gave me to understand that, since his appointment in January of this year, the new chairman of the group, Mr Kron, had devoted no more than two hours to discussions with the European representatives of the employees."
"Such arrogance is no longer tolerable."
"The need is enormous, and the demands are loud for those employees to exercise their rights as employees."
"Already, Commissioner, Alstom's European trades union coordinators are asking to be received, heard and listened to by the Commission."
"In the meantime, they will have studied the plan in detail and will be in a position to propose measures to achieve savings which will not take the form of job losses."
"That is what will happen in the immediate future."
"After that, this enormously important affair places certain major questions squarely on the agenda of the debate on the future of the European Union."
"I shall mention three of these."
"The first of these issues is the social dialogue, or rather the essential new rights of employees."
"Those timid and dust-covered directives on informing and consulting workers and on the European Works Council must be revised."
"Real rights must be established, even the right to suspend a restructuring plan so as to enable a second expert opinion to be obtained and all the available options considered."
"The second issue is that European industrial policy does not exist."
"All that exists is a race for state aids in the name of the competition rules."
"Yet in the present case, conversely, if there had not been any state aids, world economic competition would have been seriously distorted, given, on the one hand, what would be left of European industries in the strategic sectors of energy and the railways and, on the other, American giants such as General Electric, or those of Japan such as Mitsubishi."
"Thirdly, the democratic functioning of the Union makes it necessary to review the discretionary powers granted to the Commission in competition matters."
"It is essential that the social partners, the national parliaments and, of course, Parliament should have their say as regards the criteria to be met, the objectives to be assigned, and the controls to be exercised."
"Where would have been the legitimacy, in the minds of our fellow citizens, in implementing the Commission's initial threat to refuse the rescue plan for a strategic business which employs 118 000 people?"
"Finally, the Alstom case is a powerful reminder of the essential political choices to which the public debate on the European constitution will be leading us."
"For all these reasons, it was well worth adding this item to our agenda."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear about this, the Alstom affair, in its European dimension, is first of all a matter of form."
"The Commission was perfectly right to sanction the French Government for the arrogance and contempt for the common rules which it has demonstrated in this affair."
"This incident is only part of a long series of incidents."
"The way in which Mr Raffarin's government openly flouted the provisions of the Stability Pact, even though President Chirac had been one of its initiators and unconditional supporters, will make it difficult to renegotiate that pact, something that even Mr Prodi himself describes as stupid."
"There are other examples, such as the Raffarin government's contempt for the Directive on the conservation of wild birds and the Natura 2000 Directive, which resulted in the massacre in the wetlands of Poitou."
"The icing on the cake is Mr Raffarin's statement in which he talks about the legal requirements for the executive authority of the European Union as if it were some office in a foreign country."
"For this shameful statement I should like, on behalf of the great majority of French people who are aware of the fact that Europe is not a foreign country but rather our joint home, to offer our apologies to the Commission."
"Agreement has been reached today, and in this I rejoice."
"It will make it possible to save Alstom from imminent bankruptcy, something for which the directors, and those of ABB, are entirely responsible, despite warnings from their union members."
"It will give the French Government and the Commission time to negotiate formally a final solution."
"Having said that, Competition Commissioner, I should like to say a few words about the substance of this affair."
"You are aware that our group, the Greens, has loyally supported your efforts to defend consumers against the abusive practices of monopolies."
"My report on competition in 2001 bears witness to that fact."
"Nevertheless, I made certain observations which we have discussed in detail face to face, not only between Commissioner and MEP, but also between one economist and another."
"The Alstom affair once again gives me the opportunity to tell you this."
"Consumer protection consists, first of all, in guaranteeing consumers the existence of the supply of goods or services, before even thinking about the price of those goods or services."
"In other words it consists in implementing an industrial policy."
"The disappearance of Alstom, which would have caused the collapse of Asean Brown Boveri, would have greatly reduced the European supply of electricity turbines and high-speed trains, just at the time when the climate crisis and the Kyoto Agreement are calling for enormous investment in these two areas."
"Then again, what applies in the case of network infrastructures, where economic theory shows that monopolies and public subsidies are sometimes preferable to pure competition, often applies, ipso facto, to the oligopoly which is responsible for constructing and maintaining those networks."
"Finally, the brutal way in which the Raffarin Government was put in its place was perceived by the employees and the people who live in the regions concerned as a piece of brutality and inhumanity directed against them personally by a Europe which is once again being experienced as a foreign and hostile institution."
"In the final analysis the position of the Raffarin Government means privatising profits and nationalising losses."
"I do not approve of that and neither do you."
"You need to be able to demonstrate that European competition policy is aimed at keeping excessive profits in check and promoting the supply of public goods."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the people of France have had the feeling that, quite apart from the debate about any aid which the French Government may or may not decide to provide, there is an ego problem between Mr Mer and yourself."
"I should like to say right away that that is a matter which is of no interest to us."
"We are not here to give you our support, any more than we are here to give Mr Mer our support."
"The question we have to consider is simple: does Europe, the European Union - and more specifically the Commission of which you are a member - have a clear industrial policy?"
"Ought we to have blind faith in you?"
"The answer is 'no'."
"I do not see any clear industrial policy."
"As for having blind faith in you, the decisions which have been taken by the Court of Justice, which have overturned three of the decisions which you had taken, demonstrate only too well that this is not possible."
"I do not doubt your good intentions, but I do doubt the efficacy and the justice of the decisions that you take."
"At all events this affair has revealed that even the European Commission, whatever its claims, when confronted with an exceptionally serious problem involving one country, cannot do anything either."
"I would be the first to admit that the French Government has presented its case badly."
"However, I would also like to say that the way in which you yourself have reacted is not calculated to help Alstom either."
"Finally, it would seem that both sides have now seen reason to some extent."
"I would add, in conclusion, the Mr Lipietz is in the wrong place."
"If he wants to criticise the French Government, he should not do it here, because it is not the job of this House to judge the French Government."
"Come and do it in a different forum, Mr Lipietz, in our own country, where people will be able to give you an answer."
"Madam President, Commissioner, our experiences of recent days involving the Alstom affair remind me a little of the story of the man who, when he was asked why he kept hitting himself on the head with a hammer, replied that it was because it felt so good when it stopped."
"Admittedly, Mr Monti, your strong-arm tactics enabled you to impose your will on the French Government."
"Let us admit it: you even made it look ridiculous."
"That government, which had rejected all the figures on the Friday, then spent the weekend producing a whole lot more, with the support of every bank in the country."
"You have won then, but at what price?"
"All Europeans now know that Brussels can sacrifice 120 000 jobs without losing sleep over it, that it can ruin such prestigious industrial sites as Belfort or St-Nazaire, simply in order to get its own back. Mr Pasqua mentioned this a moment ago - the wounded pride of a European Commissioner."
"You are playing with communities, Mr Monti, simply in order to satisfy unimportant dogmas and your own vanity."
"You are not a lawyer, Mr Monti."
"Indeed, to call you a lawyer would be a compliment, since there are many lawyers who are actually working in the interests of families and their inheritance."
"You are only a bailiff, the man who carries out the process of seizing this social market economy, which can best be summed up as follows: the market is economising on society."
"Mr Monti, we, the people of France, already have you to thank for the fact that Péchinet was abandoned."
"You did not allow us to buy back Alcan, even though you could have done so."
"We might have had you to thank for the ruin of Schneider and of Legrand."
"Do you not sometimes think that you are to European industry what Torquemada was to the Catholic religion?"
"In other words, you are playing the grand inquisitor in hunting down state aids just as the good Torquemada, if I may put it this way, hunted down heresy, sodomy and to some extent, let us admit it, Jews."
"Madam President, following on as it does from the debate in France about the budget austerity pact, the arrogant and dogmatic handling of the Alstom affair by the European Commission is symbolic, and full of lessons to be learned for the future."
"It is an extremely bitter foretaste of the future that lies in store for a Europe of nation states in thrall."
"The people of France, surprised and shocked, have suddenly discovered the reality of Europe, a technocratic and imperialist octopus, which puts balance sheets before people, and Community legalism before enterprise."
"It is not a Europe of industry, growth and employment that the Commission is preparing, but rather a vast industrial wasteland, a Europe of delocalisation, unemployment, economic decline and social vulnerability."
"France has gone from independence to dependence, from liberty to submission, to the extent that it is now reduced to sending its government to beg our lords and masters in Brussels for new conditions and for new time limits - a pitiable and humiliating spectacle!"
"Finally, an agreement obtained only after a hard fight will not hide for long the vital need for the French people to recover their freedoms, their economic and social independence, their political sovereignty and, quite simply, their dignity."
"Madam President, Commissioner Monti, ladies and gentlemen, the threat of the Alstom Group's imminent bankruptcy has been averted through a compromise solution between more than thirty lending banks, the French Government and the Commission."
"The support package amounts to EUR 2.8 billion."
"EUR 2.8 billion, that is a generous package, and it could also be said that it is, for the most part, a generous present from the state that is of doubtful benefit."
"In my view, it is impossible to eradicate from Europe the erroneous belief that money can be used to prop up uncompetitive structures."
"I would argue for temporary support to avoid structures breaking down and to allow them to change, but I am concerned that even in this way uncompetitive structures will continue to be supported."
"The convertible loan, which is on the cards as a compromise, is nothing more than an invitation to the French state to exchange this for shares after this enquiry, which would once again result in the re-nationalisation of Alstom."
"It is precisely this mindset in Europe of not wanting to allow structural change, the belief that state money should, as a matter of principle, be used to avoid structural change, that is damaging for Europe as a business location."
"The International Monetary Fund has once again pointed out that it is the large states, Germany, France and Italy, that act as bottlenecks on the continent and are thus responsible for the fact that the next boom will probably pass Europe by."
"The elimination of businesses that cannot sustain competition is part of the market economy, and, let me add, also part of the social market economy."
"Something else of importance for me is that today, Mr Monti, we can read the headlines saying that the test of strength has been passed."
"I see that as positive and I should like to congratulate you on this in this House."
"It was important that the French state should not put before the Commission a fait accompli without being asked."
"No, this European Union is a Community based on the rule of law and this includes competition law."
"I can only invite all national states to heed this law."
"From 2001 to date there has been an increase in state aid - EUR 88 billion to date within the European Union - that is revealing and something to fear."
"I think that the nation states are well advised to adhere to competition law, in particular on the eve of the enlargement of the European Union."
"Madam President, firstly I wish to tell Mr Monti that I will not be engaging in any personal attacks on him - he has an extremely difficult job."
"However, let me just say, in reaction to the previous speaker, that businesses just stop - they go out of business."
"That is the reality."
"We have to remind ourselves of what we are trying to address tonight, which is the reality of 110 000 jobs."
"The reality is that if you do not have a job, you cannot pay your bills or support yourself."
"This House needs to recognise that we must come together to create better social dialogue and a better awareness and social responsibility for those in employment."
"In the United Kingdom alone, 10 000 jobs rest with Alstom."
"We need to support Alstom."
"The uncertainty over the aid is not helpful."
"There are already concerns that plants in Washwood Heath (Birmingham), Rugby and Stafford face an unnecessary and uncertain future."
"We need to give them certainty and encourage development and investment."
"We are not doing that."
"We need flexibility of application in the rules on state aid."
"When we are dealing with huge social upheaval we must also look at the costs."
"I support this refinancing package, but it must not be at the expense of British workers and British jobs."
"There is real concern for those in the transmission and distribution businesses that their business is likely to be transferred to Arriva."
"There is real concern about the final salary pension schemes of those workers."
"We must give them some form of certainty."
"My big fear tonight is that we will conclude that Alstom may survive and get the support of the European Union."
"What we need to say is that Alstom will survive, and we must do everything possible to ensure that survival and protect those 110 000 jobs."
"We owe it to ourselves and to those people in those jobs."
"Madam President, Alstom, that great and excellent undertaking, has almost been done to death on two occasions, the first time by the management mistakes of its former chairman, and the second time by the intransigence of the Commission."
"Admittedly the Commission has just told us yet again that it is only applying the Treaty and I have to admit, Mr Monti, that that is true."
"The Treaty itself poses a problem, because its wording, in the 'competition' part, goes back to the Treaty of Rome."
"It proves that our vision of competition is now too narrow, too focused on the internal market, whereas we should be taking a more global view of the strategic, national and European interests at stake in what is now worldwide competition."
"This is why, in the Alstom affair, the French Government was defending, in the last analysis, a more balanced and more global position than the Commission."
"In this way it was demonstrating that a nation state, democratically responsible, was perfectly capable of assessing whether state aid should be given in order to save, in exceptional circumstances, industries that are strategically important for the economic independence or cultural identity of the country."
"It would have been better if the Commission had helped it and cooperated in achieving that objective."
"Any future reform of the Treaty ought to take this into account."
"In the meantime, we deplore the fact that Mr Monti, in his statements just now, has continued to allow the sword of Damocles to hang over the plan to rescue Alstom, and we deplore the fact that the Commission has absolute power in this area."
"On that too it will be necessary to reform the Treaty in the near future."
"Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Konrad, for generously giving me a minute to talk on behalf of the constituents Mr Cashman and I share in the United Kingdom, and who are affected by the uncertainty over Alstom."
"I will come straight to the point; it is perhaps a reflection of our different views that I want some answers from the Commission about the way forward."
"It is clear this business has to be restructured and that it must change in its present form because of the lack of demand for its products."
"However, I would like to ask the Commission, firstly, its views about the sale of the transmission and distribution division to Arriva."
"Could the Commissioner confirm that this will not be subject to any further delays for competition purposes or, if that disposal or sale is to be referred to him, that he will speed up the procedure as much as possible, so that the employees and that very important division with a long-term future are not affected by any more uncertainty?"
"As far as the other parts of the undertaking are concerned, will he confirm that the Alstom management will be free to consider offers and to sell other parts of the business to whomsoever they choose and wherever they come from?"
"We know that there are businesses in Germany and potentially in Japan and America which would be interested in giving a future to employees by reconsolidating the sector."
"Finally, will he look at the competition implications in the transport business, and at the fact that within the United Kingdom the majority of railway rolling stock is manufactured outside the country, whereas other countries seem quite capable of introducing into their contracts provisions to ensure that rolling stock is made in their own country?"
"That is a crucial issue that will affect the future of an excellent railway assembly plant in Birmingham where there is no future work."
"At any rate, as part of a restructuring process, we would like to see those people employed in making trains for the United Kingdom market."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we welcome with relief, even if it is only a stay of execution, the Commission's decision to allow the Alstom rescue plan to take its chances."
"Let us not deceive ourselves: behind all the good reasons put forward by one side or the other, this issue will be a political test of the first order for the European Union as far as public opinion is concerned."
"This issue, which concerns one of the jewels in the crown of industrial and technological Europe, on which hangs the future of 118 000 employees throughout the world, is a practical test of both the European project and the Commission."
"Commissioner, we do not underestimate the extent to which the French Government, forced into a corner, making its clumsiness and its attempts to lay down the law even worse, has presented us with a fait accompli by publishing a rescue plan before negotiating with the Commission, as it is obliged to do under the Treaties."
"However, Mr Mer must be aware that in the past, on the basis of the same Treaties, another French Government, that of Mr Fabius, succeeded, without any difficulty and without any vain polemics from Brussels, in saving the French steel industry in circumstances which were difficult in other ways."
"Believe me, we are the first to suffer, we the elected representatives of France, when we see the Prime Minister of our country prostrating himself here in order to ask you to accept record deficits, and, at the same time, the reduction of VAT for his voters in the restaurant trade."
"It is true to say that in this behaviour, on the part of a country like France towards the European Union, there is something similar to, and as unilateral and arrogant as, the behaviour of Mr Bush towards the United Nations."
"Unfortunately, however, he needs a diversion and a scapegoat."
"He needs the old trick of treating himself to false victories when faced with the bureaucracy of Brussels."
"For all that, Commissioner, this episode, which can only be the herald of others like it, given the worrying movements towards deindustrialisation and delocalisation which are affecting the brightest jewels in our industrial crown, should make us, as Europeans, ask ourselves about the place and the status of our policy on competition within the Union."
"It is becoming increasingly outrageous and intolerable that our competition policy, in a context that is quite different from that of the Treaties by which it was established in 1986 and 1992, should remain bound by the impassable horizon of being simply a policy of the European Union."
"Many voices - too many, and increasingly credible - are being raised to claim that Europe cares more about the inexorable law of the market than any of the most free-market countries in the world, starting with the United States of America."
"Today, faced with the inexorable affirmation of the new major powers of tomorrow, Europe needs to look at things and judge them from an angle other than that of unbridled competition."
"It needs an industrial policy which is capable of protecting its national champions, of safeguarding its priceless technical heritage and its precious savoir-faire."
"It needs a social policy which aims to maintain living standards and the employment of the greatest possible number of Europeans."
"What is at stake here is, first and foremost, a social issue of primary importance, but also the competitiveness of Europe in the world at large."
"Finally, how can we make our peoples understand that an administrative authority over which there is no parliamentary control should alone take a decision of such importance that thousands of workers' families are now awaiting it with bated breath and with anguish in their hearts?"
"Above and beyond the decision that you take - and I cannot imagine that it will be a second negative - the whole meaning of the European project and the structure of the current Treaties are being called into question here."
"In this respect, we can only hope, if such a thing is possible, that the next Intergovernmental Conference will tackle this need to push forward, side by side and on equal terms with competition policy, a social policy of employment and an industrial policy which will enable the Union to defend its economic and social interests in the global world in which we shall be living from now on."
"Madam President, I merely wish to correct something Commissioner Monti said."
"He is right that I referred to the 10 000 jobs in the United Kingdom and specifically those in my constituency, Birmingham, Rugby and Stafford."
"However, the record will show that I said we had a care of duty - a responsibility - to the 110 000 jobs."
"Therefore, whilst I recognise that I looked at the British consequences, I am extremely concerned about the effects on those jobs across Europe."
"Thank you Mr Cashman."
"The debate is closed."
"The sitting is suspended until 9 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.50 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0232/2003) by Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and Council establishing a general framework for financing Community actions in support of consumer policy for the years 2004 to 2007. (COM(2003) 44 C5-0022/2003 2003/0020(COD))."
". Mr President, as this Parliament enlarges, Commissioner, you and I get physically further apart, but we are drawn closer together by the consequence of enlargement, which is that consumer protection is a prime concern now for a Community of 450,000,000 people."
"Tonight, the House has the opportunity to carry through an agreement at first reading, which will guarantee that support for consumers' activities."
"It came to us a little late but we have made good progress."
"I would particularly like to thank you, Commissioner, for the effort you made to get here tonight, after the lengthy day you have had, and also for the work of your staff."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their solidarity which includes their presence here tonight, my own assistant Laura Sullivan, the consumer NGOs and the Council Presidency, all of whom have brought us to a position where we can tonight demonstrate that the total support in Council is overwhelmingly replicated in Parliament."
"We are presenting about thirty-one compromise amendments en bloc, all of which have involved give and take."
"If passed, the second bloc of amendments to the fifteen original ones would fall."
"That would leave about five remaining amendments which I would advise the House to vote down."
"I will deal with those last."
"These compromises reflect the consensus view that we need to widen the scale and the proportionate limit of support for consumer activities."
"We stand on the brink of enlargement and all the diverse needs that will follow from it."
"We have had to find legally sound ways to extend those provisions up to 2007, in cooperation with our friends and colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"We also acknowledge that small - but equally deserving - applicants have been disadvantaged in the past by the arcane nature and length of the assessment process."
"The converse also applies."
"We need to be certain of the rules, qualifications and funding of all applicants, however obscure."
"Events unfolding today before other committees suggest that this caution is necessary."
"The Commission has told us that it accepts with good grace the requirement to supply an assessment of applications within three months."
"When that is not possible, we will be told why."
"I am glad that the Commissioner has stressed that his best endeavours and those of his team will go towards making early consideration of all these applications as effective as possible and that there will be seminars and other instruction particularly for those making applications for the first time and, sometimes, from a country which is itself a new Member State."
"It is an anomaly that we are having to discuss the pressing needs of enlargement at a time when, technically, we cannot consider the budget that we know must be used for that purpose post 2004."
"This is a first reading which can result in instant agreement between the three institutions if we all accept that none of the three have been pushed beyond their limits."
"The Commissioner knows that there has been a certain exasperation over some of the committees that have been set up and the discussions that have been held about consumer protection, not just in this institution but elsewhere too."
"We have to accept the limits of what we can do in saying who can meet where and do what in relation to consumer advice."
"My colleagues have wisely decided on that score that they would not push some of the amendments that came before the Committee, although we support and indeed sometimes salute the principles that inspired them."
"I have to say to my good friend, colleague and namesake Mr Bushill-Matthews that his Amendment No 11 is an amendment too far."
"I supported it in the Committee because I felt that we needed to make this point: there is exasperation where sometimes - and the Commission I think accepts this as the case - applications have not been considered not just within three or four months, as the Commission would have preferred, but within five months and beyond."
"The worst offenders are not DG SANCO."
"Indeed, some of the examples Mr Bushill-Matthews gave come from other directorates-general."
"The point however stands, we need to improve on it and we need to be able to demonstrate a greater responsiveness on the part of the Commission."
"I hope Mr Bushill-Matthews will tell us tonight with his customary subtlety that he understands the position we are in."
"In conclusion, this is a modest proposal."
"The Commissioner will understand that I do not mean this in a Swiftian sense."
"We are not devouring our children; we are nourishing them with this proposal."
"I hope it is commended by everybody in the House."
"Mr President, I am very happy to see that the European Union and the Commission, and all of us together, are supporting the consumers' associations."
"They are, in a sense, the other element of the triptych which makes up democracy."
"I would also, however, like to stress certain aspects which seem to me to be very positive."
"In accordance with this spirit of providing incentive, I believe it is enormously important to create networks and that they are not just made up of the European consumers' associations already consolidated."
"The danger with this type of aid is that we create a group of associations receiving preferential treatment which, in the end, creates an autonomous body, with no relationship with the grass roots."
"To this end, we have introduced certain amendments mentioning regional and national associations, because it is extremely important that, particularly in relation to the management and implementation of the programme, the Commission ensures that the small associations can emerge, clearly linked to the scheme and the network."
"Since we also have the challenge of the new democracies in the Eastern countries, it is essential to incentivise the creation of small associations in every part of the Union."
"I would like to praise the efforts of the small associations located in regions far from the decision-making centres such as Brussels."
"It often takes genuine heroism to create an association in these regions, in which the people feel alone and misunderstood and where they often have to touch raw nerves or denounce aspects relating to their immediate neighbours to the local authorities, bearing in mind the scant inspection the administration can carry out."
"I therefore welcome this initiative and would ask that, when it comes to distributing aid, account be taken not just of the need to provide incentives for emerging associations and to strengthen the small ones, by linking them to the more consolidated associations, but that we also need to ensure that the more consolidated ones fulfil their duties and make contacts with all parts of the Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as a Scandinavian, I do not usually go in for flowery language, but I wish to thank Mr Whitehead and the Commission's officials for the intensive work done so that we might quickly have this proposal turned into a reality."
"We have all worked in a spirit of how important it is to strengthen the consumer organisations and reinforce the objectives of consumer work."
"I therefore want to say thank you to Phillip."
"The previous speakers have already mentioned the situation in the candidate countries."
"It is for the new Europe that we are developing the consumer area."
"In this area, as in many others, I believe there is an old heritage we must combat."
"I believe that strong consumer organisations are extremely important for enabling people to participate and for giving them the opportunity to exercise influence."
"For those reasons too, approval is important so that the candidate countries become part of the required network."
"In Parliament's amendments, we indicate the importance of genuinely integrating consumer issues into other areas."
"This has been an issue especially close to my heart."
"As MEPs, we see how strong the lobbying is in other areas."
"We must give the consumer the power to study, inform and share best practices."
"The next issues must be those of mobile telephone conversations, price fixing or the ways in which billing operates in different countries."
"I therefore think it important for us to highlight this issue."
"The previous speakers, especially the rapporteur and the Commissioner, spoke of the administrative procedures."
"The work we have done together - and I want to emphasise the word 'together' - may be genuinely groundbreaking in bringing about rapid procedures and quick responses in place of a situation in which applicants are constantly forced to communicate when there is no need to."
"I hope that the outcome of our work will serve as an example of better procedures."
"We in the committee proposed that the committee, mentioned in Article 15, should be disbanded."
"We knew that the Council would not perhaps accept the proposal."
"I nonetheless hope that the Commissioner, the Commission and all of us are agreed about following up the question of what the committee costs."
"Does it give value for money?"
"In an enlarged EU, it may be extremely difficult to have large committees of this kind that decide about quite small funds."
"I hope that the Commission will genuinely look into what the committee mentioned in Article 15 will, in reality, cost."
"Mr President, we are satisfied, on the whole, with Mr Whitehead's report and with the fact that the Council has generally taken on board our amendments."
"The clarification of the detailed rules for financing consumer protection organisations was essential."
"The definition of such bodies must be strict."
"The report follows this line, while at the same time guaranteeing the participation of a panel of organisations."
"Of course we must keep those organisations which demonstrate the necessary technical competence, but we must also ensure the independence of representative bodies."
"It is absolutely essential to avoid a situation in which pressure groups - whether industrial, commercial, professional or any other kind - see those bodies as a means of indirectly influencing the Union's policy."
"On the other hand, we must maintain our relations with the cooperatives, which take consumers' interests into account in their charters."
"Relations with consumer protection organisations have to be developed in close contact with the public."
"We cannot, therefore, be satisfied with giving preferential treatment to relations with Community or national organisations while merely offering support to regional bodies: the latter must enjoy proper representation within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as corresponding financial aid."
"That committee will also be responsible for ensuring even greater representation of civil society."
"The expansion in the sphere of competence is important."
"The bodies in the food sector have now been joined by consumer protection organisations in the services sector and, more broadly, in the non-food sectors."
"Access to information is an essential guarantee of consumer protection."
"This is why we asked for, and obtained, public data banks that would be easily accessible."
"The public must be able to find out about the precise history of products, their origin, their method of production etc. This means, amongst other things, improving labelling - an effective means of guaranteeing that consumers are informed."
"We must go further, however."
"If we want to be sure that safe products are being marketed, we not only need to be informed about the risks: we also need to see about reducing those risks."
"That is only possible if we develop comparative evaluations with a view to sustainable and responsible production and consumption."
"That is the real consumer protection policy."
". Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members concerned for participating in this useful and interesting debate, and for the constructive position they have taken."
"I personally feel that the codecision process has resulted in significant improvements to this decision."
"The compromise amendments proposed have reaped the benefit of the combined expertise of all three institutions."
"The Commission can accept this compromise package, consisting of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 12, 14, 15, 22, 23 and 29 up to and including 59."
"As far as Amendment No 52 is concerned, the Commission notes the Parliament's wish and the Council's unanimous agreement that there should be a three-month deadline for decision-making on grant applications."
"We are committed to reducing the time taken for such decisions to the absolute minimum and will work towards this deadline."
"Nevertheless, the Commission wishes to remind Parliament of the importance of not deviating from the imperatives of proper evaluation and the full respect of rules on financial and budget management."
"In response to the comments from Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and Mr Rod on regional organisations, I should say that I am fully aware of the important role played by regional consumer organisations in certain EU countries."
"Their proximity to consumer concerns makes them an interesting partner for implementing the policy objectives of EU consumer policy."
"Regional consumer organisations are eligible for grants for specific projects and can also benefit from the capacity-building actions we offer to consumer organisations."
"For example, the training courses we offer to consumer organisations to help improve their managerial capacity and the contribution of consumer representatives to EU policy development are open to the staff of regional consumer organisations. Specific projects that promote the objectives of EU policy at regional level are eligible for cofinancing from the EU budget."
"I very much hope that regional consumer organisations will make good use of such opportunities."
"In response to Mrs Thors' question regarding the integration of consumer issues in other policies, I want to stress that the integration of consumer interests into all relevant EU policies is enshrined in Article 153 of the Treaty."
"It should be pursued by all Commission services and by all EU institutions."
"We have been making progress on this issue."
"In the important debate about services of general interest, that followed the adoption of the Commission Green Paper, consumer interests are amongst the core issues on the table."
"We hope that the progress achieved so far - in air transport, for example, with the charter on passenger rights and the denied boarding regulation - will serve as a reference for the improvement of passenger rights in other modes of transport."
"Actions in this proposal for a decision that will contribute to the integration objectives are many; to name but a few: actions to provide consumer organisations with the technical and legal expertise to effectively contribute to policy development in EU policy areas relevant to consumers, and actions to collect data that provide an evidence base for the integration of consumer interests into other EU policies."
"On the question of comitology raised by Mrs Thors, I would like to say that since 1999 the Consultative Committee of the Member States has advised the Commission, in particular concerning the attribution of grants."
"It makes a useful contribution to coordinating EU and national policies for project grants."
"In addition, this Committee will become the essential forum for discussion and advice on the implementation of a new type of action - those that are jointly financed by the Community budget and the Member States."
"These joint actions will in particular be used for the Commission's future activities in the area of administrative and enforcement cooperation and to consolidate the existing networks of European Consumer Centres and the Extra-Judicial network."
"The Committee, therefore, has a key role to play in the implementation of the proposed framework."
"I took full note when Mr Bushill-Matthews said that he will be watching me: that, of course, is his job and that of Parliament."
"We are accountable to Parliament and Parliament is of course accountable to the elected Members."
"I noted that Mr Bushill-Matthews also said that next time he will fire live rounds."
"I suppose that means that up until now he has been firing blanks!"
"To conclude, my special gratitude goes to Mr Whitehead, who has proved a master in negotiating at a high level to achieve a compromise with the Council."
"I take note of what he said in relation to us nourishing our children rather than devouring them."
"Of course you will realise, Mr Whitehead, that this proposal is not a modest proposal: it is quite a substantial proposal."
"Your reference to my fellow countryman points to the title 'A Modest Proposal', which, of course, is inappropriate in this instance."
"I consider this exercise to be an excellent example of how the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission can work together constructively on consumer policy issues."
"I trust that the vote will confirm the orientations set out today."
"I hope that other consumer issues pending before this Parliament can also, in due course, be resolved with equal skill and constructive spirit."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow."
"Mr President, we are concerned here with the Commission's Communication on Adequate and Sustainable Pensions and with an analysis of whether, in their first Strategy Reports, the Member States have complied with the three overarching aims of the common pensions policy."
"The first of these is whether pensions are adequate and whether we have set future pensions at a level sufficient to prevent poverty and provide a reasonable standard of living."
"The second is whether pensions are economically sustainable in the long term so that future generations do not have an unnecessarily large economic burden placed upon them."
"The third is whether pensions are sufficiently up-to-date to cope with the new situation, characterised by atypical jobs and more and more women in the labour market."
"We think that the Commission's communication is sound."
"The Commission has carried out a sound analysis."
"In Parliament, we have tried to distance ourselves from the national debates on various national changes to the pensions systems."
"We have tried to stick to our task at EU level, namely that of setting up objectives for the common strategy we are to have at EU level."
"The Member States must themselves deal with the purely practical proposals for the pensions systems."
"We have a number of viewpoints."
"First of all, there must be a balance between social and economic considerations."
"It is important for economic development that we have sustainable pensions systems."
"That applies especially to those countries that are involved in cooperation in connection with the euro, but also to other countries, so that we obtain sustainable economic development."
"It is at least as important, however, for us to address the social aspects that affect people's living standards."
"We must ensure that people have a comfortable standard of living in later years, not hugely different from that they enjoyed when gainfully employed, and that they do not end up in poverty."
"Pensions systems still reveal a lack of equality."
"Women's pensions are not as large as men's."
"In some cases, that has to do with the pensions systems, but the main reason is women's position in the labour market."
"Women have, to a larger extent, lower paid jobs, part-time work and a lower level of employment."
"That means that the Lisbon process is the most important thing in this connection."
"The situation for those who have atypical jobs is not satisfactory either, especially when it comes to the supplementary pensions on which the two sides of industry are agreeing."
"There is good reason to address these problems."
"The absolutely most important thing if we are to meet our commitments in the future is that we obtain growth and full employment."
"It is therefore important for us to link these aims to the Lisbon process and to the employment and economic guidelines and for us to take a global view."
"We very often talk about solidarity between our generations here and now, and it is important that there be solidarity right now between the generations."
"In view of demographic development, it is, however, at least as important that we talk about solidarity with future generations so that we ourselves - and I personally belong to the generation born in the forties - do not indulge ourselves too much now with the result that future generations of earners have to contend with unreasonably high costs when we become pensioners."
"We must ensure that that will not be the case with the new pensions systems."
"We must show solidarity with future generations."
"What caused most discussion in the committee was the actual and/or statutory pensionable age."
"We are not interfering with the statutory pensionable age."
"It is paradoxical that the elder portion of the population is becoming healthier and healthier - which is a good thing - at the same time as it is working less and less."
"We are today working less than we did thirty years ago."
"There are many reasons for this."
"If something is missing from the Commission's communication, it is perhaps an overall picture of how the actual pensionable age is to be increased."
"We are concerned here with financial incentives, but we are also concerned with matters such as lifelong learning, the organisation of work and problems involving the working environment, so that older people can also remain in the labour market."
"We must change working life in such a way that people can remain actively in work and not be excluded from it."
"We shall then also address the subject of enlargement."
"Finally, I wish to thank all those who have helped us obtain a broad, if not complete, consensus in the committee."
"We have enjoyed sound cooperation in the committee."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate and thank Mr Andersson."
"The report on adequate and sustainable pensions touches on one of the most burning issues in the hands of all the governments."
"Reforms in each country are, of course, a national responsibility, but I would say that we are turning a blind eye if we fail to look at the European dimension and the need for cooperation, not only because there is a very close economic dependency between the economies of the Member States, but also because our analysis has resulted in convincing conclusions that the causes of the crisis in the pension systems are precisely the same in all the countries."
"They are demographics, longer life expectancy, the new working models and the new family models."
"Using the open method of cooperation was the first important attempt made at European level for the countries to cooperate with each other."
"We agreed on three lines of approach."
"The first concerned the economic viability of the pension systems."
"The second concerned adequate pensions, meaning a dignified standard of living for pensioners, which is something Mr Andersson insists on in his report."
"And the third is the adaptability of the pension systems, so that they take account of changes."
"The reference in the report to the link between pension systems and the labour market is important, and I shall explain how the Commission is meeting the demands made in the report with a series of initiatives."
"First, the question of increasing the actual retirement age. It is clear, on the one hand, that it is important and necessary to change the age limit, for reasons of sustainability and, on the other hand, that this cannot be done on its own, without flanking employment policies which will help elderly workers to remain in the labour market, because today, due to the culture which exists in the labour market, the reality which has existed for many years, it is very difficult for elderly workers over 55 years of age to find work easily."
"Within this framework, both the European strategy on employment and the European Social Fund are being called on to play an important role."
"The second important issue is that the Commission, on the orders of the European Council, is continuing to apply the coordination method."
"In 2005, we shall move to a new report on the monitoring of the systems, while the Social Protection Committee will examine the contribution of social systems to the extension of working life."
"Finally, we are constantly monitoring the indicators to which we committed in Barcelona and we have agreed on the need to increase the actual retirement age by five years by 2010."
"To come back to what Mr Andersson said about the gender dimension."
"The gender dimension is most important in pension systems, especially in the private sector."
"I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that in the private sector there is no equal treatment of men and women, while account is mainly taken of the gender criterion when calculating pensions."
"Two more points: the issue of enlargement, on which we have constant communication with the Member States, so that they can also integrate the issue of mobility."
"The report refers in detail to how we can overcome the obstacles which exist in the labour market in Europe and with mobility, which is an issue for which we have drawn up a ten-year action plan."
". (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank Mr Andersson warmly for his excellent cooperation which is, among other things, evident from the fact that he has adopted the women's amendments and inserted them in his own report."
"The Commissioner has stated that the pension schemes are in crisis, and I share her view."
"The costs of pensions will put pressure on the Stability Pact and, in a previous term of office, I occasionally referred to this as 'a bomb under the EURO'."
"Many countries are taking measures for that reason, and because of many of these measures, women are hit harder than other groups in the population."
"As a result of a lower participation rate in the labour force, a higher percentage of women working part-time, the lower incomes and the slower rise in income (due, among other things, to maternity leave), many women receive lower pensions than men, on average."
"According to the report by the Commission, this difference varies from approximately 16 to 45% depending on the Member State in question."
"There is also the issue of equal treatment."
"In this context, I should like to make a reference to America."
"There is a judgment by the Supreme Court that stipulates that calculating contributions towards, and payments of, supplementary pensions differently on the basis of gender-based actuarial factors is in contravention of the Civil Rights Act."
"Hopefully, this view will be generally held in Europe too."
"The fact that, according to a recent hearing, it transpired that women no longer live all that much longer than men at all, should be added to this."
"I should also like to draw your attention to a regrettable fact, namely that the Commission has never implemented Parliament's proposals to force Member States to make arrangements to deal with the problem that parts of the pension rights accrued during marriage are at risk of being lost in periods when one of the partners decides to care for the other."
"I should also like to urge Member States to ensure that people continue to remain part of pension accrual schemes during maternity leave or care leave for children or other dependants."
"This is already the case in a number of countries, and I think that those countries set a good example for other Member States that have not done this to date."
"Member States should promote the individualisation of pension rights, without abolishing the derived rights of the surviving spouse and children."
"As I have stated before, it is an all-embracing problem, in fact, whereby, often, women are at greater risk of losing out than others."
"I therefore agree that we should promote labour mobility and in the light of this, I should like ?"
"Thank you, Mr President, I notice that my three minutes are up."
"Finally, I hope that the Commissioner will particularly take the position of women into consideration."
"Mr President, few things concern the European citizens more than the health of their pensions, few things in their family life or their social life demands such constant attention throughout their lives, perhaps because for millions and millions of Europeans pensions are the only significant asset they accumulate and the only security they have against the risks of biological life or economic life."
"This excellent report by Mr Andersson is the culmination of a legislature of the European Parliament during which we have brought our agenda into line with the agenda of the citizens."
"This is an important legislature because the European Parliament, also following excellent communications and excellent initiatives from the Commission, has introduced the issue of pensions into the Community agenda for the first time."
"We are extremely happy that at the end of this legislature progress has been made on a philosophy which has radically increased the appreciation of this phenomenon."
"It is no longer just a concern inspired by financial considerations or the balance of public finances."
"We now have a doctrine, a strategy, which together with this important issue, we have enriched and supplemented with the objectives and needs of the European citizens."
"We are therefore pleased that this report and the Commission's Communication have analysed the strategies of the Member States, taking account of financial viability of course!"
"Perhaps in this way we are also demonstrating that we are responsible politicians."
"There are basically two categories of politician: there are irresponsible politicians, who only think about the next elections, and there are responsible politicians who think about the next generations."
"The Andersson report is thinking about the next generations, but is also thinking about bringing things up to date so that social security, pensions, fulfil our objectives and combat poverty."
"It also thinks about modernisation and categories of workers, particularly women, who face such risks in the new social order and the labour market."
"What does the Commission tell us about the situation of our Member States?"
"We can see that there is a will, but we can also see that there is sometimes apathy and a lot of prudence; and I would also add that there is fear of reform in the Member States, perhaps because the population is afraid that reform may in fact be an excuse to talk about cuts in their social rights."
"It is therefore very important that we help to overcome these fears amongst the population by presenting reforms which are not just cuts, but which are aimed at satisfying their current and future needs within a more secure, fair and equitable framework."
"Tomorrow, the Socialist Group will support the Andersson report and the work of the Commission because we believe that in fact the changes proposed are not frivolous, or opportunistic, but that they respond to our social commitment to this generation of workers, to these citizens, and also to those who will live in Europe in the next generation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I also wish to thank Mr Andersson for his very clear and well set-out report, and the Commission for a very interesting report on European pensions systems."
"How countries organise their pensions systems falls within the sphere of national competences, but I think that the report, with its objectives of adequate, sustainable pensions and flexible pensions systems may provide inspiration and give rise to sensible debates at national level."
"I also think that an interesting conclusion has been reached, namely that, in general, there is a high degree of redistribution and solidarity in the Member States' pensions systems, but that women are disadvantaged in many countries because of their special position in the labour market."
"Something needs to be done about this, and I am pleased about the strong emphasis placed here upon the need to press for something to be done about the matter."
"I therefore very much agree with the overall conclusion of Mr Andersson's report."
"On the other hand, I disagree with a number of the amendments before us from the left side of the House where the investment of pensions savings in shares and bonds is clearly seen as an evil in itself."
"It is true that there have been problems with pension funds, which have suffered large losses in connection with the large falls in share prices, but I do not think that the answer is to stop introducing savings schemes for pensions."
"On the contrary, I think that better control of the risk in connection with pension funds' investments must be ensured and that there must be stronger supervision on the part of the authorities."
"That is also something we can cooperate on at EU level in order to guarantee better risk management."
"We are all, of course, getting older, and it is not too much to ask that each of us take joint responsibility for saving up for old age and help ensure that future generations do not have unreasonable burdens placed upon them, for it is also a question of distribution between the generations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report by Mr Andersson stresses the need to take account of the poverty suffered by many pensioners and the inequalities between the pension entitlements of men and women."
"With this in mind he recommends a sufficient level of minimum guarantee pensions and increasing the employment level among women in a bid to promote equal opportunities."
"I and my group agree with these parts of the report."
"Mr Andersson even indicates that he is anxious to ensure that a balance is struck between social and financial concerns."
"Unfortunately, this undertaking is contradictory and causes the rapporteur to call into question fundamental social principles in the name of financial criteria."
"Indeed the vote in the committee was not unanimous."
"We did not vote in favour of this report in the parliamentary committee because it supports the Commission's proposal to raise the retirement age."
"In so doing, it aligns itself with the liberal approach, manifest at many European Councils in the past, which advocates greater flexibility and increased working time."
"We are opposed to this kind of reform, which imposes increased working time and yet does nothing to resolve the employment issue."
"The report claims that the Member States have taken measures that are heading in the right direction, which is to say towards increased working time."
"Given that a majority of workers in France, Austria and Germany have demonstrated that they reject a move towards increased working time and funded pension provision, do we wish to settle the European debate on pensions without public involvement?"
"With my group's support, we are tabling amendments that seek to reflect these aspirations."
"In them, we of course oppose raising the statutory retirement age and extending the contributions period."
"We are also opposed to funded pension provision, which provides no guarantee of an income and undermines the principle of solidarity inherent in pay-as-you-go schemes."
"We propose that contributions be calculated taking into account how hard the work is and the number of dependent children."
"Finally, we propose studying new ways of financing legal pension schemes."
"The argument of increased life expectancy is used to broach the issue of funded pension schemes; this does little to mask the financial appetites of multinationals in favour of this option."
"There are other ways to resolve the issue of financing in the long term that are more viable and characterised by greater solidarity."
"We propose, for example, extending social security contributions to all revenue, with the amount adjusted depending on whether the companies are creating jobs or not."
"These proposals do not appear to me to be entirely irresponsible."
"In conclusion, I would say that faced with mounting criticism of the choices made in this field by Europe's Heads of State or Government, what matters now is to listen to the demands that people are making and not to go against them, unless we wish to see the people of Europe grow even more disaffected with the Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Andersson, first of all, thank you for the work of both the rapporteur and the Commission."
"I welcome the fact that we are gradually applying the open coordination method to pensions."
"It is not so much a debate as a beginning."
"I do not know what we should do in the long term with regard to the accessibility, financability and modernisation of pensions."
"The proposal offers, among other things, a number of guidelines."
"In my view, the benefit of the Commission proposal is that it gives a good insight into what is going on and that it contains a first set of measures."
"However, as I have already stated, they are long-term measures."
"Mr Cercas may well make a comment with regard to the next generation, but that is precisely the problem that we will be facing. In the short term, we are having to deal with a labour market that is silting up in many parts of Europe and the solution of getting people to work for longer is not effective in the short term."
"Mrs Ainardi has already pointed out that there are a number of problems in a number of Member States, including France and Austria."
"In the Netherlands, 20 000 people have taken to the streets in protest against the largely Liberal Christian-Democratic government that has thought out all kinds of measures to encourage the participation of the elderly in the labour market in the long term."
"For example, by cutting back on early retirement, the early retirement scheme (VUT), extended unemployment benefit (WW), general unemployment benefit and similar schemes."
"In this connection, it has, by the way, left no scope for circumventing these measures."
"This means that people are currently protesting against a government in the Netherlands that is intent on taking measures of this kind."
"As I stated before, 20 000 demonstrators have taken to the streets in protest."
"Short-term policy is the missing link and, in that sense, the report by Jan Andersson is, in fact, a shallow report for problems of this type."
"I am stating the facts as they are."
"The report is not a disaster."
"It is a first step."
"In the coming period, however, something should be added."
"And this will bring with it all kinds of problems."
"I agree on increasing the effective pensionable age, but, at the moment, we should just see how things pan out, and alternatives will therefore need to be developed to ensure that short-term and long-term policy are balanced out more effectively."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commissioner and, in particular, the rapporteur for his work on this issue."
"In one sense, we tend to forget what it was like at the end of the 19th century when the elderly, the sick or the unemployed had no protection whatsoever until a miserly amount of money was introduced in the late 1870s to try to give some protection to older people."
"Fortunately we, as a society, have developed in our attitude towards giving future protection to the elderly, those in need of pensions and the most vulnerable within our society."
"One thing that we have all recognised in the past is that we have not made proper provision for the future needs of changing demographics, a reducing workforce in certain cases and limits in taxation expenditure."
"We are now faced with what appears to be a sudden problem on account of the large population."
"But if you ask an anthropologist or anyone involved in any of the sciences, this was highlighted 15 years ago as an issue to be dealt with by 2015."
"It is only now that we are beginning to take action on it."
"In particular, I would point out that Mr Andersson has put forward a balanced proposal in his report."
"He has looked at creating solutions to the problems that we now face."
"In fairness to him - and I do not agree with everything that he says on most occasions - he has also brought forward short-term, medium-term and long-term priorities that must be carried out."
"In Ireland we have a system whereby we are now putting 1% of GDP towards our future pension requirements every single year."
"It gives a guarantee to those people who will need pensions in the future."
"One area we must look at is ensuring that the pension is set at a proper, reasonable standard of living to allow people to have independence and freedom of choice."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur warmly for this work that is partly his own and partly the work of others."
"This is why I should also like to extend a warm thank you to Mr Fatuzzo for his contribution."
"In my view, it is a little bit of a mixture of the best that the Italian and Swedish cultures have to offer."
"Milan meets Malmö, if you like."
"As far as I am concerned, this work should be kept more or less unchanged."
"It is extremely regrettable that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left should have tabled these amendments."
"I have to say, I have listened with great interest to Mrs Ainardi, who reminded me of Louis XVIII who returned after the revolution and of whom people said that he had learned nothing and forgotten everything."
"I find it even more deplorable that Mr Bouwman appears keen to associate himself with this statement."
"We are facing real problems in Europe in the area of pensions."
"Naturally, we could maintain the pension system, but the best way of eventually destroying it is to do what has been proposed in the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group: to act as if nothing is wrong, while the system does show up inadequacies."
"After all, when this system was agreed upon, the average lifespan was 63 years, two years under 65."
"Fortunately, the average lifespan is quite a bit longer now."
"In the light of this, it is unacceptable for us to say that we could carry on as we are for ever."
"Mr Andersson is pointing in a certain direction, and this direction receives our support."
"Pension schemes are slightly different in every country and cannot be compared, but the worst thing is that some people are behaving as some did on the Titanic who, when the ship was sinking, thought that nothing was wrong."
"This is dangerous."
"I hope that the majority of this Parliament - and I have every faith in them - want to distance themselves from attitudes of this kind and want to commit themselves to the people who really matter."
"After all, poor people will not gain in any way if there is no money left in the end."
"Mr President, I join with everyone else in congratulating Mr Andersson on the production of an excellent piece of work."
"I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for their joint report."
"It really does provide an excellent overview of this very important subject."
"I hope that you, Mr President, can pass on a request to DG I that maybe one of these days they could organise a daytime debate for an important social dossier such as this one."
"We are supposed to be building bridges back to the citizens."
"This is a subject that matters to many millions of citizens. It is a shame that it is tucked away in a night sitting once again."
"The Andersson report really underlines the need for both the employment strategy and the Lisbon strategy to begin to deliver in several important respects: continuing gross gender inequality in terms of access to and participation in the labour market is reflected in gross gender inequality in pension entitlement."
"Even if we achieve the Lisbon target of 60% for labour market participation by women, the target itself acknowledges the fact that women's participation will continue to be less than men's."
"We therefore need to consider flanking measures along the lines suggested in the report by, for example, promoting the individualisation of pension rights and urging Member States to guarantee continuity of membership of pension schemes during parental leave or leave to take care of children or other dependants."
"A second problem highlighted by Mr Andersson, and one that we really have to redouble our efforts to tackle, is the need to raise the effective retirement age, not the statutory retirement age."
"There is some confusion in certain quarters on that."
"There is now a widespread early retirement culture within the Union."
"Sustained long-term efforts will be needed to change attitudes and tackle that culture."
"But there are few signs that we are even beginning to make a start in doing that."
"The joint employment report from the Commission for 2002 reported that only four Member States have put in place fully-fledged national active ageing strategies."
"The same report showed that the efforts of most Member States to provide education and training to older age groups are still woefully inadequate."
"The Commission must, in its next round of recommendations examining the achievements of Member States against the set guidelines, make the strongest possible recommendations against Member States who continue to fail to deliver in these and other important respects."
"The final point of the report I should like to emphasise concerns atypical workers."
"Their insecurity in the labour market - and many of them are women - will be reflected again in continuing insecurity in their later years, in the decades ahead, unless something is done to lessen that insecurity."
"It is a terrible shame that several Member State governments - my own included - have set their hearts and minds against the proposed directive on temporary employment agency workers."
"The longer it is delayed the more the earlier directives on part-time and fixed-term working will be undermined, as temporary agency working becomes the favoured choice for employers for whom the word 'flexibility' means squeezing the maximum out of labour for the least possible reward."
"Temporary agency working would become an ever-growing bottom tier in a two-tier labour force."
"In the end the whole of European society would face the consequences."
"I hope even at this late stage that the governments concerned - including my own - might see sense and help us put in place a sensible piece of legislation to reinforce the point that flexibility can actually be a positive concept for both employers and workers."
"Mr President, pensions schemes, administered through common and universal public programmes, are acknowledged as a fundamental means of achieving social inclusion."
"Without pensions, benefits and other forms of social assistance, poverty levels in the European Union would exceed 40%."
"Any modernisation of state social security systems must, therefore, take this fact into account. This has not happened in most Member States introducing such reforms."
"The stubborn resistance of workers to measures threatening their fundamental rights in this regard is well-known. The cases of France, Portugal, Germany and Greece have already been mentioned here."
"In this report, however, not enough is done to avoid these positions, which lead to the impairment of rights and welfare cover."
"Hence the set of proposals we have tabled, of which I would like to highlight the following:"
"a reference to the growing difficulties faced by pension funds in the wake of the worldwide stock market slump, which provides ample proof that the growing risks of the financial market have an adverse effect on the adequacy and sustainability of funded pension provision;"
"a critique of the antisocial nature of most reforms recently implemented by certain Member States, which have reduced state pensions considerably and attempted to raise the retirement age;"
"a note on the importance of adopting strategies for reforming pension schemes at European and national levels, promoting full employment along with social rights which strengthen and reinvigorate state pension schemes by broadening their financial bases, by ensuring that employers comply with their financial obligations, and by enhancing pay-as-you-go mechanisms;"
"lastly, a rejection of all attempts aiming to weaken or replace state schemes based on the principles of pay-as-you-go and solidarity, pointing out that, in order to guarantee pension schemes in the long term, it is vital to broaden the scope of their eligibility criteria and investigate new ways of financing statutory pension schemes, in particular by extending welfare contributions to all financial returns and establishing modulation for companies on the basis of the number of jobs created."
"Mr President, I also congratulate the Commission and the Council on the quality of their joint report, and especially the rapporteur on his own powerful report on this key issue."
"I trust that Member States in particular will take note that the problem of adequate and sustainable pensions is a problem today, will be an even bigger problem tomorrow, and requires action now."
"I particularly commend the rapporteur on the way he has worked hard to absorb amendments from colleagues from different parties, who also care strongly about this issue."
"Indeed I am grateful that he has seen fit to accept five of mine: on defining the objective; to provide adequate and fair incomes to older people and prevent poverty in old age; on defining the gravity of the problem; on the importance of promoting pension portability; and, in particular, on the disgrace that certain EU institutions continue to discriminate against allowing older workers to apply for jobs - a point I have raised on several occasions with Commissioner Kinnock with, I regret to say, only bluster in response."
"Because the rapporteur has accepted so much it would probably be churlish of me to lament his non-acceptance of my amendment declaring that secure, inflation-proof pensions for public sector workers, such as Members of this Parliament, are seen as increasingly unfair by those in company schemes that depend on stock market performance in the real world."
"I believe we should show that we recognise this."
"It is, after all, the reality."
"Having said that, his report recognises much that is a problem."
"It also seeks to focus attention on what needs to be done."
"In the next 50 years the number of over-65s will double from 25% to perhaps 50% of the population."
"In rural areas, including large parts of my own constituency of the West Midlands, the percentage could be higher still."
"His report deserves support from across this House."
"He certainly has mine."
"Mr President, the key point that Mr Andersson made in his contribution tonight is the need to get the social and financial concerns in balance."
"Clearly there is a need for both."
"It seems to me that one of the key issues here, at least in relation to poverty in old age, relates to women."
"All the statistics show that because of intermittent work, breaks in their employment record, family care commitments etc. they by and large end up in a poorer situation than men."
"Add to that the fact that they also survive longer than men, and the result is greater numbers of older women than men after a certain age."
"There is a need for us to address the question of funding of pensions."
"As Mr Crowley has mentioned, in Ireland we have introduced a reserve fund where 1% of GDP is set aside each year, and there are some billions in this fund now; in fact there is so much money in it that people are beginning to fight over how and where it should be invested."
"Nevertheless it is an attempt to ensure that there is a fund there for the future."
"We are fortunate in that we have a demographic lag of about 20 to 25 years, so that the bulge that is hitting the rest of Europe at the moment will not hit Ireland for some time yet."
"Nevertheless we expect it will arrive."
"Another attempt to deal with this issue is the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, where individuals, with the assistance of their employer, can open an account and put money in it which will provide some pension funding for them at a certain point."
"The difficulty is that the financial institutions which are given responsibility for selling these products are in many cases resisting them because they cannot make enough money out of the categories of people that they are aimed at, mainly the lower income section of the workforce."
"There is a need to address that issue."
"The point I am making here is that there is no need for us to be unduly pessimistic providing we make the policy choices now about what we are going to face in the future."
"It is not enough for us to wring our hands, it is not enough for Member States, as Mr Hughes has pointed out, to oppose the temporary agency workers directive - which provides some degree of security for certain categories of workers - and then pretend that they are going to do something serious about pensions, when in fact they are undermining the possibility for many thousands of people to have sufficient contributions, even for a State pension."
"To conclude, there really is a need for some joined-up thinking in this area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"I would like to begin by saying that retirement, while still being a technical/legal and economic/actuarial issue, has become an issue of the greatest media interest and has won the status as a central issue within policy in general, and within social policy in particular."
"Back in 1950, the age of sixty was regarded as the threshold of old age; the age of 65 implied retirement from active working life, and not to have a will drawn up by the age of seventy would unquestionably have been considered recklessly irresponsible."
"We can conclude from this that the population of our current society, which has doubled by the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, includes many people of a very advanced age, who until recently were classified as 'old people', and those older people have a strong social image, they are real, they have active lives and have good reason to hope to continue living."
"Within this context, a long-term perspective is necessary in the field of pensions and, despite the fact that dealing with pensions and pension policy are essentially the responsibility of the Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the European contribution appears to be necessary, both in the exchange of best practices and in increasing consensus, and in the common regulation of certain aspects necessary in order to ensure the possibility of transferring pension rights of all types and their viability."
"Pension systems through public schemes linked to income - first pillar - through private professional schemes - second pillar - and individual retirement pension funds - third pillar - must offer Europeans the opportunities to maintain their standard of living following retirement."
"A system which prevents or hinders the free movement of people must therefore be excluded, as must the European citizens' fear of ageing or physical or psychological deterioration."
"In the face of the weight of the third pillar, fear must be alleviated and business interests excluded."
"The viability of the pension system must be guaranteed, and it must respond to changes in society and in the ways in which production is organised: the greater presence of women, an older active population and atypical forms of contract."
"Mr President, the proposals contained in this report simply relay the retrograde policy pursued by all of the European Union's Member States on pensions."
"In seeking to increase the effective retirement age, in wishing to extend time at work, in proposing even to replace pay-as-you-go pension schemes with funded pension provision, the rapporteur vindicates and harmonises the attacks on workers."
"The rapporteur is cynical enough to observe that the increase in the number of pensioners and their increased life expectancy will put considerable pressure on pay-as-you-go pension schemes."
"Should we therefore wish for lower life expectancy and for a fall in the number of pensioners so as to save money?"
"If the fruits of productivity were distributed differently, with a little less being given to employers and the wealthiest members of society so as to enable workers who have spent their lives making them rich to grow old with dignity, there would be no problem in providing an increasing number of pensioners with a proper pension."
"However, your economy does not serve to satisfy the needs of a majority as best possible, but to make a minority rich more effectively."
"Mr President, the European Union considers that pensions are yet another expense which needs to be cut back within the framework of the financial discipline imposed by the Stability Pact and is indifferent to the needs of those who have retired from work."
"On the pretext of the ageing population, it is promoting an increase in the retirement age, an extension of working life, cutbacks in pensions, the dissociation of pensions and wages and increased financial contributions by workers."
"At the same time, the European Union and the Member States, with the recent reforms, are using pensions to support the profitability of big business."
"They are reducing employer benefits and offering them the resources and reserves of the pension funds, promoting the spread of professional pension funds and forcing workers to rely on private insurance schemes, thereby exposing their pensions to the risks inherent in the financial markets."
"We support a different policy, where pensions will respond to modern social needs."
"We and the workers are calling for a reduction in the retirement age and working life, for pension funds to be financed from the national budget and for an increase in employers' contributions, coupled with a reduction in employees' contributions."
"This sort of social insurance system can only be imposed by the workers, by fighting against the choices of big business and the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow."
". Mr President, after more than six years of negotiation the Council has finally reached a compromise on energy taxation."
"Because the compromise text significantly modifies the Commission's 1997 proposal, the Commission has asked the Council to reconsult Parliament."
"I am convinced that Parliament and the Commission share the same analysis: all of us would have preferred a more ambitious compromise, especially as far as the approximation of tax rates is concerned."
"This is mainly due to the decision-making process and the unanimity requirements in the Council."
"Co-decision and qualified majority voting would undoubtedly have led to a better result for the internal market."
"However, I am very happy to see that Parliament's committees responsible for the analysis of the text - the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy - have supported the compromise."
"This future directive remains a positive step, both for the internal market and for sustainable development policies."
"To that extent, nothing has changed in comparison with the rapporteur's view on the initial proposal in the 1998/1999 session."
"As you may remember, Mr President, it was said then that the proposal was 'modest but useful'."
"Now I should like to thank Parliament and the rapporteurs, Mr Jonckheer and Mr Caudron, for their speedy examination of the text."
"It is of crucial importance that the opinion of Parliament be adopted as soon as possible, so as to allow the directive to enter into force on the scheduled date, 1 January 2004."
"I will reply at the end of the debate giving the Commission's opinion on some of the amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you yourself underlined, this proposal goes back a long way."
"I will not go back over its entire history, but I would like to stress, in connection with what you have just said, that in 1999 the European Parliament adopted a report, for which Mr Pat Cox was the rapporteur, which improved the Commission's proposal, in particular in three respects: Parliament asked for an increase in all of the minimum rates stated in the Commission's proposal; it also called for these minima to be index-linked, and finally, it called for the number of derogations and exemptions to be reduced."
"As you yourself pointed out, we have had to wait four years for the Council to reach an agreement and for Parliament to be re-consulted."
"In general, the report seeks to support the compromise struck in the Council - acting, as you said, under the constraint of unanimity - despite the text's serious shortcomings, the Council of Ministers not having in fact taken on board the proposals made in the Cox report in 1999."
"I should like to focus on two points amongst many where the position adopted by the Council appears to us to be weak."
"Firstly, the minimum rates set by the Council to be applied from 1 January 2004 are, almost without exception, lower than those proposed by the Commission in 1997 and by the European Parliament in 1999."
"Such a step backwards stands in flagrant contradiction to the undertaking given by the Council, and in particular the European Council, to provide instruments that seek to break the link between economic growth and energy consumption."
"The second issue that we have addressed is that of derogations and exemptions."
"The text of the directive is littered with them."
"The Council has added an annex with a virtual shopping list of individual exemptions and derogations so that each of the 15 Member States can find what they want in the list and can therefore agree to the text."
"Having referred to the position adopted by Parliament in 1999 and taken into consideration new political material such as the Gothenburg European Council's declaration in favour of a Sustainable Development Strategy, as rapporteur I therefore proposed to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that we should reinforce Council's position on certain points, while retaining a moderate stance bearing in mind the different political sensitivities."
"In particular, I proposed bringing forward the second step of motor fuel taxation and the revision of tax rates by two years."
"I also proposed a sunset clause for all derogations, whereby exemptions and derogations could only be maintained if the Council explicitly so decided."
"Finally, I proposed making it mandatory to support renewable sources of energy."
"In principle all renewable sources of energy should be fully exempt."
"I confess that it came as an unpleasant surprise when all of the amendments were rejected by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - and I do not share your approval, Commissioner."
"It is true that in many cases they were rejected by a majority of one single vote and that not all Members of the committee were present."
"I therefore think that the logical step for me, as rapporteur, is to re-table these amendments in the plenary."
"In addition, Commissioner, I would draw your attention to Amendment No 2, tabled by Mrs Kauppi and adopted by the committee."
"If it were to be confirmed in the plenary it would mean that Parliament was denying the very timeliness of this proposal for a directive because we recently adopted a directive on emissions trading."
"In conclusion, I hope that Parliament's vote in September 2003 does not represent a retreat from its 1999 position, although this was adopted, it is true, during a different term of office."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my task this evening is a simple one: it is to give you an account of the unanimous votes in the ITRE Committee in favour of my report for opinion and all of my amendments, apart from one, in relation to the Council's common position of 3 April 2003."
"As everyone has said, the Council took a great deal of time to reach this agreement, since the Commission's initial proposal dates back to 1997 and Mr Pat Cox's report to 1999."
"Despite this, we agreed to play ball and treat this as a matter of urgency given that it is clearly in the general European interest to do so."
"Although there are many areas with which I and my fellow Members are dissatisfied, as rapporteur, so as not to threaten the agreement in the Council, I only proposed amendments that enhance that agreement."
"Although the agreement reached by the Council does not go as far as the Commission's 1997 proposal or the European Parliament's vote in 1999, it still remains a first step, in my view and that of my fellow Members, towards establishing a common framework for taxation in Europe."
"The amendments adopted by unanimity improve it by providing for time limits for exemptions, so that the exemptions do not become the rule; by specifying units of measurement and by reinforcing the political signal in favour of biofuels."
"I dare to hope therefore, ladies and gentlemen, that when Mr Jonckheer's report is put to the vote tomorrow the plenary will confirm an agreement that is for the time being, admittedly, minimalist, by seeing it as part of an ongoing process to serve the interests of the environment in Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Jonckheer for his excellent work and I think the directive, as it was approved in the committee, is very good."
"In my opinion, it is a good and positive sign that an attempt is being made to harmonise the environmental point of view with healthy competition in the energy markets."
"Common minimal levels of energy taxation are needed and the polluter pays principle is important, as long as we remember to give attention to the effects on competition and employment."
"Furthermore, emissions trading, which is beginning to be implemented, is an important means of regulation, and we can therefore also avoid regulation overlapping with it, as would be the case with taxation of energy products and the various exemptions proposed thereto."
"In the matter of energy taxation, in general renewable natural resources should be treated favourably, and in the same way there should be tax relief on new fuels that are particularly environmentally friendly."
"In this way we can use financial incentives to steer both consumers and industry in the direction of environmentally friendly energy use."
"The Commission proposal on tax incentives with regard to certain biofuels is worthy of our firm support."
"Although this directive does not directly deal with hydrogen, for example, it is a good, and will in the future be, an important energy source that in time could clearly replace oil for transport in particular."
"It is obviously worth supporting hydrogen in matters of taxation."
"We have to remember, however, that any form of taxation that deviates from neutral taxation has an impact on market activity and for that reason any such support measures as these should be temporary and exceptional in nature, in order to promote new fuels and production methods."
"The troubled aviation industry has enjoyed tax exemptions on air fuel for a long time."
"Taxation in this area is a problematic issue because aircraft can choose fairly freely where to refuel."
"If a tax were imposed on air fuel within the EU but not outside it, this would lead to refuelling outside the Union."
"That is why the international agreement on the tax-exempt status of air fuels should be respected."
"The Member States have a right they must not lose to decide themselves on taxes on fuels for local use."
"These fuels, such as peat, for example, which is important in my country, are of no importance to a viable internal market, but at local level they may well be very important and necessary sources of energy and employment."
"In Finland and the other Nordic countries taxes on energy are already widely applied, so these countries would have no problem with even shorter periods of transition."
"I, however, have yielded to the will of the majority in my group."
"My group is not in favour of a shorter timescale, as Mr Jonckheer has proposed."
"In other words, I personally would have been prepared to go further in this."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, and I share his disappointment on the minimum solution."
"Commissioner Bolkestein also made it very clear that this minimum solution is a small breakthrough, but that the European Union has not actually succeeded in a consistent approach to energy taxation."
"This consistent approach remains coherent though, and after the experience with fiscal coordination we can almost be grateful because once again we had to experience how much the unanimity rule in fiscal decision-making hampers the functioning of the internal market."
"It is extremely regrettable that the fourth Environment Action Programme, which envisaged that sustainable development and economy could be stimulated not only by environmental regulation but also by tax regulation, could not be implemented, and so this directive's tale of woe goes further back than just 1999."
"Furthermore, the directive also has the defects - as has already been said - of low minimum rates, non-indexation of minimum rates and also the difficulty of derogations."
"We have already debated the issue of derogations on several occasions in this House."
"I believe that we have actually always agreed that there have to be derogations for energy intensive enterprises, but that these derogations should at least incorporate conditions enabling the situation to be tackled."
"This has not happened, and so this directive is bound soon to be followed by another."
"What is positive is that this directive is not only a framework for the taxation of all types of energy, including electricity, but that at the same time it also supports the promotion of renewable sources of energy and thereby will surely be able to give additional impetus to further develop these renewable sources of energy."
"That is a good thing, because we know that it is renewable energy that gives not only Europe, but also world civilisation, a chance, since we all profit from the tax incentives for using environmentally friendly forms of energy."
"Actual primary energy generally costs nothing, and furthermore it can be obtained and converted where energy consumption takes place."
"Thus the steering effect of tax incentives for energy use is an important addition to the EU Environmental policy and, I believe, also to emissions trading."
"Rather than seeing this as a contradiction, here too, I see it as adding to the instruments that steer our European economies and lives towards sustainable development."
"It is also to be welcomed that this directive will make possible the final implementation of measures for preferential tax treatment for biofuels, on which we have already agreed, but the regulation of which was, of course, coupled to general taxation."
"I can also see that the goals that we set can be achieved."
"I would just like to emphasise once again that in the past many Member States have taken advantage of the revenue effect of environmental taxes, in particular, energy taxes."
"I welcome the fact that in the meantime we can at least have the possibility of reaching a European agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work."
"I share his view that the proposal is a small step in the right direction."
"Mr Cox wrote a similar report as long ago as 1999."
"If the Council had followed his directions, the basic conditions would have been different now."
"Just as the Commissioner says, the long period required for discussing this issue shows how important it is for us to obtain a sensible decision-making procedure."
"Today's environmental problems must be seen in a pan-European perspective."
"The EU is a unique tool for creating common environmental rules."
"The EU's environmental policy must be developed by means of more stringent minimum rules and environmental charges."
"It must be possible to take decisions on such rules and charges by qualified majority voting."
"As is well known, this is an extremely sensitive issue."
"Some of my fellow MEPs visibly shake when EU taxes are mentioned."
"I nonetheless hope that the Intergovernmental Conference can devise solutions when it comes to energy and environmental taxes, together with a robust decision-making system."
"The EU's and the Member States' task in the energy sphere is to formulate requirements concerning safety and the environment, to check that the requirements are being complied with and to promote research and development in the energy sphere, aimed at replacing fossil-based energy production with environmentally friendly energy sources."
"We should nonetheless be very careful that, with taxes as a weapon, we do not seriously reduce competition in the energy sphere."
"A rational energy policy is best promoted through free trade and the free production of energy."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will support most of the amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jonckheer, ladies and gentlemen, last week, I was in Moscow with a delegation of this Parliament, where we tried to convince the Russian Parliament, the Duma, of the need to sign, as well as implement, the Kyoto Protocol, which was no mean feat."
"We are asking the Russians to make an effort to combat climate change and environmental pollution."
"I personally experienced the need for this in the form of a serious chest irritation during my stay in Moscow."
"Even in Russia, a clean environment has a price tag, despite the pledges of financial support and cooperation."
"To bring this need to attention in Moscow is all the more difficult, given the fact that we in the European Union are already so reluctant to pay a price for a better environment."
"The Council's draft directive for energy taxation is a striking example of the lack of unanimity in making efforts to bring about a better environment."
"An environmental tax on energy has been the subject of discussion and negotiation for more than ten years."
"Only in the past six months, under Greek Presidency, did it seem possible to agree on a compromise text."
"However, it became a compromise that left something to be desired."
"My first observation is that the Council is still lacking the vision and audacity to take decisive action and move the tax pressure from the area of labour to environmental pollution."
"In this way, employment can be promoted and environmental pollution given a real price."
"A second point of criticism concerns the many interests of the Member States and industries which are taken into account in the proposal."
"As a result, the proposal contains too many exceptions and exemptions."
"As such, the amendments that aim to restrict the conditions for exceptions receive my support."
"I should like to bring to your attention a few other matters."
"First of all, I should like to argue in favour of biofuels being made exempt from energy taxation."
"In that way, the development of these clean fuels is given a fair chance."
"It would be quite ludicrous to grant subsidies to promote biofuels with one hand and levy taxes on these fuels with the other."
"Secondly, I should like to point out that it is important for the proposal on emissions trading to be taken into consideration."
"Both instruments can co-exist and complement each other."
"I should like to warn the Council to ensure that the directives do not overlap during implementation."
"Finally, in his report, the rapporteur argues in favour of abolishing the unanimity rule where tax matters are concerned."
"Although I consider energy taxation to be a valuable instrument for reasons of content, I cannot share the view on the unanimity rule."
"This is why I will not be supporting Amendment No 13 although I support the rest of Mr Jonckheer's report."
"The idea of energy taxation as a supplement to the agreements that have been reached with regard to emissions trading has been mooted before."
"It is time we were serious about its implementation."
"Mr President, the matter now before us has been an awkward one for the Council."
"Nevertheless, the long period of time during which the Council has considered the matter - one lasting more than five years - has been a disappointment."
"Now is the time to put the disappointment to one side; making headway in the debate on the directive is the next step in an inevitable direction."
"I am happy to note that it is just this sort of practical approach that we also see in the report drawn up by Parliament's rapporteur."
"The Council has declared a commitment to adopt instruments to be able to decouple economic growth from energy consumption."
"The Commission has also committed itself to such aims, and so has Parliament."
"In principle it is therefore not an obstacle to significant change."
"In practice it is sorely needed."
"The directive now up for discussion offers an opportunity for this and it is our responsibility to implement it soon."
"In the integrated European economy the solution must be more coherent than ever."
"While energy taxation satisfies the parliamentary needs of Member States, at the same time it provides the means to lighten taxation on labour and employment and is an effective and precise tool for guidance in what is, ecologically speaking, the right direction."
"Taxation on energy products is the link that has long been missing which ties all the small parts of sustainable development together."
"I would furthermore like to raise the matter of the connection between energy taxation and the Directive on emissions trading that was recently completed."
"Independent studies show that responding to the challenge of climate change will be most favourable in overall financial terms if the reduction for sectors outside the emissions trading scheme is set at the right level."
"Cuts across the board will not bring that about: we need a comprehensive energy taxation system."
"We have to ensure that each branch of industry falls within the ambit of either energy taxation or emissions trading."
"That way, every company, through taxation, will be looking at a maximum price that is the equivalent of the marginal cost to society."
"Europe needs an ambitious energy taxation system very quickly."
"It would seem that the Commission and Parliament are to shoulder the responsibility for establishing one."
"Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0062/2003 B5-0277/2003) by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the transfer of personal data by airlines in the case of transatlantic flights."
". Mr President, as I said to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on 9 September 2003, and in accordance with the messages I received from Members of Parliament on that occasion, the Commission is pursuing its negotiations with the American authorities which receive passenger name record data transferred from the European Union with a view to obtaining improved undertakings on four major issues."
"First, I will touch upon purpose limitation."
"So far, the United States has refused to limit its use of passenger name record data to the fight against terrorism."
"The Americans also want to cover other serious domestic criminal offences."
"So far, they have not been prepared to further narrow these down."
"Second, as far as the scope of the data required is concerned, the United States requires 39 different PNR elements, which it is hard to regard as necessary for or proportionate to the purpose."
"The Commission is seeking a reduction in the list of 39 data elements from the United States."
"Thirdly, the data storage periods are still far too long."
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has stressed that they last six to seven years."
"Fourth, American undertakings are insufficiently legally-binding, since the available extra-judicial redress mechanisms are not fully independent."
"Therefore we must insist that rights are, to the greatest possible extent, legally-binding and thus actionable before American courts."
"Currently, we are working with the target date of Christmas 2003, the date that I set when I last spoke to the LIBE Committee."
"Ideally, an adequacy decision should be well on track by that time."
"An adequacy decision will only be possible, however, if the United States is ready to improve significantly its undertakings."
"I must be frank with the House and say that I am not confident that we shall be able to secure the necessary significant improvements in order for the Commission to be able to make an adequacy finding."
"However, progress in the United States' commitments is in any case necessary for any kind of solution, whatever its legal form - be it an adequacy finding or, if supported by the European Parliament, a bilateral international agreement."
"The most recent step in our negotiations with the United States was the meeting which I held yesterday with Under Secretary Asa Hutchinson of the US Department of Homeland Security - he is the number two person in that department."
"That was a useful meeting in which we discussed all the main issues and agreed to put our officials to work to make further efforts to find a solution in the coming weeks."
"When I am in Washington in mid-October I expect to meet with senior Homeland Security officials, including, hopefully, Secretary Tom Ridge."
"I emphasised to Mr Hutchinson yesterday the urgency of finding a solution - and of course I also referred to the serious concern with which PNR transfers are viewed in this Parliament."
"I find it difficult to accept any remark that the Commission is tolerating the situation and not doing its job as Guardian of the Treaties."
"As far as the Data Protection Directive is concerned, applying the law is a job for the Member States and their data protection authorities."
"The Commission's immediate role is to ensure that it is the Member States that respect the directive, not the airlines."
"But the problem, in any case, is not one that we can solve via purely intra-European means."
"We have a conflict of laws with the United States and that is the heart of the matter."
"In my talks with the United States authorities, I hope to be firm."
"But being entirely inflexible on the European side will not necessarily obtain more flexibility from our counterparts."
"Regarding passenger consent, which was mentioned by some Members as a possible way out - at least in the short term - this would not, in our view, constitute a legally-secure, longer-term solution."
"First, making consent unambiguous would prove very burdensome in practice."
"Second, the result would be a transfer of data that - despite being legal in the EU - would still lack any significant protection on the American side."
"Therefore, securing the best possible undertakings from the United States on the way in which they will treat the data collected from EU citizens is much to be preferred."
"The oral question submitted by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak also refers to what should happen if an adequacy finding cannot be reached by the end of the year."
"She proposes to stop the data transfers that are not in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination, prior informed consent and an efficient appeals procedure, and to begin immediate negotiations on an international agreement with the United States."
"These measures reflect to some extent the options for possible courses of action that I outlined in my meeting with the LIBE Committee earlier this month."
"However, as I stressed then, we should be very prudent not to shoot ourselves in the foot."
"Enforcement action may be superficially attractive, but it is not clear that its consequences would be those that we seek."
"Therefore, let us cross that bridge when we come to it."
"Political judgments will have to be exercised at the right moment."
"It is clear that the course we shall follow will fully involve the Parliament and the Council."
"I am sure we can all agree on the need to unite to combat terrorism."
"But we equally agree on the need to avoid security concerns becoming an excuse for dismantling our civil rights and liberties."
"I should like to assure the House that the Commission will continue to devote its unstinting efforts to finding an agreed solution with the United States on this important but also very delicate issue."
"The solution needs to be found as a matter of urgency, and must respect the law on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a number of key dates have been mentioned repeatedly in this affair."
"The first is, without a doubt, 5 March 2003, when the United States asked airlines operating between the United States and Europe to make available all the data relating to passengers: absolutely all the data, not just, as had been the case thus far, the data necessary for air transport agreements."
"The second date is 15 March 2003."
"Just a week later, with timing worthy of an even greater cause, Parliament adopted the resolution calling for enforcement of the 1995 directive and the 1989 regulation on the protection of privacy."
"The third date is 23 September, today: six months after the adoption of the resolution, it would appear that nothing has changed; the United States has not responded to the Commission's demands."
"We might ask whether the Americans are deaf or whether it is the Commission that is unable to find the rights words to get through to them."
"Thus, still today, travellers to the United States find themselves asked, in addition to the usual general questions, about their religion, their taste in food, where they last went on holiday and their close and distant relatives."
"That is certainly going too far."
"It is right that the Commission should raise its voice, that Parliament should call for more resolute endeavours such as an international agreement, perhaps, as proposed by the resolution."
"It would, however, seem appropriate to mention another date too: 11 September 2001."
"As we all remember, it was then that strict controls started to be enforced."
"Mindful of that appalling incident, I feel that perhaps we ought to be just a little more patient and realise that, behind what is certainly an annoying breach of confidentiality, there is still a great deal of fear."
"In any case, as the Commissioner said, a little flexibility might facilitate dialogue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current situation is clearly unlawful."
"There is no legal basis for giving the US authorities direct, unfiltered access to the personal data of European passengers and it is contrary to Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; it is contrary to the Community provisions on the protection of personal data; it is contrary to the Community Computer Reservations Systems Regulation."
"Part of the responsibility for this unlawful situation lies with the European Commission, for the US legislation requiring the disclosure of this information dates back to November 2001 and was updated in May 2002, while the system did not enter into force until March 2003."
"In the meantime, the Commission failed to inform Parliament of any of this and negotiated at senior-official level with the United States to achieve the joint statement of 18 February 2003 which, in practice, allowed the US authorities indiscriminate access to the personal data of European citizens collected by airlines for completely different purposes, even suggesting that national control authorities should not take action against airlines complying with the United States' requests."
"Only the firm reaction of the European Parliament and said control authorities induced the Commission, at last, to acknowledge that the conditions of adequate protection required by Article 25 of the directive were not being met as regards the transmission of data collected in the Union."
"I would, however, point out that, in the case of Italy, the ban by the control authority on access to data collected by the company, Alitalia, has not met with negative reactions or sanctions from the United States authorities."
"The Commission must, therefore, make more vigorous endeavours to achieve a genuine international agreement with the United States as soon as possible which regulates the matter on the basis of fundamental principles: respect for the principle of reciprocity, on the basis of which, if the Union gives US citizens the same rights as its own citizens, then the United States must do the same for European citizens; respect for the principle of proportionality; respect for the principle of informed consent and the right of the person concerned to appeal to an independent authority or judge."
"In the meantime, pending the achievement of a satisfactory agreement, a situation of legality must be restored and access to data which violates Community law must be banned."
"In future, then, a centralised system will have to be established at European level for the electronic collection of data relating to flight reservations, containing adequate filters which ensure that only data which may be lawfully disclosed is transmitted to third parties, with due regard for the fundamental rights of the European citizens which we, Parliament and the Commission, are under obligation to protect, not least against terrorism."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to pursue in greater depth the news to which Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has already referred."
"It is about the airline company Jet Blue that recently had the dubious honour of being the first American airline company to be able to provide data about its airline passengers to the Pentagon."
"The latter had requested this information so as to be able to make a risk assessment of passengers based on the CAPS II programme."
"When this piece of information was leaked, a huge outpouring of indignation in the United States ensued."
"Apologies were made and the data tap was turned off immediately."
"Especially serious was the fact that passengers had not been previously informed of the violation of their privacy, but the wrath of public opinion was also directed at the very fact of registration on a massive scale."
"As already stated, the influential UCLA, the American Civil Liberties Association, qualified this as 'a highly un-American system' and condemned the fact that, in this way, every passenger is turned into a suspect."
"I am giving this account of American indignation to press home to the Commissioner that he should not be fixated on striking a compromise between us and Minister Rich and company in the current negotiations with the United States, because the playing field is much wider and it is up to us to make it wider still."
"Apparently, the American public does not deem the actions and measures viable, and we must therefore also raise our objections."
"Commissioner, I should like to ask you to try out an alternative route using an alternative strategy."
"You have easy access to the Anglo-Saxon press, and I therefore count on your written powers of persuasion, via American public opinion, to put the administration effectively under pressure."
"Consider it to be a kind of hearts and minds campaign."
"What are our specific problems?"
"It would be useful to clarify this, because I think that we will find a ready audience in this respect, also among the public in the USA."
"Mr President, the second point that I should like to bring to your attention is the proposals that are circulating to develop a passport with advanced electronic chips in which biometric data, including somebody's past travelling history, can be stored."
"If this travelling history is stored on this chip and somebody travels to America, then Bush will still have unfettered access to the information which is the subject of our bickering."
"My question to the Commission is therefore: how can we ensure that we are not fighting a rearguard action today?"
"How much progress has been made with the discussion about these passports, and are you considering how this might affect the privacy of our citizens?"
"This is, after all, how we can avoid being faced again with faits accomplis in a year's time and being indignant on a massive scale."
"Mr President, Commissioner, flexibility is highly appropriate in negotiations but highly inappropriate when it comes to respect for the law."
"Article 2 of Regulation 22/99 bans the disclosure to third parties which are not party to a transaction of personal information on a passenger without the passenger's consent."
"Commissioner, you stated that responsibility for enforcing legislation lies with the Member States."
"This is true where directives are concerned but not when it comes to regulations."
"You are vested with all the necessary authority to intervene and ensure that the law is enforced, under Article 11, which states that the Commission, when appealed to or acting on its own initiative, is to instigate proceedings in order to stop all violation of the provisions of the regulation."
"Do we want to require respect for the law when that would actually be counterproductive?"
"I believe, first and foremost, that where there is a law, it must be respected, and that a condition of any reform - even reform of an international agreement - is compliance with procedure."
"Commissioner, you would acquire greater clout in international negotiations if the Commission were to demand respect for the law without delay, for it has the power to do so as well as the Member States."
"The timeframe is not for us to decide: it is - and, in my opinion, should be - the timeframe laid down by Article 232 of the Treaty, which stipulates a period of two months from our request for action."
"If no action is taken, we have two months in which to appeal to the Court of Justice."
"Mr President, the thirty-nine data elements that we have been dealing with today can be divided into three categories. Firstly, superfluous data, the storing of which has already - in the GDR and elsewhere - caused intelligence services and whole states to collapse."
"In the interests of the fight against terrorism this data should not be saved."
"Secondly, useful data which would, on entry, be removed anyway."
"This data can be used in an appropriate and legal manner."
"Thirdly, however, there is sensitive data, on which we need precise rules, and which must either not be recorded, saved and passed on at all, or it must at least be deleted after a deadline, after the person leaves the USA."
"Although we are all vehement advocates of the fight against terrorism, terrorism cannot be fought with anarchy, but rather in two ways."
"Firstly on the basis of the law, and this - rather than arbitrariness - we should step up."
"I regret to say that at the moment in transatlantic relations there is arbitrariness regarding these questions of data, and an absence of any legal basis."
"Secondly we can fight international terrorism only on the basis of trust between the USA and Europe, trust that was damaged through both sides apportioning blame and must be re-established."
"Trust can only arise when genuinely transparent rules are created, ones that the public can understand, otherwise we will fuel mistrust of both the USA and the European Union itself."
"Commissioner, I do not think that we can wait until international rules are in place, nor can we rely on the current fifteen and future twenty-five Member States implementing the law."
"It is much more a fluke that the Commission, with you as a spokesman for the European Union, which will soon have more inhabitants than the USA and Russia together and must be a partner of the USA, is acting on this important issue, but intentionally and on the basis of the law."
"Therefore, Mr President, I would like to call out to the Commission: be tough in your conduct of the negotiations, Mr Bolkestein!"
"The debate is closed."
"I would remind the House that the vote on possible motions for resolution will take place on Thursday 9 October in Brussels."
"The next item is the report (A5-0287/2003) by Mrs Villiers, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on investment services and regulated markets, and amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/12/EC (COM (2002) 625 - C5-0586/2002 - 2002/0269(COD))."
". Mr President, I begin by thanking the rapporteur for her report."
"It certainly improves the Commission's text in some places, while ensuring that the goals of high investor protection and market efficiency are adequately respected."
"We know it was a very difficult debate, but Parliament has demonstrated a great willingness to compromise and find a workable solution."
"Let me also pay tribute to the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, who, true to her word, has helped drive forward on time the financial services action plan."
"In particular, we welcome the efforts of the rapporteur in reaching a compromise on two major points."
"Firstly, as you know, pre-trade transparency was one of the principles of the Commission's proposal, in order to ensure market efficiency and investor protection."
"We are very pleased that the principle is kept in the proposal, but it has been adapted in a pragmatic way."
"Secondly, we appreciate the work carried out on the suitability test - Article 18."
"I consider this to be a good basis for working out a solution that is adapted to the specificities of each type of service and it will help to complete our proposal in this respect."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur."
"The road has been long and, in parts, an arduous one, but we have now found a compromise that reflects the whole House, that reflects opinion, and we should do our best to ensure that, in this week's vote, the compromise as such is no longer challenged, but that there are only editorial changes to be made."
"We all accept that in future there will be competition between the different trading platforms, competition between stock markets and banks."
"On the other hand, we cannot disregard specific criteria, for example, that in competition the same conditions apply to banks as do to markets."
"What that means is that, if I take markets as sources of prices - of meaningful market prices - then this cannot be allowed to lead to liquidity being damaged in future and markets no longer being meaningful."
"As for transparency, we must ensure that the market is transparent for all as a place where prices emerge, and that everyone can understand how prices evolve there."
"Supply and demand must be maintained."
"This is what our laborious discussions achieved, and also for pre-trade transparency."
"We gave some points to the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and we will listen attentively to what advice the CESR gives us."
"I see it as crucial that there are no winners and no losers in this discussion."
"Neither the City of London nor any other financial centre in Europe has won."
"Also we cannot say that the markets or the investment houses should have won, but everyone should be in this market together in the future, in order then to attract customers with the best offer."
"From a German point of view it is also important for me that the market structure should take national factors into account."
"I would, therefore, also ask that you give broad support to the two amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats so that small dealers in Germany are still protected."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the report we are debating concerns one of the most central issues of the economic unification of Europe, the unification of the financial markets."
"The principle that a large financial market offers greater liquidity and greater economic weight is well known."
"It can also offer greater competitiveness and, consequently, better prices to transacting parties."
"In this way, it encourages investors and investments and an increase in investments has an obvious economic importance on which we all agree."
"Our group is aiming for the maximum possible employment which can be created by increasing investments."
"The Commission proposal is based on the unification of the financial markets, on the so-called 'European passport'; in other words, it offers investment banks the right to develop their activities in all 15 Member States, provided they comply with the rules of approval in just one Member State rather than in 15."
"But the Commission has complemented its proposal with the thought that, if a financial market really is to be able to operate without frontiers, the transacting parties must feel the same security wherever they place their money in Europe."
"This thought has given rise to regulatory rules common to everyone, which the Commission is also introducing in connection with the exercise of activities in a fair and transparent manner, the integrity of the market and the rights of investors to proper, honest treatment by banks and financiers."
"Rules always regulate conflicting interests."
"The interests are fluid at the moment, because technology and the concentration of banking capital in large enterprises are creating new conditions, conditions under which banks are turning into stock exchanges with internal transactions and the stock exchanges are turning from infrastructures into companies."
"Thus, there is a risk of multiple fragmentation of the market which the directive, in one of its most controversial provisions, is trying to overcome, by forcing investment banks to communicate with the market transparently and before and after their commercial transactions are closed."
"Generally speaking, the Commission proposal has again struck a good balance between the various interests and technological developments."
"The debate and the amendments by the Committee on Economic Affairs in general reinforce the Commission's work, thanks to the huge contribution by the rapporteur, whom I want to congratulate on her endeavour and her conciliatory approach."
"I hope that this conciliatory approach will prevail until the end and that the amendments proposed by our group will be supported, so that the report can be approved by a large majority."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur on an exceptional piece of work."
"She has managed to piece together a sustainable compromise against all the odds."
"At present, the stock exchanges within the EU have a near monopoly on dealing in securities, especially in certain national markets."
"Now, we are obtaining competition and freedom of choice and, Mr Katiforis, sound protection of investors."
"I want briefly to comment on the two sensitive articles, namely Articles 18 and 25."
"Where Article 18 is concerned, we think it important that the suitability test be reserved for services where advice is given and not, for example, Internet-based dealing in securities."
"These clients have consciously chosen a brokerage service in which they will have no need to pay for professional advice."
"That would just be more expensive."
"We shall therefore vote in favour of the committee's Amendments Nos 53, 54 and 55."
"The most discussed article in the proposal is Article 25, which deals with the internalisation of trade and the publication of price information prior to transactions that take place outside the regulated markets or MTF platform."
"We view this as rather risky."
"It would reduce liquidity on the market and increase costs."
"There has not been sufficient political support for the removal of this article, but we think that the committee's Amendments Nos 33, 86, 87, 88 and 89 should remove the negative effects that the proposed rules on the publication of prices would have on the market."
"Finally, I should like to ask why we are debating as important a proposal as this so late in the evening."
"Mr President, the new directive on investment services seeks to order competition between three major structures: exchanges, the Internet and companies using internalisation."
"Competition between them over processing transactions will intensify as the European financial market becomes more integrated."
"Everyone knows that the City of London, which is also an aircraft carrier for American investment banks, has a strong lead where internalisation is concerned."
"Other companies such as Deutsche Bank or ABN-AMRO are launching out into the trade with ambitious business plans."
"I observe that in carrying out our task as legislators we have singularly lacked a sound economic analysis clarifying the nature of the competition entered into and its implications."
"For example, do we want the small European markets stretching from the South to the East to be piloted by a handful of global players in London?"
"In this House we are accountable to the general interest and not the interests of individual countries."
"That is why we have supported two main principles: quality of information and fair competition."
"Businesses that use internalisation harness huge resources, but they do not form the market."
"They manipulate it but they need it, which is why pre-trade transparency is crucial to the quality of price formation, in particular to prevent volatility, speculation and insider dealing."
"The Commission proposal applied this principle of pre-trade transparency that Mrs Villiers initially wished to abolish."
"Later she accepted it."
"She has shown great professionalism, it has to be acknowledged."
"She has given ground, but a large number of traps and mines were adopted in the committee on her initiative that drain this requirement for transparency of much of its meaning and create legal uncertainty."
"This applies to the definition of businesses practising internalisation, bonds and the size of orders, the exemption for eligible counterparties and the notion of price improvement."
"As it stands, the report that was adopted proposes a system of regulation that is inferior to that enjoyed by the United States."
"That is why we have requested a number of separate votes so as to remove passages that we feel are harmful."
"Our aim is not to conclude this at first reading at any price nor simply to seek a compromise between the various interests, but to adopt a resolution that really does serve the common good."
"Mr President, confrontation lay at the very root of this report because of two different philosophies."
"The first considered that investment firms - businesses practising internalisation - should be authorised to forge a strictly bilateral relationship with their clients, which had the disadvantage of not enabling these clients to benefit from the best possible price on the market, or even to learn what that best price was, or even quite simply to ensure price formation, which can only emerge from a general confrontation of bids and offers."
"The second philosophy, the so-called philosophy of regulated markets, considered that consumer protection required competition on a single, transparent market between all bids and offers, so as to enable clients to know the price and to benefit from the best possible price."
"Were these two philosophies compatible?"
"Yes, provided that the policies of investment firms were subject to common rules."
"In this respect the Commission text was very satisfactory."
"I am not sure, unlike Mr Bolkestein, that Mrs Villiers's report does markedly improve your initial text."
"But we can live with this compromise, because it is, as we have just been reminded, relatively satisfactory."
"It allows us to defend true principles and to act on them."
"This statement is however subject to two reservations."
"The first concerns the issue of price improvement."
"It is not a question of knowing whether the client has the best price."
"Of course he should have the best price!"
"The issue with price improvement is that it makes it possible for investment firms to apply a different price from the one that they publish and thus to prevent the market from contributing to the formation of fair prices."
"Secondly, we are also unable to accept transactions relating to portfolios that consist, for the purpose of removing a transaction from the constraints of the directive, of an amalgam of securities of different kinds bearing no relation to each other."
"Subject to these two essential reservations, where some of us will be voting against the proposal, we consider Mrs Villiers's report to be satisfactory."
"I would be happy to congratulate the rapporteur if I felt - and this is a reservation - that she had been completely fair throughout the negotiations between the groups."
"Mr President, the negotiations on the directive on investment services and regulated markets have once again shown how difficult it is to bring together the different European market philosophies and traditions, in particular the continental model of stock exchanges, which have in the meantime lost their public-private character to a large extent and have been privatised, and the investment banks' new internal trading systems."
"To allow these two systems to coexist at European level and to organise fair competition as well as protecting the interests of investors at the same time is a difficult task, and that will become particularly clear when we see what high sums are transferred every day and what effects the development of the financial markets will have on European and world economies."
"That being so, I hope that the compromise, which was reached through very tough negotiations in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, will encourage the Council to come to similar compromises so that this important legislative act on implementing an integrated financial services market can actually be passed in this term."
"I believe that we have tried to consider the interests of all market participants, including non-professional investors, and that we have implemented the principle of transparency in all key areas, just as the Commission intended."
"For example, in the interests of price transparency and investor protection, it is necessary that contracts limited to internal trading systems, if they cannot be carried out by the internaliser directly, can be directly transferred to the regulated markets, unless the customer explicitly rules this out."
"A quick transfer offers the best chances for the best possible completion of the contract in the interests of the customers. I thereby believe that we have reached the right decision in this House, as is the case for the disclosure requirements in Article 25."
"I hope that with this directive competition of all trading systems will have a chance without the protection of investor interests being neglected."
"Mr President, everyone is congratulating the rapporteur, so I will do likewise, and I recognise the progress that has been made between what she referred to as the 'Prodi amendment' and the text that is on the table today, even if influences from outside the continent have had a significant bearing on our debate."
"We are all familiar with the directive's objectives: to ensure that the financial sector allocates our economy's financial resources in the best possible way."
"On this basis, I believe that the text that we have drafted is expected by all traders."
"All that remains is for me to make a few essential observations."
"To protect non-professional investors, financial companies need to take the trouble to check their level of knowledge and their resources."
"Execution only is not a continental practice and by suddenly imposing it we would run the risk of destabilising many investors."
"Secondly, for competition to be genuine, information must be made available to all players."
"Transparency is therefore essential."
"Pre-trade transparency should not admit of any exception and I can accept that it does not apply to limit price orders and is restricted to orders of a standard size, but the possibility of price improvement, already mentioned by Mr Jean-Louis Bourlanges, seems to me to be an extremely worrying development."
"Finally, in the vote on Thursday, I think that we should try to restate the position that we in Parliament adopted on the 'delivery' regulation, which is to say that we should ask the Commission to draft a directive on this point."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking all of those involved in this compromise, beginning with the rapporteur and Mr Radwan."
"It was a very difficult task, but we were successful."
"Further, I would like to make it clear that Parliament wants to pass this directive in this term and we hope that this compromise will also help the Council to come to one of its own."
"The new directive for investment services and regulated markets will strengthen the single European financial market."
"Why do we even need a directive?"
"Because inadequately harmonised rules, high levels of bureaucracy and antiquated provisions for investor protection have so far been considerable barriers to cross-border securities trading."
"What are the main points of our compromise and the new regulations?"
"Firstly, investor protection."
"Investors must be well informed and the rules on the conduct of business are one of the most important pillars of investor protection: the differences between advice and non-advice business."
"In future a suitability test will only be required for advice business."
"Thirdly, we want the best possible service."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have come up with a wording that is acceptable to both small and large financial institutions. Fourthly, the decisive point: the level playing field between banks dealing internally with securities and markets."
"In this compromise, it was decided that banks are subject to appropriate supervisory and transparency rules."
"The aim is that the internalisation systems are allowed but not to the detriment of markets and other market participants."
"We hope that this compromise will make for fairer competition between banks and stock markets, from which the consumer will benefit most."
"I would ask everyone to vote in favour of the compromise the day after tomorrow."
"Mr President, all honour to you for your stamina."
"In the short time that has been allocated to me and at this late hour, I can only formulate a few guiding principles that will determine my commitment to reach compromises and my voting behaviour on Thursday."
"I should like to outline two objectives."
"First of all, promoting private investment in the European Union."
"We must make every effort to increase liquid assets for the benefit of economic activity and to recover from the economic decline once again."
"Secondly, protecting small private investors."
"On the one hand, by laying down unambiguous rules that are closely monitored and, on the other hand, by optimising these small investors' choices in terms of investment products, institutions and methods."
"It is the latter point that formed the subject of the debates concerning the directive."
"In my view, the small investor should be able to have access to stock exchanges as well as his own home bank."
"In-house matching is a fully-fledged alternative to the monopoly of stock exchanges, something which causes me increasing anxiety, certainly if it transcends national borders and stands in the way of national supervision."
"This requires transparency, but must not adversely affect price forming and liquidity on the financial markets."
"As far as the last point - the method of legislation - is concerned, I agree with the approach, based on the Lamfalussy method, of delegating a number of things to supervisors and regulators."
"I concur with everyone who has stated that it is important to reach compromises and to encourage the Council to do the same."
"Mr President, this House is fast demonstrating that it can solve things that even the Council cannot solve."
"Maybe that suits us for what may happen in the very near future."
"I hope, Commissioner, you will take note of that."
"But if the financial services plan is to work, this directive has to be in place."
"There is no point in acting on the issues of barriers of national protectionism if we look backwards."
"If we do not look at what is happening with the global financial position then Europe, its investment, its potential for growth, all the risk capital action plan issues of the Lisbon European Council go by the by."
"As in so many of these issues, as before, we in Parliament, as elsewhere, have often been distracted by our own national concerns as opposed to what happens with the European economy."
"I commend the rapporteur for the work she has done."
"Acting in the way she has done - and I am being cheeky here - she is acting in the most European of ways."
"As we know, markets cross borders."
"I am glad that as a British Conservative she has acted in a European fashion."
". Mr President, I shall briefly explain some of the points where we have some concerns with the amendments which have been proposed by this Parliament."
"As regards pre-trade transparency obligations for investment firms, Article 25, all the amendments related to pre-trade transparency, that is to say Amendments Nos 33 and 86 to 90, can be accepted at least partially or in principle, but we are not convinced of the necessity to allow for price improvement."
"We are not convinced that in the way it is presented in the amendments it is necessary or beneficial for the interests of retail investors."
"We consider that the current exemption for commodity derivatives and the dealers of such instruments should apply on a consolidated basis."
"As already explained, in the conduct of business obligations we accept - and this is in line with the Commission's initial proposal - the limitation of the obligation on investment firms to carry out a full suitability test only for certain services."
"Regretfully, we do not agree with a number of amendments referring to comitology provisions."
"Some of them are against the principles set out in the report of the Wise Men - the Lamfalussy approach in particular."
"We consider that implementing measures should only contain detailed technical rules, not principles."
"The purpose of adopting level 2 measures is always to ensure uniform application of EU legislation in all Member States, so any vague formulations proposed in that respect cannot be accepted."
"On the division of responsibilities between competent authorities, in the case of branches we consider that in order to ensure a correct functioning of the single market the principle of the host Member State regulation should only apply as an exception for determining the conduct of business rules and record-keeping."
"In this context the Commission is in a position to accept a large number of amendments, some of them in their entirety, but also a large number partially or in principle and with adaptations."
"To conclude, the Commission can accept 36 amendments in their entirety."
"Furthermore, 62 amendments could be at least accepted partially or in principle, with some changes needed in order to ensure the overall coherence of the text."
"We consider that 60 amendments have to be rejected."
"The Commission's opinion on the individual amendments has been provided in writing"
"I have today in the European Parliament chosen to follow the Group of the Party of European Socialists in relation to Mr Olle Schmidt's report (A5-0210/2003)."
"I am, however, aware of the fact that the proposal is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark's position."
"I have today in the European Parliament chosen to vote in favour of Mr Kirkhope's report (A5-0291/2003)."
"I am, however, aware of the fact that the proposal is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark's position."
"European Constitution and IGC"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report Mr Tsatsos and myself have produced is based on very clear political criteria."
"Firstly, Parliament must support its delegation in the Convention, which has achieved a good text, an intelligent text, although naturally it is not a perfect text, because no legal text is perfect."
"We do not therefore believe that we need to make proposals to modify this text; we understand that many Members would have liked to have called for improvements on various points, but our approach has been that we should not call for any, but that we should ask the Heads of State or Government not to substantially undo or alter the broad consensus achieved in the Convention."
"We are not dealing with mere preparatory work, but with an expression of solutions supported by national parliaments and the European Parliament - which represents the citizens of Europe - and by representatives of the governments and the Member States."
"I repeat: we are dealing with a political consensus which must not be undervalued or sidelined."
"It is true that, on certain points, ladies and gentlemen, some governments and the Commission have expressed reservations."
"It would be naïve to imagine that these extremely important political problems are not going to be dealt with by the Intergovernmental Conference, or that that Conference will simply rubberstamp what the Convention has done."
"Those people who maintain this position are naturally expressing an initial negotiating position because, otherwise, we would have to assume they have their heads in the clouds."
"I am convinced, ladies and gentlemen - and I am obviously speaking on a personal basis and not as rapporteur - that the system according to which only half of the Commissioners would vote would be a crass error."
"That solution would weaken the Commission at a time when it most needs to be strengthened."
"This is an error which must be corrected."
"I would also say equally clearly that it will not be possible to alter the balance of power established in Nice, so that just one or two States pay the price for a new decision-making method."
"In the Union, consensus can be changed, of course, but on one condition: that the interests of everybody are brought together."
"Otherwise, new consensus cannot be achieved."
"A consensus is replaced by another consensus, not by impositions."
"Our report intends to stress that dealing with and resolving these specific issues will be legitimate provided that we thereby improve the democratic consensus achieved so far."
"This, however, must not be a reason for reopening the constitutional negotiations, as if we were weaving Penelope's shroud."
"I would say to the Heads of State or Government that that would be a great error."
"That is the main political message of our report, but we had to go further than that, of course."
"It was necessary to evaluate the ins and outs of the draft Constitution so that the citizens can express their opinion on it when the time comes and so that it may be clear that the European Parliament accepts and supports this draft as a compromise, a realistic negotiated position between the ideal solutions it has been advocating and the possibilities for putting them into practice at this time."
"We are not abandoning those goals."
"We are making it clear that the draft represents a step forward, an important step, but we are not giving up the idea of making further progress when the time is right."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would not like to end this brief speech without thanking my co-rapporteur, Professor Tsatsos, for his exemplary will to achieve consensus and the high intellectual quality of his contribution to achieving it."
"I would also like to thank all our fellow Members from the different groups for their extremely valuable contributions and their sense of responsibility."
"There is no question that we have been able to work with such a high degree of consensus because Parliament's representation in the Convention - in agreement with the national parliaments - did such a significant job achieving the consensus on the basis of which we have been able to continue to build."
"I have mentioned this Parliament's sense of responsibility."
"Parliament usually demonstrates this sense of responsibility when it comes to taking political decisions of truly great importance."
"Since it was elected by universal suffrage, that sense of responsibility has turned it into the Union's driving force."
"I have seen this during successive Intergovernmental Conferences, some of which I have participated in very directly."
"It is in this spirit of integration, construction and genuine Europeanism, that I am hopeful that the House will vote in favour of our report."
". (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, history means development."
"That is why, with the work of the Convention, the constitutional history of the European Union has started to unroll."
"In the draft which we are submitting to you, my distinguished and respected colleague, Mr Gil-Robles, and I propose that the European Parliament take the following three positions:"
"First position: Parliament claims recognition of the institution of the Convention as its victory and as acquis communautaire."
"The preparation of the revision of the Treaties is the work of a political body for the first time in history of the European Union."
"Second position: despite the imperfections and shortcomings in the Convention's draft, the European Parliament, as Mr Gil-Robles stressed, is calling for the Intergovernmental Conference not to reopen the package of basic compromises reached in it."
"If, on the contrary, the Intergovernmental Conference distances itself politically from the draft, it will damage our institutional victory and the result of the revision will not, I fear, differ from the Nice fiasco."
"Of course, there are also reasons relating to the content of the draft that impose respect for the compromise reached."
"For example, fundamental rights, safeguarding the basic values of the European Union, the social state, culminating in the objective of full employment, the upgrading of the European Parliament, the constitutionalisation and simplification of the content of the Treaties, the increased safeguarding of transparency, making full use of the national parliaments, the extension of qualified majority voting and much more besides."
"Third position: the Convention's draft constitution also has serious weaknesses, as my respected friend, Mr Gil-Robles, emphasised."
"For example: first, the institution of the President of the European Council does not leave the balance between the institutions or the functioning of the European Commission or the parity between the states untouched."
"It is an institution with a democratic deficit and the corresponding abolition of the revolving presidency damages the parity between the states."
"Secondly, the constitution of the Commission with 25 commissioners divided, to put it one way, into full and second-class commissioners, is - if you will pardon the expression - a monster in the making."
"The attempt to extort a 'yes' to the introduction of the institution of the President of the European Council by offering more, albeit second-class, commissioners is clear here."
"Thirdly, it proved impossible to take substantial steps on a foreign policy and security policy which would allow the European Union to restore its political credibility internationally."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, both 'yes' and criticism?"
"Perhaps that is a contradiction?"
"I believe it is not a contradiction for three reasons. First reason: constitutional texts are not static."
"They are based on concepts such as freedom, democracy, fundamental rights, equality, the rule of law, the social state, in other words concepts, the content of which undergoes permanent historic development through political and social struggle."
"Our criticism should be seen as a contribution to this development."
"Second reason: the European Parliament, should these compromises be reopened, must have submitted its views."
"Third reason: we are not calling on the European citizens to support the constitutional text because they will be ignorant of its drawbacks, but in knowledge of its drawbacks and for reasons of its advantages."
"Two amendments have been proposed in a bid to expressly emphasise the Christian character of the historic roots of the European Union."
"By its very nature, this is an historic, philosophic and moral issue with a metaphysical basis which therefore concerns each and every one of us."
"That is why, to finish, I dare to take a personal stand: I recognise the determining role of Christianity in shaping European civilisation, I recognise the need to safeguard the validity of its teachings; however, it would diminish Christianity and underestimate its persuasiveness if we were to accept that it needs constitutional support."
"That is why I am voting against urging that the Intergovernmental Conference safeguard it constitutionally."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish the Constitution a long, safe journey."
"I wish it luck in times of storm."
"I believe that its first port of call should be to restore its political credibility, the political credibility of the European Union."
"That is what was so badly damaged by the alliance between certain of its members and the United States, who must bear the burden of the illegal invasion of Iraq on the pretext of terrorism."
"Finally, I warmly thank my respected rapporteur and chairman, Mr Gil-Robles, the committee's excellent secretariat and all those who cooperated with us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to set before this House the guidelines that the Italian Presidency intends to follow in conducting the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Thanks, not least, to the essential contribution made by representatives of Parliament, the Convention has written an historic page in the process of European integration."
"For the first time, the European Union's institutions, the governments of the Member States and of the accession countries, the national parliaments and civil society have all taken part in a structured, all-embracing, public and transparent debate on the future of Europe."
"The Convention has successfully accomplished a gargantuan task within the timeframe set by the Laeken Declaration, achieving substantial consensus on crucial points that had not been resolved during previous Intergovernmental Conferences, such as the division of competences, the conferring of a legal personality on the Union, replacement of the pillar structure of the previous Treaty, strengthening of the principle of subsidiarity, clearer definition of the hierarchy of the Union's legislative acts, the involvement of national parliaments and a new institutional balance of powers."
"The Convention also demonstrated that it is possible to prepare and negotiate European treaties in an entirely new way."
"The success of the new method is shown by the fact that efforts to reconcile the positions of all the parties involved on the most controversial points were being made up until the very last day."
"The final outcome was the drawing-up of a draft Constitutional Treaty that has the merit of gathering proposals and suggestions from all parts of European political and civil society, on the basis of an ambitious plan to bridge the differences that had emerged at previous Intergovernmental Conferences between countries with larger populations and countries with smaller populations and between countries which varied in their readiness to proceed towards even greater integration."
"The governments will now have the final word, in accordance with Article 48 of the Treaty."
"That fact must not, however, make us forget that this is a single constituent process, the first stage of which has come to an end with the Convention; the process is now entering the stage of intergovernmental negotiation and will, we hope, end with the ratification of the future Constitutional Treaty."
"In essence, then, this is a different kind of negotiation process from that which preceded the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice."
"We will have to take this into account when defining the organisational and procedural aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In conducting the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, starting on 4 October, the Italian Presidency's primary aim will be to keep to the timetable drawn up at the Thessaloniki European Council."
"This means pressing ahead determinedly to achieve a positive result in time for the European Parliament elections to be held in June next year."
"This groundplan has dictated one of the Italian Presidency's main objectives: to conduct the Intergovernmental Conference at a high political level and to a tight schedule so as to reach a comprehensive overall agreement on the constitutional text by December."
"It would thus be possible for the Constitutional Treaty - a Constitution for Europe, as President Giscard d'Estaing has described it - to be signed between 1 May 2004, the date set for the entry of the ten new Member States, and the European Parliament elections."
"Prolonging the negotiations on the Constitution beyond these dates would result in two serious problems of democratic legitimacy and transparency: on the one hand the constitutional legacy of the Convention would gradually be lost, and, on the other, the citizens of Europe would be voting in the European Parliament elections without knowing what the constitutional shape of the future Union would be."
"The Presidency therefore intends to safeguard the structure and balance of the draft produced by the Convention."
"Parliament's opinion, in the text approved to date by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has provided valuable support for our efforts, as have the speeches given by the rapporteurs who spoke before me and strongly confirmed this intention."
"We have already expressed our views on the inappropriateness of reopening debates that have already been thrashed out in the Convention; revisiting them could only lead to less consensual and less ambitious results."
"The Intergovernmental Conference must not, therefore, change the overall structure and balance of the draft Constitutional Treaty but will, instead, be called upon to improve and add to those parts of the text that need clarifying, completing or supplementing, all with the greatest transparency and openness."
"Our objective is to achieve a quality result that both meets the expectations of European public opinion and can ensure that the enlarged Union operates effectively and democratically."
"Giving the European Union a Constitution is a challenge, and not just for certain Member States or for the Italian Presidency, whose task it is to steer the Council through this phase."
"It is a challenge for everybody."
"It is a commitment to our citizens: if we do not succeed in this challenge, as Mr Frattini said to his fellow ministers at Riva del Garda, it will be a defeat for the Union as a whole and a serious setback in terms of our goal of making Europe a respected leader on the world stage as a force for peace, democracy, stability and prosperity."
"We should not disguise the fact that the final outcome is not at all a foregone conclusion: the process might reach a deadlock or even break down."
"I should like to make it quite clear, in this regard, that the Italian Presidency is not willing to make any compromises that do not abide by the spirit of the key elements of the draft produced by the Convention."
"In this context, the Presidency believes that greater involvement of the European Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference's work is essential in order to safeguard the constitutional legacy of the Convention and to avoid falling back into the narrow, nationalistic ways of thinking that produced the obscure agreements at Nice."
"At the last Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament took part in the group of personal representatives, where it made a constructive and much-appreciated contribution."
"The Italian Presidency feels that, since preparatory technical working groups will not be formally set up this time, it makes sense for Parliament to be fully involved in the Intergovernmental Conference meetings at Foreign Minister level."
"With regard to the meetings of Heads of State or Government, the Italian Presidency undertakes to make every effort to secure agreement on ways of involving the President of Parliament much more and of keeping him much better informed than at previous Intergovernmental Conferences."
"The recent Riva del Garda talks did not result in agreed guidelines on this matter."
"The Heads of State or Government will therefore have to come to a decision on it themselves when the Intergovernmental Conference opens."
"At that time, the Italian Presidency will work along the lines that I have just sketched out for you."
"Today, we are on the eve of a fundamentally important event in the history of European integration."
"The Italian Government is aware of the role that Parliament has played over the last two decades to achieve a more democratic, more cohesive and fairer Union."
"It was the Spinelli draft Treaty that reinvigorated that process of European integration which - through the Single Act and the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice - has led to the completion of the single market, the adoption of the euro, and the ever greater sharing of sovereignty in the fields of foreign policy, justice and home affairs."
"At the same time, your Parliament, speaking directly for the peoples of the Union, has taken on ever greater and more effective colegislative and monitoring powers."
"Your support will therefore be crucial in the coming months, which will see the enlarged Europe enter its constitutional phase, the crowning point of the long process that was begun by the founding fathers with the Treaties of Paris and Rome and which should lead us to ever closer union between our states and our citizens."
"This tradition of a shared understanding strengthens the Italian Presidency's determination to stay in constant contact with the European Parliament: in this spirit, the President of the Republic, Mr Ciampi, will be addressing you next week to express once again the firm belief in Europe that is the joint heritage of all the main political, economic, social and cultural forces in Italy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, together with my friend and colleague Mr Antonio Vitorino, I had the privilege of taking part in all of the work of the Præsidium of the Convention, alongside Mr Klaus Hänsch and Mr Íñigo Méndez de Vigo."
"We have worked hard together for the last 18 months."
"I am sure you will allow me to thank them personally and in public, as this is my first opportunity to address Parliament since the work of the Convention was concluded."
"I should also like to say how grateful I am for the work of all those Members of the European Parliament who served as Conventioneers. Thanks are due too to their deputies and to others who supported them."
"The oversight exercised by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, under the chairmanship of Mr Giorgio Napolitano, must also be commended."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as was stated a few moments ago, the Convention has now finished its work. It has fulfilled its contract."
"There is, however, no time for nostalgia."
"Furthermore, nostalgia is not a good guide in politics, in my opinion."
"As of today, the Commission and Parliament must again work together in approaching the very sensitive period of the imminent Intergovernmental Conference. We must work just as hard as in the past and face future challenges together."
"Mr President, I hope the IGC will draft a new and genuine Treaty of Rome."
"At the end of the Conference, Parliament and the Commission must again work shoulder to shoulder to ensure the text is ratified."
"This final stage represents a considerable challenge."
"It entails the citizens or their representatives in each Member State appropriating the text, if I may put it like that."
"In this connection, I should like to reiterate my support for the idea that, when the time comes, the future European Constitution should be ratified on the same day across Europe. Ratification would of course take place in accordance with the specific procedures of each of the Member States."
"At the same time, a single European ratification day would generate a truly European debate, instead of 25 national debates all taking place alongside each other. This could be a first."
"As I said just now, the latest IGC is about to start."
"It is not, cannot and will not be like previous IGCs."
"It will not be comparable to the Amsterdam or Nice Conferences."
"I was deeply involved in those Conferences."
"They resulted in a measure of progress, but also in many regrets."
"This IGC is different because it has the chance of building on the in-depth groundwork undertaken by the Convention."
"Mr Gil-Robles termed this work intelligent and I agree with him."
"As a first point of agreement between Parliament and the Commission, I would like to stress that we both want to ensure that this IGC does not revisit issues on which agreement was reached in the Convention."
"Further, as you said a moment ago, Mr President, the important balances achieved in the draft Constitution must not be disturbed."
"The second point on which we agree is on what was accepted at the Convention."
"Briefly, this means that the values, principles, institutions and even, at the request of the Parliamentary conventioneers, the symbols of the European Union are to be enshrined in the Constitution."
"It also implies the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to which Parliament made a significant contribution."
"Further, it implies establishing the unique legal personality of the European Union and doing away with the pillar structure."
"There is also the hierarchy of rules."
"Other elements are clearer delimitation of the competences of the European Union and the extension of the application of the Community and codecision procedures."
"Another point of consensus is the election of the President of the Commission by the European Parliament."
"Genuine progress was made in the implementation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Real advances were made too in the field of defence."
"I hope they will be retained."
"In this regard, I have had the privilege of chairing the Convention group on defence."
"In particular, we worked on a proposal for a European Armaments Agency and on a draft Solidarity Clause that would allow for mutual assistance in response to a terrorist attack like the one on 11 September that had such tragic consequences for New York and Washington. Attacks of this nature are always a possibility."
"This would make up for what the European Union currently lacks, namely a space where a common diplomatic culture can be patiently nurtured. In the event of crises, Europe would then be able to adopt common positions, based on a common geostrategic assessment."
"I would remind you of the crisis in Yugoslavia and, more recently, the one in Iraq. These are some of the main achievements enshrined in the Constitution."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we also agree on what is lacking in this Constitution."
"To quote Professor Tsatsos, we agree on the progress we still need to make and that we must work together to that end."
"For instance, this draft Constitution does not really reduce the fields where the requirement for unanimity paralyses and will in future continue to paralyse common action."
"It does not equip the European Union with the instruments and procedures it needs in the key field of economic governance, as is evident at present."
"The Constitution does not provide for the less crucial of its provisions to be revised in a more flexible way."
"Furthermore, as you are aware, the Commission has considered those provisions of the draft Constitution with implications for its own composition."
"It wished to propose a better composition than that which currently appears in the text of the Convention."
"Your two rapporteurs, Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos, spoke along these lines on the issue of the composition of the Commission a few moments ago."
"Ladies and gentlemen, very many of us here today experienced a sort of enthusiasm throughout these last 18 months of work. I would go as far as to say we were, in a sense, uplifted by being involved in the success of this Convention, thanks to the open and transparent procedure implemented for the first time."
"Not all the citizens of Europe may actually have felt engaged. Nonetheless, it is at least the first time a great European venture has been prepared outside a secret diplomatic conference."
"Nevertheless, it is important simply to note today that a new and different stage is about to begin, namely the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I trust it is clear that the Commission is tackling this new stage in the same spirit with which it tackled the Convention. We are tackling it with the same will to work with you to achieve our common priorities."
"If we so wish, we do have the opportunity to improve a limited number of the points of the draft Constitution without upsetting the overall balance."
"We can clarify all the provisions of this draft, especially the scope of their application. This would prevent certain misunderstandings or confusion when the text is ratified."
"Lastly, we can ensure that this IGC accomplishes the legal revision work entrusted to it by the Convention."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my sincere belief that, setting aside semantic differences, there is broad agreement between our two institutions on the substance of the matter."
"The Commission indicated recently in the opinion adopted on 17 September that it is essential this IGC does not call into question the major balances achieved in the draft Constitution as a whole. Allow me to emphasise once again how vital this is."
"I would also like to reiterate that the College of Commissioners, and in particular the President, Antonio Vitorino and I, are determined to lend our support to the Italian Presidency in achieving this common aim."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to say, on behalf of my group, how extraordinarily grateful we are to the rapporteurs Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos, not only because - as was only to be expected - they have done an outstanding job, but also because their work makes political sense, stating as it does that there are things with which we are not satisfied, areas where one could have gone a good deal further, but that considerations of compromise and balance led us to find a way that we should take."
"I believe that this is an important message, identical to that expressed by the Italian Presidency of the Council, and that it is for this reason that Parliament and the Italian Presidency of the Council will be able to cooperate constructively at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It must be clear to us that this draft constitution represents a considerable advance in almost every area."
"Whereas Nice created only the formal conditions for enlargement, this constitution creates the conditions under which the enlarged community will be viable, with its viability made manifest by its greater capacity for action, improved decision-making mechanisms and the extension of the principle of majority decision-making."
"We could certainly have done more but, I believe, the progress is plain to see."
"It must be clear to us that the removal of the pillar principle and the possibility of development inherent in the actual constitution change the fundamental structure."
"I believe that the democratic principle has also been decisively strengthened."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam represented a breakthrough for the right of codecision, which we are now on the way to completing in the course of making the European Parliament an institution with real capacity to act and real powers of codecision in almost all areas of Community law."
"It must also, moreover, be apparent to us that opening up the Council's legislative process to the public can make a dramatic leap forward in terms of transparency."
"I believe it to be crucial that we have a transparent EU, one in which the citizen can establish who is responsible for what, and can upbraid and punish the guilty parties."
"I believe that, if citizens do not understand how decisions are taken and who is responsible for them, they cannot be expected to accept them."
"I hope that the influence of national ministries will not be so great in this area as to make transparency in it impossible."
"I believe that it amounts to a decisive step forward that we should have a division of competences that will make it much easier for us to say, in future, where Europe has authority and where it does not."
"This too is important in order that the nation states do not feel that they are losing their identity and that Europe is drawing everything to itself."
"If competences are clearly delineated, then they are an area in respect of which one can demand improved decision-making processes and greater capacity to act, and there will be fewer grey areas."
"This ties in with the principle of subsidiarity."
"I see this as really substantial progress, as this gives the national parliaments the opportunity and hence the awareness of exerting influence when they believe that the subsidiarity principle has been violated."
"I believe that it is also extraordinarily important in terms of the Community's internal health that the national parliaments have gained for themselves this role, without the levels being confused or decision-making processes made complicated."
"It is also important that Europe should be brought closer to its citizens, for it will be, in future, by way of the European parliamentary elections that the president of the Commission will be chosen."
"It is on the citizen that the EU is founded, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights makes him also its subject, protected by it and with the capacity to act."
"I believe that this, in future, will be of great significance."
"Within the European Union, we must also ensure that the balance between large and small, rich and poor, new and old members is guaranteed, so that the small countries feel that the balance in the EU's institutions enables them to put across their point of view and defend their identity."
"The strength of the larger countries consists in their consideration for the smaller ones."
"I believe that we have to introduce this into the equation, just as we also have to make it clear that, in structural cooperation in defence and in other areas, when some go on ahead, the door must always be open for others who want to join in at a later date, and that we must put no new obstacles in their way."
"It must be perfectly clear that this constitution may well be the last chance we have to realise a Europe of equal rights, rather than a two-tier-Europe."
"In view of Europe's enlargement, it is important that we try to achieve this."
"Let me make one final observation."
"The European Union is also a union of values, as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the preamble make clear."
"If we were to be strong enough to associate the religious element - in a spirit of tolerance - with the word 'Christian', that would surely be the sort of progress that would be in the public interest."
"Mr President, Mr President?in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say firstly that I am conceding half of my speaking time to Mr Napolitano, Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"I still do not understand, after many years, what criteria are used for allocating speaking time in this Parliament, and I believe that Mr Napolitano, as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, deserved time outside of that allocated to the political groups, but this has not been the case."
"I would ask you to communicate this to the President of Parliament."
"Secondly, I would like to express the support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for the Tsatsos-Gil-Robles report."
"My colleagues will analyse in detail the aspects which we consider fundamental, with greater authority than my own."
"What I would like to point out at this stage is that, having heard the Commissioner and being aware of the Commission's document - which I believe fulfils its responsibility, as guardian of the Treaties, to make proposals, and which is important in terms of institutional balance - I believe there is great correlation between what is said in this report, as an assessment of the aspects which are not properly resolved, and what the Commission says."
"We will have to look for a way to maintain this balance, which we are all claiming to be so fundamental within the institutional triangle."
"I would like to make a more specific reference to the future reform of the Constitution."
"Commissioner Barnier has insisted that, symbolically, we must all vote on the same day."
"With the outstanding issues - which are the subject of an evolutionary clause, the 'rendez-vous' clause - it is true to say that it does make sense to seek solutions which allow us to resolve the problems we have."
"I hope that the Italian Presidency can do so."
"Having said this, Mr President, and having heard the President?in-Office of the Council, I am going to propose an in voce amendment to the Tsatsos-Gil-Robles text."
"With the best of intentions, the President?in-Office of the Council has told us that the Italian Presidency wishes to comply with what it promised in this Parliament, but it has also told us, very diplomatically, that in Riva del Garda it did not achieve that."
"I believe we must state the facts clearly."
"What would not be acceptable, having had the Convention, would be to hear the words 'Time for bed, children, now we are going to discuss serious matters'."
"That cannot be the case."
"It is not acceptable from the point of view not just of transparency, but of democratic responsibility."
"Therefore, having also seen what was discussed in Riva del Garda - because the document we have seen does not correspond to what the Italian Presidency is saying here: that we are going to be observers on the same level as such respectable countries as Romania, Bulgaria or Turkey is not a way to give the European Parliament a very worthy position - I would propose that, in paragraph 37, the wording be changed and, rather than saying 'Strongly welcomes the Italian Presidency's assurance', it should say 'Expresses its concern and discontent with the lack of compliance by the Council with the assurances expressed by the Italian Presidency to Parliament'."
"This corresponds to reality at this moment."
"The Italian Presidency has good intentions, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"What we need to do is to ensure that our representation is worthy and corresponds to reality."
"I will end, Mr President, by making a proposal to the Italian Presidency, so that it can communicate it to the Council."
"The majority of foreign affairs ministers were members of the Convention."
"We are inviting the members of national parliaments who were members of the Convention to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"I believe this invitation should be extended to the ministers and the Council, so that these issues may be debated in public, which is what European pubic opinion is demanding."
"Mr President, there have been several weeks for us to reflect carefully upon the draft Treaty establishing the Constitution."
"It is gratifying for those of us who were Members of the Convention to see that, despite some initial posturing, most members of the European Council appear now to be accepting the outcome of the Convention with few qualifications."
"They can all see that if the IGC discards the outcome of the Convention, then it will fall to them to come up with alternative solutions commanding a greater consensus."
"Prime Minister Blair should be especially congratulated for apparently discarding previous British Government positions upon defence."
"At his Berlin Summit meeting at the weekend, Mr Blair seemed sensibly to accept the Convention's proposals for structured cooperation within and outside Nato, allowing a core group of capable Member States to forge forward to build a common European security and defence policy, not as a last resort but as a first call."
"It is a tribute to the Convention process that it stands up to such critical assessment, especially from this House, which is not known for complacency when it comes to these questions."
"The Convention certainly examined all the options, refined all the arguments, and took a broad political approach with the common interest of Europe very much at the centre of our work."
"It is for that reason that this resolution properly demands that the spirit of the Convention - transparent, pluralistic, political - should be brought forward to the IGC."
"I support the President's proposals that there should not be technical working groups."
"I very much support their proposals to have stronger representation of the European Parliament at the IGC."
"Perhaps it will be possible before the summit on 4 October to reopen this issue at the General Affairs Council next week."
"An IGC with a more democratic flavour and less diplomatic style will be more successful and much quicker in reaching a conclusion."
"Mr President, in giving Europe the text of a Constitution, which will contribute effectively to constructing our future, the Convention has accomplished an important task."
"This work must be protected from slanderers and opponents but it must also be further improved upon - it is not true that there is no scope to do this - and we must reject the theories of those who do not want to change anything, or else all the work that has been achieved will come to nothing."
"I share and support, therefore, the proactive view taken by Mr Prodi, who sees the value of the texts but is also aware of the limits and risks that could arise from it."
"More specifically, I will indicate corrections that I feel are necessary and possible."
"I am not referring to the inadequate content and inadequate social rights, which, as we know, are the result of the specific balance of powers today."
"It is no coincidence, for example, that the Constituent Assembly which wrote the marvellous Italian Constitution in the post-war period, had as its President the communist, Umberto Terracini, while our Convention is chaired by the extremely respectable but extremely moderate Mr Giscard d'Estaing."
"I am, therefore, referring to issues that are purely institutional."
"Firstly, a full-time President of the Council who is in office for a long period of time, instead of a rotating presidency, would end up overlapping with the President of the Commission and their work would conflict, causing paralysis and crisis in the institutions."
"Secondly, unanimity voting must be abolished in all areas because the right to veto can, at any time, block any innovative process. Thirdly, there must be a single common foreign policy and it must be accompanied by a European military capacity superseding NATO which would give us not only an independent role but also a stabilising role in the face of the one-sided, imperialist power that is currently present in and threatening the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that this House will today back the Convention's draft, and do so by a large majority."
"We agree overwhelmingly that the best thing about the Convention was that it was not an Intergovernmental Conference."
"It was largely parliamentary in character, it was held in public, it engaged in dialogue with the public and civil society, and it had many months in which to do its work."
"The worst thing about the Convention was that it ended up turning into an Intergovernmental Conference after all."
"Its conclusion was determined by negotiations and haggling behind the scenes, with nations' own interests being played off against the European interest, and threats of vetoes being used."
"The Convention was successful when it was free."
"It followed constitutional logic in producing a draft on the future of Europe."
"Out of it emerged the draft of a European democracy, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a republican legal order for Europe, capacity to act and the possibility of a new role in the world."
"Success eluded the Convention whenever it bowed to governmental pressure and lost itself in a thicket of conflicting interests."
"Hence we have no European social contract, no European social order, too few decisions taken by majority vote and we still, among other things, have laws made by the Council. The question at issue was not what we could do for Europe, but what we could deny Europe."
"Many governments are now calling for a 'real' Intergovernmental Conference; this is a dangerous threat, and one founded on very dubious legitimacy."
"Mathematically speaking, a plus and a minus add up to a minus."
"Where is the sense in forcing as chronically unsuccessful a method as an Intergovernmental Conference upon one so successful as the Convention?"
"The outcome, the end result, of this simple arithmetic will be that of an IGC, a 'Nice Mark II' - not the highest common denominator, but the lowest, and were the governments not represented at the Convention, and at the highest level?"
"Did they not brutally force through their positions?"
"Were you not at the Convention, Commissioner Barnier?"
"Did you not agree to a great compromise?"
"Can the Commission really take on the historic responsibility of enabling the governments to unilaterally change this historic consensus for the sake of their own interests?"
"In doing so, are you not enabling the forces of destruction to absolve themselves?"
"Commissioner, your place is alongside the European Parliament as it fights for this compromise."
"You will have to answer for that; it is perhaps the gravest error in the whole of its period in office for which the Commission will have to account."
"What can the Intergovernmental Conference do without demolishing this consensus, without - behind closed doors - perpetuating the same old horse-trading that we saw at Nice?"
"It should accept the Convention's draft, it should deal, in the spirit of the majority in the Convention, with those issues that the governments blocked, those on which there is no consensus, especially the revision clause."
"That was something on which the Convention could come to no agreement; the Intergovernmental Conference should make it possible for future amendments to the Constitution to be made by a democratic majority."
"It should, moreover, resolve the inconsistencies between parts 1 and 3, which are largely the result of governmental intervention."
"If we promise the people the social market economy in part 1, but the free, untrammelled competitive society in part 3, then we are not being honest with the public."
"If we promise full employment in part 1, but only a high level of employment in part 3, that amounts to a trick, and it will not build confidence in Europe."
"If, at this historic moment, we make the wrong choice, we will be leading Europe into a crisis."
"If, after wrecking the methodology of the Intergovernmental Conference, we go on to wreck and discredit the methodology of the Convention, we will be left with nothing."
"What will we then be able to do when the crisis strikes?"
"Hard though this compromise may have been for all of us, we should defend the Convention on the future of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, zealous advocates of the Convention want the new Treaty signed on 9 May next year, the anniversary of the 1950 Schuman Declaration."
"Let us heed Robert Schuman carefully, though!"
"His exact words are these: 'Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan."
"It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.'"
"I repeat: it will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan."
"Now let us see what we have on the table."
"We have a Convention, to produce which, Mr Giscard d'Estaing told us here, 1 800 speeches were made and thousands of amendments proposed. There was not one vote, however."
"Not a single vote. This process was not democratic either in principle or in practice, and it far exceeded its mandate."
"What would it mean, then, if the Convention's conclusions were imposed as final, as the rapporteurs would like, riding roughshod over the powers and responsibilities democratically granted only to the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)?"
"It would mean a blow against Robert Schuman."
"Let us cast our eye once again over the Convention's text, which, say its supporters, should be forcibly enshrined as the Constitution."
"What do we see there?"
"We see an attempt to make Europe 'all at once', upsetting a long-established balance by means of a new 'single plan'."
"Another blow against Schuman."
"Let us remember, moreover, what happened some weeks ago at the IGC planning meeting in Riva del Garda."
"Various Member States, various countries expressed major reservations about the Convention text. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has incorporated those reservations into the amendments it has tabled to this report, on the composition of the Commission, the Presidency, the role of Christianity, and so on."
"These criticisms received a blunt response from Mr Oskar Fischer in the form of the financial forecasts for 2007-13. The press correctly interpreted the German minister's threat as ill-judged budgetary blackmail."
"What does this amount to?"
"It amounts to a negation of the 'concrete achievements' which gradually 'create a de facto solidarity'. That was precisely what Schuman was advocating on 9 May 1950."
"The united voices of my group, therefore, urge the IGC to look to Schuman's method for its true inspiration, never forgetting 9 May."
"I would appeal to the Italian Presidency, therefore, not to kowtow to threatening language, to restraints, to blackmail by Member States, and rather to encourage free, equal and open debates."
"Our responsibility is to prevent the haste and pressure of a few from destroying, against the grain of democracy, the magnificent edifice whose foundations were laid by the Treaty of Rome."
"Mr President, I warned the Italian Presidency about its timetable for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Twelve meeting days have been set aside this autumn for negotiating a constitution that extremely few people have yet heard of."
"It is to be adopted on 13 December and signed on 9 May, whereupon we can go to the polls and participate in referendums, but not change the Constitution."
"That is not fair, and it is not at all democratic."
"The peoples of Europe have not yet asked for a Constitution."
"None of them have been properly involved in the EU elite's plans to transfer electoral power to Brussels."
"In the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we agreed, with 22 votes in favour and 3 against, to call upon all the countries, where possible, to hold referendums."
"The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities supports that decision wholeheartedly."
"Take that decision now, for it is only when people know that they are to vote on the plans that they begin to take an interest. When matters become serious, people get involved in them."
"If all the EU countries make up their minds to hold referendums at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament in June, we shall have the opportunity to hold the first common European debate."
"It will then become apparent whether we can also reach a common conclusion."
"I hope and believe that the voters will reject the draft prepared under President Giscard d'Estaing's fairly authoritarian leadership, referred to as consensus."
"I collected 200 signatures with a view to reversing the procedure so that it might begin with openness."
"My petition was signed by all the elected representatives from the national parliaments and supported by all the Members of the European Parliament apart from Mr Duhamel. What was requested does not, however, form part of the final report."
"I collected 123 signatures with a view to ensuring that all the countries should continue to have Commissioners. No such arrangement is, however, part of the consensus."
"We have instead obtained a division into Commissioners with and without voting rights - a proposal that was not submitted to, or discussed in, the Convention until the very end."
"The main thrust of the draft Constitution is to transfer much more power from our parliamentary democracies to the Brussels of the officials and lobbyists."
"It will soon be impossible for our countries' electorates to change many decisions that can at present be overturned by voters in elections."
"Our democracies are being vigorously pruned back, and the national parliaments are surrendering power to a degree not matched by the additional influence acquired by the European Parliament."
"If democracy is to be cut back, the decision to do so should at least be taken democratically by the voters themselves in referendums."
"Let us therefore call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to urge all the countries to hold referendums."
"Why not, moreover, prepare two different proposals, namely a democratic federal constitution and a draft treaty for a Europe of the democracies."
"In that way, we can safely let the European voters take the decision about our common future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the past few days we have seen our Heads of State or Government go up, one by one, to the platform at the United Nations, but Europe has not."
"I think that this image is enough to avoid long debates and, above all, to say what this Constitution lacks."
"This Constitution is, without a doubt, the result of laborious institutional bricolage, difficult to explain and even more difficult to understand and, as a result, little liked."
"It is a complicated work, complex and, I fear, ineffectual."
"There are indisputable improvements as regards the internal sectors relating to the citizens of Europe or to our lives - those sectors that have been defined as collateral - but the issue that this Constitution does not address or resolve is defining the role, the responsibility, the resources and the procedures necessary to make Europe not only what it is already - a great economic power - but also what it should be, namely a responsible political player on the world stage."
"We did not even attempt to respond to this."
"The Constitution conveys the image of an introverted Europe, of an inward-looking Europe, which is, of course, concerned about the well-being of its own citizens but is not giving itself structures, procedures, commitments or anything at all to help it discharge its responsibilities - which it does have - beyond its borders."
"We are not even giving ourselves the instruments to respond to this need for Europe, this appeal to Europe, this demand for Europe - that is so strong in so many parts of the world, from the near east to the southern shores of the Mediterranean - to this need for European values, to be a partner in essentially fairer development which is based more on human, civil and political rights."
"We condemn ourselves with this Constitution to always and in all cases being towed along by others - grumbling, of course."
"It is all too easy, but, above all, I think it goes against the spirit and goals of Europe and, in particular, our duties as Europeans towards peoples that, even although not European, are our neighbours."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as a longstanding and ever more convinced federalist, for the sake of political realism, for love of the Europe that should be able to draw strength from its own successes to promote other successes, at least in neighbouring countries, I believe that this Constitution is a lost opportunity; an opportunity lost that others will suffer for."
"It may be that we Europeans will improve our standard of living, but others will suffer for our small-minded actions, our great mediocrity, precisely because we have decided to remain merely a great economic power."
"That is not enough."
"This is not what being European means, at least not for me!"
"Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control welcomes the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos and congratulates the rapporteurs on it."
"Our opinion sets out a few points from our area of activity on which we would like clarification."
"The first is that, in line with its institutional status, the Court of Auditors should be included among the institutions listed in the draft constitution, and its functions should be set out more clearly later on in it."
"Secondly, the giving of discharge - including to the agencies - should be referred to under the Budgetary and Financial Principles, in order to make it clearer that it is Parliament that exercises democratic control."
"Thirdly, as regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor, we recommend, on the basis of the original motion put to the Convention by Parliament's delegation, that the establishment of this public prosecutor's office be put in clear terms rather than being left as an optional provision, and that the present unanimity principle in the Council be replaced by the legislative procedure, in other words, by qualified majority voting."
"We believe that these recommendations would help bring about a Europe of freedom, security and justice in the Constitution."
"- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the development of European public law, from the Treaties of Westphalia to the Treaty establishing the European Community, allows us to today accept an innovative idea, once unimaginable, of a constitutional Treaty that brings together characteristics of a Treaty in some parts and those of a constitution in other parts."
"The draft that we are examining today represents a great step forwards, in particular, in the field of constructing a single European area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is a step forwards because the Community method is, for the most part, used in this area, a method which should be the only decision-making method in a federal Europe since it respects the values of democracy and the rule of law, both founded on the principle that laws must be approved by representatives of the people, and, consequently, that European laws must be approved by the European Parliament."
"Furthermore, it respects the criterion that decisions must be taken by qualified majority voting, which enhances unity, whilst unanimity breeds particularism and divisions: where this method is adopted Europe moves towards the future; where the exclusive power of governments remains, Europe returns to its past, its tragic past."
"Mr President, although the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sees the extension of the codecision procedure as being, in principle, much to be welcomed, we do not believe that this goes far enough, as it leaves out policy areas that are crucial to the functioning of the internal market and of the economic and monetary union."
"It is particularly to be regretted that the simplification of procedures even diminishes the status of joint consultation, as the cooperation procedures have been made merely consultative."
"We are therefore, of course, less than satisfied, particularly in the areas of competition policy or fiscal policy, which are of immediate relevance to the internal market."
"I would also like to point out, though, that we would have liked to see the appointment of a Minister for Economic Affairs, which would, in particular, have enabled us - especially in the euro zone - to make a qualitative leap in terms of how we implement the Lisbon objectives."
"I also think it regrettable that we have not been able to get the Lisbon process constitutionalised, which means that this new Constitutional Treaty cannot be described as a real European economic constitution."
"I would, however, like to welcome the way in which the EU's values and objectives are seen as conditional upon sustainable growth, full employment, solidarity and the social market economy, competition and freedom."
"Mr President, the opinion expressed by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the European Constitution and the next Intergovernmental Conference takes a very positive view of the contributions made by the Convention in the field of its competences, and it has expressed this in a document approved virtually unanimously by its members."
"The Convention has certainly done good work and it must be congratulated on it."
"I would like to highlight three points, two positive and one not quite so positive."
"On the one hand, the consolidation, as an exclusive competence of the Union, of the common trade policy, which represents a step forward, and which, it must be said, will increase the participation of the European Parliament's work in this field."
"Secondly, by consolidating the concept of the European Research Area, we will be able to tackle the deficiencies we Europeans have in this field."
"Perhaps our only complaint is the fact that the Convention has not decided to integrate the Euratom Treaty into the text of the Constitution, which means that, in this field, there will continue to be an intergovernmental approach, with all the problems that causes."
". Mr President, it is a little difficult to give an opinion on this when half my colleagues seem to believe that there is no point in giving an opinion because we cannot alter the Convention text."
"However, for what it is worth, I would just say the following."
"In many ways the European Union already exercises maximum powers in the area covered by my committee: we have codecision and qualified majority voting."
"However, there are certain lessons we can draw from our experience."
"The main lesson that I would draw - which is not embodied in the Convention text - is that we need to be much more careful that we adopt legislation that is put into force."
"Therefore we need to build into the Constitution or Constitutional Treaty an absolute requirement for the three institutions - the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament - to provide cost-benefit impact assessments of the amendments which they propose for legislation."
"Unless we do that, we shall continue to adopt legislation which all countries agree with, but which in some countries is ignored and which a lot of countries cannot afford."
"This will become much more important with the enlargement of the European Union to include a lot of very poor countries."
"As it is, if we go on with the expectations that we are arousing but cannot fulfil, we will not do Europe or Europe's consumers any good."
"."
"Mr President, the fisheries sector is in crisis."
"The common fisheries policy has been an abject failure: the core objectives of the CFP were to save jobs and conserve fish stocks, but thousands of jobs have been destroyed and fish stocks have collapsed."
"In the name of conservation, our fishermen have been forced to dump two million tonnes of prime dead fish back into the sea every year to comply with the quota scheme."
"In the name of conservation, our fishermen have suffered tie-ups, lay-offs, emergency closures, decommissioning and plunging incomes."
"We are struggling now to reform the CFP and to stop the final collapse of the industry in the North Sea and other key sectors."
"It is therefore of paramount importance that fisheries policy is highlighted."
"The committee was alarmed that the Convention seemed to attach fisheries policy to agriculture as a mere appendage."
"For the hundreds of thousands of people who work in the sector throughout the EU, we are not an appendage to agriculture: we are a major sector."
"Please ensure that our bid for codecision-making powers in the Committee on Fisheries is endorsed."
"Please also ensure that we can start playing a meaningful role in the future of the industry."
". (NL) Mr President, the Treaties should include a legal basis for European tourism policy."
"This has for years been the view of the majority on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and I might add that I do not share it."
"The reason for this request is the following: for a considerable number of regions in the European Union, the tourism industry forms an important, if not the most important, source of income, just as agriculture or industry do in other regions."
"Many businesses in the tourism industry are small and medium-sized enterprises and would already benefit from regulations for this category."
"Nevertheless, it is expected that a Community tourism policy would provide extra support for the industry's sustainable development."
"Prosperity in the relevant regions would increase, thereby benefiting economic and social cohesion."
"As such, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism would request that a legal basis for European tourism policy be included in the new Treaty."
"- (DA) Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities had a lot of reservations from the beginning about the work of the Convention, simply for the reason that only 17% of the Convention's members were women."
"Whether or not the deputies were counted alongside the members proper, the same result was produced."
"What is more, the average age in the Praesidium was 53, the members concerned being men. There was only one woman, who might almost be regarded as a female hostage."
"Our reservations remained intact when we saw the first draft."
"There was absolutely no mention of equality, 'mainstreaming' or anything at all along those lines."
"Fortunately, things went well in the end."
"Equality was made one of the fundamental values, and I should like to take the opportunity also to thank all those who have contributed to the Convention's success."
"There is still a lot to be done, and I wish to emphasise that, if the constitutional Treaty is implemented, there are still areas of relevance in terms of equality where matters are not perfect. That is something of which I should like to ask everyone - the Commission, the Council and the representatives of the European Parliament - to be aware."
"Mr President, in ten days' time yet another Intergovernmental Conference will get under way."
"The European Union seems to be in a state of permanent IGC."
"Over the last 16 years we have had the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty and, more recently, the Nice Treaty."
"In each case there has been an inevitable process of one-way integration, a sense that the European Union can only be successful if it acquires more and more power."
"And yet the peoples of Europe meanwhile have been increasingly registering their disillusionment with the European political process, through record low turnouts in European elections."
"There is a dilemma here for us and cause for concern."
"This IGC is leading to something quite different from past treaties."
"It will seek for the first time to create a constitution for the European Union."
"The draft constitutional Treaty increases the centralising and integrating agenda which has been the hallmark of European development in recent years."
"We should be going back to first principles."
"At Laeken, the Heads of State and Government called for better and clearer definitions of the EU's competences, simplification of legal instruments, greater democracy, greater transparency and efficiency and for European institutions to be brought closer to the citizens."
"It is all a far cry from what the Convention has proposed; and now we are being asked to ensure that the IGC does not undermine the Convention in any way."
"It is back to that same old message: Europe must deepen its integration or risk going backwards."
"It is time for a reality check and perhaps Sweden warned us of that."
"The European Union is in real danger of moving way ahead of what the people of Europe want."
"For those like me and my party, who believe in membership of the European Union and in a Europe of nation states cooperating closely together, this rush to integration that is represented in the Convention paper risks a backlash from the electorate."
"I fear that Europe could be facing a crisis of legitimacy."
"First we were told by the British Government that there was no need for a constitution."
"Now in Britain we are told such a constitution is essential."
"Next we are told that the IGC was a mere tidying-up exercise."
"Then Mr Blair in the UK started signalling furiously that there were redline issues for him in the IGC - on tax, on defence and social security."
"But according to reports published over the weekend he has sold out on these as well."
"My party has a simple and democratic answer to the twisting and tortured approach of the Prime Minister and his government to the IGC, and that is to give the British people a referendum."
"Let them decide whether this further leap forward towards a federal Europe is in fact what they want."
"If a referendum is good enough for the peoples of Ireland, Spain and other nations, then I believe it is good enough for the people of the United Kingdom and polls indicate that 80% of people in the UK want it."
"The IGC will debate a fundamental shift in the power balance between nation states and the institutions of the European Union."
"I fear that railroading through a constitutional change of such magnitude at such a late stage in the enlargement process could lead to further disaffection and disillusionment amongst the people of the accession states and of the current 15."
"Finally, we in this Parliament have a duty to represent the interests of our electors."
"By supporting the motion for a resolution in its unamended form we send a signal that the political élite knows what is best for our electors."
"That is a dangerous message in election year."
"Mr President, over and above the initial brief comments that were heard in this House on 3 September 2003, Parliament can now give a much fuller opinion on the draft Constitution adopted by the Convention."
"It can do this thanks to the careful and impartial analysis provided by the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos: an analysis advocating turning to account of all the innovations, progress and potential offered by the Convention's draft."
"It is therefore clear why Parliament is urging the Intergovernmental Conference straight out to do justice to the Convention's result."
"I would like to add that we are particularly sensitive to the importance and the emotion of this historic process: the birth of a European Constitution, which was the dream of Altiero Spinelli."
"The draft supported by him and adopted by this Parliament almost 20 years ago laid the foundations with vision."
"This must not, however, prevent us from assessing the text issued by the Convention objectively, to take note of its shortcomings, contradictions and uncertainties."
"Indeed Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Degado and Mr Tsatsos did not fail to mention them in their report, they did not shirk their responsibility to point them out with the necessary critical spirit."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the basic problem is not that Parliament is dissatisfied that certain positions and proposals have not been accepted, but the danger that the EU will not be capable of addressing the challenges awaiting it properly."
"It is with this in mind that we urge the Intergovernmental Conference to reflect, to look at every possible way of increasing the coherence of the draft Constitution and to prevent any distortion of it, so as to avoid any steps backwards."
"Parliament, through its Committee on Constitutional Affairs, will follow the Intergovernmental Conference with the utmost attention and vigilance."
"The approach that we have chosen to adopt is highly constructive, not uncritical and very responsible, and I believe that there must be no contrast between our attitude and that taken by the Commission, although that is not to deny the distinction between the two institutions or their independence."
"The Italian Presidency can count on their united efforts to stand up to the pressure from those governments that want to reopen negotiations because, Mr Antonione, there have already been negotiations in the Convention and to reopen them on the fundamental issues would make the Conference unmanageable."
"I hope that the Italian Presidency will show itself to be consistent and firm."
"Mr President, I think that all those of us who are well disposed towards the Convention should go out and pull no punches in making the fact public."
"There are some who criticise the Convention, but I think that most of us in the House today can see that the Convention method has worked. It is a success, and it has come to stay."
"There is, in actual fact, talk of a democratic step forward, and that is something we should emphasise."
"It is not perfect, but it is a democratic advance in relation to all the previous Intergovernmental Conferences."
"Moreover, the fact that we have had this broad debate is a sound foundation for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"There are some who thought that the people should have been more fully involved."
"That is possibly the case, but people cannot perhaps be expected to run around discussing constitutional treaties in the middle of their everyday lives."
"That is of course, in a way, what they have elected ourselves, as MEPs, to do."
"We have, however, devised, in this House, a number of basic conditions that would enable people to be involved more fully."
"I shall mention a couple of these conditions."
"First of all, simplification would in itself make it easier for people to take an interest and to understand the Treaty and European development."
"Secondly, we have now brought about a situation which the basis of values on which we operate in Europe has been defined in detail."
"This is a very good thing, bringing the EU closer to the people and increasing their understanding."
"The fact that we have arranged for the practical political objectives of our cooperation to be specified is also of great value to people."
"I think, too, that we in Parliament can safely say that there are no other regions in the world that have those values and objectives underpinning their political cooperation."
"It is quite simply splendid."
"The third good thing is that the national parliaments are now being given greater responsibility than they had previously, and the fourth is, of course, that those of us in Parliament are now obliged, in very practical terms, to follow up matters in all our work, irrespective of the subject."
"I can quote, as an example, Mr Cashman's report, which we shall be debating later."
"Last of all, I wish to refer to one matter that was not mentioned."
"We found no solution to the problem of our two homes."
"We did not resolve the basic issue, namely that the European Parliament itself must decide where it will hold its sessions. That, moreover, is an issue that I should very much like to call upon the Italian Presidency to address."
"I know it is difficult, but we shall never obtain proper acceptance of European work if the Members of the European Parliament chase around as they do at present."
"Mr President, despite the highly polarised positions that were taken up, the Convention has produced a draft Constitution that possesses relative internal consistency."
"As a member of the Convention, I supported the outcome of the proceedings with its overall content in mind, although, like others, I was unable to assent to all the statements made."
"What will come out of all this is, for the first time in the history of European integration, a European constitution establishing a framework within which many millions of people in over twenty-five states can live together; that is what is really significant."
"I see it as a positive thing that the EU as a whole will become more democratic, that progress has been made in the separation of the powers, that Parliament will be given more rights and that referendums will be introduced."
"It is also very important to me that the EU can become more social, although this presupposes that we stick to the goals and values set out in Part I. What that means is that, if we are to have the social mission, as incorporated in the Convention's draft, the Intergovernmental Conference must resist the European Central Bank's insistence that this provision be revised."
"Above all else, the Intergovernmental Conference must complete the work that the Convention ended up being unable to do."
"That is a matter of political and legal obligation."
"How are the public to understand a constitutional document that presents them - and I know I am exaggerating - with two different economic philosophies: on the one hand, the social market economy, balanced economic growth and full employment; on the other hand, an open market economy with free competition and merely a high level of employment?"
"I might add that the same applies to other aspects."
"This makes it important that Amendment No 3 be adopted today and that this House should give the Intergovernmental Conference a clear mandate to do away with the inconsistencies between Part III and Part I."
"I would also like to say in unmistakeable terms that I reject all those provisions intended to develop the European Union as a military and interventionist power."
"That is not Europe's way of emancipating itself from American hegemony; it will be by way of civil conflict resolution and civil conflict prevention that the European Union will become a respected partner on the international stage."
"Nor is it acceptable for the Constitution to oblige the Member States to enhance their military capacities at the same time as there is no more money available for social security expenditure, pensions or education, and while new indebtedness is reaching dizzying levels."
"I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference should also be guided by the ideals and the spirit of the Convention."
"It is because the public have a right to see how the second stage of the constitutional process proceeds that the governments should hold their sessions in public and in a transparent manner."
"Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of those who dream of a truly united Europe of regions and peoples, a Europe that the proposed constitution will not bring about."
"As is stated in the Tsatsos report, it is a major step in the Union's democratisation process, but we are still not developing into the decisive and transparent Europe that can play a role on the world stage and inspire confidence in its own citizens."
"Sovereignty only rests with a few Member States that boast their own constitutional structure."
"The diversity of languages and cultures is only recognised within the Member States that grant this recognition."
"The regions that have constitutional authority are witnessing the accession to the EU of some ten new Member States, some of which are smaller than those of their own regions that possess constitutional powers, such as Flanders, Scotland, Catalonia, Wales, and so on. These sovereign states may even be less willing to work towards the establishment of a real Union."
"This will become clear shortly in the IGC."
"However, the small states are also our allies."
"I would like to urge them to help defend the result that has been achieved in this convention."
"At least a certain balance has been achieved in these texts."
"There is a certain unity in diversity, but we should, above all, continue to uphold these latter aspects together."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate my colleagues Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos for the report they have presented to us today."
"The draft Treaty presented to our EU leaders in Thessaloniki forms the basis for discussions on a final agreed text at European Union level."
"The vast majority of people agree that the European Union must change the procedures it uses if it is to become a more effective political body in a Community of 25 Member States."
"The discussions that will take place on 4 October will be the next phase of these important negotiations."
"The model for decision-making within the Union dates back, in part, to when the European Economic Community was a six-Member organisation in the late 1950s."
"This is an inadequate structure in a Community of over 25 Member States."
"I believe in the principle of equality between small and large Member States."
"In particular I believe that representation within the European Commission should be based on a system of strict equality between small and large states."
"I support the continuation of each Member State of the Union having the right to appoint a nominee as a full voting member of the European Commission."
"It is important also that the precise role of the European Union President / President of the European Council is clearly specified in the new Treaty."
"Equally I welcome the fact that the new Treaty will define the powers between the European Commission itself and the individual Member States of the Union."
"I have some reservations in the context of the negotiations in the IGC."
"The issue of taxation must remain the preserve and remit of the individual Member States' governments."
"I do not believe that support from the citizens of the Union for the EU extends to the area of deciding taxation levels in Europe."
"Ever since the European Convention was set up, however, extensive negotiations and discussions have taken place across all elements of European Union society."
"Over the coming months we must approach these negotiations with firm determination so that an agreement can be secured on a text for the final Treaty, which hopefully would govern the operation of the Union for the next 50 years."
"Mr President, the vote in Sweden is a clear illustration of the political and economic situation in which, with three wealthy countries like Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark outside the euro, we are preparing to launch the European Constitution."
"It will not, I fear, succeed in stopping the process that seeks to cancel out national and regional potential but, rather, it will advance the construction of a European superstate governed by a stateless technocracy which will go wherever globalisation takes it."
"A European Constitution, especially today with the serious challenge represented by China - which, in addition to its products, has succeeded in imitating even the logo of the European Union - should, instead, provide for the reintroduction of customs duties and limits to protect our production, in particular to protect the system of small and medium sized enterprises and our agrifood production."
"It should, first and foremost, enshrine the value of the protection and development of our cultural identities to preserve an ethno-cultural, historical and linguistically unique heritage in the world."
"For us citizens of Padania, it is unacceptable that a European Constitution should, instead of drawing its inspiration from the historical root of Charlemagne, appear to take the euro-dollar relationship as its only spiritual guiding principle."
"It should, instead, lay claim to its own Christian roots with pride, in particular in the face of the grave danger of creeping Islamicisation."
"Furthermore, it is unacceptable that there should be no specific reference to the rights of peoples, even though those rights have been confirmed in various UN resolutions, or, in particular, to the principle of self-determination of peoples - inalienable for us citizens of Padania - and that has called forth legitimate protests from representatives of non-Italian ethnic groups in the Italian State, including the Sardinians and the people of the Valle d'Aosta and South Tyrol."
"Sixty years on from the Declaration of Chivasso, the historic document marking the birth of federalism drawn up 19 December 1943 - particularly difficult times for Europe and for our country - by representatives from the Valle d'Aosta, the Waldensians and the people of Provençe to protect the regional cultures against centralism from Rome, we cannot endorse a Constitution that ignores the rights of peoples and regions if we want to respect the ideals of these fathers."
"Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference that will open in Rome on 4 October represents an extraordinary opportunity for the whole of the European Union, for almost 500 million citizens that are, at last, calling for institutions that are more in touch with the people than they have been to date."
"It would be an extremely serious political error to allow the IGC to fail and not to give Europe its first Constitution."
"I am an optimist and I am personally convinced that no one will want to be responsible for undoing the work of the Convention and for wiping out the hope of having a Europe that is politically strong and independent at last, a Europe that can play the part of the power required to balance an international situation dominated today by the United States, with the prospect of an increase in China's power in the future."
"Let us be clear: we believe in a more influential Europe which is independent from the United States but, at the same time, a friend and ally of a country and a people that have also made a decisive contribution to ensuring freedom and democracy in our continent."
"I share the opinion of the Italian Presidency and those who believe that the structure adopted by the Convention cannot be radically changed."
"Perfection is the enemy of good: pursuing unfeasible projects would mean not achieving the goal towards which we are all striving."
"It would be very serious, as you have said here, Mr Antonione, to accept substantial compromises and I welcome this opportunity - as a Member of the European Parliament - to thank the Italian Presidency for its endeavours to ensure that this House is represented in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I therefore endorse the line taken in the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgrado and Mr Tsatsos regarding the need for the European Parliament to play an important role, and I hope that other countries will follow the advice of the Italian Presidency and rally round to support the commitment taken in this House by President Berlusconi."
"Some corrections will, of course, have to be made to the text adopted by the Convention, such as, for example, an increase in the number of areas where decisions can be made by qualified majority voting and the need to reach agreement on the number and role of Commissioners."
"Then, it would be a serious historical error, Mr President, to exclude any reference to Europe's Judaeo-Christian roots."
"I am not saying that we should renounce the secular nature of the institutions; on the contrary, we would be reinforcing this inalienable characteristic, remembering the command given in the gospels to 'give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's'."
"It is appropriate here to recall the words of many laymen - I am thinking here of the philosopher, Norberto Bobbio, the philosopher, Benedetto Croce - who insisted on the role and the importance of religions in the history and growth of Europe."
"How can we fail to mention a great painter such as Marc Chagall, a European painter, Jewish, who also devoted himself to depicting the spirituality of Europeans, and who confirmed that painters have dipped their brushes into that colourful alphabet of hope that are the Sacred Scriptures."
"Turning now to those who are forming ranks to oppose this choice, I would also like to recall the words of Chancellor Schroeder, who stated in the Bundestag that he was not against inserting the reference to Judaeo-Christian roots into the Constitutional Treaty."
"A Europe that wants to explore new horizons, called upon to bring together new citizens of different religions, really cannot afford to erase its own roots."
"Mr President, we cannot explore new horizons if we do not know where we came from."
"Mr President, subject to a few amendments, my Group fully supports the motion for a resolution put before us and so ably drafted by the rapporteurs, Mr Tsatsos and Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado."
"The great challenge facing us now is to get the Constitution through the IGC without it being dismantled bit by bit."
"That is why we welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution which we will adopt is not calling for significant changes to the draft Constitution."
"Of course it rightly expresses some criticisms: it highlights shortcomings in the Constitution."
"However, this is done to show that we too have compromised to achieve this result."
"The package that has been agreed in the Constitution is, nonetheless, one that takes the European Union forward in a number of ways as regards democracy, efficiency, transparency and understandability of the Union."
"It therefore deserves to be adopted by the IGC."
"There are dangers lurking."
"There are governments - Spain, for instance - which object to the system of double majority in the Council and want to revert to the Nice system, which is complex, not understandable and not a very sensible system."
"Why should we accept a retrograde move to allow one or more governments to preserve what is, frankly, an unfair system?"
"There are governments that want to reopen the question of the composition of the Commission."
"I, too, have some doubts about the formula of the Commission."
"However, I recognise that it is part of a wider compromise that was achieved in the IGC."
"The key question is: what is the remedy for this?"
"If we move to one Commissioner per Member State and one vote per Commissioner, would we not be turning the Commission into a sort of Coreper, an intergovernmental body?"
"That is not what the role of the Commission should be."
"I also oppose those who wish to make a reference to religion in the Constitution."
"We are a Union of diverse religions, of religious pluralism."
"There are people in our Union who are not religious."
"We should not impose a particular view on religion in the Constitution."
"That would be a form of cultural imperialism."
"Finally, I turn to the issue of a referendum."
"It is not up to the European Union to tell its Member States what procedure they should use internally to ratify a treaty setting up a constitution."
"That is a matter for each Member State in accordance with its Constitution and its traditions."
"Therefore I oppose the position taken by Mr Evans and others that this Parliament should tell Member States what procedure they should use to ratify and we will be seeking to amend that paragraph accordingly."
"Mr President, in my opinion it is a positive sign that the Convention's proposals strengthen cooperation between the Council and governments in Union decision-making."
"The weakest link in the proposed new Treaty is the proposals concerning the Council."
"Although many objected beforehand to the establishment of new institutions, the Convention is actually proposing that two new institutions should be created."
"The European Council is to be considered as a separate institution, and it is being proposed that it should have an external President."
"Both proposals are the wrong ones."
"The Council must be considered in the new Treaty as a single institution, and a prime minister or president who is in office must be elected as its long-term President."
"The Presidencies of Councils of Ministers for the various areas of policy must be shared among the representatives of more than one country. The Presidencies must be for two and a half years, and the Member States must be treated impartially when assigning them."
"Such a reform of the Council would correspond to the proposals that Secretary General of the European Council, Javier Solana, made over a year ago."
"They must be given consideration in the Intergovernmental Conference, as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party proposes in Amendment No 28."
"Mr President, I endorse the readings and proposals of our two rapporteurs."
"As they themselves said, there are negative points and there are obstacles which we shall find in our path towards unification and which we shall have to overcome in order to cast an informed vote."
"One of these is the reform process."
"It is impossible for half the Treaty, 150 articles in part three, to have a non-revisable status, because that is where we shall end up with the provisions which we are planning; in other words, policies will be regime."
"That is impossible."
"It goes against every political development of Europe in every direction."
"Secondly, we cannot proceed with the budget as it is being configured today."
"We are making a clownish trick here of what we teach our first-year economics students."
"How can we have a budget which says, 'here is your money, now decide what policies you are going to introduce', instead of saying what policies we want and then seeing what budget will serve them?"
"Third point: the Convention itself did not accept nor, I imagine, will the Intergovernmental Conference proceed with the concept of the Ministers for Finance."
"Where is the cohesion of the eurozone, the symmetry between economic and monetary policy, to come from?"
"Where will the real hard core of the European Union come from, if not from here?"
"I think that it is a huge mistake and we shall find that too in our path."
"The same applies to the timidity on issues of security and defence."
"My honourable friend Mr Cossutta said as much, I shall not repeat him."
"Allow me to comment on one last issue, the reference to religions."
"I fail to understand which religions they wish to cite as being of value."
"Or why we need to refer to what is indeed the important history of Christianity but not, for example, to the history of free thinking?"
"Or even of anti-clericalism, which inspired the Enlightenment, which inspired revolutions and intellectuals and policies in Europe."
"Or why we should not refer to the big names?"
"For me, the face of Europe is Aristotle, it is Erasmus, it is Mozart, it is Marx, it is Freud."
"Are we going to impose them on our citizens?"
"Let us allow our citizens a pluralistic choice for their future lives and careers."
"Perhaps this pluralism will be the real face of Europe."
"Mr President, this Constitution does not reflect the thoughts, hopes and aspirations of ordinary people."
"It does nothing for jobs or economic growth and widens further still the democratic deficit."
"The gap between the governors and the governed is now a gaping chasm."
"Those who wish to force this Constitution upon the peoples of Europe should pause for thought."
"If national governments attempt to pass this without consulting the people, it will be a constitutional abomination."
"Worse still, it is a very dangerous thing to do because when people realise that voting in general elections can change nothing - because the power has been given away - what are they left with?"
"All they are left with is to resort to civil disobedience, and civil disobedience can quickly break down into civil disorder."
"Free and fair referendums must be held in every Member State or you will unleash the very nationalism that the EU was supposed to stop."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos, for their excellent analysis and their report on the Convention's activities."
"I am also indebted to the Italian Presidency for its constructive approach, and Commissioner Barnier, who, together with Commissioner Vitorino, played such a key role in the Convention."
"For me, the work that I have done on behalf of our Parliament in the Convention is the single most important piece of work that I have done in my career in the European Parliament that has spanned twenty years."
"To work on a constitution for twenty-five, and soon perhaps thirty, European Member States, is to work on an important part of our common history."
"When we consider Europe's violent past, we realise all the more that it is a very big step in the right direction, one that should bring peace and development to present and future generations."
"Does this now mean that the work that has been done is complete?"
"No, but perfection is not in any case within the grasp of human beings."
"We can, however, establish that the Convention has achieved more than the amendments to the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice together."
"This is why the model of the Convention should be preserved also in future."
"We now know that a Convention achieves a great deal more than the normal IGC."
"I will quote five positive elements: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has been incorporated in the constitution, which also includes a sound anti-discrimination clause."
"The Union's constitutional standards and values as a community of law have been laid down effectively."
"In the relationship between the Council, Commission and Parliament, transparency and democratic procedures have now taken centre stage, and Parliament has been granted sound powers in terms of codecision legislation whereby decision-making by majority has become the rule."
"The whole legislative system and process have become a lot simpler and more transparent, with more openness in the Council, as a result of which the Council has now, in my opinion, taken on the character of a Senate."
"The concept of subsidiarity is expressed far more effectively through the national and also regional parliaments being given their own roles to play in the European decision-making processes, so that the Union's activities can be carried out a great deal closer to the European citizen."
"As I have already said, the result is good, but it is not perfect."
"The shortcomings I should like to mention are the lack of a qualified majority in the decision-making process on foreign policy, trade agreements and financial perspectives."
"Furthermore, I take the view that every Member State should retain its own Commissioner."
"These shortcomings, however, are not so serious that we cannot be positive about the document."
"I sincerely hope that the Heads of Government will reach agreement about this Constitution before Christmas, so that we can equip ourselves with this document for the European elections, and can add the positive judgments of the European citizens to it."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen, you started your speech by thanking everyone for their contributions to the Convention."
"I should like to thank you for your contribution to this House."
"I understand that this is the last speech you will make to the House."
"We appreciate your work over the many years you have been a Member here."
"Mr President, the draft Constitution is good for the whole of the Union and for each of its Member States, because it benefits the citizens by making the Union more effective in terms of resolving its people's aspirations and by doing so in a more democratic way, thereby increasing its legitimacy."
"The Convention was a success."
"In a transparent fashion, it enshrined a broad consensus in the draft Constitution, a solid balance which involves this Parliament, the Commission and the national parliaments and governments, which undoubtedly moves the European Union forward."
"We are undergoing a Constitution-building process, of which the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) must be one stage, and it must not dilute or reduce the fundamental content of the main progress made in the draft Constitution."
"These include the Charter of Fundamental Rights of a binding nature, the legislative procedure as a general rule, the extension of the qualified majority, the creation of institutional figures - such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs - who are clearly useful, the progress on justice and home affairs and, of course, the Convention as an essential method for future constitutional reform."
"We would have liked more progress: for example, greater extension of the qualified majority, for there to be no exceptions to the legislative procedure, a strengthening of economic and social government, or more flexible constitutional ratification or revision procedures, but we can achieve all of this through future constitutional development, on the basis of a co-relationship between clearly Europeanist forces."
"In order for the IGC to be a success, furthermore, it must properly resolve the problems which are still on the table. One example of this is achieving an institutional balance within which each country is suitably represented."
"All the governments must contribute to achieving this, doing so with the same agreement-seeking spirit which existed in the Convention, strengthening the consensus in it and in the whole of the draft Constitution."
"Governments, the Commission, the national parliaments and we, in the European Parliament, must send a positive message to the citizens so that they support this Constitution and, if possible, do so by means of a referendum."
"There is no doubt that the text of this report sends this message; we therefore congratulate and support the rapporteurs and their text."
"Mr President, on a point of order, with your permission I should like to draw the House's attention to the fact that we have in the official gallery the President of the Chilean Christian Democratic Party, Senator Adolfo Zaldívar."
"Chile is, as you know, a country with which we have one of the most far-reaching association agreements for trade and we in the House should extend our normal welcome to Senator Zaldívar."
"The Senator is most welcome to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed European Constitution represents undeniable progress in the process of European construction and I fully agree with the assessment of my colleague from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, Mr Andrew Duff, in this regard."
"However, we Catalan Members from Convergencia i Unió will abstain."
"The reason is that an aspect which is fundamental to us, and I believe also to many European citizens, has not been considered as fully as we had asked for."
"The peoples of Europe who are identifiable as stateless nations, or in regions with a strong personality and sense of identity, have not been associated in the manner we called for."
"It is true that the draft Constitution takes up certain principles which we believe to be valid, but it does not include the guarantees we called for in order to associate the regions with full legislative powers with the European institutions, nor does it guarantee that they have access to the Court of Justice, nor does it ensure the inclusion in its linguistic system of languages which are official in the Member States."
"That means that a language such as Catalan - which will be the eighth most widely-spoken in the enlarged Union - lacks and will lack the Union's official recognition and there will be no guarantee that it will have it."
"I would insist that we recognise the positive elements of this Constitution and the inclusion of the principles relating to cultural and linguistic diversity and the principle of subsidiarity for the regions, which we believe to be very important, and a modest degree of progress in terms of the competences of the Committee of the Regions."
"However, for the reasons I have given, we shall reserve our definitive vote for the result of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, under the Constitution the present European Union will be abolished and in its place a new one will be established, which, according to the Constitution, reflects the will of the people and states."
"We know how to discover the will of states."
"It is represented by governments and national parliaments."
"The will of the people is not always the same as the will of states, and, to learn what it is, there is no alternative but to have a referendum."
"The fairest course of action would be to arrange one in each Member State separately but on the same day."
"If the subject of a referendum were the Convention's draft Constitution without any amendments to it, I would vote against it and I would urge others to vote the same way."
"The reason is that the Convention worked undemocratically."
"It had a Praesidium, a Politburo-style dictatorship, and the Convention did not vote on the more than 6 000 proposed amendments made by its members or the final outcome."
"The Convention brought about a redistribution of power that favoured the big countries and the Union was militarised."
"The Member States lose their right to a permanent Commissioner with voting rights, and in future will not be able to choose their own Commissioner."
"All candidate Commissioners must be committed to the Europe issue, but what is this Europe issue?"
"It is the issue of federalism."
"The EU is to be made into a federation, and on the last night the Convention, acting against the mandate for a Constitution presented at the Thessaloniki Summit, even adopted the symbols of a federation, with its own flag, anthem and national day."
"Under the Constitution the EU will become militarised."
"That means a new type of military structural cooperation and a declaration under the Constitution that Member States will give each other collective defence guarantees."
"A commander in the Finnish army said that acceptance of this declaration would take Finland into NATO, and that is something our nation will not agree to."
"These are the reasons for saying no to such a constitution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I must say you are right."
"I deplore the weakness of the political message delivered by Parliament's report."
"Clearly, the draft Constitutional Treaty represents an improvement over the Treaty of Nice. It is, however, appropriate to highlight its serious deficiencies."
"If the IGC does not rectify these, they will pose a considerable handicap to the government and future development of a European Union of 27 Member States."
"Maintaining unanimity for decision-making on crucial issues and the procedure for the future revision of treaties are particularly problematic areas."
"On the eve of the IGC, and in view of the positions adopted by governments wishing to renegotiate certain articles of the treaty, the European Commission showed political wisdom. In its remarkable opinion, the Commission underlined the weaknesses of the text and the need to improve it."
"The Commission is sending out the right political signal whereas Parliament is sending out the wrong one. This is why I will vote against the European Parliament report."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention has presented its responses to the questions posed at Laeken in the form of a draft Constitution."
"We are all aware and appreciative of the high quality and lofty ambitions of those responses."
"They are not desultory, but form one body, whose feet are firmly planted on the ground and which is prepared, with great pragmatism, to imagine a responsible and challenging future for Europe."
"The thinking behind the draft on the table is not short-termist or experimental."
"As a Constitution, this text aspires to permanence."
"As the work of human hands, however, it is not perfect or polished."
"It can and should be fine-tuned, as long as its basic equilibrium is maintained."
"The Gil-Robles - Tsatsos report is very clear in that regard."
"The Intergovernmental Conference can and should make the text of the Constitution more coherent, and improve some of its proposals."
"In this connection, I would like to support what the rapporteur, Mr Gil-Robles, and the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, have already said about the problems of the two-tier regime for the composition and functioning of the Commission, which, to my mind, is undesirable because it is inefficient."
"Commissioner Barnier spoke to us a moment ago of nostalgia, warning us that it is not a good guide in politics."
"I can think of no better advice to give the Heads of Government charged with approving the Constitution at the next Intergovernmental Conference, for the process they are currently overseeing is not like previous revisions of the Treaties."
"The Convention was not simply a preparatory phase, as its predecessors were."
"It led to very important political balances and consensuses being achieved, and they should remain intact."
"The Heads of Government, therefore, are obliged to do much better. The responsibility they bear is thus much greater."
"Mr President, the Convention was an assembly of all parliaments, all governments, and the Commission."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is only an assembly of all the governments."
"It is quite clear that, in this historic process of giving Europe a constitution, it is no longer the Intergovernmental Conference that enjoys the greater democratic legitimacy, but the Convention."
"I would therefore see it as quite utterly unacceptable for the Intergovernmental Conference to wreck the political substance and hence the political compromises that the Convention arrived at."
"Few are saying this - although Mr Voggenhuber has done so in very clear language - but the thought is in the minds of many that the issue of whether the Intergovernmental Conference should alter what came out of the Convention, is also a power issue between the governments and parliaments of the European Union."
"It has to be made perfectly clear that any change in what the Convention produced would be a vote of no confidence in the parliaments, which made up a majority in the Convention."
"That would certainly have an effect on the process of ratification, whether that be by the parliaments or by referendum, and hence on public acceptance of the Constitution."
"Commissioner Barnier, you always took a very progressive line in the Convention."
"We did a lot of work together, and we did it well, but now I am disappointed in the Commission, which accepts the position of certain governments rather than that of most of the parliaments, which do not want any alterations to the Convention's draft."
"As I see it, this indicates that the Commission is not up to date."
"Nor do I know what the IGC is meant to produce by way of a positive outcome. You can just imagine how they will again be haggling, the sort of cattle market it will turn into, and things can, in fact, only get worse."
"I am not very confident about all this."
"Finally, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and I were rapporteurs together in Nice, when Parliament demanded much and got little."
"With the Gil-Robles/Tsatsos report, we are now asking for little and hoping to get much, by which I mean that we are hoping that the IGC will change nothing, and that would be a great deal."
"I congratulate Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos on having formulated this in such exact terms in the historic period in which we find ourselves!"
"Mr President, Mr Antonione, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation of and full support for the content of the report under discussion."
"We would obviously have preferred the text proposed by the Convention to be more advanced in terms of the process of integration but we realise that the compromise reached is the only one possible, and it is this that we need to admit by agreeing with President Giscard d'Estaing's statement when, opening the work of the Convention, he said that our unity is the reason for our existence."
"I believe that a text that has such broad backing cannot easily be modified by the Intergovernmental Conference, except in some minor aspects."
"There is, however, only one issue, the most important issue, on which we need to put pressure on the Intergovernmental Conference, namely the rules for the revision of the Constitutional Treaty."
"If every single amendment to the Constitution is to depend on the unanimity of the 25 or 27 - or, in future, even more - Member States, then the risk is that this great step in the history of Europe will ultimately serve to constrain on Europe's future and put an end to its hopes."
"Mr President, as a Euro-enthusiast and a Catalan I should be very disappointed by this draft Constitution."
"Despite the efforts of my fellow Member from Scotland, Mr Neil MacCormick, those of us Parliament terms regionalists did not succeed in having our demands accepted. Our demands were a model of moderation."
"We wanted to be able to participate at a European level as far as our legislative competencies permitted. We wanted the right to submit cases to European jurisdiction to defend the latter."
"We wanted equal language rights and we wanted internal enlargement to be an option."
"For the most part, the Convention kept to the philosophy of the Treaty of Westphalia and the concept of the nation state."
"As a Euro-enthusiast and a Catalan, I should be very disappointed, and yet I am not."
"I am not disappointed because my fellow countrymen from Salses to Guadamar, from Fraga to Maó, have already come to the logical conclusion. The State of Catalonia must be re-established if we are to be able to contribute fully to Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I assure you that the process of enlargement will not stop at the Balkans."
"The day will soon come when my country, having regained its liberty and dignity, will be knocking on this door."
"You will not refuse us entry."
"As you well know, we have been Europeans ever since the days of Charlemagne."
"Mr President, I believe we are experiencing a real crisis of confidence at the European level."
"We need look no further than the overwhelming vote against the euro in Sweden and the stinging defeat suffered by Commissioner Lamy at Cancún. There is also the faintly ridiculous arm-wrestling between the Commission and France over both the Stability Pact and the Alstom affair."
"To cap it all, this draft Constitution is now to be submitted to the Member States."
"For my part, I would not lose sleep over whether to align myself with Parliament, the Commission or the Member States. It seems to me that the problem does not concern relationships between the European institutions."
"Rather, it concerns the relationship between the European institutions and the people of Europe. I therefore think it is essential for a referendum on this draft Constitution to be held in all Member States at the same time as the European elections."
"I urge you to give careful consideration to the options before us."
"If this is a constitution, a referendum is needed. If there is no referendum, it cannot be a constitution."
"Mr President, I shall begin in the same way as many of the previous speakers and thank the rapporteurs."
"Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos have done good work, and so we should endorse what they are basically saying, that is, that the consensus achieved by the Convention should not again be unwrapped."
"There was, though, one area of the Convention's work where consensus was no longer sought, in which a number of the 'more equal' in the praesidium ruthlessly forced through their interests and those of Europe's 'big boys'."
"The issue to which I refer is that of the composition of the Commission, the outcome of which was one to which the small and medium-sized states in the EU cannot say 'yes'."
"A Commission in which not all the Member States were always fully and equally represented would lose the political legitimacy that meant that all the previous Commissions were fully-fledged players in the European Union."
"It might well survive as a perhaps more efficient body, albeit one consisting exclusively of technocrats."
"The Council would then cease to be part of the present balance and would start to assume supreme power."
"That cannot happen; it must not be allowed to happen."
"In the interests of all Europeans, not only of those from the small and medium-sized Member States, we need the IGC to give a different answer on the one point where the Convention's praesidium no longer sought the consensus of all."
"In the interests of all Europeans, we will need, in the future too, a representative and fully-fledged Commission with one Commissioner from each country, one that will carry political weight and really give every one of the EU's citizens the feeling of being equally represented in all the European institutions."
"That is what the IGC must ensure; it should not do much more than that."
"Mr President, 2004 will be the year of the European constitution."
"Despite initial scepticism, the Convention has managed to strike an admirable compromise."
"The constitution will certainly contain things that we in this House would have preferred differently."
"However, the result still deserves our support."
"First of all, I should like to express my surprise at the fact that some, including the Dutch Government, argue in favour of including God - Christianity - in the European constitution."
"If this were done, where would that leave the separation of state and religion, on which modern democracy - the very foundation of our united Europe - is based?"
"Is God not above the law?"
"How can Liberal government parties endorse this?"
"Secondly, we indicated in the resolution that all Member States should hold referendums on the constitution, where possible, according to the constitution, on the day of the European elections."
"I myself am a great supporter of a referendum."
"I think that an important decision about the European constitution cannot be left to Heads of Government alone."
"Such a referendum is likely to take place in my country, the Netherlands, and I am delighted at this, especially now that it transpires that more than 80% of the Dutch population intend to vote."
"Unfortunately, the Dutch Government appears very divided about the referendum and lacks a clear European profile."
"That does nothing to help our citizens; on the contrary, it puts them at a distance."
"Europe achieves too little, is insufficiently transparent, has to contend with a democratic deficit and sometimes interferes in matters that can be dealt with nearer to the citizen."
"These are precisely the areas that we intend to improve by means of this constitution, which allows the European Union to function more effectively and more democratically and which, moreover, gives the EU a social and political dimension, and this is why we ask for the support of our citizens in the referendum."
"Finally, I urge the Heads of Government, and certainly also the Dutch Prime Minister, not to engage in backroom analyses where the constitution is concerned."
"Basic values, social fundamental rights and more democracy must be defended and not weakened by alleged national interests, which would send us back to this cursed backroom in Nice, where the government produced something of little consequence."
"I should like to thank both rapporteurs."
"Let us give Europe back to the citizens."
"Mr President, I will make two remarks on the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil Delgado and Mr Tsatsos, which reflects the hopes but also the fears of this House."
"The first remark relates to the identity of Europe."
"I would mention the words of a great historical liberal: 'Why we cannot help calling ourselves Christians'."
"The reference to Christian roots could help to strengthen the secular nature of a policy which continues to be undermined by indifference and love of power."
"Nevertheless, what we are calling on to unite Europe must not divide it."
"I am, in fact, convinced that the references to the human person and to peace, freedom and democracy, to human rights and to pluralism represent the synthesis in constitutional form of Christian and democratic values that inspired the actions of the founders of the European Community."
"The second remark concerns future revision of a compromise that the Intergovernmental Conference may be able to improve on, without reopening the debate on the institutional balance proposed by the Convention."
"The report condemns the fact that the unanimity of the States continues to apply to the Constitutions' revision procedure, and continues to do so even in the future."
"I believe that the Commission's opinion - mentioned here by Mr Barnier - must be supported, in other words that the IGC should pave the way for more flexible revision procedures that do not allow the right to veto, at least where the non-essential provisions of the Treaty are concerned."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner, everyone is taking up their respective positions and the negotiations are taking shape."
"There are two possible solutions. Either nothing is changed or everything is."
"In the light of the possibility of negotiations being reopened, everyone is hoping to improve everything and running the risk of ruining everything."
"I am aware that in this role-play, some people, including some Members of Parliament are ready to invoke God as a way of obtaining more concessions on other subjects."
"I will let them make their own decisions on this. I do not share this approach to organising our earthly life."
"Everyone is coming to this forum with the 10% they want to change. I also have 10% I would like to change."
"I would like to see more qualified majority voting on social and fiscal matters. This would be the only way to put an end to tax havens and dumping."
"I would also like to see real coordination of economic policies and majority decisions in the field of foreign affairs."
"President-in-Office of the Council , there may actually be another way of tackling these negotiations."
"I shall now test it out."
"We need to establish what we are determined to retain, what we are not prepared to give up."
"I would now like to outline five such issues I am not willing to compromise on."
"The first relates to the fact that I think it is essential to retain the option of those countries engaged in strengthened cooperation to use the enabling clause. This is a technical point but it is important."
"The second issue concerns the status of the Charter. In my view it could be improved but not a great deal."
"The third issue is that of God."
"God has been left out of the scope of the Constitution."
"Unlike Mr Elmar Brok, I want God to be left where he belongs. This means he should be left out of the Constitution."
"The fourth issue is the legal basis for public services."
"This is a crucial point. I do not want any concessions to be made on this."
"Lastly, there is the issue of price stability."
"The ECB seems to have taken up the offensive on this again."
"In this regard, I believe the consensus that has almost been reached on Article 3 on the objectives of the European Union is a reasonable one."
"I therefore propose that God and price stability are left out of all this."
"I wish you good luck."
"President-in-Office of the Council, allow me to suggest that transparency is the key to success."
"If you publish the proposals made by all the parties concerned, you will enjoy more widespread support than you could ever gain with the wheeling and dealing between the representatives of the Heads of State or Government."
"There have, since 1957, been dramatic developments in the ways in which independent European nation states collaborate with each other."
"Just as a planet's gravitational pull captures everything that draws close to it, the courage of six states has resulted in a process of cooperation that has been spreading and becoming more profound right up to the present day."
"No end to this development is in sight, even though we have started to think about where Europe's boundaries lie."
"In business, there is the rule that 'to stand still is to go backwards', which, metaphorically speaking, is also true in politics."
"Thank God we did not stand still as Europe developed politically in the second half of the previous century."
"All our efforts were and still are rewarded by the reunification of Europe in peace and freedom."
"Despite many and varied economic problems, Europe still has the power of a planet to attract others, and many fine words have been said about this already today."
"By means of the Constitutional Treaty, Europe is meant to - indeed it has to - make a qualitative leap if it is to be able to get the better of the challenges that lie ahead."
"This House was right to denounce the outcomes of Nice for failing to do that, as they were entangled in national egoisms."
"The Convention was rightly described as 'constitutional', for its work shows the way ahead, over and above economic cooperation."
"It is on this basis that the Member States' governments can and must show, at the Intergovernmental Conference, whether they are working with the future in mind or are trapped in the behaviour patterns of the past in clinging to national egoisms and national patronage."
"The present text of the Constitutional Treaty points the way to the future."
"It should be changed only to improve what already exists."
"Many of us are concerned that what came out of Nice will not be enough to cope with the imminent enlargement, and that is why - whilst being obliged to the Presidency of the Council for what it has said - I urge the governments to do everything in their power to facilitate the new Treaty's speedy entry into force, so that not too much time elapses between the governments giving their consent and the Treaty's final ratification."
"It is now for you, Europe's Heads of State or Government, to decide whether you want to take Europe forward or stand in its way for your own egoistic and nationalistic reasons."
"Mr President, I would like to join with previous speakers in congratulating the two co-rapporteurs on their excellent summary."
"I acknowledge that the method has proved successful and that real progress has been achieved in comparison to the current treaty."
"Nevertheless, I would like to examine critically the three innate deficiencies of the draft Constitution identified in the Gil-Robles and Tsatsos report as requiring closer scrutiny."
"The election of a President by his or her peers on the European Council marks an unexpected strengthening of the intergovernmental structure. The latter should actually be weakening as Europe moves forward."
"This sort of monarch-president, accountable to nobody, could considerably weaken the Commission and call into question the responsibilities of each institution."
"The Commission has appreciated the danger. In its communication, it lashes out with a damning statement: 'Someone who is not accountable for his/her action to any parliamentary assembly cannot exert influence over the modus operandi of the Council, which is supposed to be transparent and democratic'."
"Mr Barnier, it is for you to act now."
"The second innate deficiency, highlighted by many, concerns the future Commission. It seems that no longer would all Commissioners enjoy the same status."
"It would be a complicated, confused system, and impossible to operate. It would undermine the collegiate system within the Commission."
"The third obvious deficiency is the failure of the Convention on the reform of the CFSP."
"On this matter, the conventioneers have patently failed to meet the expectations of the citizens. No doubt the conventioneers were under extreme pressure from those Member States wishing to deny Europe the right to follow an independent foreign policy."
"The totally unsatisfactory status quo remains."
"It is to be hoped that the IGC will dare to correct this obvious flaw in the new constitutional edifice."
"At the very least, it will be necessary to facilitate strengthened cooperation between those Member States who do not believe the United States of America is their overlord, with control over their bodies and souls."
"The lesson of Iraq must be learnt."
"Mr President, an amendment which I with others tabled to this report called for confirmation of the dual nature of the Union in which nation states are the predominant component."
"All too often European citizens do not feel that this is actually the case."
"In fact, they feel as though their national identity is being forgotten."
"There are many ways in which this can be rectified and I personally feel the Convention could and should have gone further in this area."
"However, on a practical level, I believe it is essential for MPs and MEPs to work more closely together to ensure the correct transposition of legislation."
"Gold plating is a phenomenon which affects every Member State to a greater or lesser extent."
"In the UK it is particularly harmful, harmful to our agriculture for instance."
"The Abattoirs Directive left the Commission as a twelve-page document, was reduced by the French to a manageable seven pages and expanded by the British to an unreadable ninety-five pages."
"Sadly, there are many other examples of gold plating in the fields of business and industry."
"So why does gold plating affect the UK more than any other Member State?"
"One important reason is because the UK, unlike other states, does not involve MPs in the transposition process."
"Belgium has a Federal Advisory Committee on European Affairs, made up jointly of MPs and MEPs."
"The German and Greek legislatures have similar arrangements."
"As an MEP who has been an MP in the UK, I now realise how little my colleagues and I knew about the regulations coming from Europe."
"The problems have deteriorated under the present British Government as it reduced the powers of our House of Commons."
"The way forward is for joint committees of members of national parliaments and MEPs to oversee the transposition of legislation into national law in every Member State."
"This would be a small but significant step in the right direction and, by increasing cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament, it would allow national MPs a real say in the workings of our Union."
"Mr President, it stands to reason that a European constitution makes sense if it is actually worthy of the name; so, quite certainly, do the plebiscites or referendums that even the treasurer and election campaign manager of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has called for."
"Which draft, though, do we see before us?"
"Will this draft by the Convention give us fair and, above all, truly transparent decision-making structures?"
"Will it bring about the unmistakeably clear separation of powers?"
"Will enough decisions be taken by majority vote?"
"Did not the governments brutally force through their positions, as one of the previous speakers, Mr Voggenhuber, put it?"
"Will the small Member States lose out?"
"Will only a few of the large ones gain anything, Mr Rack?"
"Will the European Parliament become fully representative of the people?"
"Can it now call individual Commissioners to account in any real sense?"
"If we cannot, then can, at least, the voters?"
"Are they able to directly elect the Commissioners?"
"Will voters have direct influence on the decisions of the Council?"
"In essence, will there be more direct democracy?"
"John Palmer, of the respected European Policy Centre, and numerous German provincial prime ministers of varying political colours, have for years been saying over and over again, that if a country were constituted in the same way as the European Union, it would not be able, by reason of its lack of democratic legitimacy, to qualify as a Member State of the EU."
"Will this new draft now do away with this fundamental deficit?"
"Are our much-valued European regions not left out?"
"What about the right of appeal?"
"Will we now at last have the proximity to the citizens that we have so often invoked?"
"Is the draft so clear and comprehensible that young people will be able to get to grips with it and get some idea of what Europe is?"
"Will it not result in incessant wrangling and party-political horse-trading?"
"A strong social market economy is the key to social peace in Europe - does the constitution contain any of the framework conditions on which that is dependent?"
"The answer to too many of these questions has to be 'no'."
"That is why it now makes sense to convinced Europeans, among whom I number myself, to say 'no' to the text that is before us."
"In any case, there can be no democracy without transparency, and, to this deception, we have to say, 'no, thank you'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after congratulating the rapporteurs on their work, I believe that it is necessary to make some preliminary remarks."
"There was a lengthy debate on whether it was necessary, appropriate and right to introduce a reference to Christian values - or even to God - in the text in question and in the text that will be adopted."
"I believe that, over and above the formal aspects - and I would not be sorry if a reference to Christian values could be included - and over and above the terms used, it is important to note that the text that has emerged, and is emerging as it develops, respects these values."
"I believe that the text shows considerable respect for Christian values: respect for human life and respect for the dignity of human life are, indeed, points of reference on which there has been much work in the Convention."
"I feel it is important to emphasise that, over and above the actual words contained in the text, there is a reference to our history, to European life, that has, of course, been influenced by and associated with Christian values."
"The different stages in achieving a Convention, a Constitution, new Treaties, have, I believe, been useful."
"I am not a pessimist: on the contrary, I believe that the work that has been carried out, although slow, has, overall, been fruitful, even if there is still room for some more development."
"I often think of what Europe could have been like without the Institutions that there are today, and I remember what our continent was in essence 60 years ago."
"I must say, therefore, that what has been done - in terms of the direct legitimacy of the public, the quest for ways of achieving consensus and the management of the institutions and consensus - can be considered to be positive overall."
"Many people maintain that there is still a great divide between the institutions and the citizens."
"Perhaps these very citizens should be involved in the evolution of Europe to a greater extent; perhaps it falls to us to recognise rights and to ensure that, through an important principle - justified expenditure, effective and appropriate bureaucracy - the divide between the institutions and civil society can be bridged."
"Mr President, my high opinion of the rapporteurs, Mr Tsatsos and Mr Gil-Robles, does not prevent me from wishing that their evaluation had been perhaps a little less wordy and, to compensate, more incisive. They might have laid greater emphasis on our satisfaction with the draft Constitution for Europe, and at the same time warned the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) of the responsibility it will assume if it tries to replace the Convention's political consensus with a different, governmental consensus."
"We all share in that responsibility, in that risk, especially those who, in accordance with the will of the citizens, cannot accept an enlarged Europe lacking a common legislature, or one strictly governed by an obsolete Treaty of Nice."
"Numerous representatives of the 28 Member States spent 16 months considering all the options in their quest for a reasonable consensus."
"I do not believe, Mr President, that European diplomats can do any better in little more than two months."
"In any case, those diplomats were involved at every stage in finding solutions on behalf of their Member States, which makes them partly responsible for the results achieved in the Convention."
"In the same way, I do not believe that any amount of political modesty can hide our pride in affirming clearly that, at the end of the European Convention, the highest honours went to the European Parliament."
"Nor can any nationalist neuroses make us forget how valuable European unity is for governing Europeans, and, of course, for curbing the supremacy - and very often the stupidity - of other parts of the world. Our unity has thus become an essential tool in the service of peace."
"No delusions of grandeur or mediocrity can jeopardise the challenging mission which is Europe's destiny today."
"The text submitted to the IGC is a broad and profound compromise. It may rouse the whole gamut of emotions, but it will not be denied its role as the precursor of a new Europe, based on democracy, human rights, equality and European solidarity."
"That fact alone gives us the mettle to champion it, and to convince the citizens to confer on it the title 'Constitution for Europe'."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although Europe is becoming more democratic, more transparent, and closer to its people, it has certainly not finished with this Constitutional Treaty."
"We are a project, on which work must be in continual progress."
"The codecision procedure is becoming the rule and unanimity the valid exception."
"The citizens' parliament's legislative competence is being extended more than twice over."
"The way in which the national governments share responsibility for European decisions is being made more transparent, so it will be harder to make accusations, and the information given to the public will need to be more honest."
"Two of the constitution's fundamental pillars of governance are the subsidiarity principle and the environmentally responsible market economy."
"There is, of course, criticism."
"Aspects that have been criticised and cry out for amendment include the current proposal on the composition of the Commission, unanimous voting on taxes relevant to the internal market and on the Common Foreign Policy, as well as the absence of a common information campaign and of any requirement that the public be involved in the process of ratification."
"It is because Europe needs European awareness, an awareness that only information can create, and because we need our citizens to be informed and involved, that I advocate - even though the legal basis for it is not yet in place - a Europe-wide referendum, to take place at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament."
"It is because we have to inform, because we have to make citizens participants - and what could be more vital than to pro-actively tell the public about the European constitution, with its fundamental rights and civil liberties for citizens and to enable citizens to participate?"
"I call on the members of the Intergovernmental Conference to hold a Europe-wide referendum to introduce the process of ratification, and I call upon my fellow Members of this House to endorse my statement to this effect."
"Mr President, I would like to focus on three points: the question of unanimity, the reference to God and Christianity and traditionally resident minorities."
"The work of both the Convention and the rapporteurs is certainly positive; therefore - in answer to the pessimists and to those who always say no - I would say that, in terms of a complete Constitution, we are obviously only half way along the road but, compared to Nice, we have made steps forward that were and are giant steps."
"It is, however, necessary to make some changes to this report, as President Prodi, whose opinion I share, stated before this House."
"The first point that I would like to mention is unanimity."
"I believe that, in requiring unanimity for constitutional amendments of minor importance too we would certainly be closing the door to future developments."
"We must endeavour to be more farsighted and more open, and, to this end, I, too, endorse the spirit of Amendment No 20, for which I will vote."
"Regarding my second point, the reference to God and Christianity, I find the uncompromising position of certain sections of this House incomprehensible; indeed, it is in conflict with the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the population."
"As regards Christianity, above all, if we do not include a clear, firm reference to it in the Constitution it will be tantamount to disowning our age-old history."
"The third point concerns linguistic and cultural diversity and the rights of minorities, referred to in Amendment No 22, recital H. I believe that the minorities that were referred to in the Copenhagen criteria should have a place in this report as well."
"I urge the Italian Presidency to make every endeavour to this end, both before and during the IGC, and to ensure that these minorities are mentioned in the Constitution too."
"I just want to thank all the Members who spoke and made a valuable contribution to the debate which sees us all committed to creating a new, effective European Constitution: I would therefore like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for what will be a precious contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I think that the Presidency is right not to discuss the merits of each individual issue, for the issues will, of course, be reflected upon and discussed during the Conference itself."
"I believe, on the other hand, that it is right to take on board the general sense of direction and the suggestions relating to transparency, first and foremost, and, from this point of view, I can assure you that the Presidency will make every endeavour to ensure the participation of the entire European public, not least by setting up a special web site."
"As regards the fundamental issue, which concerns the European Parliament and on which there was also an oral amendment from the President of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, namely the direct participation of Parliament in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, I can only confirm what I said in the initial report, to the effect that the Presidency is in favour of making this possible."
"This does not, of course, depend on our own will; we could propose it again and try to support it with conviction because we are certain that the European Parliament can make a decisive contribution to achieving a positive result when the new European Constitution is drawn up."
"Since we, ourselves, are not, however, able to impose it, we can only take the message on board, make it our own and genuinely try to achieve a good result, in the hope that we will all be able to be present and to contribute to the achievement of this major, important objective that is the European Constitution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to urge you most earnestly to adopt the recommendations drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"They represent an attempt at making a new start and desisting from the disputes of the past."
"They are about finding a solution to the problem of how we help the people of Iraq in the aftermath of war, and that of the competences of the United Nations, which must progressively take over the leadership in this area in order to be able to permanently stabilise the region."
"It is for this reason that I am pushing for the rejection of those amendments that seek to re-ignite the disputes between us from the time before the war in Iraq."
"We owe it to the people there to look to the future rather than perpetuating old disputes, and so I would recommend that you reject all the amendments, with the exception of Mr Sakellariou's on the International Court of Justice, which I recommend that we adopt. If you do, you will achieve a great majority in this House, enabling the European Union to be in a stronger position when it goes to the donors' conference and us to take on a great deal of responsibility in a constructive way."
"Mr Korakas has asked to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, I wish to protest about Mr Brok's intervention."
"He referred to the substance."
"There is no further debate today."
"What he said confirms precisely our position: that an attempt is being made to legalise the intervention in Iraq and the occupation and we are radically against any such development ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Korakas, I do not intend to reopen a debate."
"Mr President, the oral amendment to Article 4(3) is as follows: 'The technical contribution shall be assessed by consideration of the difference between all of the technical features of the patent claim and the state of the art, irrespective of whether or not such features are accompanied by non-technical features.'"
"This amendment merges my original Amendments 110 and 16."
"Mrs Berès, as you know, the decision is taken by the Conference of Presidents."
"Report (A5-0299/2003) by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the European Parliament's opinion on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) [11047/2003 - C5-0340/2003 - 2003/0902(CNS)]"
"Mr President, I have presented this amendment having heard the Italian Presidency of the Council and the report it has produced on the situation relating to Parliament's representation in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I believe that we cannot strongly welcome something we have not been offered, and therefore my proposal is that the following should be included: 'Expresses its concern and discontent with the lack of compliance by the Council with the assurances expressed by the Italian Presidency to Parliament'."
"The rest would stay the same."
"I would point out that the President-in-Office of the Council has indicated his agreement with this amendment, because it may help him at the Council."
"Mr President, the Council has not made any agreement and, since it has not made any agreement, it is not possible to express concern over a non-existent agreement."
"What happened in the meeting was that the decision was left to the Heads of State or Government."
"My group is therefore opposed to this oral amendment and to a vote on it, because we believe that it responds to a political aim which we do not share."
"If it is necessary for twelve of us to rise, moreover, twelve of us will rise."
"I would ask twelve Members to rise."
". (PT) It beggars belief that the European Parliament should, in its first statement following the invasion of Iraq by the United States and its allies, adopt a recommendation which, due to the rejection of an amendment tabled by my group, fails to recall - to paraphrase our amendment - that the present unstable situation, which represents a threat to the Iraqi people and the international community, is a consequence of the unjust, illegitimate and illegal attack launched by the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries on 20 March 2003."
"It is unacceptable for the European Parliament to refuse, as a result of the rejection of one of our amendments, to call - and I paraphrase again - for the restitution of international law, with the immediate withdrawal of occupying foreign troops and the assumption by the United Nations of its responsibilities under the UN Charter, with a view to putting power in the hands of truly representative, legitimate and democratic institutions without delay, by holding elections to ensure that the Iraqi people regains its sovereignty."
"It is worth mentioning, by way of criticism, that the recommendation welcomes what it perceives as 'the change of attitude of the Bush administration towards the more active role of the International Community', when the real issue is, above all, dividing the costs of the occupation and the Iraqi people's resistance to that occupation."
"That is why we voted against the recommendation."
". British Labour MEPs are pleased to have voted in favour of this resolution, which marks a genuine effort on all sides to build consensus within this European Parliament around the very difficult issue of Iraq."
"In the spirit of seeking maximum support for European and international cooperation for the reconstruction of Iraq, its return to peace and stability and for the full observance of human rights and democracy for its people, we have not sought to amend the wording which commanded all-party support in the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"Nevertheless, vital as the role of the United Nations is and must remain, it is impossible at this stage to lay out a precise timetable for a transfer of sovereignty, or indeed to identify the precise nature of a Trust Fund in advance of the forthcoming donors' conference."
"The principles, however, are ones on which we are all agreed."
"In terms of the resolution's reference to an ad hoc international tribunal, we should also recognise the need for Iraq to develop its own reformed judicial system within which perpetrators of crimes could be tried, and which could itself refer cases to the International Criminal Court."
"(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"We members of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the recommendation to the Council on Iraq because, while it does not say a word about the invasion and occupation, it welcomes the efforts by the Bush administration to get out of the impasse and condemns the resistance of the Iraqi people, which it qualifies as terrorism."
"It proposes making the Iraqi people a ward of the international community until it is old enough for democracy."
"Two elements in particular are typical of this opinion:"
"paragraph 1.8 talks of the need to set up a multinational military force and a police force mandated by the United Nations, in cooperation with ????, on the basis of a 'political timetable', thereby repeating the 'Bosnia-Herzegovina' argument (six-month timetable, now ten years old);"
"Mr Brok called for and succeeded in securing a vote against all amendments calling for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces, the assumption by the UN of its responsibilities, the restoration of the sovereignty of the Iraqi people and the amendments which referred to the illegality of the invasion of Iraq and the lack of proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction."
"The fact that only the members of the European United Left (45) voted in favour of these amendments, while 420 voted against and 68 abstained, demonstrates just how hypocritical they all are; while they are making a great show of fighting for the rights of the Iraqi people, they bless its occupation, oppression and plundering in practice."
"We leave them to the judgment of our peoples."
"Mr President, the European Parliament today has voted on legislation that will slow down the rate of technological advance, narrow consumer choice, increase the price of software and destroy the free and open-source software industry in Europe."
"Of course I have voted against it."
"We do not want to see a situation where a limitless patent system can be abused by large operatives to stifle technical competition or, even worse, prevent the publication of information."
"US experience tells us that software patents do not encourage innovation and R&D but, in fact, weaken the market and suffocate small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as those starting out in the market."
"Software is not an invention and is already protected under copyright law, just like books, films and music."
"Changing this to patenting is a recipe for handing the software industry over to lawyers instead of the creative people who have led the boom in technology."
"I welcome the fact that the directive as proposed was improved, but it is still not good enough and I hope that it will not destroy the software industry in Europe as we know it."
"Mr President, I particularly want to thank Mrs McCarthy for her work on this difficult report."
"I was shocked to hear some of the comments that were made about her personally and I in no way subscribe to them."
"However, in the end I voted against the report."
"My main reason for doing so was because of the legal uncertainty which is created by the imposition of a patent on software development, particularly when we can see the rapid advance of technology and the new small and medium sized enterprises that are starting up to create software packages specific to certain sectors of industry or business, or merely to create a new game for them to play themselves."
"All of this could now be prevented because a patent could be placed on the menu option, on the one-click option or in numerous other areas of operation."
"As Mrs Ahern said, some improvements have been made, but the reality is that we have to take into account the experience in the United States which has created multi-million and multi-billion dollar legal suits by large companies against small companies, which have stifled innovation, prevented new invention and prevented job creation."
"Mr President, I, too, voted against this draft directive, which I find bitterly disappointing."
"It is lamentable that Parliament has bowed to pressure from the USA and, above all, pressure exerted by the major software companies."
"This is a great disappointment, especially for consumers."
"It is they who will have to pick up the tab for this decision; for them, it will mean higher prices and less diversity in products, reducing their freedom of choice."
"Software patents stand in the way of a growing, dynamic and diverse European software industry."
"It is primarily consumers and software users who feel their effects."
"They increase dependence on software giants, such as Microsoft, which have secured many trivial patents, and quite manifestly curtail freedom of choice, but this is also a grave blow for the development of software in Europe, which is being hampered by the monopolies that are establishing themselves."
"Not only does this go counter to the interests of consumers, but it also hampers innovation, instead of encouraging competition and diversity in the software market."
"It is also a real defeat for Europe as a location for business, even though its advocates see it as the very opposite."
"That will become apparent in the future, and this decision does the utmost damage to the prospect of an open, free and sustainable knowledge-based society."
"Mr President, my colleagues and I expressed our views on all the amendments seeking to improve the text. We were pleased to note a number of improvements but deeply regretted that a number of the proposed amendments did not succeed."
"This has strengthened our belief that the directive, far from encouraging dynamism and creativity, is giving in to the desire for bureaucracy to regulate inventiveness itself."
"It has not escaped our attention that this departure favours big financial and industrial groups."
"This is why we eventually voted against the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the EU had to respond to the enormous increase in the number of patent applications in this area is not a matter of doubt, nor is there any doubt about the fact that these must not be allowed to be detrimental to the interests of small software companies."
"What the Commission is proposing, however, encourages the domination of the software market by monopolies, as small software companies cannot afford disputes about patent rights."
"Greater protection for patents would enhance the large service providers' position of strength in the market and would consequently mean that software developers would have to pay fees, in other words, royalties, for a wide variety of standard functions."
"It is the consumer who will end up paying the bill."
"The attempt to create greater legal certainty by means of this directive is to be welcomed, but, in this instance, it misses the mark."
"On the one hand, there is no single definition of the 'technical contribution' required for a patent to be granted, and, on the other, it blurs the boundaries between the end product - which can be patented - and the software itself, which cannot."
"The EU needs patent law that not only encourages innovation, but also gives better protection to inventors who lack financial clout."
"This proposal from the Commission guarantees neither of these things, and that is why we have voted against it."
"The directive we are examining today allows every type of software to be patented."
"The aim is obvious: to strengthen and consolidate the economic/political centres of control and the monopoly of information and information processing by the multinational companies active in the software centre."
"The result is easy to foresee: small and medium-sized enterprises and independent programmers will be throttled."
"Adopting it signals the de jure acceptance of the demands of the widespread 'patent industry' in the USA, will discourage research and development and will result in a huge waste of resources on legal protection proceedings which could have been invested in technological innovation."
"The procedure for safeguarding software patents will have painful consequences for consumers/end users, who will be called on to pay the increased profits of the monopolies while, at the same time, their options will be limited, as will the facility to use improved software."
"It is for these reasons that we members of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the directive and the corresponding report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and we stand by those demanding free and open software."
". (NL) The Vlaams Blok ('Flemish Block') opposes the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, it having been found in practice that software patents stifle the innovation capacity of small and medium-size enterprises in the IT industry."
"All too frequently, these patents are used improperly by (invariably American) computer giants with large in-house legal departments to take 'offenders' to court."
"These practices are crippling to free competition, since many patents relate to software which de facto belongs to the public domain."
"Applying for, and obtaining, patents is an expensive business."
"New and creative IT businesses in Europe are right not to see the legal aspects that are involved as part of their core business."
"Europe is queering its own pitch by adopting this report."
"- (PT) It is regrettable that the European Parliament did not approve our proposal to reject this proposal for a directive, which prepares the ground for the patentability of computer programs, despite the fact that very many of the proposals for amendments to this directive were adopted."
"The European Parliament has thus done innovation and technological development a disservice."
"In today's world, it seems that anything can be marketed. Anything can become private property and be used for somebody's personal gain."
"There are those who would like marketing to embrace not only production but also knowledge and life itself."
"We live in a time when discoveries - a common heritage for all of us - are being confused with inventions."
"This directive prepares the ground for the patentability of human knowledge, which we oppose."
"Although a few positive proposals were also approved at the final vote, most of our own proposals were rejected, which gives us cause for regret."
"We will continue to fight this proposal for a directive and the large multinational interests it aims to please."
"Once again the European Parliament has failed to listen to the voice of reason and has accepted the principle of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions."
"The majority bloc of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, although weakened by the pertinence of the arguments put forward by those who oppose this measure, once again yielded to the demands of major corporations to take the commercialisation of human activity ever further."
"Indeed, by accepting the principle of patents in this field, when computer-implemented inventions are already protected by copyright, multinationals are in effect given the power to seal off this sector."
"They alone would have the financial power to lead a type of continuous legal guerrilla war, with a view to monopolising these inventions to make them pay a high price or to block them, depending on what is in their interests."
"Several amendments to the Mc Carthy report limiting the extent of this attack have, I am pleased to say, been adopted."
"The fact remains that the final wording of the resolution remained profoundly dangerous and we voted against it."
"After much consideration and reflection on the arguments put forward by the various businesses, software producers etc., on the issue of this directive, the aim of which is to allow computer-implemented inventions to be patented, I have come to the conclusion that, if clear definitions and precise explanations were introduced into the directive with regard to some questionable and ambiguous terms to avoid erroneous interpretations, then I could subscribe to it."
"Indeed, I believe that it is essential that we set about clearly determining the scope of the directive by precisely defining pure software and inventions which, to be executable, must be computer-implemented."
"The patentability of software is absurd in so far as it would lead to the formation of a monopoly of large software companies detrimental to small and medium-sized enterprises specialised in this field, which, more often that not, play a key role in developing new technologies."
"Software is a precious tool that must continue to be accessible to all so that we have every chance of achieving the Lisbon objective by 2010, that is, for the European Union to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world."
". As rapporteur, I supported the thrust of amendments tabled with a view to getting a clearer definition of what is patentable and limits to ensure that pure software is not patentable."
"It remains to be seen in the analysis of the votes whether this objective has been achieved."
"We await a common position from Council and Commission."
"This will be difficult to achieve as Parliament's amendments will inevitably be seen to go well beyond the legal situation as regards the patenting of computer-implemented inventions and may indeed put us at odds with our obligations under TRIPs."
"I continue to express my concerns that this EU directive should not undermine the competitiveness and innovation of our brightest and best companies in Europe, in particular by putting EU business and industry at a disadvantage in the global marketplace."
"It would be folly if our companies as a result of Parliament's amendments could not protect their innovation, enforce patents or gain a return on their R&D investment."
"It would be contrary to our economic interests if we allowed the US and Japan to dominate markets as a result of their patent protection, while Europe's companies are squeezed out."
". (NL) In America, large computer companies have been trying for years to protect their software inventions against free use by individual users and small companies."
"They build in technical restrictions, tie buyers to restricting contracts, try to collect enormous damages and demand legal protection by the authorities."
"It is young, resourceful users in particular who are faced with ever more restrictions and run the risk of ending up in prison."
"In Europe too, such companies are trying more effective ways of protecting their monopoly against the public."
"In departing from Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, according to which software is subject to copyright rather than to patenting, the European Patent Bureau in Munich is trying to extend its remit along the lines of the American system."
"It has managed to do this by granting 30 000 patents to date."
"The European Commission and part of this Parliament want to justify this extended remit with the argument that nothing actually changes in comparison to the present situation."
"This course of action is meeting with much opposition, and with good reason, from those who are hindered in their inventions, their education, their work or their leisure activities."
"I support this opposition to the commercial interests of large monopolies and have enjoyed working on counter arguments prior to this vote."
"- (PT) During the debate in plenary, my colleague Mr Mussa said words to the effect that intelligence cannot be patented."
"I entirely agree with this principle, since we cannot ignore the fact that any piece of software is the product of a mental process enabling a human being to command an unintelligent machine to perform a series of instructions. What is at issue, therefore, is a product of the human mind."
"To patent it would be to risk diminishing our capacity for research and innovation, in view of the number of patents already filed, particularly by large United States corporations. These corporations would thus come to enjoy a sort of 'monopoly on intelligence'."
"Although this is a highly complex area in technical terms, we are sensitive to the economic and political consequences of the proposal, which will hit small- and medium-sized software companies hardest. We voted against it, therefore, even though some amendments pointing in the right direction were adopted."
". (PT) A patent is a tool designed to protect intelligence and encourage creativity by legally protecting a creation, in the strict sense of the word."
"Those who legislate in this area should do so with that principle in mind."
"In other words, patents should not be used to do exactly the opposite. Intelligence itself cannot be patented, nor can patents be used to stifle creativity, giving rise, in extreme cases, to 'crimes of intelligence' or 'crimes of free creation'."
"A patent must not be reduced to the status of a trophy for whoever gets to the competent authority first with an application for a particular patent. Rather, it should be a reward reserved for those who really have created something new, and an incentive to create more."
"In contravention of the provisions of the European Patent Convention, this proposal for a directive allows for the patentability of ideas implemented by software programs to be authorised. That goes much further than the safeguards already provided by copyright, and would lead to the stagnation of 'intelligences' and the disastrous establishment of an obstacle to technological development per se, as well as to economic and social development."
"The approval in plenary of a few amendments, some of which were proposed by me, enhanced the text a little, but not enough to gain my support."
"That is why I voted against it."
"Furthermore, I would rather the proposal had been rejected and the process started all over again on the basis of a fresh report, as I also proposed."
"- (FR) Our sub-group sets great store by consumer protection and we will support the rapporteur's compromise, but we will abstain on the final resolution because of budgetary considerations."
"Programming has indeed been planned until 2007 but we all know that the financial perspectives will be revised in 2006."
"There is, therefore, no guarantee of continuity."
"I return to the wisdom of the Committee on Budgets (COBU), which states that 'the amount scheduled for the year 2007 is subject to approval by the Budgetary Authority for the Financial Perspective beyond 2006.'"
"I am equally concerned about the operational costs."
"EUR 32 million are earmarked for human resources, whilst the operational envelope amounts to EUR 72 million."
"That is a terrible cost-benefit ratio."
"Let us not forget that consumer organisations, which exist in all Member States, are an effective opposition force."
"What is the use of implementing European financing at such a high cost price?"
"As regards the cofinancing of projects, I am in favour of keeping a maximum ceiling of 70% and I am against 75%."
"As regards financial support for European consumer organisations, a 50% threshold is much too high."
"We need to avoid these organisations and the Commission becoming dependent on one another, thereby preventing these organisations from operating independently and from acting without constraint."
"I abstained on the final resolution for all of these reasons."
". (PT) This proposal for a decision aims to safeguard the financing of Community actions in support of consumer policy for the years 2004-2007, in line with the objectives and actions laid down in the European Consumer Policy Strategy, adopted in 2003."
"It aims, therefore, to support organisations and bodies working to promote consumer interests at Community or national level. EUR 72 million have been allocated to this end."
"While I feel that the financial package should be more generous, I support this initiative, which was unanimously approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. It endorses the following objectives: a high level of consumer protection; effective enforcement of consumer protection rules; greater involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies; and integration of consumer protection objectives into all other Community policy areas."
"I believe, nevertheless, that the delivery of this support should be expeditious, not encumbered by bureaucracy, and that direct assistance to national consumer organisations, including cooperatives, should not be excluded."
"A clearer distinction should also be drawn between organisations genuinely working to promote consumer interests and those which are merely the mouthpieces of industrial lobbies."
". (PT) We could only vote in favour of this report, given that what is at stake is financing a high common level of consumer protection, effective enforcement of consumer protection rules, and the involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies, even though this report looks no further than questions of consumer safety relating to non-food products, protecting the economic interests of consumers, and promoting consumer organisations at European level, as well as the involvement of those organisations in Community policies relevant to their interests."
"It is pleasing to note that the total budget proposed for this period has risen to EUR 72 million in operational credits, or EUR 18 million per year, while the total for human resources and other administrative costs has risen to EUR 32 million, or EUR 8 million per year."
". (PT) I voted in favour of this report, because the aim of the financial framework on the table (for 2002-2007) is to pursue a consumer protection policy, particularly by financing consumer information projects."
"This tool will be important for achieving the EU's three political objectives, set by the European Commission's 2002 communication (the Consumer Policy Strategy for 2002-2006). These objectives are to strive for a high common level of consumer protection and effective enforcement of consumer protection rules, and to ensure that consumer organisations are involved in EU policies."
"Although the sums that have been announced do not encourage major fundamental changes - especially in terms of major projects - I felt that things were moving in the right direction, especially as regards questions of consumer safety relating to non-food products, protecting the economic interests of consumers, and promoting consumer organisations at European level, as well as the involvement of those organisations in Community policies which are relevant to their interests."
"We will nurture the active and inclusive citizenship we desire only if citizens have at their disposal the means of promoting their interests, common or individual, and enhancing the protection of those interests effectively through concerted efforts at European, national and regional levels."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Jonckheer report, as we now need to make it possible to at last give favourable tax treatment to non-food crops."
"We should welcome the European Union's declaration that the increased use of renewable sources of energy is one of its objectives and the Commission's definition of binding objectives and timetables in its 'Renewable Energies' White Paper."
"The right conditions and instruments are needed, though, if these objectives are to be achieved."
"If the European Union wants to discharge its obligations under international law to reduce greenhouse gases in line with the Kyoto commitments, this directive on the taxation of energy can be only one of many steps that will end up taking us in the right direction."
"Not only is the use of renewable energy sources CO2-neutral, but it also makes for added value in the regions and creates new and modern jobs in rural areas."
". (PT) The Commission has wanted to create a Community framework for the taxation of energy products for some time."
"This Council compromise, therefore, constitutes a significant step in that direction, since it has brought agreement on a comprehensive energy tax directive, encompassing all forms of energy."
"The rapporteur, however, has some piercing criticisms of the minimum tax rates agreed, the exemptions and the tax reductions provided for."
"We have grave reservations about this directive."
"We favour lightening the tax burden on workers, but the solution does not involve so-called 'environmental taxation' of energy or pollution. The solution involves finding a new balance of taxation between workers and capital."
"What is more, this type of indirect taxation is levied, when all is said and done, on the final consumers (users). It is not sensitive to levels of income and penalises lower-income households."
"The effects of steep tax increases on the productive fabric, especially in the least-favoured regions, should also be assessed."
"The underlying 'polluter pays' principle, furthermore, engenders serious reservations, as it permits those with economic clout to generate pollution. That is clear in the liberal philosophy behind emissions trading."
"The bottom line is that we should not pollute at all."
"The battle to protect the environment and stop environmental dumping must be fought with appropriate legislation and effective enforcement. This requires a high degree of state intervention and investment."
"(DE) Tax issues are by their nature very thorny, something attributable, as much as to anything else, to the great differences between one country's system and another's; for example, the Scandinavian states, in particular, use high levels of excise duty to fund their extremely generous social security systems."
"Our practice is to fund pensions - to take one example - using employers' and employees' contributions, albeit on a participatory basis."
"In the EU, we agreed, at the beginning of the 1990s, to lay down only minimum rates and to retain unanimity in the Council on matters relating to this."
"Despite the issue's sensitivity, efforts were made, when this proposal was discussed, to abolish the unanimity principle with effect from 2010."
"Decisions as important as that are taken while revising the Treaties or the Constitutional Treaty and not when consulting Parliament on a draft directive."
"Turning to the taxation of fuel, harmonised minimum rates for Luxembourg (and other Member States) always go hand in hand with an increase in tax, and thus, in fact, with an increase in prices."
"Although Luxembourg's specific situation meant that it was allowed a temporary derogation, this is no reason to bring forward from 2010 to 2008 the second phase for the application of the minimum rates."
"I am sure that the thinking behind the rapporteur's amendment was that it would benefit the environment if higher fuel prices were to deter consumers from using their own cars."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure.)"
". (PT) The European Parliament took an important step towards greening European Union energy taxation today, by giving the green light to the directive restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity."
"I hope the Council's reaction will now be equally constructive, and that there will not be a repeat of the veto which precluded any revision of this very same piece of legislation in 1997."
"One of the most important objectives of any sustainable development policy is to internalise environmental externalities into the economy."
"In other words, the price of goods must reflect their real environmental cost."
"The message sent by the price is essential in order to induce both producers and consumers to realign their choices towards sustainability."
"That situation is, unfortunately, still a long way off, which is why buying green is still a luxury and selling green is not yet sufficiently profitable."
"I welcome the rapporteur's advocacy of more ambitious and binding rules, and in particular of lowering taxes on goods produced using renewable energy sources while raising taxes on fossil fuels for use in transport."
". (PT) I voted in favour of this report, since I feel it is necessary to face up to climate change and the growing threats to the environment, using taxation as an additional tool to that end."
"Despite the rapporteur's reservations about the Council's draft, which, in his view, fell short of expectations, I believe that this draft represents the broadest possible consensus within the Council, bearing in mind that caution and the ability to compromise are advisable when approaching this issue."
"My vote, then, is a response to the legislative body of the report, for I do not entirely share the rapporteur's concerns, which are detailed in the explanatory statement. We differ in particular on doing away with the unanimity requirement in these matters and on tightening Community requirements relating to the taxation of products."
"Indeed, although there must obviously be greater coordination between Member States in order to meet the growing environmental challenges, the keynote should be the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle and not the imposition of any artificial consensus."
". The EPLP voted against amendments concerning taxation changes and abstained on the final vote, consistent with its attitude on taxation."
"(PT) The fishing agreement with the Government of Mauritius expired on 2 December 2002. The parties had agreed to begin renegotiating the protocol annexed to the agreement."
"These negotiations, however, were postponed in view of the fact that the Government of Mauritius is currently reviewing the state of its salt-water fish stocks. The parties, therefore, proposed that the current protocol be extended for one year, retaining the fishing opportunities and distribution between the Member States."
"This means that Portugal's eight longliners will continue to enjoy fishing opportunities. The extension is thus essential and for that reason I support it, although I regret the delay in referring this protocol to Parliament for consideration."
"The crux of the matter, however, is creating, as quickly as possible, the right conditions for concluding a new multiannual agreement."
"My vote in favour does not, however, mean that I agree with all the rapporteur's views."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has just adopted the Andersson report on adequate and sustainable pensions."
"One of the paragraphs it adopted was paragraph 16, in which the European Parliament calls for the increase in the effective retirement age to be implemented together with incentives - and not, I repeat, not - with disincentives such as drastic reductions in pension values"
"The European Parliament is thus going in the opposite direction from the Italian Government, which presented a proposal which means that, from 2008, retirement pensions will be put back five years with disincentives - and what disincentives: pensions will be completely cancelled for five years."
"This will bring EUR 25 billion to the state coffers in 2013, whilst there will be 2 million fewer jobs for young people and the unemployed."
"Mr President, I did not vote for this report because I believe that this issue should be the competence of national states and legislation without interference from Brussels."
". (PT) Ageing populations and ever-lower levels of employment among older people are threatening the sustainability of pension schemes."
"We are faced with an urgent need to reform social protection systems."
"The Member States must cooperate on pensions by applying the open method of coordination, so that differences of interpretation arising from bilateral agreements can be reduced."
"Studies carried out on developments in pension schemes show that the balance between economic and social concerns is the key to success, since macroeconomic, social and employment policies are connected."
"The European Employment Strategy and the European Social Fund have important contributions to make in promoting the continued employment and hiring of older workers."
"The Member States should adopt measures to discourage early retirement and - together with companies, workers and social partners - encourage active ageing."
"Lastly, the Member States must eliminate from their pension systems any forms of discrimination on the grounds of gender and any shortfalls in women's pensions, which are still lower then men's."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"- (FR) The Andersson report takes the form of a resolution commenting on the Joint Report by the Commission and the Council on 'adequate and sustainable' pensions."
"It tries to reconcile two disparate elements, insisting on the compatibility of the 'financial dimension' and 'social and welfare aspects'."
"The report contains a number of apt remarks, in particular, on the situation of women."
"These good intentions soon, however, become meaningless."
"The rapporteur seems, in fact, to feel obliged to make emphatic references to the European employment strategy, which is a very bad framework to use in devising the changes to revenue distribution that must accompany demographic change."
"The text sees the reforms under way in many Member States as positive without mentioning that they have inspired massive public opposition amongst the communities affected."
"Let us concede that with some trepidation the report 'supports the aim?of increasing the effective retirement age'."
"We reject this objective, all the more so because it is the only one which is specifically advanced, on the basis of which all future 'reforms' should be organised."
"We will challenge these reforms for millions of employees and we will oppose a simple measure, an increase in employer contributions."
"This is why we voted against this report."
". (DE) I am especially glad that this report, which, for the first time, subjects the EU Member States' commitment to the adoption of a common approach to the future of pensions policy to detailed and systematic scrutiny, addresses the problems of women in the way that I successfully insisted on in the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"We clearly have to ensure that all the Member States banish from their pensions systems discrimination on the grounds of gender."
"They ought to have done so ever since the directives in the 1970s on equal treatment for women and men in social security matters."
"With variations from one country to another, women receive between 16% and 45% less in their pensions than do men."
"In the case of those women retiring now, that results from, among other things, the fact that they, in their younger days, were, quite legally, entitled only to between 80% and 90% of the wages paid to men with the same qualifications."
"This discrimination lives on, in that women suffer from it to the end of their lives."
"Just as I had suggested, the report also makes reference to the problem of social protection for divorced women."
"As long ago as 1993, Parliament had adopted, on my initiative, a report on the pension entitlements of women who were divorced or living separately from their partners."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure.)"
". (NL) The establishment of pension systems used to be considered as a step towards a civilised society."
"Together, we provided for our future, for security at a stage in life when people are no longer productive."
"These days, the opinion is peddled that pension commitments are a burden on society whereby the elderly exploit the younger generations."
"This is not only a result of the changing population pyramid which is becoming much narrower than before, because there are fewer younger people at the bottom and more elderly at the top."
"It also has to do with short-term thinking, with the encouragement of individual egocentricity and with the advent of individual pension schemes."
"Often, young people do not realise that they will live much beyond their productivity peak."
"Also, they often do not realise that people suffer exhaustion faster because work has increasingly become a form of top-class sport."
"So much productivity is being required from people that many are physically or mentally burnt out long before they reach the pensionable age."
"In many cases, employers do not want to employ people over the age of 55."
"However, people who are older than 55 are often very useful in voluntary work, in an advisory role or as childminders."
"Given these circumstances, it is more obvious to lower, rather than increase, the pensionable age."
"To refuse a pension to people who can no longer cope with the pressure at work creates problems that cannot be solved."
". (PT) The Commission communication on adequate and sustainable pensions analysed the first National Strategy Reports presented by the Member States in the field of pensions."
"The Commission's analysis covers the adequacy of pension systems, their financial sustainability and the need for modernisation."
"It goes without saying that I welcome the rapporteur's conclusion that the Member States have already started their reform processes, and that a number of them have put major reforms into practice."
"This, I am happy to say, is the case in Portugal."
"There is also a clear awareness of the need for further reforms in order to safeguard the long-term sustainability of pension systems, which is linked to sound public finances."
"I feel that it is of the essence to eliminate from this debate any demagogic and stormy rhetoric styling itself as the 'champion of workers' rights'."
"The unsustainability of many national pension systems is due to demographic change, and we may be sure that it will indubitably do serious and - unless something is done to stop it - irreparable harm to all retired workers, both now and in future."
"Like the rapporteur, I welcome the close cooperation between Member States in this area. Moreover, because I agree with most of his conclusions relating to three fundamental objectives - adequacy, financial sustainability and the modernisation of pension systems - I voted in favour of the report."
"Mr President, as you know, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has voted basically in favour of the Gil-Robles/Tsatsos report and the proposed European Constitution offered by the European Convention."
"As I stated in the debate, however, the Catalan Members of Convergencia i Unió cannot accept this position and we have stated that we will abstain."
"Having seen how the votes have unfolded, furthermore, we confirm with even more conviction our decision to abstain and to wait to establish our final position until the result of the draft European Constitution, which may be presented by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We regret in particular that the Group of the European Peoples' Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have voted against our proposals to recognise and associate the regions with full legislative powers with the institutions of the Union, and also that the idea that the Ombudsmen of the parliaments of these regions with full legislative powers should be associated with the work of the European Ombudsman has been rejected."
"I believe this is a mistake, since it leaves millions of citizens far from the reality which is closest to them."
"This is the case for, amongst others, the stateless nations and the regions with a strong personality and sense of identity, and I believe it goes entirely against our stated aim of being closer to the citizens and building a Europe of the peoples."
"Mr President, the way the voting went this morning reinforced our bitter feeling that the draft European Constitution flouts fundamental social desires and mounts a serious challenge to the European social model."
"In particular, the precise, profound and dangerous threat hanging over public services was, I am sorry to say, confirmed by this House."
"It was from then on impossible - not to mention other reasons such as the stubborn refusal to consider constitutional or legislative regions - to want, as the majority do, the Intergovernmental Conference not to modify the grave imbalance created in this way between the powerful and the weak."
"This is why we voted against this report."
"Mr President, the reason why I abstained is that I regret that our amendment relating to our Judaeo-Christian heritage was not adopted."
"Not even a Marxist history teacher can deny that Europe's roots are both Christian and Jewish; without them Marx and Marxism would not have existed, and if Europe turns away from God, Christianity and Judaism, it is cutting itself off from its roots, only to be swamped by materialism and to collapse."
"The second point I want to make in this connection is that it is an illusion to believe that this Treaty can be put under glass and can never again be amended."
"Twenty-five governments are not going to meet together just to do nothing; they will work on the Treaty, and we hope that they will improve it."
"It is to be hoped that they will include in the preamble reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots and also make a number of improvements in the institutional sphere, such as having one Commissioner per Member State, which I too regard as essential."
"While we do not want the package to be completely unwrapped, there are some definite improvements that the governments should carry out in October."
"Mr President, I did not vote for this report, despite being in favour of the text adopted by the Convention - which I took part in as an alternate - because the report has left out the reference to Europe's Christian roots."
"Furthermore, there is an excessive tendency to restrict unanimity voting, which is one of the principles on which the European Union was first founded, even when it went under a different name."
"I believe that unanimity voting is a bastion of the sovereignty of the States and protects the national interests that are so dear to the majority of Italian political groupings."
"I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will confirm the substance of the Convention's work, despite the enraged attacks by President Prodi, who is doing everything he can to thwart it."
"Mr President, the draft Constitution for Europe reminds me of a cappuccino: lots of good coffee, a political froth which is a little too thin and very bitter institutional chocolate."
"As regards the coordination of economic and social policies, as regards foreign and defence policy, the political basis proposed is still flimsy."
"The permanent president of the European Council will certainly be competing with and clash with the President of the Commission."
"The division of the Commission into Commissioners that are accountable and non-voting and, therefore, unaccountable will weaken the Community dynamic and shatter the image of the Commission as a College with drive."
"I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will draw its inspiration from the Commission recommendations and will improve on the Convention proposals. This would mean that I could fully support a genuine European Constitution."
"Awaiting something better, I abstained."
"I would like to say once again to Mr Posselt that Europe not only has Judaeo-Christian roots but also Muslim and secular roots."
"Thank you, Mr President; although I cannot spare you the inconvenience of my rising on a point of order, I intend to be brief."
"I had no prior intention of holding my fellow Members up, and technology is normally very friendly to me."
"Perhaps my slowness has fallen victim to its delightful speed."
"In any case, my vote on Amendment No 21 to item 21a in the Gil-Robles report has not been recorded; I wanted to vote against it."
"In asking for the floor, I actually want to refer back to yesterday."
"I am delighted by the large number of roll-call votes today, which means that I am not going to be suspected of speaking in the interests of my own wallet."
"That was not the case yesterday."
"Today, though, it so happened that the exits from the Parliament building were once again blocked by demonstrators, so that vehicles on their way out had to use the way in, and those of us who wanted to get in - I managed it at twelve minutes to nine, having had to return briefly to my hotel - formed an enormous queue."
"Following on from what was said yesterday, I would like again to urge the bureau to give some attention to the question of how MEPs are to be guaranteed adequate access when exercising their right to vote."
"If the bureau is not willing to concern itself with this and inform MEPs as soon as possible, you will have to reckon with me constantly raising this issue in the plenary."
"The European Parliament motion on the introduction of a 'Constitution for Europe' aims to give parliamentary cover to a large-scale operation to deceive the peoples."
"It presents as a 'constitution' a text which not only fails to safeguard democratic achievements, but also, as we have repeatedly denounced, adds new links to the chains of the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice which big business has used to bind the workers in the Member States of the European Union."
"The institutionalisation of the market economy, the further militarisation of the ?U, in cooperation with ????, which goes as far as preventive intervention on the pretext of terrorist threat, the redistribution of power for the benefit of the powerful and the even greater transfer of national sovereignty to the international centre are just some of the 'gifts' which the Intergovernmental Conference is to offer the monopolies."
"The new venture is in total keeping with current policies, the undermining of workers' achievements, the successive terrorist laws and the interventions against peoples the world over."
"Nor can we fail to note that the anti-democratic procedure followed when drafting the text is being promoted as a standard of democracy and transparency."
"The Communist Party of Greece is categorically opposed to the introduction of a European constitution which strengthens the imperialist ?U. It trusts in the fight of the peoples, which will demolish the construction of the exploiters and radically change society."
"- (FR) We voted against the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil Delgado and Mr Tsatsos, which develops a strategy of 'encircling' the Intergovernmental Conference seeking to oblige national government representatives to more or less ratify the conclusions of the Convention."
"Thus Parliament is showing that it is aware of the importance of the federalist breakthroughs achieved by the Convention, in particular, with the proposal for a European Constitution, which was not part of the initial mandate given by the Council, for whom it is an unexpected result that it does not want to compromise."
"The Commission is not following the same strategy and is clearly trying to benefit from the IGC in order to make greater progress in terms of supranationality, for example, almost completely abolishing unanimity voting, methods of revision that make it possible to get around the opposition of some nations or stronger economic governance."
"In any case, this is about moving towards a European super state, which the citizens do not want."
"We hope that at the IGC the national governments will remember this and will not let their hands be tied by the European Institutions."
". On behalf of Mr Antoni Macierewicz:"
"It is necessary to underline the undemocratic procedure that led to adoption by the Convention of the draft Constitution."
"Consensus means a universal agreement, but the text adopted did not enjoy such approval."
"It is obvious that a document drawn up in violation of democratic principles can benefit neither the citizens, the nations, nor Europe itself."
"The draft Constitution changes the fundamental principles through which the EU functions (right of veto, states' voting rights, equal representation in the European Commission etc.)."
"These principles played a significant role in the accession of new states to the Union."
"Changing those principles is to present them with a fait accompli."
"The draft Constitution aims at establishing a single European state, in which decisions would be taken over the heads of citizens and governments without reference to the referendum as a necessary method of expressing the will of citizens on such a fundamental issue."
"Instead of imposing this anti-democratic Constitution on the peoples of Europe, we should work together so that in accordance with democratic principles we can build a true agreement between the nations and citizens of Europe."
"- (FR) We voted against the draft European Constitution because, over and above the details of the wording, this Constitution is destined to become one of the legal foundations of laws designed to preserve the prevailing social order and to ensure the privileges of the wealthy."
"Our rejection of the European Constitution in no way means that we are falling back on the French Constitution, which was also devised to protect the middle-classes and to sustain exploitation."
"We advocate a completely unified Europe, from one end of the continent to the other, but one which is free from domination by the upper middle class and by the dictatorship of financial groups on the economy; we have no sympathy for anachronistic forms of sovereignty."
"We abstained on the majority of the amendments because even the best intentioned ones still propose improving a Constitution that we reject."
"We abstained on the amendments proposing to organise referenda on the draft Constitution."
"Besides the fact that the questions are always skewed by the authorities asking them, we do not consider referenda to be a way for the citizens to express their will in a social structure in which the wealthy hold a monopoly over information tools and the media."
"- (FR) My position today in no way prejudges my position on the future European Constitution."
"In principle, I am in favour of a Constitution but I cannot, at this stage, join with those who state that the Intergovernmental Conference must not significantly change the draft prepared by the Convention."
"Socially speaking and in terms of the citizens Mr Giscard d'Estaing's draft is manifestly insufficient."
"Moreover, a Constitution should not set the economic and political structure of the EU in stone and thus deny the public any real opportunity to change society using its democratic vote."
"I hope, therefore, that the IGC will make profound changes that will allow me to vote, when the time comes, in favour of the Constitution."
". (PT) I can only welcome the drafting of the Convention on the Future of Europe and its work, which represents an historic milestone in the process of European integration."
"I welcome the concern to bring the Union closer to the citizens, enhance its democratic character and improve its decision-making capacity, in the context of enlargement."
"I welcome the (admittedly rather unambitious) enhancement of the Union's role and its capacity for action on the world stage, bearing in mind the challenges of globalisation and growing interdependence."
"I welcome the fact that, for the first time in the history of European integration, national parliaments will have an active role in drawing up European legislation."
"The Union has acquired legal personality, and the longed-for disappearance of the pillar structure has become a reality."
"I welcome the appeal contained in Mr Gil-Robles's excellent report that the citizens of Europe be called upon to give their opinion in a referendum, preferably on the same day as the European Parliament elections."
"I regret the disappearance of the rotating Presidency of the Council and the omission of any reference to our common cultural and historical roots."
". (PT) In accordance with the indication of vote of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I voted against Amendment No 78, tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"I feel, however, that the aforesaid amendment is essentially correct in pointing out one of the weaknesses of the draft Constitution presented to the Intergovernmental Conference by the Convention."
"The fact is that this draft contributes little that is new to the economic governance of Europe. Specifically, and crucially, it does not define how national economic policies should be coordinated, or review the objectives of the European Central Bank so as to link them more actively to growth and employment policies."
". (DE) The Members of this House belonging to the CSU have voted in favour of the report by Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos recommending the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference on the EU Convention's draft of a European constitution."
"We do, however, believe that a number of amendments to the draft are necessary."
"As a matter of urgency, we call for the incorporation, in the Constitution's preamble, of a reference to God and to Christianity."
"As Europe has been shaped by the Christian West, its policies should also aspire to put Christian values into practice."
"In order to make it possible for the EU to slim down and concentrate on its core tasks, we call in particular for there to be no extension of competences for the coordination of economic and employment policy, in order not to compromise freedom, competitiveness and the ownership of policies at national level; for no legal basis to be created for harmonising services of general interest, especially in water supply and sewerage; for competence in asylum and immigration policy to be limited to minimum standards, with the exception of rules on third-country nationals' access to the labour market; for there to be no extension of authority to promote and coordinate in the areas of sport, energy and civil protection; and for internal market competence to be restricted to measures primarily and directly intended to remove tangible obstacles."
". (PT) This report contains renewed endorsements of the work and results of the Convention we have rejected."
"As we have complained in the past, the undemocratic methods and processes by which the Convention was constituted helped produce a text to which we are flatly opposed, since we disagree with the social project it advocates."
"Under the terms of this text, an increasingly aggressive form of capitalism will become entrenched, society will be structured along neoliberal lines, everything will be commercialised and people will become increasingly devalued. The social aspects which the text promised to defend will become secondary, and we will slide further down the road mapped out in the Treaties of Maastricht and Nice."
"This is a real attack on the principles of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic."
"It is a threat to sovereignty, not only in legal and institutional terms, but also in concrete areas of citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms."
"It is an attempt to consign any chance of alternative routes to European integration to the dustbin of history."
"Instead of selecting as absolute priorities the quest for peace, development, and economic and social cohesion, based on high levels of social welfare for all, this text defines peace as a mere possibility and not as a fundamental objective. It embraces the profoundly militaristic NATO route, tied to United States imperialism."
"We believe that the next Intergovernmental Conferences should reject the Convention's proposal and find alternative ways of giving a positive response to today's problems."
"."
"(IT) I am not satisfied with this resolution: it is too long and difficult to understand for the uninitiated, and it is ambiguous on a fundamental issue, the revision procedure."
"It is not enough to lament the fact that unanimity voting is being preserved and that the European Parliament is not being given power of ratification."
"Parliament's demands had to be made a central issue, for the only way of overcoming the unsatisfactory elements in the Convention's text is precisely to ensure that there is a democratic method of ratification which will allow us to move forward."
"The rapporteurs and the majority of Parliament have preferred to maintain a rigid and mistaken position on this issue: it is not true that the revision procedure forms a part of the agreement reached by the Convention."
"This is practically the only issue on which we are asking the Intergovernmental Conference to decide!"
"Why, then, did I decide to vote for this resolution that I do not like?"
"Because a clear message needs to be given at this time: the IGC should not unilaterally reopen the fundamental issues of the text adopted by the Convention and this is what the resolution says."
"From 4 October onwards, if the IGC decides to reopen the agreements then we will resume the battle over its content."
". (FR) The Convention, which was instructed to draw up the draft Constitution for a Europe of 25, published its report at the beginning of the summer."
"Although the lack of change on some issues is to be regretted - and is this not inevitable - on others, we can only welcome the progress made by the Convention."
"Promoting territorial cohesion is now one of the European Union's main objectives and, as a Member of the European Parliament representing an overseas territory, I am bound to welcome this fact."
"Those who saw the work of the Convention as an opportunity to consign Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, concerning the outermost regions to the dustbin were seriously misguided."
"The desire to see the content of this article feature in the future Constitution, is indeed legitimate but there was no guarantee that it would happen."
"I believe that this new development demonstrates the desire to build a Europe that is united in its diversity, a Europe that is willing to provide assistance, a Europe that cares about the development of all citizens and a Europe that provides itself with the legal means to achieve all this!"
"This is what I have been fighting for, together with others and I am thinking in particular of Mrs Pervenche Berès and Mr Olivier Duhamel, who are both representatives of the French Socialist delegation to the Convention and I should like publicly to offer them my thanks."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". I have voted against this report, although some amendments have taken on board a few numbers of our concerns about the future of our continent."
"We must recall that this report was adopted in the Committee by 18th votes to 6, with 4 abstentions, which clearly indicates that the draft constitution lacks of credibility, being this report its formal evaluation by this Parliament."
"The draft Constitution indeed does not incorporate into the Union the basic criteria that could build a desirable home for everybody."
"As the report confirms, the unique nature of the Union is drawn from its member states and citizens."
"The report, following the Constitutional draft, do not give any room to the peoples of Europe to exist as such, what in practical terms, excludes the recognition of the actual Stateless Nations of Europe, as has been clearly enlightened by the words of our catalans colleagues, Mr Gasòliba and Mr Mayol."
"Certainly, this exclusion gratifies the Spanish nationalism of Mr Gil-Robles, but does not match in any way with what Mr Tsatsos wrote after the Treaty of Nice: 'The EU must steer a cause between the opposite poles of effectiveness and legitimacy, a balance which takes account of its raison d'être as Union of peoples and states'."
"(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (FR) We have rejected this report as we rejected the draft Constitutional Treaty drawn up by the Convention and presented by Mr Giscard d'Estaing."
"This draft has no legitimacy because it is not the outcome of the will of Europe's citizens and the Convention was nothing but a mockery of democratic debate."
"Neither those who drafted it nor the decision-makers were mandated by the people or by universal suffrage."
"The views of 'civil society' were certainly given a hearing but there was never any question of involving the citizens in the drafting process."
"The most important aspect, however, is that this Treaty represents the constitutionalisation of a liberal, pro-Nato, militarist and antisocial Europe, which is opposed to secularism, social rights, public services and the interests of the workers."
"We now refuse to give an Intergovernmental Conference the right to decide for us all."
"The stakes, however, are high."
"This European constitution for 450 million citizens will take precedence over national constitutions."
"The container and the contents concern us all."
"What is really needed is a different type of process, in other words, holding binding referendums on the same day throughout the Union in order to ensure that Europe has a different, more progressive draft Constitution."
"The best way of opposing this free-market Europe is by mobilising the citizens, and this will happen in particular at the European Social Forum, which will take place at Saint-Denis in November of this year."
"(DE) I voted for the report on the Constitutional Treaty despite a number of gripes about it, and so I am keen to clarify a number of points. The extension of majority voting to a range of areas is, in an ever-expanding EU, something to be welcomed."
"I regard the automatic abolition of unanimity - something provided for only in exceptional cases anyway - in order to transform it into a super qualified majority after 2009, as being premature at the present time."
"Why announce now something that is due to happen in 2009?"
"I am glad that this passage, which was present in the first draft, has now disappeared."
"I voted against paragraph 22 of the resolution, as I regard the allocation of Members in the European Parliament, as laid down in the protocol on enlargement appended to the Treaty of Nice, as balanced."
"It is, however, not acceptable for the number of MEPs from Luxembourg to be cut by one-third."
"I agree with Mr Juncker, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, that the proposals relating to the presidency of the specialised Councils of Ministers are unclear, in other words, that they still need some clarificatory amendments."
"Nor is the creation of two classes of Commissioner - with and without voting rights - ideal."
"Which country is getting a junior Commissioner, and when?"
"These are all questions that remain to be resolved."
". (NL) The draft constitution, like many national constitutions, is full of fine rhetoric on such things as a high level of environmental protection, with a few points that sound social, and the rejection of capital punishment or discrimination, but this is not why this text was initially conceived."
"The really tough points are the confirmation of the Council's power, which hinders parliamentary democracy, the integration of the whole of the EU into NATO and the establishment of the capitalist character of the EU economy."
"Soon, there will be no more room for a militarily neutral position outside of NATO, as has so far been adopted by Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Austria, Cyprus and Malta."
"It is not only about defending each other's territory against outside attackers together, but also about being able to intervene in defence of our own interests outside of NATO's and the EU's territories."
"The constitution also protects freedom of enterprise and 'free and pure competition'."
"In neo-liberal Europe, public utility companies in the areas of public transport, postal services, energy and telecommunications are no longer considered to be vital community tasks but are contracted out to profit-seekers."
"In this way, this constitution will resemble that of Cuba or the former Soviet Union, which also wanted to lay down the form of their economy and protect it from democratic decisions about change."
"If Europe is to have a constitution, then this is the wrong text."
"There needs to be a referendum on this subject in every Member State."
"- (IT) No one can deny the need for a European Union which has more transparent institutions whose respective roles and competences are better defined, and, as a result, less bureaucratic and more capable of acting quickly, where needed, in a Europe that leaves questions of an exclusively internal nature to the Member States so that it can, instead, deal with the major issues affecting society as a whole and our continent in particular; these objectives are at the heart of the text drawn up in the European Convention's eighteen months of work."
"We are satisfied that the Convention established that Europe should be a union of nation states, respectful of the languages, cultures and traditions of every one of its components, and that this union, strengthened by a Constitutional Treaty, should produce a political, economic and social project capable of protecting our children, but also the rights of others' children: a Europe that, in safeguarding democracy, freedom and peace for its own peoples, is also able to promote freedom, peace and justice in other parts of the world too."
"Precisely in order to ensure that democracy is respected, we urge the Intergovernmental Conference to accept the proposal for a Commissioner and the right to vote for every Member State, remembering that the concept of equal dignity of States, irrespective of the number of inhabitants, took shape as early as the peace of Westphalia."
"(Text abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (FR) I abstained from voting on compromise Amendment No 7 and I disagree with paragraph 30 of the motion for a resolution."
"I believe that it is a mistake to say that 'draft Constitution prepared by the Convention (...) expresses the will of the citizens'."
"The will of the citizens will only be effective once the Constitution has been ratified by a referendum of the people at European level."
"Furthermore, I supported Amendment No 78, which expresses unhappiness at the draft Constitution's inclusion in part III, unamended, of all the articles of the Maastricht Treaty dealing with the Union's economic and monetary policy, which are founded on the principle of 'an open market economy with free competition' (Article III-70 of the draft Constitution)."
"I believe that this amendment is crucial to fully guarantee the content of Article 3 of the draft Constitution, which suggests that the Union is founded on a 'social market economy, highly competitive and aiming at full employment and social progress'."
"On the issue of public services I supported Amendment No 82, which calls for public services to be exempted from the rules of Community competition law."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (DE) I find it regrettable that the majority in the European Parliament has not supported the amendment by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats aimed at incorporating especial reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots in the draft Constitution."
"Even in its present form, however, the Constitution contains elements that are important in terms of Europe's Christian heritage, in that the preamble refers to Europe's religious inheritance, and the Christian conception of mankind becomes one of the Constitution's important foundations through the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Article 51 of the draft Treaty, moreover, gives explicit recognition to the status of the churches and non-confessional organisations."
"So the Constitution includes important features relating to Europe's religious heritage."
"By means of its amendment, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sought to add another important dimension to these elements."
"It is now for the Intergovernmental Conference, and hence for the Member States, to take on board this proposal and add it to the draft Constitution."
". (FR) This report embodies a number of contradictions."
"The most obvious of these is that Parliament is in favour of opening up the IGC but only in order to ensure that it achieves nothing."
"Overall, the majority does appear to be highly satisfied with the results achieved by the Convention, but cannot deny that the major and recurring problems, such as a lack of democracy, transparency and effectiveness have still not been resolved."
"As regards the detail, every proposal contradicts the commitment to diversity and to respect for democracy, because attempts are still being made to impose a uniform and binding supranational law."
"The Chasse Pêche Nature Traditions (CPNT) Members of the European Parliament's Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD) feel that the Convention's method makes the same mistake that besets all diplomatic negotiations."
"The decision was taken within a circle consisting of a chosen few, which seeks to impose its point of view, as has been the case since the beginnings of Community integration."
"The only aspect of the draft drawn up by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was the last paragraph, which consented to seek the citizens' by referendum in the States whose constitution allows this."
"It is to this test of truth that the proposals on the future of Europe must really be subject, by allowing a genuinely open debate on which everyone can take a stance."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"We voted against a proposal for a Constitution that is very complex and difficult to explain and understand; it is difficult to imagine how its mechanisms, dialectics and balance of powers will work in reality."
"A very complex institutional structure is, by definition, not secular but conceived for the priests of bureaucracy that control everyday life: life that cannot be controlled and cannot function."
"Whilst not denying that there has been progress in the current situation, it is in internal and related affairs."
"There have, however, also been steps backwards such as the inclusion of Article 51(I), the declaration annexed to the Treaty, which confirms the status of religious bureaucracies too."
"In fact, it obliges the EU to maintain regular dialogue with churches, thus violating the principle of secularism, the principle of separation between public institutions and religious organisations."
"In this way the power of churches to interfere is sanctioned, and this is likely to constitute an obscurantist obstacle to the European citizens' right to decide freely on questions of ethics and science."
"Furthermore, the EU is prevented from examining or reconsidering the situation of churches in the Member States, and so the preservation of privileges that are enjoyed by churches thanks to the agreements signed with Franco in Spain, Mussolini in Italy, Salazar in Portugal and Hitler in Germany is guaranteed."
"(Text abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"- (ES) I take a positive view of the text of the report, in that it responds to many of the expectations of the political groups in this Parliament in relation to the future European Constitution."
"Nevertheless, as a Member from Catalonia, a stateless nation which currently has a limited Statute of Autonomy within the framework of the Spanish state, I cannot accept the deficiencies in the future Constitutional text, particularly in relation to two specific aspects."
"On the one hand, the territories with legislative powers have no clear, recognised system for participating in the EU's policy-making."
"Neither is it established that those regions have the possibility of bringing cases before the Court of Justice when its competences may be affected."
"Furthermore, neither does the future European Constitution provide for the incorporation into the Union's linguistic system of those languages which have official status in part of the territory of a Member State, as in the case of Catalan."
"I hope that in the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) the governments of the Member States will modify the text so that it is brought closer to the reality of today's Europe in relation to the aspects I have mentioned."
"I therefore abstained from the final vote on the report."
"That concludes the vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 2 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Middle East."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are deeply concerned about the situation in the Middle East and about the most recent events that have shaken the region."
"The campaign of targeted killings which Israel has decided upon to eliminate the leaders of Hamas, the repeated appalling and bloody terrorist attacks in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the resignation of the Palestinian Prime Minister, Abu Mazen, and the obstacles put in the way of his government by the President of the Palestinian National Authority, the decision in principle taken by Israel's Security Cabinet - the 'kitchen cabinet' - to expel President Arafat from the Palestinian Territories, and even the idea mooted that he should be killed, are all elements in a circle of violence which is in danger of spiralling completely out of control, putting an end to any hope of restoring peace to the Holy Land."
"The escalation of violence therefore needs to be halted as soon as possible."
"A ceasefire needs to be called without delay so that the negotiating process can be re-relaunched. We are committed to achieving this as a priority."
"Indeed, we remain convinced that the only means of achieving a fair and lasting peace based on the United Nations' resolutions and principles is a process based on negotiation and on implementing the process laid out in the road map in good faith."
"Only in this way will it be possible to realise the vision shared by the international community of two states peacefully coexisting and respecting both the Palestinians' right to self-determination and the Israelis' right to live in peace and security."
"In addition to the day-to-day measures needed to respond to short-term imperatives, we also need other, more extensive measures based on a long-term vision of an area of peace, understanding, dialogue, prosperity and security, uniting the two shores of the Mediterranean."
"This will be the vision before us at the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference in Naples, which we hope will give the Barcelona process fresh impetus and enable it to play its part in stabilising and bringing peace to the Middle East and to a wider Middle East."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is of the utmost importance that the European Union should maintain a coherent approach on this issue, an approach fully supported by the Member States, the product of ongoing, thorough dialogue between the different viewpoints and perspectives."
"Only by demonstrating cohesion and unity will the Union actually be able to strengthen its role and its influence in the Quartet and within the region, something we very much hope for."
"In this connection, the unanimous, united vote by the 25 nations in the UN General Assembly in New York on the resolution exhorting the Israeli Government not to implement its decision to expel Yasser Arafat must be stressed."
"What should our strategy be?"
"In the first place, as I have already said, we believe that the only way to achieve a peaceful solution of the conflict is for the Israelis and the Palestinians to implement the road map promptly in good faith."
"We are therefore, once again, taking a firm line, calling for the terrorist structures to be dismantled and for both parties to refrain from acts likely to feed the spiral of violence."
"Secondly, we believe that only broad-based international action can create the conditions necessary for the road map to succeed."
"This is why we have been consistently committed, from the very beginning of our Presidency, to making the role played by the Quartet (including its role on the ground) more effective as the driving force behind negotiations between the two parties and, at the same time, to reinforcing the credibility and authority of the European Union's action within the Quartet."
"Although the United States is the undoubted leader of the whole process, we must, to my mind, avoid a situation where it is left to act alone, unilaterally, on the ground: the European Union's role must be recognised."
"Indeed, let us not forget that the European Union's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict are one of its international priorities."
"Not only is this crisis taking place at the Union's southern borders and destabilising the whole of the Middle East and the Mediterranean region, but it also has wider adverse repercussions affecting the dialogue between civilisations and religions and the fight against international terrorism."
"In the course of the practical implementation of the clear strategy I have just outlined, in line with our longstanding strong European commitment, we have consistently devoted special attention to the Israel-Palestine conflict."
"Ladies and gentlemen, to return now to the present, I would like to report on the initiatives that the Italian Presidency has taken in response to the latest tragic events which led to the breakdown of the truce and a return to the appalling spiral of violence."
"As well as supporting the action taken by Mr Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, who has made several visits to the region, we have stayed closely in touch with our fellow Quartet members - the United States, Russia and the United Nations - monitoring and assessing all the implications of the situation on the ground, in order to be able to take the most timely and appropriate steps to relaunch the negotiating process."
"We have also acted to ensure that the Quartet will resume meeting at regular intervals at Special Envoy level without delay and that its ministers will meet on the occasion of the ministerial week at the United Nations General Assembly."
"The members of the Quartet are unanimous in thinking that its role should be further reinforced."
"We have told the two sides via various channels that they must, without fail, take concrete measures straight away to halt the violence and to avoid any action which could prevent a return to the negotiating table."
"The progress made in the weeks following acceptance of the road map demonstrated that this is the path to take."
"Despite everything that has happened, we have a duty not to lose heart. There is still an opening, an opportunity to achieve the goals we have set, and violence must not prevent us from seizing it."
"This was also the thrust of the public declaration issued by the Italian Presidency on behalf of its partners and with their approval on 11 September 2003."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have enormous responsibilities towards their citizens and towards the international community."
"We accordingly expect them to show firm commitment, greater determination and, above all, great courage, sparing no effort in their pursuit of peace."
"It is important that the power vacuum created by the resignation of Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas should be filled without delay."
"Abu Ala, the Prime Minister designate, should quickly form a new Government of respected Palestinian politicians enjoying both his and his people's trust."
"The new government should continue along the path laid out for it by Prime Minister Abu Mazen, putting an end to violence and opting resolutely for negotiation."
"Abu Ala should also, as soon as possible and without further ado, deliver clear, tangible results on the security front by taking resolute action against terrorist violence."
"To that end, it should be the new government - regardless of the membership of the national security council that President Arafat is preparing to appoint - which should have full control over the security forces."
"If they take this path, Abu Ala and his government can count on the European Union's wholehearted support."
"I wish here to reiterate our conviction that there can and must be no tolerance for terrorism."
"As the holders of the European Union Presidency, reflecting very widespread public opinion in the Union, we firmly condemned the terrorist attacks for which Palestinian extremist organisations claimed responsibility."
"At their informal meeting in Riva del Garda at the beginning of September, the EU Foreign Ministers decided to add the political wing of Hamas to Europe's list of terrorist organisations."
"This had to be done: the EU had issued clear warnings to Hamas at the Thessaloniki European Council; not to have followed them up would have undermined the Union's credibility as a force to be reckoned with in the region."
"I am very happy that the Council was able to reach a consensus that overcame the doubts harboured by some partners and enabled us to agree convincingly on a common position."
"We also consider that the reforms being introduced by the Palestinian National Authority, to make it more democratic, transparent and efficient, are another necessary condition for a peaceful, stable and democratic Palestinian state."
"Those reforms must continue and be nurtured by support from the European Union and the international community."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to set out clearly the Presidency's position with regard to President Arafat."
"We cannot deny the essentially negative role that he has played in recent months, contributing to the splits in the PNA's leadership, undermining the efforts of Prime Minister Abu Mazen and causing his resignation."
"His historical role and his responsibilities towards the Palestinian people should entitle us to expect from President Arafat a change of heart, full backing for the Prime Minister designate, Abu Ala, and a clear condemnation of terrorist violence."
"Nonetheless, as the Presidency has publicly made clear to the Israeli Government, Yasser Arafat is the Palestinians' legitimately elected President; to send him into exile would be unacceptable and a very serious mistake."
"The European Union - confirmed in this stance by the similar positions of the United States, Russia and many other members of the international community - has, accordingly, asked Israel to rescind its decision and to guarantee the physical safety of the President of the Palestinian National Authority: death threats are unacceptable."
"We also reminded the Israeli Government of the need to show moderation and put an end, once and for all, to the targeted killings, which, apart from any considerations of international law, all too frequently also strike the innocent, thereby doing much to stoke the fires of rage, frustration and violence."
"We also urged Israel to work harder to ease the conditions of the Palestinian people in the territories."
"Lastly, we reminded Israel - whose need for security we do not underestimate - that the European Union expects it to proceed with other specific steps identified by the road map without delay, in particular to suspend all settlement activity in the Palestinian territories, to dismantle the settlements built since March 2001 and to stop erecting the 'security wall' along its current route, which is sited beyond the 'green line' and therefore jeopardises any prospect of a negotiated solution to the conflict."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has an important part to play in the Quartet to reinvigorate the negotiating process in the direction I have described."
"However, those diplomatic efforts must go hand in hand with action on the ground."
"We are convinced that the European Union can, alongside the United States, take on a larger role in the international monitoring arrangements provided for in the road map right from phase 1."
"The possibility of greater European involvement will also be discussed at the Quartet's forthcoming ministerial meeting in New York."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that, yet again, we have reached a critical point in the Middle East crisis; it is all the more painful because hopes were objectively raised by what seemed to be shared determination to forge ahead regardless of difficulties, with no effort spared."
"History, especially the history of the Middle East crisis, teaches us that it is precisely when the negotiating process is yielding its first fruits that the forces of radical extremism, which are opposed to any form of peace, unleash greater violence."
"At precisely these times, however, the onus is on the international community to press the parties involved to opt clearly for the negotiating table and to reject the use of violence."
"The European Union will ensure that the region and the parties involved feel the weight of its efforts to bring about a negotiated peace."
"In taking this road, we very much hope that we can rely on the support of Parliament, with its long tradition of closely following the Middle East crisis and responding to it."
"Mr President, the Commission shares the assessment made by the Council Presidency, which can be summarised in a few words: the Middle East peace process has gone off the rails."
"We believe that the future of the road map depends on a solid and unambiguous commitment by both sides and by the international community."
"What is lacking is the political will, which is a crucial factor for peace and completely non-existent today."
"We had hoped that the road map would create the political will to implement the vision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace."
"Is this still possible?"
"It is, but only if Israel regains a certain feeling of security, is once again accepted in the region and can have confidence in the Palestinian structures and if at the same time the Palestinians see that Israel accepts their aspiration to build a nation on the territory seized by Israel in 1967, as well as their desire to improve their economic and humanitarian situation."
"What needs to be done today to give new impetus to this road map, which is coming apart at the seams?"
"Israel would have to adopt a sufficient number of measures designed to establish a climate of trust, in particular by stopping the extrajudicial executions and the punitive house demolitions, it would have to prove that all illegal settlements built since September 2000 will be dismantled and impose a freeze on new settlements and resolve the problems caused by the building of the 'security wall'."
"The Palestinians for their part must adopt visible and effective measures to combat the planning or perpetration of terrorist attacks against Israelis by individuals or groups, rein in seditious acts, publicly declaim Israel's right to exist and speed up preparations for elections, for drafting a constitution and for the participation of civil society in reform."
"We believe that the international community must exert its influence in order to resolve the security problem and offer rapid and effective support as sponsors."
"Tomorrow, in New York, the quartet will meet and the European Union will take the opportunity to attempt to persuade all parties to accept genuine coordination of the quartet as regards the support and follow-up that should be given to this road map."
"As the Council Presidency stated, Hamas still appears on the list of terrorist organisations, but banning this movement in the United States and in Europe is not enough."
"We must go further."
"Radical forces exert their influence through the social and educational services and we must not content ourselves with helping to cut off their sources of funding."
"We must also increase the Palestinian authority's power to provide local services."
"The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) can also provide support in this area."
"We believe that what improving security and the fight against extremism requires is above all Community-level action."
"The Commission has announced a programme of support for the reforms to be undertaken by the Palestinian Authority and also various measures aimed at alleviating the economic and humanitarian problems."
"We estimate that our commitment this year will total around EUR 245 million."
"We feel encouraged in this course of action by the aid recently donated to the Palestinian Authority by the United States and by the restoration of Israeli tax receipts to the Palestinian Authority."
"This will not by any means suffice, however, to get the Palestinian Authority up and running again."
"The economic situation will not improve if the border closures remain in place and Israel, for its part, must help to kick-start the Palestinian Authority."
"We must also continue to reiterate to all Arab States to put an end to all public and private funding of groups bent on violence and terrorism and to close down the offices of their representations."
"We in Europe have much more to offer the people of the Middle East: ever-closer relations thanks to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the network of association agreements that is currently being set up."
"We have presented the new initiative on the policy of neighbourhood relations in an enlarged Europe, which sets out all the opportunities for closer cooperation to achieve the economic and social integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region. Only progress in the context of the peace process, however, can help our partners in the region to take full advantage of the opportunities with which the European Union will continue to provide them in this field."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East appears to be hopeless."
"After the removal of the Iraqi dictator, we had all hoped for a new and peaceful order in the Middle East."
"This hope proved to be false, and it appears as if all efforts for peace, and the roadmap, have come to nothing."
"Mahmud Abbas has been replaced by Ahmed Kurei after only four months in power."
"Personalities are of course important, and we also know that the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat are the decision-makers, but, in essence, this is about the people of these countries."
"Prime Minister Sharon is democratically elected; so is President Arafat."
"I do not know whether his election meets all the democratic criteria, but he is elected."
"He is also a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, something that should perhaps spur the Israeli Government and the Palestinians to get back to the common ground that President Arafat once shared with the Israeli Prime Minister Rabin."
"We are all familiar with the enormous problems that we face. In our group, we are perfectly clear in our own minds that we can in no way justify the suicide attacks, which hold human life in contempt."
"They constitute an abuse of the young people to whom promises of paradise are made, and they involve the murder of other innocent people."
"They bring about a vicious circle of violence; another result of them is Israel's death lists, which we can in no way approve of, since - as Commissioner Lamy and Mr Antonione have said - it is not only the hunted criminals, or those assumed to be such, but also a very large number of innocent people who end up being killed."
"A policy of 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth' will bring no resolution."
"Just as we hear Hamas and Islamic Jihad speaking the language of hatred, we also see the deeds of hatred, and all this leads to further escalations."
"There are also Israel's illegal settlements in Western Jordan, which are a constant provocation for the people in Palestine."
"Let me quote this from the 8 September issue of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: 'The symbolic removal of a few containers in illegal settlements west of the Jordan was too little for it to have been capable of becoming an encouraging experience of success for the Palestinians.'"
"The building of a wall rams home the deep sense of constant humiliation felt in Palestine."
"We must seek to enable both Israel and Palestine to live within secure borders, and we declare that all the people of that region - Israelis and Palestinians alike - are endowed with the same dignity."
"That is why, despite the apparent hopelessness, there is no alternative to pressing on with the efforts towards peace."
"I am speaking personally rather than on behalf of my group when I say that I do not believe that a peaceful solution will be possible without an international military peacekeeping force."
"Unless an international military peacekeeping force is used to keep the two sides off each other, I do not believe that a solution will be possible."
"Nor can we expect the Americans to do everything - their elections mean, in any case, that they are less capable of acting in this area."
"I rejoice at the common purpose that is apparent here, and it is as the European Union that we should persist in our efforts together with the USA, with the UN, and with Russia."
"We must persist in our efforts, for it is the people of the Middle East who are at stake."
"Mr President, the Israeli threats to assassinate Yasser Arafat are not just morally reprehensible, but also politically unacceptable and absurd, unless, of course, the intention is to cause chaos in the region."
"It is as if we were not all aware that Hamas and Islamic Jihad consider Arafat to be the barrier preventing them from attempting an assault on Israel."
"How are the Palestinians going to negotiate with people who intend, in this way, to assassinate their President, democratically elected in 1996 in fair and democratic elections, in the presence of observers, including ours?"
"Frankly, the only legitimate and morally acceptable way to get rid of Arafat is by means of the elections laid down in the roadmap."
"George Bush has just said, although it sounds like sarcasm, that 'in the United States we free people by means of a peaceful and ordered process' but, nevertheless, has vetoed a resolution in the Security Council which advocated just that and expressed opposition to political assassination."
"I would like to highlight here and now the political realism of President Chirac, who said in New York, and I quote verbatim, Mr President: 'you may think what you like about Arafat, but the truth is that he is the authority, the elected and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people."
"I do not believe that anyone else can impose an agreement on the Palestinians'."
"End of quote."
"Within this context, and in relation to the settlements, it offers little hope that Colin Powell should have said on Monday, and I quote, that: 'it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the Israeli Prime Minister to say to his people that he is giving in to American pressure'."
"End of quote."
"I would ask myself: have the Palestinians not given in, by reforming the Ministry of Finance and creating the post of Prime Minister against the initial will of Arafat although, at the end of the day, with his assent?"
"Incidentally, however, if you wish to listen to an Israeli voice on the subject of Yasser Arafat, then please listen to Simon Peres, who - on reaching 80 years old - has said: firstly, that Arafat has accepted the theory of two states, abandoning that of the destruction of the state of Israel; secondly, that he has accepted the 1967 borders, abandoning those of 1948, and, thirdly, that he has agreed to negotiate."
"Simon Peres says - and it is true - that Yasser Arafat only has one significant fault, which is that he is not combating the fundamentalist militias of Hamas and Jihad."
"I, however, would say that until the Israeli Government adopts specific measures, which are credible to the Palestinian population, on selective assassinations, the settlements or the wall of shame, for example, no Palestinian will enjoy the popularity and political support necessary to combat the Islamic extremists."
"Mr President, not until the non-terrorists have a consolidated political space, which so far Israel has not provided, will the terrorists have lost the war."
"Mr President, two weeks ago a London newspaper convened a meeting between senior journalists from Israel and Palestine, the first of its kind since before the current intifada."
"A number of participants, from both sides, expressed the belief that theirs was, in effect, a 'twenty-second century conflict': a war that would last a hundred years, blighting the lives of their grandchildren's children."
"A conflict that has the capacity to exhaust the optimism of the best of us once again demands deeper reserves of patience and commitment."
"But grim as the situation is, we cannot afford to despair."
"If the two sides have strayed from the roadmap's path of peace and reconciliation, we must coax them back."
"The European Union must continue to play a crucial role in the search for peace in the Middle East."
"Greater engagement with Israel might help in this."
"Making peace also requires a strong, functioning and accountable Palestinian Authority."
"That is why the Union has spent more than EUR 300 million since 2000 to keep the Palestinian Authority in business."
"An effective and legitimate Palestinian Authority is essential to dismantle the terrorist organisations."
"The Palestinians also need a strong voice to negotiate with Israel."
"The European Union must step up its support for financial reform of the Authority to help it distance itself from terrorism."
"We have also provided more than EUR 30 million for the vital work of Palestinian municipalities in providing basic public services, because that is how you fight despair - with clean water and classrooms; with the promise of normality and peace."
"We may regret Yasser Arafat's intransigence, but we should remember that if the Palestinians voted tomorrow in the fair and transparent elections we would like to see, they would probably choose him again as their leader."
"The surest way to ensure that outcome would be for Israel to make a martyr out of him."
"Arafat's place in the peace process is not for us to determine, any more than it is for Israel or for the United States."
"However, we can have no truck with terrorism."
"That is why my Group welcomes the inclusion of Hamas in the European list of terrorist organisations."
"Suicide bombings have taken an unbearable toll in Israeli lives, and the political apologists for terror cannot receive support while the killing continues."
"Both sides have to realise that there can be no military solution to this conflict."
"Israel's extra-judicial killings must end, as they will only breed more terrorists, not force the Palestinians to negotiate."
"Israel must withdraw its forces from the Occupied Territories, and the settlement building must stop."
"Two states, living side by side in peace - that is the only viable solution."
"Israel's existence as a Jewish state and as a democracy demands a Palestinian state."
"The alternatives are Palestinian apartheid or the inexorable demographic eclipse of Israel's character as a Jewish homeland."
"The roadmap, of which the European Union was the chief cartographer, recognises this, and my Group remains firmly committed to its implementation."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, thank you, Europe, for the unanimous stance it adopted at the UN General Assembly."
"Europe's assistance will be more important than ever in salvaging the situation."
"This is the message given to us on Saturday, in Ramallah, by President Arafat, who was visibly relieved to have the impassioned support of his people in the face of Ariel Sharon's relentless hounding of him."
"At the same time, however, he was extremely concerned at the increasingly intolerable situation facing his fellow countrymen."
"After the staggering decision of principle taken by the Israeli cabinet to expel an elected president from his country, and even, if comments made by the number 2 in the Sharon government are to be believed, to physically eliminate him, my group wished, through the intermediary of its chairman and of our colleague Mrs Morgantini, the chairman of the Parliamentary delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, to express on the spot what the vast majority of European citizens, including many who are actually critical of the Palestinian Authority, think about this extremely serious precedent. This decision is completely unacceptable and I think that it must give food for thought to anyone who thinks that accommodating Ariel Sharon will encourage him to relax his approach."
"The main lesson that we can learn from our meetings in Ramallah, and also in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, is that there has never been a greater need for external political intervention in order to create a momentum for negotiations that offers a population on its knees some hope of a worthy and equitable peace."
"I still remember the ominous words of Commissioner Patten on the eve of the war with Iraq: he basically said, to a barrage of applause from our House, that the one thing he was sure about, was that if this war takes place without a political solution being found for the conflict in the Middle East, we will see an upsurge in terrorism."
"This is, unfortunately, the situation now facing us."
"The 'road map' was supposed to take up this challenge and is in a doubly strong position to do so."
"Firstly, this is a general political plan, not one concerned solely with security."
"Because it makes sense, the Palestinian people will be all the more willing to rally forces to prevent terrorist acts as their daily lives become liveable once again and as their fundamental rights are recognised."
"Furthermore, the route map has four official godparents, not just one, whose credibility as peacemaker is at its lowest ebb."
"And yet, four months after launching this initiative, what remains of it?"
"What has become of the 'road map', what has happened to the 'quartet' and, for that matter, what is Europe doing?"
"At this crucial time, the European Union is unavailable to its subscribers."
"I would like to believe that the unanimous vote given by the 25 in New York last week is a sign of a new awareness as regards the collective responsibility that must be shouldered in the region, and Mr Solana, due to speak to Parliament on 9 October, will then explain the political strategy, the practical goals to attain and the timetable of the initiatives decided on in Council to prevent the worst case scenario from arising and to give fresh hope to the Middle East."
"My own conviction is that, of the priorities for launching such an initiative, three warrant particular attention."
"First of all, we must refuse to give in to Ariel Sharon's blackmail where President Arafat is concerned."
"It is one thing to support the idea that reforms are needed in the Palestinian Authority."
"This debate is already taking place in Palestinian society, and is legitimate and healthy."
"It is another matter altogether unquestioningly to accept the de facto imprisonment of an elected president in the ruins of his headquarters. What is even worse is the fact that we are bowing down to the veto imposed by the occupying force whilst failing to meet the man seen by his entire people as the living embodiment of Palestine."
"Significant action is required, in my opinion, to put an end to this terrible ambiguity."
"Next, we must strongly oppose the wall that is being built."
"This is not simply a border that is questionable only in its appropriateness."
"This constitutes a blatant incursion into internationally recognised Palestinian territory."
"The wall cuts through the University of Aboudis, near Jerusalem."
"It cuts through the very heart of Bethlehem."
"It is depriving Palestinian farmers of crucial irrigated land to the north of the West Bank."
"The wall's construction has entailed further land confiscations, further expulsions, and to further check points and foreshadows a Palestine in pieces."
"This is a scandal of such proportions that even President Bush has taken umbrage at the action of his protégé."
"If the White House itself is threatening to remove US credit guarantees for Israel if Israel continues to forge ahead in this opportunistic way, the European Union must finally be bold enough to state clearly that the association agreements with Israel will only remain in place if there is a change of direction in Ariel Sharon's policy."
"Lastly, we must attach priority to all Israeli and Palestinian initiatives to halt the violence and to reopen political dialogue."
"I am thinking in particular of the coalition for peace, whose prime movers are Yossi Beilin, former Israeli Minister and negotiator of the Oslo agreements and Yasser Abed Rabbo, outgoing Palestinian government Minister, also a steadfast proponent of Israeli-Palestinian dialogue."
"These two remarkable personalities have furthermore just accepted the invitation I sent them, on behalf of my group, jointly to visit the European Parliament in mid-November and speak to us."
"I am also thinking of one of the most symbolic of all Palestinian prisoners, Marwan Barghouti, a member of parliament and also someone who is highly committed to the Oslo negotiations and whose prestige, particularly amongst Palestinian youths, could help to persuade the most recent recruits to engage in dialogue rather than in violence."
"Lastly, Mr President, I am thinking of Yasser Arafat himself, who has just reiterated his determination to work on achieving a ceasefire and not just a truce, if his efforts and those of the prime minister, Abu Mazen, are not blown out of the water by targeted assassinations and house demolitions."
"The President of the State of Israel, unlike Ariel Sharon, has called for this prospect to be taken extremely seriously."
"I believe that high-profile initiatives by the European Union in this direction are highly pertinent."
"This is the express request of my group, but this is above all the dearest wish of supporters of peace on the ground who would like to be able to say as soon as possible, full of hope 'Europe is back'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'there is something rotten in the state of Israel', and, as my friend Abraham Burg, former President of the Knesset, recently wrote in The International Herald Tribune, 'a state lacking justice cannot survive'."
"He went on to write, 'We must remove all the settlements, all of them and draw an international recognized border between a Jewish National Home and a Palestinian National Home'."
"The European Union can protest as much as it wants against Sharon's adopted policy; the real change has to happen in Israel itself, where gradually, people are realising that they are heading the wrong way."
"The separation wall will not solve the problem."
"We know in Europe that walls are not permanent and that borders do not last for ever."
"Israel is a friend on the wrong track."
"Who can help this friend at this stage?"
"Who can bring pressure to bear on the government in Israel?"
"The United States can, because it can turn off the money tap."
"Apparently, we should not expect much from Washington in the short term either."
"Is it still serious about the roadmap?"
"Is it not time to win respect in the Arab world, now that the situation in Iraq is continually deteriorating?"
"International law should not lose out in the fight against terrorism."
"We believe that both camps must disarm."
"Arafat's status as the elected leader is a matter of unalterable fact."
"The time is ripe, I believe, for a major conference on the Middle East, at which the European Union can speak with one voice."
"Only by means of a global solution can peace and stability be established."
"The United States is asking for support for Iraq."
"The European Union is asking for support for Israel and Palestine."
"Indeed, It is indeed possible, Mr Poettering, to moot the idea of an international military force in this context."
"Mr President, there is great concern, and justifiably so, surrounding the extremely grave situation in the Middle East."
"Prospects for progress are bleaker now than at any time this year."
"There has been almost a complete breakdown in the implementation of the roadmap for peace in the region."
"The cease-fire announced by Islamic Jihad and Hamas has been called off and their leaderships have called for attacks on Israel."
"Planned Israeli withdrawals from some towns in the West Bank have been cancelled and the Israeli army has been active against Palestinians in Gaza."
"The Israeli security cabinet has also decided, in principle, to remove President Arafat from the Occupied Territories."
"This decision has been widely criticised, and rightly so."
"On the Israeli side there has been a failure to meet commitments, to dismantle settlement outposts and to freeze settlement activity."
"The Palestinian side has also been unable to fulfil many of its commitments on the issue of future security."
"New buildings continue to be erected on the settlements in and around Jerusalem and the prospects for the roadmap appear dim unless action is taken in the immediate future."
"I believe that imaginative gestures must be the order of the day if the roadmap is to have any chance of survival."
"Neither side has met its commitment under the roadmap for peace."
"That is one issue that we can all agree on."
"The new Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Alaa has international credibility as he is one of the Palestinian negotiators of the 1993 Oslo Accord."
"We cannot disguise the fact that the decision of the Israel security cabinet to remove President Arafat from the Occupied Territories has led to a deteriorating situation in the Middle East."
"At the moment the Israelis are insisting that their ban on contacts with those who meet Yasser Arafat also applies to people from within the European Union."
"This is an issue that will have to be resolved if the European Union is to have any effective role in the region."
"I strongly believe that efforts to isolate President Arafat will only exasperate tensions within the Palestinian leadership."
"Any attempt by Israel to expel him from the Occupied Territories will only undermine the Palestinian Authority and will further inflame the security situation."
"The Palestinian leadership has been presented with a list of security messages by the United States Government that will have to be implemented."
"I would also urge the government of the United States to remain fully engaged in the peace process and to press Israel on its commitment to the roadmap."
"Finally, I welcome the continued efforts of Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten to renew a cease-fire in the region."
"This has been a particularly bad year for the Middle East."
"Not only is the political situation becoming more unstable now in Iraq, but if we are not all collectively careful, the situation between Israel and Palestine could also deteriorate further."
"Mr President, on Saturday 6 September, Mahmud Abbas, having resigned as Palestinian Prime Minister, appeared before the Palestinian parliament to render an account of his brief term of office."
"He did so behind closed doors."
"What has since been made known of this closed meeting makes a mockery of any Palestinian implementation of the so-called roadmap."
"It is abundantly clear from Mr Abbas' indictment that the person responsible for this is the President of the Palestinian Authority."
"Mahmud Abbas was, along with his Cabinet, committed to the reform of elementary policy areas such as the coordination of the Palestinian security services and the purely financial management of public funds, but to no avail."
"All these praiseworthy attempts eventually foundered on one person's thirst for power, that person being 'raïs' Yasser Arafat. Hence Abbas' lament: 'A Palestinian minister does not even have anywhere near as much power as a deputy secretary elsewhere.'"
"How do we go on from here?"
"Officially, the President of the Palestinian Authority is very much the relevant political interlocutor for the European institutions."
"Given the seriousness of Mahmud Abbas' accusations, I am asking both the Council and Commission what they think the implications of this are."
"After all, ignoring this courageous, honest Palestinian self-criticism renders the roadmap to peace in the Middle East politically implausible - certainly when a new Palestinian Prime Minister has to operate from the same position of relative weakness as Mahmud Abbas."
"Mr President, a few days ago, the UN General Assembly, with negative votes by the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Israel and the USA alone, adopted the well-publicised resolution on Arafat."
"This resolution, interpreted politically, does not only have the narrow sense of what Arafat means and what the problem means today; it also expresses the demand of the international community for a solution at long last to this impasse of a crisis which has lasted 40, 50, 60 years, with thousands dead and thousands murdered."
"What we are or are not debating today is immaterial in relation to what must be done there."
"We here are a political body."
"We are not judging intentions."
"In this sense, we must only speak about what needs to be done politically."
"We are talking about one roadmap in relation to what is happening in the area and we fail to see the other roadmap, the map of violence, of blood, of suicides, of innocent people murdered and so on, of the wall, of anything else."
"Over recent days, there has been a new representative of the European Union in the region, Mr Otte."
"Unfortunately, however, he has been ill-received by the Sharon side, which has refused to receive him, as it refused our other representatives, because they also wanted to see Arafat."
"This is not a positive development."
"We must send out certain positive messages."
"The Quartet is not enough, it is not enough as a body of observers."
"It needs to be converted into a task force which will impose terms and conditions and procedures."
"Otherwise, every time we come here, we shall list our complaints, some of us from a position of security, others in line with their sympathies, but without any final result."
"I therefore agree with the proposal made by my honourable friend Mr Poettering for international blue-helmeted observers to be installed at long last on the border between the two states, as has happened elsewhere in the world."
"I agree with all the proposals which do not have us as neutral observers, which do not lead us into inaction."
"I agree with all the proposals which, at long last, call for us to take action on our own responsibility and not for us to simply wait and follow others' instructions."
"Mr President, I get the impression that too many speakers in this Chamber are referring to the road map without having read it, and that, because of their unfamiliarity with the actual document, they are interpreting it in an ambiguous way."
"The road map is a plan in three phases."
"The whole thing is summed up in the title of Phase I - Ending terror and violence, normalising Palestinian life, building Palestinian institutions - and its aim is to bring about an immediate and unconditional end to violence on the Palestinian side."
"This is the vital point, and if it cannot be achieved everything else will become ambiguous, uncertain and vaguely sermonising in tone."
"Frankly, it does not make sense to call on Israel to take further or different initiatives in addition to those it has adopted thus far, if acts of terrorism on the part of the Palestinians are not halted."
"No European state confronted with a series of terrorist attacks, especially against unarmed civilians, would agree not to react using force and legal means of suppressing violence."
"Nor am I convinced by the exhortations to keep Mr Arafat in place on the grounds that he is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, given that everyone recognises that there are still no democratic institutions within the Palestinian community."
"Yasser Arafat is responsible for the failure of the Camp David agreement and for Abu Mazen's failure."
"I believe that we in Europe should adopt a more severe approach towards his behaviour if we are to secure a change in attitude."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, one minute is not long, but if it is to reiterate what has been said before, then one minute is sufficient."
"I concur with what Mr Wurtz has said, but I should like to add something in relation to our own mandate."
"When we are confronted with endless violence that always generates more violence, then we are facing a situation that condemns Europeans, Americans and Russians to powerlessness, insofar as their opinions are expressed in a joint phased plan to peace."
"There is no phased plan to peace."
"I have read it and do not want to read it again."
"For what is left of it?"
"It has been shot to tatters from all corners."
"What I am asking you is how we can take a new direction."
"With this roadmap, have we not been led to believe in an all too optimistic scenario, the premises of which have not been accepted by the actual state of Israel itself?"
"Has Israel accepted that it will, from now on, live with a Palestinian state beside it?"
"Has Israel really abandoned the idea that the occupied territories should be governed by Israelis?"
"I am coming to the conclusion that it has not and that, instead, it hopes to achieve military dominance in the region with military backing from the United States."
"In that case, there will be no peace."
"Every nation is entitled to its own home."
"I see it as Europe's responsibility to sit down with both parties to find out their real intentions and to stop collaborating with a regime that is using military means to eradicate part of a powerless nation and is trying to kill its elected president."
"Mr President, if Abu Allah's period of office is to be longer than Abu Massen's, and if he is to have any kind of chance of combating terrorism, Israel must not provoke the Palestinian population the whole time and undermine all the attempts on the part, for example, of Abu Abbas, to stop the violence."
"Remember what happened the day after he had got the Palestinian leaders to enter into a unilateral ceasefire."
"Israel liquidated Hamas leaders in the street, an act that was of course no better than a terrorist attack, for, when Hamas leaders are liquidated, their wives and children and casual passers-by are also killed. Nor, of course, is an occupying power entitled to kill in the street those who are engaged in resistance."
"I believe that until the West makes it fully clear that we condemn the liquidations perpetrated by Israel just as strongly as we condemn suicide bombers; until we make it abundantly clear to Israel that it must call a halt to the settlements; and until we make it crystal clear that, as long as it holds Palestine in an iron grip of oppression and violence, there can be no peace, we make it completely impossible for any Palestinian Prime Minister to put a stop to the violence."
"When I was last in Palestine with the delegation, there were three deaths in just the few days that I was there."
"A little boy died when an olive stone went down his throat the wrong way."
"There was a curfew, so no doctor went out to him, and he therefore died."
"An old man died at the checkpoint."
"He said that he had a bad heart, but the soldiers refused to allow him to pass the checkpoint, and they looked on as he died there of a heart attack."
"A patient died in an ambulance on the way to hospital because it too was not allowed to pass the checkpoint."
"Until we begin to condemn such things just as roundly, there will be no peace in the Middle East."
"We have the honour of welcoming Mr Abdou Diouf, the former president of the Republic of Senegal and secretary-general of the International Organization of the Francophonie to the gallery."
"The International Organization of the Francophonie helps with its activities to reach people within the framework of respect for cultural diversity."
"Mr Diouf, I welcome you and your representation to the European Parliament."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that we are facing a catastrophic situation in the Middle East, and one of course wonders who is to be blamed for it."
"It would be far too simple to attribute responsibility to one side alone, but it must give us pause for thought when Abraham Burg, a member of the Israeli Knesset whom we welcomed to this House some time ago, tells us that the Israel of today has the choice between Jewish radicalism and democracy, settlements or hope for both peoples, the deceptive visions of barbed wire, street blockades and suicide attacks or an international border between two states and Jerusalem as their shared capital."
"I believe that what Mr Burg is telling us calls us back to something present at the birth of Israel and of what could have become Palestine, and that is the decision of the United Nations."
"Some of those who spoke before me have made it clear that we have to get the United Nations more deeply involved, with a peacekeeping force to bring peace to this region."
"At present, that is not yet accepted, but I hope that the situation does not have to deteriorate still further and become even more extreme before we can accept the involvement of the United Nations and of peacekeeping troops."
"Let me add another observation on terrorism, this one from Avi Shlaim, writing in today's Herald Tribune: 'The real obstacle to peace is Sharon, not Arafat.'"
"I think that is perhaps putting it in rather too simple terms, and provocative ones at that."
"I share the view expressed by the Presidency, that neither Sharon nor Arafat are angels of peace, and that what is needed instead is other people who are capable of making peace."
"I am very grateful, too, to Mr Zimeray for very recently bringing to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy people from Israel and Palestine who want to make peace."
"I have two reasons for the profound conviction that leads me to abominate terrorism; not only does it kill innocent people along with the so-called enemy, but it also always bears within itself the seeds of self-destruction."
"It is not only Israel's retaliation attacks that I have in mind; I also believe that a society built upon terrorism possesses an inherent capacity for self-destruction."
"Whilst I understand why the Presidency is taking the initiative in having certain organisations blacklisted, the one thing I would like the Council and the Commission to tell us is what we are to do about this shameful wall that runs through Israel."
"On what list are we going to put that? The fact is that there is violence other than terrorism in the traditional sense."
"Perhaps we ought to maintain a list of actions that are detrimental to peace but do not constitute terrorism."
"This wall - God knows - should be on it."
"Mr President, on the subject of the role the European Union can play in the Middle East, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude for the role played for many years by its representative in the region, Miguel Angel Moratinos, who has worked with few resources, but whose work has been and must be deservedly valued."
"I hope that his successor will have more resources in order to take action there."
"I believe that the war in Iraq has contributed to worsening the situation in Palestine."
"A decision such as the war in Iraq, a unilateral one, has led to a worsening of the situation and an increase in acts of terror."
"I believe, therefore, that the European Union must strengthen acts of multilateralism such as the Quartet and the establishment of the road map."
"We must demand from the leaders, both Israeli and Palestinian, the political commitment to seek peace."
"Selective assassinations must come to an end and terrorist attacks must also come to an end; we must remember that not only terrorists are implicated in an attack, but also those who provide them with resources and those who perhaps turn a blind eye to the preparation of those attacks."
"Commissioner, a sine qua non for the end of international terrorism, and thereby a more peaceful world order, is the cessation of hostilities between the Israelis and Palestinians."
"The deadly cycle of attack and reprisal has to be broken."
"The two protagonists and their international supporters can argue interminably, and sometimes even convincingly, to justify their sides' violence."
"But this is a sterile debate and I do not propose to get into it."
"The two sides have to be kept apart, but the normal constraints of morality, self-discipline and the rule of law have been drowned in a seething reservoir of hatred and revenge."
"As things now stand, neither side will stand back for long enough to allow these intense emotions to abate."
"They fear and distrust each other too much."
"It is clear that an international force must be interposed between them, because there is literally no other way of keeping them apart."
"This force must command the confidence of the two sides."
"To achieve this it has to include United States and EU components."
"The American presence will reassure the Israelis, who rightly see the US as their unquestioning and loyal ally."
"The Palestinians see the EU as an honest and trustworthy broker."
"A realistic appeal can then be made to both sides for restraint while the force is being organised and deployed."
"Simultaneously, the peace process can be reactivated on the basis of the so-called roadmap, which has been accepted by the two sides."
"It can work, if it gets time."
"It will get time if there is no violence, and I believe the international force could break the cycle of violence."
"The EU can now vindicate its claim to a place on the world stage by brokering this strategy."
"There is nothing else in sight."
"It is exceedingly urgent."
"The prize is much more than peace in the Middle East: it is world peace, because continued violence in the Middle East is a poisonous backcloth to a lot of the terrorism which continues to happen in all parts of the world."
"Mr President, October 2000 to October 2003 represents 1 000 days of violence, 1 000 days of the innocent dying, 1 000 days of suffering by both communities, 1 000 days of the Intifada and 1 000 days of Europe's powerlessness."
"One day the history of this missed opportunity, this wasted time will be written about, and those who thought that violence was a justifiable political weapon will be judged very harshly."
"A few days ago, we experienced an exceptionally powerful moment in Parliament, a moment of genuine enlightenment, when we received the Palestinian, Mr Nusseibeh and the Israeli, Mr Yalon."
"They represent hope, because hope emanates from the communities themselves."
"Europe could be built because in 1946 a Franco-German commission decided to withdraw anti-German phrases from French schoolbooks and anti-French phrases from German schoolbooks."
"From that time on, we have not called the Germans 'Boches'; we have given them different names and looked at them through different eyes."
"This is the message that we must send to the region."
"There are people in both communities who think in terms of dialogue, reconciliation, the future and development."
"These are the people who warrant our support."
"Those who truly deserve to win the Nobel prize are the Palestinian intellectuals who take the risk, as Camus once did, of condemning terrorism as an absolute evil and a crime against humanity."
"I cannot allow it to be said, as it was a few minutes ago, that the actions of Hamas have anything in common with the French resistance movement."
"The real heroes are also the ordinary Israelis, the bus drivers that no human shield has ever thought about accompanying."
"Europe must think about the communities and about the future."
"We must stop acting as prosecutors, since we are not really qualified to sit in judgment."
"We must play the role of a realistic and courageous guide."
"Mr President, at the Conference of Presidents Mr Antonione correctly stated that the downward spiral of violence must be stopped."
"The way forward is for both sides to get together around a table."
"What could they bring that might break the deadlock?"
"Perhaps Palestine could re-examine the status of her intifada."
"It is an armed intifada."
"She should ask herself whether an intifada has to be armed to qualify as a genuine intifada."
"The answer to that is 'no'."
"Most intifadas are popular and peaceful intifadas."
"Perhaps she could withdraw from violence by making her intifada a peaceful one."
"What about Israel?"
"Israel has a responsibility to bring Palestine to independent statehood."
"Palestine cannot be an independent state if it is not financially viable."
"Israel could think hard and re-examine her approach towards helping Palestine to trade freely, without adding on costs and without using the wall to further depress agricultural or factory production."
"There is much to be done if both sides can get together."
"Looking at just those two simple items, success could still be within their grasp."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we have repeatedly given our very close attention to developments in the Middle East, and I think there is consensus that we all want to do our bit to ensure that the roadmap to peace can be adhered to."
"I see this, though, as giving rise to three specific demands."
"First of all, in the first phase of the roadmap, there is reference to the need to destroy the infrastructure of terror."
"What contribution are we making to that?"
"What contribution can we make to it?"
"This is where there is a need for further initiatives, especially together with the United Nations, if we are to make a positive contribution in this area too."
"Secondly, I am very grateful to the European Union for now having blacklisted the civilian wings of certain movements."
"I would ask, though, that we now do what the Palestinian Authority has already done, and block their accounts, so that there is no possibility of terrorism being funded through European bank accounts."
"In this, we should not merely make declarations, but take the appropriate action."
"Thirdly, there is something that has been for many years a major concern for me as a member of the Committee on Budgets, namely the issue of the form of the Palestinian Authority."
"It is a fact that we in the European Union have been spending a very great deal of money, and I would like to see it achieving something."
"We cannot be expected to invest in a system that does not correspond to what our Budget regulations require."
"Instead, we must ensure the creation of stable structures capable of giving a country like this peaceful civilian administration in the long term."
"Mr President, as we listen to and take part in this debate, we seem to feel, after 50 years and seven wars in the Middle East, that we are taking a risk, that is to say that each of us seems to have turned into a minor master of democracy and budgeting capable of applying yardsticks and prejudices that are ours and ours alone."
"We may not always have appreciated the role played by Yasser Arafat, just as we have hardly ever appreciated the role played by Sharon, but we should not forget that President Arafat was democratically elected as president of a people deprived of a homeland, of its own territory and a peaceful existence."
"If we forget that we are guilty of conceit, evasiveness and superficiality."
"If we condemn terrorism against Israel firmly and with absolute sincerity - and we condemn it with all our strength and with all due vehemence - then we should condemn with equal force and vehemence the character assassination by the media of the democratically elected president of a people."
"We call on the Presidency not just to denounce his exile as unacceptable. We should also be denouncing the indecent incitement to homicide by a minister in the Israeli Government and by an influential newspaper like the Jerusalem Post."
"What can Europe do?"
"Just blacklist Hamas?"
"I do not think that is enough."
"We need to be firm on three points: we should call for an end to the blockade on the Palestinian territories; we must call for an end to all settlement activities; and we must call for the demolition of the security wall, which amounts, in practice, to an annexation of territory and is a violation of international law."
"Europe must invest here, and one possibility might be to send in a ground force that would make a decisive, practical contribution to monitoring respect for reciprocal obligations."
"The only alternative to peace is peace, but to make this possible Europe must take practical action."
"Mr President, the tragedy of the Arab-Israeli conflict is never too far from our minds or TV screens, and the carefully constructed roadmap now seems to have virtually imploded."
"Serious mistakes have been made."
"Clearly the Palestinian Authority was unable or unwilling to rein in the excesses of Islamic and other terrorist groups, as we saw in the Hamas suicide bomb a month ago in Jerusalem."
"In this context, I welcome the EU's belated banning of the political wing of Hamas from fund-raising in its territory."
"I also believe that the undermining by Chairman Arafat of Prime Minister Abu Mazen has further muddied the waters, and lends credibility to those who argue that Arafat has no interest in going the last mile for peace and security if he is not at centre stage."
"However, coded calls for his assassination recently by Israel's Deputy Prime Minister are not helpful, as he was recognised as the elected PA Chairman, and this lowers the moral tone of the debate."
"Our challenge is to encourage reformists and moderate interlocutors amongst the Palestinians."
"I met a Professor Nusseibeh two weeks ago in Brussels and he is clearly an example of the type of Palestinian who is acting in good faith and is prepared to make compromises, including over the vexed issue of the right of return and the final status of Jerusalem."
"Both issues can be solved with imaginative thinking and money."
"The international community needs to redouble its efforts to reconvene the roadmap to enable a two-state solution with a viable, contiguous state of Palestine, based approximately on the 1967 borders, and a secure Israel living in peaceful, neighbourly coexistence."
"Otherwise, Islamic fundamentalists throughout the world will use this conflict to galvanise the Islamic world against the West, using it as a pretext to justify worldwide terrorist attacks."
"Unlike my colleague, Mr Cushnahan, I am not yet convinced that an international military force is the solution needed to end the hostilities and kick-start the peace process, as I do not think that a totally neutral force could ever be assembled."
"Incidentally, I have been involved in Parliament's working group looking at EU funding to the Palestinian Authority, which is proceeding on schedule."
"It has been a worthwhile exercise in addressing so many of our taxpayers' concerns about serious allegations of misappropriation of funds, and now we have in place the appropriate mechanisms for scrutiny of the way these monies are being spent."
"Mr President, violence in this conflict cannot offer a solution."
"A solution should be sought not by military means, but by way of politics and -diplomacy, but one of the key problems is that the leaders on both sides - and I mean on both sides - are in a weak position."
"Despite this, there still seems to be goodwill, as is evident, among other things, from the proposal to release a number prisoners from each side."
"The European Union should play a pioneering role, much more so than it has done to date."
"We are, after all, the region's key trading partner."
"I would therefore argue in favour of working for peace from this House, this Parliament, even though it appears that Parliament is becoming increasingly divided into two camps."
"It is not up to us in the European Parliament to fan the flames through all kinds of unilateral actions."
"On the contrary, we must use our joint goodwill and energy much more to help establish reconciliation and lasting peace."
"That is the Parliament's task."
"Mr President, I believe there have been many statements here condemning the recent comments of the Israeli Government and recent events."
"It is very easy to say to other people, to the Israelis and the Palestinians, what they must do, but perhaps we should consider what Europe is doing, what we are doing, because we can do something about that, because it is in our hands."
"In this regard, I did not like the comments of the Council, which has taken the bait, which has become embroiled in the current media war."
"Europe cannot depend on the media war, on statements and threats."
"We must work on what Europe is doing."
"In this regard, European policy has been rather ambiguous in recent months, because, if Europe played an important role in creating the figure of Abu Mazen, what has it done to support him?"
"I would like to put this question to the Council, and also, and above all, to the Commission."
"What have we done to ensure that the Palestinians do their duties, such as to support Abu Mazen so that he may have a single police force or to demand that Arafat concede some of his powers to a minister who he himself had supported?"
"What have we done in order to build a country able to accept its responsibilities as an independent and democratic state?"
"What have we done to exchange our very nice NGO programmes, peace declarations, human rights groups, doves in schools, for a system and health services which are not managed by the Church or by a terrorist system like Hamas, which is paying doctors and teachers?"
"There are more than 1 200 000 children lacking a proper education system."
"The question we should be asking is: what has Europe done to strengthen the system of security and justice?"
"We condemn the wall, because it runs counter to any democratic system and is a physical and moral aggression, but we must also build the country and support the victims of terrorism."
"Europe must open a line of support for these victims."
"It must take a position and combat the prevailing ambiguity."
"Let us have a clear and effective policy in Europe, and not a policy of making statements."
"I view the increasingly aggressive stance of the Israeli Government towards the Palestinian people with the deepest concern."
"The recent series of threats by the Israeli Government to expel Yasser Arafat, which culminated in the Deputy Prime Minister's suggestion that he be assassinated, is totally unacceptable and despicable."
"The United Nations General Assembly has criticised the Israeli Government in this connection."
"The United States veto of a UN Security Council resolution to this effect (a vote from which, moreover, Germany and the United Kingdom abstained) is deplorable."
"The EU cannot simply, in the words of the statement by the Presidency of the European Union, express 'its deep preoccupation', ask 'the Israeli Government to refrain from any use of force and, in particular, from the expulsion of President Arafat', or consider the Israeli Government and the Palestinian people as equals. To do so is to ape the stance of the United States."
"It is essential to put significant pressure on the Israeli authorities with a view to ending the military occupation, the killings, the annexing of Palestinian territory, the building of the wall to control the movements of Palestinians, and, in general, the campaign of pure state terrorism being conducted against the Palestinian people."
"There is an urgent need to show solidarity with the Palestinian people."
"Peace will come only when the Palestinian people's inalienable and widely-acknowledged right to their own independent, sovereign state becomes reality."
"The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the outcome of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in Cancún from 10 to 14 September 2003."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this House, the Union body which is fully representative of the citizens, I feel it is right to start with the document which you, yourselves, adopted on 3 July 2003 - this year, that is - in preparation for the Cancún Ministerial Conference, in which, inter alia, you rightly underline that the successful outcome of the Doha Development Round negotiations remains an important factor in bolstering economic growth worldwide and strengthening multilateralism and global governance."
"For its part, the European Council took these considerations on board, reaffirming in the conclusions of the GAER Council of 21 July 2003 the European Union's fundamental commitment to a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda by the end of 2004, the DDA being a single undertaking aimed at achieving an ambitious, comprehensive and balanced package of agreements."
"On these bases, the European Union went to Cancún, but - as you know - our desires, our hopes and our undertakings were shattered at the Summit in the hot, torrid climate which was caused by more than just the weather."
"Yet we all thought that we had done everything possible over those months, that our preparations would ensure that the negotiations could genuinely take off and that the timeframes laid down at Doha would be respected."
"It is therefore necessary, in this cooling-off phase, to ask ourselves a number of questions about the Summit and the preparations we made for it."
"Where did we go wrong?"
"In particular, we need to ask ourselves this question because Europe, perhaps more than anyone else - and this is to our credit, not a criticism - believes in multilateralism, for that is the principle underpinning our Union of sovereign States."
"The work of the European Parliament, your work, is the highest expression of that principle."
"Before I raise some questions, I feel it is only right and proper to confirm before the European Union body which is fully representative of the citizens that Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Fischler - who are to speak after me - have always fully adhered with wisdom and flexibility to the mandate given to them by the European Council, which is, moreover, mirrored to a large extent in the demands contained in your resolution."
"Furthermore, as President-in-Office, I can assure the House that, at all times during the Summit, at every meeting held and in every measure - including bilateral measures - taken or supported by the individual Members of the Union, there was always full coherence and consistency."
"Europe really did work as a team!"
"In Cancún phraseology, Europe was a genuine G-25, thanks, not least, to the substantial contribution of the accession countries."
"At this point, we must attempt to respond, although it will not be easy, to the three questions which appear to be most urgent, and to discuss together with you three short- to medium-term scenarios."
"Firstly, why was the fifth Ministerial Conference a failure?"
"Secondly, who is to blame for that? Thirdly, did Europe do everything it could?"
"Why did the fifth Ministerial Conference fail?"
"First of all, we have to realise that the ambiguities in the agenda for the negotiations and the issues which had not been resolved at Doha served to tighten the noose at Cancún, particularly where the two main subjects - agriculture and the Singapore issues - were concerned."
"In both cases, the ambiguities were left over from Doha."
"As regards the agriculture text, ambiguity was introduced in too many places during the fourth Ministerial Conference, during the very last minutes, the very last exchanges."
"Moreover, a similar thing happened with the postponement of the decisions on the Singapore issues, which were the subject of a heated debate at Doha and were in danger of bringing the talks to a standstill then."
"At the fourth world Conference, these ambiguities were resolved thanks to the decision of the Qatar presidency to extend the negotiations for a further 36 hours in order to discuss precisely these matters."
"As you know, the solution adopted then allowed the matter to be inserted more or less effectively in the single undertaking but without any specific negotiating commitment."
"This means, apertis verbis, that the success of Doha is probably due to the level of international need."
"It was the exceptional nature of Doha, the fact that it took place so soon after the tragic events of 11 September, which caused the Fourth Ministerial Conference to be a success."
"It may be, however, that, in actual fact, the WTO crisis which started in Seattle was only temporarily alleviated in Doha and that it re-emerged in Cancún, not by chance in relation to those same Doha issues. These are two questions which are relatively similar."
"On the one hand - with regard to agriculture - Europe and the countries of the northern hemisphere created a cultural exception, which was completely legitimate but which is, still today, in conflict with the hopes of the major developing countries, who are actually accusing us of protectionism and of distorting the market. On the other, there are the Singapore issues, the other issues relating to the governance of globalisation, which are a priority for Europe and the major investor countries but which the developing countries feel are an invasion of their rights, which has led them - or some of them, at least - to create a kind of cultural exception too, at least for the time being."
"The second question is: who is to blame?"
"The negotiating parties must certainly take some of the responsibility. They did not take recognition of the other as a basic premise."
"Quite the opposite: they often sought, more than anything, to divide the opposing side."
"After the August agreement between the European Union and the United States on the agricultural dossier and NAMA, there was a strong reaction from about 20 countries, led by India, Brazil, China and South Africa and including developing countries from the Cairns Group, which continued consistently throughout the Summit."
"However, precisely this initial impetus - a negative rather than a positive impetus, given the dissimilarity between the countries involved - resulted in a polarisation of positions which soured the negotiations."
"For the same motives, some African countries sought - they may have had no other choice - to take up a new, offensive position, promoting initiatives on themes such as cotton, for example, and further widening the gap between the positions on the traditional chapters."
"Basically, the WTO has a clear structural problem: the lack of a structure organising the negotiators, leading to the absurd situation where we have a presidency which first extends negotiations, at Doha - those who were present at Doha will remember - for over 36 hours and then, however, cuts the Summit short in Cancún; then the mini-ministerial meetings, a useful pre-negotiation exercise, which, however, failed to resolve the issues; lastly, the greatest flaw - a WTO which now has 148 members and, yet, is without efficient decision-making structures."
"Immediately after the summit, Commissioner Lamy talked of mediaeval organisation."
"European history teaches us that, in order to reach the Rinascimento, the era of the flowering of civilisation, a common effort of creativity and political vision is needed."
"Therefore, we must ask ourselves now, in this House, whether Europe did everything possible."
"For our part, I would say that we Europeans were well-prepared - or, at least, we thought we were - in particular with the reform of the common agricultural policy, while the United States was moving in the opposite direction with its Farm Bill, but it may be that we did not succeed in getting the message across properly."
"I feel that we did a good job, not least as regards the most vulnerable, with the Development Agenda itself, with Everything but Arms, with technical assistance measures and capacity building, with the ground-breaking decision on lifesaving medicines, with regard to which we showed ourselves to be willing a long time before the United States."
"However, maybe we failed to exploit the full potential of our position, which was, moreover, decisive on many issues."
"Moreover, we tried to stop the gap widening between the European Union and the United States with the August agreement, but we must ask ourselves whether what we thought was a solution has not actually proved to be a mistake."
"Was it possible, after a year and a half of trade wars which have widened the gap between the two shores of the Atlantic and divided the principal Doha negotiators, to remedy the situation with two framework-agreements, however important?"
"Could we have done more?"
"I am referring, in particular, to the cotton initiative, which, as an MEP pointed out at Cancún during the Council's meeting with the interparliamentary delegation present, gradually, over the course of the Summit, assumed ethical and political significance, a symbolic value equal to that acquired by lifesaving medicines at Doha."
"If we had been quicker off the mark in involving the United States too, in showing greater willingness to resolve the issue, we might have achieved a more successful result."
"We must go back to that point and start again."
"This thread must be taken up again in accordance with WTO rules and without this constituting a precedent for other negotiating chapters."
"At this juncture, these three questions open up three debates."
"Firstly, can we resume the Development Agenda at this point?"
"Of course, it is not yet wholly compromised, but its path has become more difficult, full of obstacles and, thus, of necessity, longer."
"If we do not make up in the coming weeks in Geneva what we lost at Cancún, the process will go on way beyond the deadline of 1 January 2005."
"On 15 December in Geneva, there is a kind of mid-term review, probably at senior-official level, which will tell us more."
"Moreover, at the end of next year, the principal negotiators might change, not least because of both the US presidential elections and the end of the present European Commission's term of office."
"There will be other negotiators, other issues, other timeframes."
"Until then, we will need to hold a dialogue, aware of its value, with the new leaders which emerged at Cancún; to recognise these leaders in order to succeed in forging a close, effective negotiating relationship; to pursue the reform of the common agricultural policy and communicate it better; to persuade other industrialised countries to undertake initiatives along the lines of Everything but Arms; to verify that the agreement on lifesaving medicines is being properly enforced, that the agreement is having the desired effect, that it is meeting the needs of the weakest of the weak; to extend technical assistance and capacity building to prevent third negotiating parties starting to lose faith in the transparency and objectives of the European Union because of the inconsistent and fragmented nature of the message, maybe."
"We wish not to impose but to persuade. We believe not in deceit but in clear agreements."
"The second debate is the WTO reforms."
"Can we reform the structure and the themes of the agenda at the same time?"
"How and where?"
"Is that, perhaps, linked to the crisis of the other international organisations, starting with the Bretton Woods organisations, which are not doing their job, and the organisations dealing with other themes - such as employment, the environment, agriculture itself - which are overloading the WTO agenda?"
"The WTO may be in a crisis similar to that of Aesop's frog, because it is in danger of swelling up, both because of the number of Members - 148, as I said - and because of its growing agenda, in the face, moreover, of the inertia of other international organisations on themes which are their particular interest and responsibility."
"I wonder, and I put it to you, whether it might not be appropriate to resume the initiative pursued by the Commission in 2001, creating a special group to work on the reform and transparency of the World Trade Organisation, to explore the possible institutional solutions for the organisation in depth."
"Lastly, the third debate is whether we need to adjust our trade policy in any way."
"It is no coincidence that President Bush's personal representative, Robert Zoellick, announced within minutes of the failure of Cancún that the United States was going to forge ahead with the creation of the FTAA - the Free Trade Area of the Americas - and, in any case, with bilateral agreements."
"These great continents are linked by very strong bilateral agreements."
"Without undermining the principle of multilateralism, Europe must take the initiative and step up its action, starting precisely with the implementation of the EU-Mercosur agreement, on which a great deal of negotiation work has been done, for which I pay tribute to the Commissioners, and which now needs to be brought to a swift, successful conclusion."
"The Barcelona agreement on Euromed also certainly needs to be fully implemented."
"These are bilateral agreements which do not undermine multilateral agreements, which must remain our main priority, but strengthen and pave the way for them."
"Brazil - although only with regard to the agricultural dossier, for the moment - has, together with others, capably taken on leadership of the countries of the southern hemisphere, with the creation of the G-21."
"It is an authoritative, democratic leadership, European in nature."
"We must place our trust in it and strengthen the historic, economic and commercial ties with Latin America as a whole; let us endeavour to include this objective in next year's agenda too."
"I would like, if I may, after this discouraging analysis of negotiating issues, to end by sharing with you something which distinguishes us as Europeans."
"Upon hearing the news of the failure of the Summit in Cancún, a journalist from a prestigious Italian newspaper asked me a spontaneous, maybe too frank question."
"He asked me at the press conference whether we might have made a mistake in resolving the issue of lifesaving medicines before Cancún, suggesting that if they had remained on the negotiating table during the Summit we might have had more influence, more negotiating power."
"I immediately replied, interpreting, I believe, the values of our Europe: 'If we are the European Union, the pioneers in the recognition of civil rights and the dignity of the human person, it is because we believe that the highest value, life, takes precedence over negotiating considerations.'"
"If Cancún served any purpose, indeed, it is precisely that it may have forced many countries to remove barriers to agreement in the run-up to the Ministerial Conference."
"Of that, at least, we can be proud."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lamy and I agree entirely in judging Cancún, to our regret, to have been a disappointment, a failure that leaves us all damaged and is of course also a setback for the whole Doha development agenda."
"It would be wrong to take the view that this failure is ultimately attributable to the industrialised countries' agricultural policies."
"The negotiating parties did not even get round to addressing that topic in a concluding round of negotiations."
"In the months leading up to it, the success of the negotiating round at Cancún was alleged to be largely the EU's responsibility."
"At first we were told that we had to reform our common agricultural policy if the negotiations were to stand a chance of success."
"That is what we did, and the world even applauded us for doing so."
"We were then told that the conversations would collapse if we did not settle our differences with the Americans."
"In August, therefore, we drew up, with the USA, a compromise document giving the negotiations a solid structure that promised them success."
"The bottom line is that the failure of the discussions makes losers of us all, and, in the final analysis, it is probably the developing countries that are the overall losers in the agricultural negotiations."
"This is particularly true of the G21 countries, which were most opposed to the approach proposed by Mr Pérez del Castillo."
"The package on offer at Cancún would have enabled the developing countries to better integrate their economies into the world trading system, and, accordingly, to benefit from its advantages."
"Why do I say that?"
"Because the package on offer at Cancún would have resulted in a rational reform of the system of agricultural trade; it would, in particular, have led to drastic cuts in the subsidies that distort competition, especially in the industrialised countries - which was one of the developing countries' main objectives in the agricultural negotiations - and, among other things, the USA would have had to reform its agricultural policy."
"What, exactly, was on offer?"
"In the area of domestic support the measures that most distort competition, the so-called 'Amber Box' and the 'de minimis' payments, have been drastically cut back."
"The Blue Box would have had a lid put on it, while there was, at the same time, provision for special preferential treatment for developing countries, to which input subsidies would have continued to be permitted."
"In the field of export competition, drastic cuts and disciplinary measures were proposed for export subsidies, state-funded export credits and the exploitation of surpluses disguised as food aid."
"There was, for the very first time, the prospect of the complete abolition of all forms of export promotion for a whole list of products of particular interest to the developing countries."
"That is not all by a long way."
"Success in Cancún would have led to further substantial liberalisation of trade."
"Quite apart from its proposals on market access, which were in the interests of all concerned, the European Union, with the development aspects of the Doha agenda in mind, had made a number of far-reaching and specific proposals relating to these states."
"When the EU delegation arrived in Cancún, it demonstrated its support for the developing countries and its endorsement of the development agenda."
"I would sum this up by saying that our concessions to the developing countries played a part in making the European Union, today, far and away the most important importer of agricultural produce from developing countries."
"Last year, we imported from developing countries agricultural produce to the value of EUR 35 billion, which amounts to more than the imports of the most important industrialised states taken together."
"We had adopted the 'Everything but Arms' agreement, which unilaterally opens the EU market to the forty-nine poorest countries in the world, without demanding political or economic concessions in return."
"We proposed that this concession should be extended to our partners among the industrialised countries and the more advanced countries in the developing world."
"We proposed that the industrialised countries should guarantee that at least 50% of the total agricultural imports from the developing countries should not be subject to import duties."
"Other things on offer included discussion of the escalation in customs duties, and the developing countries would have gained a special protection clause and separate arrangements for their specialised products."
"Finally, the document drawn up by the facilitators left other issues, such as concerns not relating to trade, open to further negotiations, and proposed that the 'peace clause' be extended."
"As far as the future is concerned, I take the view that we have to continue on our ambitious path, but that we must also take great care in evaluating, analysing and planning every step that we take along it."
"Over the coming months, we must continue to put our weight behind constructive dialogue; whilst we must play a central role, success, at the end of the day, is dependent on all members of the WTO and also our willingness to move towards a position in the centre."
"This will, without doubt, demand from all of us - both the industrialised and the developing countries - not only political will but also the willingness to compromise."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy has asked us whether, after the failure of Cancún, we intend to go for a multilateral or bilateral approach."
"If you go by what the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the European Parliament's resolution say, we will be operating primarily multilaterally, for in a global village, it is a choice between corrective global rules to make world trading fair, or regulations à la carte, where the law of the jungle rules."
"The law of the jungle leaves no room for social and environmentally-friendly agriculture. It leaves no room for development of Africa, which only has 2% of world trade to its name."
"It does not provide any protection against unfair competition via state aid in South Korea or against products made involving slavery or child labour which enter Europe via China, for example."
"Although globalisation offers opportunities, it also makes our citizens anxious - and with good reason - about the future of their jobs."
"This is why global rules for protection are necessary."
"Not everything can, or should, be done through the WTO."
"A great deal can be achieved through other multilateral organisations, such as the UNDP and the ILO, but also through human rights protection and the right of organisation for independent trade unions."
"The WTO, however, should first be reorganised towards this end."
"It has to function more intelligently, faster and more democratically."
"On a practical level, it has to join forces more with the UNDP and the ILO."
"Politically, we witnessed in Cancún the birth of a new world order in response to Iraq and George Bush's unilateral power politics."
"Political debate and cooperation with the G-21 and the new Alliance is of major geopolitical importance to Europe."
"This requires new initiatives from the Commission and the Council."
"We cannot afford to wait and see, for the US is on a unilateral mission."
"Europe must seek alliances with the developing countries based on its social values."
"Together, we can take initiatives to reorganise the WTO and put them on the table."
"At the same time, we must pursue our own agricultural reforms convincingly, and continue to put the US under pressure to do the same."
"In short, I am arguing in favour of consciously investing, politically speaking, in short-term alliances with developing countries in the short term and avoiding situations where the US and Europe get caught up in the same trouser leg, for then we will stumble, as we did in Cancún."
"Confidence-building measures are required if a new global coalition of fair traders is to be brought about."
"Export subsidies in Europe for products that seriously affect the developing countries must be abolished."
"This does not only apply to cotton and sugar, but also to cereal and meat."
"This should, however, be directly linked to aid for multifunctional agriculture."
"Furthermore, reinforced financial support for the transfer of knowledge and the development of production capacity in the developing countries is needed, as well as priorities in political contacts and the debate with the new alliance."
"We must bring the debate with the developing countries on social dumping, child labour and slavery back on the negotiating table."
"They are more open to this now that they are being increasingly threatened by China."
"In short, we need new initiatives to get the development round back on track via new avenues."
"As for the Singapore issues, Mr President I should like to ask you to find out whether, in addition to the intense technical preparation for Cancún, which was perfect, a new initiative should not be taken to take the pressure of the negotiations away from the topics, and thus to create a freer forum for a political debate with the developing countries about pros and cons."
"After all, they also know that transparency and rules for them are necessary, because they will otherwise be faced with the arm-twisting of the large trading blocs, such as the US and China."
"Despite all the disappointment surrounding the failure of Cancún and the appeal I am making here to invest politically in this new global coalition of fair traders, we should also emphatically mention, as a significant result of the Doha round, the agreement on cheap medicine for Aids, tuberculosis and malaria patients in Africa, Asia and Latin America, as well as Europe's commitment to it."
"Thank you, Commissioner Lamy, for your open and direct cooperation with us."
"With your own responsibilities, over which we have clashed once or twice, for example concerning the Singapore issues, you have behaved as a true democrat, as has your fellow-Commissioner, Mr Fischler."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the general disappointment at the failure of the WTO negotiations in Cancún is evident, and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party too is of the opinion that this negative outcome is a missed opportunity."
"Nevertheless, on behalf of the Liberals, I share your view that despite this failure, we need to make a new start in the area of multilateral negotiations in order to bring about trade liberalisation."
"Stubborn bilateralism is not the way forward."
"In addition, I endorse your ideas about reorganisation of the WTO."
"Clearly, the secretariat's organisation, structure and mandate in Geneva are not equipped for preparing and running negotiations effectively."
"The question then arises as to why the negotiations in Cancún failed."
"Several times in this House, the Singapore issues have been blamed for this."
"Apparently, the EU was even inflexible in the negotiations and this is why everything went wrong."
"This appears to me to be a serious misconception, and, on behalf of my group, I concur with what was said by Mr van Velzen, who also spoke highly of the work of our Commissioners."
"As a member of the delegation, I took umbrage at the fact that the entire week was dominated by agriculture and that knowledge about our agricultural policy is very minimal in various countries outside of Europe."
"Only at the eleventh hour did the negotiations about the Singapore issues and trade in services open, and the conference collapsed no less than half a day later."
"It is, moreover, regrettable that the developing countries were not prepared to negotiate on this, for it is precisely they that stand to benefit from a favourable investment climate, reduction in import levies and transparent legislation."
"In this respect, they would gain from trade facilitation."
"Indeed, 80% of all import levies are paid by the developing countries combined."
"One ray of hope that I saw in Cancún was the success of the Parliamentary Conference, which is of crucial importance in lending the WTO democratic legitimacy."
"We managed to make a final declaration calling for the installation of a parliamentary pillar in the WTO."
"This seems important to me, for we cannot leave democracy to the NGOs."
"They, at least some of them, once again demonstrated their dubious role in Cancún by cheering on the sidelines when the negotiations had failed."
"And this while the developing countries lost out!"
"I would ask Commissioners Lamy and Fischler what their first step will be to breathe new life into the multilateral negotiations."
"Mr President, instead of looking backwards I would like to look forwards."
"Commissioner Lamy, in our meeting this morning, I asked you what the status of your Seattle mandate was."
"You replied that, as yet, you were not sure."
"I would like to make the case as strongly as possible that the mandate given to you in 1999, even before the Seattle Ministerial - let alone the Doha and Cancún Ministerials - must now be null and void."
"We cannot pretend, now that two out of three ministerials have collapsed, that we are dealing with business as usual."
"In particular it seems that the EU must now accept the verdict of developing countries that they do not want negotiations on the Singapore issues."
"Therefore we must drop not just two, but all four of those issues."
"At the same time we need to go further in eliminating export subsidies and much further in responding to ACP and LDC concerns in particular."
"The statement by Botswana on behalf of those groups said very clearly that the revised texts fell far short of their expectations."
"We can debate the causes of the collapse at Cancún."
"I suspect my own analysis will be rather different from many we have heard so far this afternoon, but what is clear is that collapse offers us an opportunity to start a root-and-branch transformation of the WTO."
"What we need now is a full review, not just of the working procedures of the WTO, which you have rightly called medieval, but of its trade rules themselves, which I would call imperialist."
"In many ways the rules of the WTO are not neutral ones that can be used defensively to protect the interests of the weakest players."
"The rules are too often institutionalising the current system of global inequality."
"Take the overriding principle, for example, of national treatment that effectively denies poorer countries the right to promote their own national industries and economies, a right that was indispensable to most richer countries and which they used with impunity in their own development processes."
"It is clear that we need fair, multilaterally agreed rules to oversee and regulate trade in the interests of poverty eradication."
"But whether the current WTO can actually deliver those outcomes is frankly much harder to believe."
"If we are to rebuild confidence in the multilateral system, we have to expend much more political capital in making its rules and procedures genuinely fair and sustainable."
"Can you tell me if you are prepared to do that?"
"Mr President, I share the views of the majority of the speakers here this afternoon that the collapse of the talks was a major blow, both to the WTO itself and to the global economy."
"Without increased trade activity, global growth will slow down and global poverty will rise."
"Clearly the current EU and indeed US markets could do with an output boost, but it is the developing countries which would really have benefited from a successful Cancún."
"I believe that the WTO in its current structure and working practices is dead."
"We need to breathe new life into the round."
"That is for sure, but first we must put in place a more workable organisation that can deal with 148 members, many of whom do not have the technical expertise and resources to operate at full potential."
"In this I am convinced that the EU must take the initiative."
"It is clear from statements of the US trade representative, Bob Zoellick, that America intends to forge ahead on a bilateral path."
"I urge the Commission to put in place immediately a cross-services task force so as to come up with concrete proposals for reforming the WTO."
"I know that colleagues in Parliament are more than willing to contribute to such an exercise."
"Each of the European institutions must take on its responsibility to get the message across to our WTO partners regarding the EU offer which remains on the table."
"We in the EU put a lot on the table in the interests of developing countries in the area of agriculture, market access and so on. It is particularly important to carry out this diplomatic and information activity with the so-called Group of 90, comprising the ACP, the African Union and LDCs."
"In conclusion, it is imperative that the Doha development round gets back on track if there is to be any hope of lifting millions in the developing world out of poverty."
"This can only happen if we seriously adjust the structures and procedures of the WTO."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Urso, Commissioners, Cancún was essentially a game of trade agreements."
"If the WTO survives, this must remain the main focus of negotiations."
"Essentially, however, a political game has been played, with the creation of an absurd situation - mentioned a number of times by Commissioner Lamy in the meetings with the European Parliament delegation - in that, at the beginning, the debate focused almost solely on agriculture, which accounts for only 20% of international trade."
"This is, indeed, an absurd situation, for which we bear a large share of the responsibility."
"Cancún was the scene of a propaganda game, and there is certainly no need to explain to the heirs of the Princes Metternich and Talleyrand the significance of propaganda in international politics."
"We Europeans have given our 'opponents', if ever they have deserved that name, a wonderful opportunity for dispute and propaganda on a silver plate, where international public opinion is concerned."
"It has been said that there were red lines in the field of agriculture, the abolition of - quite despicable - export subsidies across the board and a maximum ceiling for Green Box subsidies, subsidies which, in theory, should not distort the market."
"It has been said that, rather than cross the red line, it was better for the negotiations to fail, and that is what happened."
"The fact that an industrial power like the European Union is imposing these limits, these 'red lines', is one of the reasons why we are now lamenting a failure which affects the European Union much more than it affects the United States, for instance."
"There is no time to explain why, in my view this is the case."
"The very fact that the Commissioner for agriculture - and I am not trying to sleight Mr Fischler in any way - is here today, on a par with Commissioner Lamy, explaining what happened at Cancún, is a sign that something is wrong, of the absurd situation of Europe as regards agricultural policy."
"That is not, of course, to say that European agricultural protectionism is not ultimately so very different from that of the United States."
"Quite the opposite: it may be that, with the reform of European agricultural policy, we have succeeded in overtaking the United States; the Japanese are causing more harm than we are with rice."
"We, however, are thinking of the interests of Europe."
"The Members know that all the parliamentary delegations we were able to meet insisted on focusing on the agricultural issue."
"They had their own reasons for doing so - to cover up the tariffs of nearly 90% on Indian fabric."
"It may well be true, but how do we explain to these people that we want new investment rules?"
"We ask developing countries to impose competition rules and public procurement rules, and then we continue to subsidise meat, rice and other exports."
"Then we could discuss Everything but Arms at length, Madam President."
"We have postponed the definitive abolition of tariffs on rice, banana and sugar imports until 2010."
"Is this all we can manage to offer the developing countries?"
"What is more, causing loss of interests ?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, the failure of the mid-term review of the Doha round at Cancún was a defeat with regard to accelerating world economic growth."
"It was also an undeserved defeat for us in the EU; but above all it was a defeat for the developing countries."
"The atmosphere when the meeting started was cautiously optimistic."
"The European Union and the United States of America had reached consensus on a joint bid to lower agricultural trade barriers and subsidies, and an agreement on the introduction of generic drugs to improve medical care in the developing countries had been made."
"What, then, went wrong?"
"If we ignore the chairman's in my opinion hasty decision at the moment when everyone had prepared for at least 35 hours more of intensive negotiations, there are surely many reasons why it went wrong."
"New as far as the Doha meeting was concerned was the appearance of the Group of 21 nations."
"This group, as has already been said here, probably did not have only trade goals, but also aims relating to power politics, as, for example, its opposition to real or imagined US unilateralism."
"Whilst these countries talked as if they were representing all underdeveloped countries, they themselves were not prepared to abandon the high trade barriers they had in respect of poorer countries."
"Part of the problem over cotton is connected with this."
"It is time we understood, on a more universal scale than just Europe, that the development of the less developed countries is starting to differentiate very greatly."
"Moreover, it is worth asking what a developing country actually is."
"Is India, taken as a whole, still one, or even China or Brazil?"
"Other developed countries should also follow the EU's example and conclude 'Everything But Arms' agreements, as we have done with 49 of the poorest countries."
"We should also remember that the EU, in addition to being by far the biggest donor of development aid, buys, for example, 80% of Africa's agricultural exports."
"In terms of its form, the meeting failed in its debate on the four Singapore issues."
"Why, when each individual country can opt to be absent with regard to these?"
"Why, when it had been agreed at Doha that they would also be on the agenda?"
"It was mainly a matter of the timetable."
"To what extent opposition to the liberalisation of the cotton trade was responsible for the meeting's failure remains a mystery, but it certainly played a part."
"A large number of NGOs, as has been mentioned here, were happy the meeting failed."
"Let us hope that the underdeveloped countries will never again get caught by them as they were at Cancún."
"We have to move forward."
"The EU and the Commissioners negotiating on its behalf have nothing to hide or be ashamed of."
"The Commission did a good deal beforehand to ensure the success of the meeting, and furthermore used the room for negotiation it had during the meeting."
"The EU's task must be on the one hand to endorse the WTO and speed up negotiations and on the other, and as a result, to further clarify to the underdeveloped countries the EU's position regarding trade policy, as they still do not seem to know what it is."
"Madam President, Mrs Lucas was right when she said that this is not the time to look to the past, but rather we must look to the future under all circumstances."
"It is true that, following the failure of Cancún, this is the right time to consider the dangers facing us now."
"The first, and I am saying nothing new, is to dedicate ourselves to saving multilateralism within commercial relations."
"We must be careful when we say that we must reform the World Trade Organisation."
"We must say how we want to reform it, because we must not think of reforming the World Trade Organisation in such a way that it begins to function like its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which, at the end of the day, made decisions in accordance with the wishes of certain commercial giants, without taking account of the importance of other countries."
"Also, when we say that 'we are going to reform the World Trade Organisation', are we as Europeans going to accept a reform in which the European Union has no right to veto, or is the United States going to accept that type of reform?"
"The World Trade Organisation therefore functions with all the problems we know about, but, at the end of the day, it is the best instrument we have for international trade."
"Secondly, I would like to stress the importance of the birth of the Group of 21, which we wrongly believed was going to be dissolved like a sugar lump in water."
"I do not believe that we should attack that Group of 21, but rather sit down with them, accepting what they are, a giant like us, which represents more than half the world's population and their specific weight must clearly not be underestimated."
"Finally, we must act in a balanced and coherent fashion."
"Commissioner Lamy is right when he tells us that it is one thing to make declarations and quite another to take decisions which affect thousands of millions of citizens."
"It is true that we must reconcile solidarity with some of our least-favoured sectors, such as the rural population or certain types of production, with solidarity with the least favoured countries."
"We cannot say that we are going to adopt one line while forgetting the other, because, until we are capable of finding that balance, it will be difficult for us to continue making progress."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Cancún showed, firstly, that it is quite simply unrealistic to demand that markets be opened up without taking into account the existence of serious social differences."
"The WTO member states start from such widely divergent positions that having the same conditions for all does not promote justice but reinforces injustice, and thus takes us away from the declared objective of fair trade rather than bringing us closer to it."
"Secondly, there are of course especially great differences between the industrialised and developing countries, but these blocs are far from homogeneous, any more than the European Union is a homogeneous edifice."
"Knowing as we do how difficult it is to get results out of the European Union, we ought to sympathise with the incomparably greater difficulties faced by a community of 148 states."
"Thirdly, when negotiating, we must always put ourselves in the position of the party with whom we are negotiating; that is to say, we must be prepared to make concessions to our weaker opposite numbers without expecting anything in return."
"If, though, we conduct negotiations as if in a bazaar - 'you give me one thing, and I give you another', we should not be surprised when they fail."
"Fourthly, we have to grasp the fact that the EU is only one of many regions in the world, and, in future, our decisions must take into account, to a much more marked degree, the effects they will have globally."
"To put it in other words, we need the impact of our policies to be assessed in a preventive way."
"The fifth thing that we learn from Cancún is that negotiations have to be conducted with more candour and transparency, enabling civil society as a whole to be involved in the whole process at the right time."
"Is it not paradoxical that the WTO puts up fences to keep its critics out, while its alleged mission is to tear down trade barriers for the good of the world's population?"
"I too was in Cancún, and I think it quite utterly unacceptable that the representatives of governments, instead of seeking dialogue with the demonstrators, barred them from the venue where the negotiations were being held."
"My sixth point is that the WTO needs a different organisational and decision-making structure, and should be restructured in such a way that multilateral agreements can be hammered out in a fairer and more transparent manner."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, obviously one might well regret an error of analysis in the power relationships at Cancún."
"You spoke of two elephants; perhaps the third one escaped you."
"Fifty years after Bandung, we have Cancún and the return of the non-aligned, even if they have multiplied."
"More to the point, a mistake was made on 13 August 2003, with the EU-US agreement, which blurred the pro-development image which you wanted to create, especially with the 'Everything but arms' programme, and you gave the impression, to use your words, of a 'duopoly'."
"It is certain that this preliminary agreement with the United States, which came in the wake of the 1992 Blair House agreement, put you and us in the same boat as the Texas cotton planters and their USD 3.5 billion subsidies, which are creating financial hardship for the 10 million small African planters."
"Europe is certainly not responsible for this failure, however, if stopping the drift of ultraliberalism can indeed be called a failure."
"During the election campaign, the American administration did not want an agreement any more than, in Seattle, the African countries could not accept the contempt of paragraph 27 of the final declaration, telling them to grow something other than cotton."
"You, on the other hand, you have made every sacrifice, you have sacrificed our farmers in advance, you have sacrificed two out of the four Singapore issues, you were even prepared to give them the shirt off our back, provided that the textile agreement was brought to a close, but they did not want our shirt in Cancún."
"What is to be done, then?"
"Obviously we wait for the investiture of the new American president in January 2005."
"What is to be done about the common agricultural policy (CAP)?"
"Good sense, justice, would want us to withdraw the rules on the CAP since it was the price to be paid for the Cancún goods which were not delivered."
"What is to be done about cotton?"
"Do we sacrifice our 3% share of the world market or make the Africans a gift of what they wanted: a trust fund of USD 250 million per year organised by an international institution?"
"What is to be done at the World Trade Organisation (WTO)?"
"You say we have to change medieval procedures."
"You could say that of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), you could say that of the UN, you could say that, moreover, of the European Commission itself."
"Which means that the institutional question is much broader."
"How in future can we legally reconcile, on the one hand, inescapable globalisation at economic, media and technological levels with, on the other hand, the equally inescapable and eternal perpetuity of the political nations which, for their part, have the decision-making powers?"
"Obviously, no one has the answer as to how to modify the WTO."
"At all events, however, it needs to be sought in teleology, not theology, because there can be no doubt that the theology of the 'free-tradist' sect, the madrasas of Washington or Geneva which train the market fanatics, the Taliban of ultraliberalism, constitute between them an ideological error of global proportions. This is because the right aims, which will bring about the right solutions, are not ultraliberalism, privatisation or the market, but social justice, political justice and national justice."
"This being so, Commissioner, we wish you good luck in your new office after June 2004, and I admit that I await with a little thrill of greedy curiosity to see where your golden parachute lands."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in a similar position to Mr Daul, in that I too do not wish to repeat everything that has already been discussed, but I would like to say something about one comment made by the Italian Presidency. I think you were right to raise the issue of whether we are not really still in the 'post-Seattle process'."
"You put it so neatly: from Seattle, via Doha, to Cancún."
"I think there is a lot in that."
"We had a situation in Seattle in which civil society tried, as part of anti-globalisation campaigns, to ask questions that we as a political institution have perhaps not always taken seriously enough or adequately addressed."
"That process has continued, and it has led to a general feeling of insecurity, insecurity not just limited to civil society but that has also reached far into the political institutions and also into many societies and states."
"We felt the same thing once again in Cancún in relation to the African states involved, and that feeling has even to some extent reached the G21 countries, who of course also attempted to mount a kind of revolt and to break this monopoly of power between Europe and the United States and perhaps also other nations."
"In view of that it may perhaps make very good sense for us to analyse further what actually happened and whether we are creating a reasonable basis for our new strategy."
"I do not share the self-pity that I rather sense here in this Chamber, that feeling that we are to blame for so much."
"I would like to congratulate the Commissioners."
"I think that their strategy was the right one and that we should not be heaping all the blame onto our own shoulders because it failed."
"I also believe that we should keep our options open."
"I certainly do not think that we should limit ourselves to the multilateral agenda, and those Members who know me will be aware of that."
"Sometimes it is a good thing to have several options, because you then have some scope for juggling your options."
"Sometimes one option is right and at other times a different one is."
"I am therefore in favour of keeping both options open."
"Furthermore, I hope that my fellow Member from Austria, Mr Paul Rübig, will address the House later."
"Unfortunately I have no more time left."
"Madam President, the failure in Cancún is a snub inflicted by the countries of the South on the imperial powers of the United States and the European Union."
"The latter have tried, once again, to impose their rather cynical logic, which consists of maintaining protectionism for their own agriculture and obtaining free access for their industries the world over."
"The suicide of the leader of the Korean peasants symbolises in a tragic manner the despair of millions of men and women dishonoured by this fool's bargain."
"Under very difficult conditions, the demonstrators in Cancún affirmed their refusal of the rules of the WTO which impoverish them more and more each day."
"This failure on the part of the WTO will not suffice to change the systems in order, at long last, to satisfy fundamental needs."
"Nonetheless, it constitutes real encouragement for the rejected of the planet - and they are numerous - to develop their philosophy and fight towards an ambitious objective: to create, at long last, a fair, mutually supportive world."
"Specifically, today, Mr Lamy, it is necessary to stop demanding, in our name moreover, the liberalisation of 102 of their services."
"On the contrary, it is time today to cancel the debt of the countries of the South."
"That could, at long last, open up the possibility of real development for the developing countries."
"Madam President, the failure of the ministerial conference in Cancún on 14 September has made many people fear that the first victim will be the multilateral approach to international trade negotiations."
"That would be a pity."
"We are in fact convinced that world trade and international life in general must be based on simple multilateral rules respected by everyone, applied by transparent international organisations."
"Which rules, though?"
"That is the whole problem, because since 1995 and the Marrakech agreements, the WTO has been living by a major underlying principle: the systematic opening of the markets and the doctrine of global free trade which are supposed to give everyone, in all circumstances, maximum profit."
"It is this rule, contested by more and more countries, which has just exploded in Cancún and we must be aware of this if we want to reconstruct something."
"In order to reconstruct, we would need to keep the rule of free trade, of course, but complement it with another rule: that of the sovereignty of each national democracy or each preferential trade zone, which must be free to modulate trade to its needs, especially when it comes to agriculture."
"Now we need to learn the lessons from the failure of Cancún and admit the specificity of these questions, which should doubtless even be taken away from the WTO and dealt with by a specific international organisation."
"At all events, the fundamental rules should be the right of each country or each region to maintain its agricultural model, its food independence and the health of its population."
"This implies two twin demands."
"First, we have to accept the total abolition in the long term of agricultural export subsidies."
"Let us not hide our face, let us recognise it frankly, it is a moral necessity."
"Then, we have to accept equally frankly the legitimacy of the Community preference in the form of an import levy or internal aid when it is needed to achieve the social objectives that we have democratically set ourselves."
"These two simultaneous frank acceptances are necessary if we want to start again now on the right foot, but they also imply the need for an in-depth review of the internal reform of European agricultural policy, which was prepared too quickly in the run up to Cancún."
"This reform should now be the subject of new reflection and should be reoriented in line with the lessons we have learned from this failure."
"Madam President, I declare an interest as a farmer receiving agricultural subsidies."
"But today I specifically want to speak in defence of the weaker developing countries, particularly those in the ACP."
"To me, Cancún should have been the culmination of months of serious work in committee, thrashing out answers to the doubts and fears of the developing world."
"To expect to sit down with 148 countries and reach any conclusion is beyond any possibility, but I believe that Cancún was a watershed."
"The days of powerful blocs such as the European Union and the USA sitting in smoke-filled rooms, carving up the spoils and throwing a few crumbs to the rest of the world, have long since gone."
"Developing countries have realised that there is strength in numbers and power in using that strength."
"But this is not just a matter of the developing and the developed world."
"There are different strata in both groupings."
"Economically, Asia, the Far East and Latin America are light-years away from the ACP countries."
"Countries' trade potential will develop at different speeds."
"Successes for the future depend on flexibility of timing."
"Opt-outs were offered as essential ingredients at Cancún and must be part of any future plan."
"Capacity to enact what has been agreed is a key factor."
"The ACP is, at this moment, negotiating a Cotonou partnership agreement on trade to be agreed by 2008."
"Economic partnership agreements and regional economic partnership agreements are the eventual aim of those negotiations."
"Most of those countries are not ready for reciprocal trade agreements or rules on competition; but regional integration would give them strength in a global world and increase south/south trade."
"The ACP countries could not cope with Cotonou and Cancún at the same time."
"For them Cancún was a step too far, too soon."
"Now we must have a complete reassessment of procedures."
"Madam President, I should like to say at the outset that I agree with those who have said that we have to look to the future."
"However, what others have said here today, that we must take stock of what happened, is equally important."
"My first point is that we should not waver in our continuing commitment to multilateral trade rules."
"We arrived in Cancún with an extremely overloaded agenda: ministers had enormous difficulty grappling with too many complex, unresolved issues."
"The process, therefore, is clearly unsustainable."
"The whole process of those few days was virtually wasted until Saturday when the revised text appeared, to the consternation of developing countries."
"There was a real sense when we arrived in Cancún - as confirmed by this revised text - that the vision, promise and ambition of Doha was being seriously threatened, because matters of substance on agriculture, cotton and the new issues, which are important to developing countries, simply were not being addressed."
"We have to acknowledge very clearly what the perception of developing countries is."
"It is not good enough to come here and say that the developing countries were asking for too much."
"They should be insulted by the implication that NGOs were able to manipulate and manage their opinions in the way that some have said."
"In view of the proximity of the December date for the meeting in Geneva, I would like to ask, Commissioner, what kind of bridge-building and confidence-building you are engaged in at this time - having just had a moment to catch your breath after Cancún - to try to ensure that we have some success there?"
"Finally, on the Singapore issues: are you aware, Commissioner, that on Thursday the DTI Minister in the UK said that she would be seeking a meeting with you on the Singapore issues to ensure that you stick to the position that was taken in Cancún and that we will no longer press for negotiations at the WTO on investment and competition?"
"Are you aware that the British Minister said this in the House of Commons and do you expect your mandates to change on the basis of this kind of statement?"
"Madam President, the WTO is the main imperialist mechanism which imposes the terms of the multinationals and the full liberalisation and opening of the markets on international trade."
"The result is the widening of the gap between rich and poor, despite the growth in international trade."
"The failure of Cancún demonstrates that the WTO cannot play this role unimpeded, which is, without doubt, a good thing."
"Resistance is growing both on the streets and in the negotiating chambers."
"New players are appearing and claiming a place in the game. Intra-capitalist oppositions are becoming more acute."
"The solution does not lie in reforms in one direction or another, it needs to get to the very foundations of the WTO."
"The European Union went to Cancún having sacrificed the interests of small and medium-sized farmers."
"It is clear from the interview with Mr Lamy that he intends to sacrifice even more and I am waiting for an answer to the question of how far he will go."
"With cotton, for example, where the European Union imports 70% of its requirements, will we reach the point at which we import 100% and wipe out the cotton industry in Greece, Spain and Portugal?"
"Madam President, unlike in the past, agriculture was not the reason why these negotiations failed."
"In my view, their failure was due to the maximalist stance of the Group of 21, which came to the negotiating table with questions which went beyond the Doha Agenda. The most striking of these was the demand for the phasing-out of the domestic aid believed to cause the most distortion, namely the blue and amber boxes."
"For the first time, the European Union adopted an assertive stance, with which it seemed rather comfortable. This was due to the CAP reform it has carried out, and the agreement it has concluded with the United States of America."
"Sadly, though, the Group of 21 did not recognise the European Union's efforts to adapt its agricultural policy. This group still insists on talking as if the CAP had not changed in the last ten years."
"The CAP has changed radically in that time, but they still talk as if the European Union were a protectionist wall, ignoring the fact that the EU is the largest importer of agricultural produce in the world today."
"Perhaps the group of African countries which, perhaps legitimately, dug in their heels to defend cotton, had forgotten that the European Union as a bloc has tried harder than anyone to support developing countries. Today's EU market, moreover, takes in 85% of those countries' agricultural exports."
"Furthermore, the voices of the world's poorest countries, which enjoy completely free access to our markets as a result of the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, were not even heard. This was because they were completely drowned out by countries which also claim to be underdeveloped but whose interests are fundamentally different from, or even opposed to, the interests of these poorest countries."
"We must not, I feel, be masochistic."
"The European Union took a very reasonable stance in these negotiations and behaved generously towards less-developed countries."
"It could go further, of course. I can say in all conscience, however, that if everyone had adopted the same flexible, responsible stance as the European Union there, an agreement would have been reached."
"Madam President, I get the impression that the individual trees that make up the many aspects of the failure of Cancún prevent us from focusing more closely on the wood."
"The wood is the same as that which caused Seattle to break down almost four years ago, and it has a name and a surname: it is called a huge inequality between rich and poor countries, and the absence of an agreed strategy to reduce that inequality, a strategy made up of timeframes, policies, programmes, figures and amounts."
"Clearly, this strategy forms part of neither Bush's unilateralism - it is true that there is a close link between Iraq and Cancún - nor any of the bilateral agreements."
"Genuine multilateralism is the only correct method, but that is where our limitations lay in the preparations for Cancún."
"That was one of the weaker areas of the Presidency and the Council's work."
"Although he is not listening to me, I would like to say to Mr Urso that I appreciated his frank reasoning and also much of his analysis."
"What, however, did we do to prepare for Cancún?"
"While President Bush was on the phone to President Lula and the Indian Prime Minister, what were we doing?"
"This was a weaker area of the Commission and Parliament's work too."
"According to Commissioner Lamy's forecasts - backed by most of the Members of the European Parliament - the famous G-17 alliance, which then became G-21 and G-24, was to be primarily tactical, but, for mainly political reasons, that was not the case, and it will not be the case in future either."
"Madam President, I would have preferred to wait a little before voting on the documents in this Chamber."
"Indeed, tomorrow, we are going to vote on a rather disappointing document which will not answer the question 'Why did Cancún fail?' and will not provide guidelines on the direction we should take in future."
"I would like to end by saying to Commissioner Lamy that, although the WTO is the negotiating forum, it is not on the Moon or on Mars."
"It is here, and the backdrop to the negotiations is precisely this huge inequality which exists and which characterises life on this Earth in our time."
"Madam President, I would like to remind you of three main lessons we should learn from events in Cancún."
"Firstly, the positions of the European Union and the United States contributed to this conference's failure to find solutions which might have given developing countries a fair deal. The EU and US positions ignore the need for debt relief for the least-developed countries, and ignore the problems faced by workers and by micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises within Europe itself, in sectors such as textiles, clothing, footwear and agriculture."
"Secondly, the workings of international institutions must become more democratic. New, fair and democratic rules must be laid down, giving hope to the poor and enabling effective sustainable development."
"Thirdly, however, I would also like to remind you of the major popular demonstrations in Cancún and, to a degree, all over the world, protesting against the injustice of globalisation and demanding new, fairer, and more democratic rules."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have indeed all lost out as a result of the failure at Cancún."
"Paradoxically, the least-developed countries are set to suffer most, when they should have been the main beneficiaries of the Development Round."
"Economic growth at global level has also been negatively affected."
"This is not only because a reduction of duties and the elimination of other barriers to trade benefits economic growth by making trade exchanges easier."
"It is also because success at Cancún would have sent out a very positive signal, one that would have helped revitalise the global economy."
"There is also likely to be a negative impact on the multilateral trading system."
"I am convinced there is no need to deviate from the course followed to date."
"Nonetheless, it is imperative to overcome the stalemate the Development Round finds itself in following Cancún. Work on the basis of the agreements previously reached must resume at the earliest opportunity."
"As has already been stated, it is essential to undertake an in-depth study of the working procedures of the WTO and its organisational structure."
"The reasons for the failure at Cancún must be investigated too."
"Commissioner, I venture to suggest a further area for consideration by you, namely the need to reformulate the development of the potential of the least-developed countries."
"By this I mean more than the need to increase the budget allocation for the purpose, though that is certainly required also."
"What I have in mind is the need to establish how best to help weaker countries to improve their negotiating capacity, and how best to empower them to take decisions for themselves, and to do so in full awareness of the facts."
"This would also ensure they were not taken advantage of."
"Regrettably, this does seem to have been the case in the past."
"Madam President, I believe the outcome of this consideration and the ensuing decisions will determine whether Doha will indeed prove a turning point, even though the next stage of the journey will be longer than anticipated."
"It will also determine the future of the multilateral trading system."
"Madam President, the negotiations in Cancún should have been an opportunity to take a first step towards fairer trade."
"However, they were scuppered."
"The developing countries reversed the traditional power relations within the WTO."
"This is an essential point to consider politically."
"But who will really benefit from this failure?"
"I note, for my part, that the developing countries have not gained anything specific in the application of the demands which they put on the Doha agenda."
"I imagine, like many here, that the United States is going to try and reinforce bilateralism for its own good, and I wonder how we Europeans are going to face the intensification of the trade war which threatens to ensue."
"On balance, this failure appears harmful, at least in the short term."
"In the public's eyes, however, it has had the effect of raising more than ever the question of adjusting the balance between the North and the South."
"This is the overall problem to which we must now try and find an answer."
"We need to see how to respond to it and with whom."
"This question is truly important because, for example, the interests of all the developing countries are not identical and their options with respect to the WTO do not yet appear to be very homogenous."
"In this context, which partner, which group can we count on in order to elaborate and engage in a strategy to relaunch the negotiations and reform the WTO?"
"Elsewhere, and on another level, we have, of course, understood the Group of 21's intention to combat external and internal public subsidies in the agricultural sector."
"Should we not fear that some countries, Commissioner, will seize the opportunity of the end of the peace clause to launch a legal attack on our CAP, in order to achieve their objectives without needing to honour any politically negotiated guarantees in return?"
"However things stand after Cancún, the answers appear to be less obvious than the questions."
"Madam President, I would first like to thank the Commission's very professional negotiating team, Commissioner Fischler and Commissioner Lamy, because they really did everything in their power to make the conference a success."
"Perhaps in future we ought to bring in a rule that says anyone who walks out of the negotiations has given their approval."
"We were expecting tough, rigorous negotiation, but we lost our partners along the way."
"In other words, the poor will remain poor and the rich will remain rich."
"That is not something for us to be happy about."
"Mrs Lucas said earlier that poorer countries should have the right to promote their own national industries."
"Does she mean by that monopolistic companies owned by a handful of ministers who are worried that competition rules and investment protection agreements will put their own assets at risk?"
"It might be helpful here to involve national members of parliament, opposition members, somewhat more closely, so that there can be a genuine debate in the least developed countries as well about who is to be wealthy and who is to live in total poverty."
"A few wealthy individuals compared with millions living in hunger."
"We should therefore make every effort to encourage small- and medium-sized enterprises, family companies, in these countries, to stimulate competition, and to promote well-being - and I do not mean just for a handful of people who benefit from the existence of monopolies."
"That is why I believe that the Parliamentary Conference is so important, and we as Europeans should be in the vanguard here, to ensure that there is an objective and transparent debate not only here in Europe, but also and above all in the world's poorest countries."
"They urgently need a debate of that kind."
"There is one more issue I would like to focus on: what will happen when the ''peace clause'' expires?"
"Will we be faced with another war, a world trade war in which the poor will become even poorer?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, I think that the Union should learn the lessons of this failure in Cancún, in order to avoid making the same mistakes in the future, and should rethink its strategy in order to prepare the indispensable initiatives for relaunching multilateralism."
"First, with regard to the emergence of these new groups of developing countries, I think that President Prodi was right, in Bologna last week, to stress that the nature of G21 and the will to make a political affirmation which it expressed were underestimated and misunderstood."
"I think that to seek to divide it or to set other developing countries against this group was wrong."
"It was useless and it diverted us from the indispensable political dialogue and trust which we needed to try and re-forge with it."
"Of course, the emergence of these groups, such as the subsequent G90, will make discussions and negotiations more difficult for us within the WTO."
"This is a challenge for the European Union, but it is also the pledge of a fairer trade system which responds better to the concerns of all the continents, especially of those who have not so far been the winners from the establishment of the WTO."
"Secondly, on the Singapore issues. I think that the negotiations were already fairly complicated on agriculture and the other questions which come under the jurisdiction of the WTO."
"There was also the outstanding balance of the commitments which were made in Doha and not respected, especially the deadlines which were not respected, not to mention the issues which we knew the majority of developing countries did not want."
"This was too classic a bargaining approach between defensive and offensive issues which did not match the situation and demonstrated, here too, a poor understanding of the deep-seated refusal to deal with these Singapore issues."
"I think that, if we want to save multilateralism today, it is only conceivable if we propose an in-depth reform, not only of the working of the WTO - this Parliament has made proposals for which I had the honour of acting as rapporteur - but also of its rules, of its priorities and of its doctrines, as previous speakers said."
"I think that we have to reinsert the commercial rules, in order for them to be better accepted by everyone as a whole, into a concept of world governance."
"Without doubt we need to replace the WTO in the system of the United Nations, because what Commissioner Prodi said earlier about relations with the other agencies comes down to that, perhaps under the control of an 'economic and social security council', as proposed by the former president of the Commission, Jacques Delors."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Dakota Indians have a wise saying: 'when you discover that you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount'."
"Things have not yet got quite that bad with the WTO, but what happened in Cancún is certainly a cause for concern."
"I too regard abandoning the negotiations more as a pyrrhic victory for the developing countries than as a success."
"Another interesting point here is the suggestion that the negotiations foundered on the rock of agricultural issues."
"How could that have been the case, though, when there were never to be any negotiations in the form of an official agriculture round?"
"I too regard the EU proposal on agriculture as totally acceptable, even if many developing countries were looking for something more. It was still an excellent proposal."
"So what role did the United States play?"
"It suited President Bush very well that there were no negotiations at all on agriculture, because reality would then have dawned on many countries."
"They would have then realised just who was putting the brakes on and that would have no doubt somewhat irritated the 'coalition of the willing' and those dependent on it."
"Mexico accordingly had to break off negotiations before they had even started, and the United States is also more interested in bilateral treaties than multilateral ones."
"I have one more thing to say, however, about those who believe that they now need to mount a campaign against the NGOs."
"Firstly, they greatly overestimate the NGOs' power, and, secondly, they demonstrate what they ultimately think about participation by some areas of civil society."
"My advice to them is to close this particular can of worms before it leads to their own downfall."
". (IT) Madam President, I will just say a few words, first and foremost to thank the European Parliament for the contribution it has made today."
"Thirty-one speeches underline the importance this institution - the greatest representative institution of the European Union - attaches to the principle of multilateralism which must govern our work."
"You have stated, reiterated and stressed the need to save and reinvigorate multilateralism, and, at the same time, many of you have stressed how important it is to launch a WTO reform process, in which the need for recognition of the new players must on no account be disregarded, to this end."
"Of course, we cannot go back to the old GATT mechanisms; we need to move forwards, recognising, as I said, that the world is now, I am glad to say, multipolar, and this is true of both northern and southern hemispheres, as can be seen, not least, from the creation of the G-21 - with which we must cooperate - made up chiefly of developing countries which are already reaping the benefits of globalisation and which have, therefore, become strong competitors and are claiming their rightful place - China and Brazil, for example - while there is a world in the south - the ACP and African States - which, as yet, are not benefiting from globalisation but, if anything, merely suffering the consequences."
"Thus, this threefold need to save multilateralism, reform the WTO and recognise new players should presumably prompt us to call for a process to be launched which can then lead to the creation of some intermediary bodies in between the Secretariat and the Assembly, in which this new representation can, at last, establish common ground between players who represent geographical, political, cultural, social and economic areas which are similar but different, so that they can create a high-level forum where issues can be resolved before they reach that assembly which really did seem in Cancún to be a veritable cacophony of languages and positions."
"Another important aspect which has been stressed concerns the issue of communication - a wholly European problem."
"Somebody pointed out that the non-governmental organisations played a dual, perhaps ambiguous role, changing between the language spoken in Brussels or Strasbourg and the, at times, loud shouting at Cancún, and that, at the same time, the European Union and the Commission had difficulty in putting across how much Europe has done over these 22 months and how much it does every day for the weakest of the weak."
"In this connection, by way of example, I believe the Commission took two press attachés to Cancún, whereas a single non-governmental organisation had at least 14."
"There is therefore a communication problem, and there may also be some linguistic confusion, which we must clear up if we are to do justice to the remarkable strength of European civil society, which has to express itself first and foremost - although not solely - through its representative organs."
"Lastly, you ask whether it is necessary to change the mandate or make it more flexible."
"I believe it is our duty to take your comments to the European Council, particularly in preparation for and in the wake of our appointment on 15 December, in which we may succeed in gaining a better insight into the impact of this failure on the other players too, including those who, perhaps unwittingly, have rejoiced rather too soon at this failure."
"I believe that we should discuss this in the coming months in order to discover whether more flexibility is needed on the Singapore issues - as requested by some - more flexibility on social and environmental issues and more flexibility on agricultural policy too."
"Lastly, I believe, with due regard for the time limits, that your contribution on this matter will be important, not to say decisive."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you all for your contributions to this debate, which has been a very important one."
"In my response I would like to concentrate on a few points that I think need to be explored further and also clarified somewhat."
"Firstly, one of the issues being debated was whether a multilateral approach or bilateral agreements should have priority."
"I do not think there is any alternative."
"There is no better approach than the multilateral one, and we need to adhere to that."
"Bilateral agreements can of course sometimes be helpful, but they should not be a substitute for a multilateral approach."
"Furthermore, no one should deceive themselves into thinking that only multilateral negotiations are difficult."
"Many bilateral agreements can also be hard to achieve, for example agreements with the Mercosur countries or many others besides."
"I also believe that it would be a mistake if by precipitately switching to bilateral negotiations we fell into the trap of thinking that those opened up the way to a kind of win-win situation. By that I mean imagining that you can take home what you have won in bilateral negotiations and then be well placed to make further massive demands when it comes to multilateral negotiations."
"I think some caution is called for here from a European point of view."
"Nevertheless, we should have direct discussions and direct negotiations on a bilateral basis with many individual states that are WTO members so that they understand our stance towards them in multilateral negotiations."
"My second point is this: I very much believe that it was the right thing to reform the common agricultural policy."
"We made those reforms ourselves - and I am pleased to remind you about that here, because we had that very debate here in this Chamber."
"We said that European society was demanding reforms, and that was why we needed them."
"We cannot come along now and say that we were only pursuing our project to make Europe's agriculture and European agricultural policy more sustainable, for example, because we needed an argument to succeed in international negotiations."
"That really would be putting the cart before the horse."
"This did of course give us a certainly flexibility in international negotiations, but it goes without saying that we should always carry out our internal reforms first, and then base our mandate for negotiations on that."
"Or do you really believe that this House would be willing to give the Commission a negotiating mandate that goes beyond our own existing common policies?"
"That is inconceivable, it would never work, and we should not therefore have any such illusions."
"What we cannot tolerate, however, is an attempt to simply 'write off' the contribution we are making by virtue of our own reforms, so that for example commitments to make reductions are not based on the amount we agreed last time, during the Uruguay Round, which was taken as the starting point at that time, but that instead any competition-distorting support measures we are currently implementing are treated as the baseline."
"That would be unfair to us and that is something we also need to make clear."
"My third point is that the NGOs have played a major part in this debate."
"We should not make the mistake of acting now as if the NGOs have not behaved properly and cut off their financial support or whatever."
"I think that would be nonsensical."
"What we must do, however, is to seek a dialogue with the NGOs."
"We need to deal with them and with the arguments they put forward."
"This is pretty important, when I think, for example, how much the position of the same NGO may vary depending on whether you are talking to the department responsible for development policy or the department for environmental policy."
"You cannot just do what many NGOs have done and say that Europe's agricultural sector must become environmentally friendly and we must have a budget for agri-environmental measures."
"Because if we do that you cannot come along afterwards and say that any form whatsoever of agricultural aid is undesirable!"
"That is inconsistent, and we need to have a more meaningful debate here."
"This would also enable us to reduce mistrust towards the developing countries, which sometimes get the feeling that the complexity of the negotiations and the difficulties involved have been designed to make access more difficult for those who have not already been taking part in these negotiations for years."
"We need to dismantle the barriers here."
"First and foremost, we should try to get back to the facts."
"We should involve independent organisations such as the OECD more closely so as to achieve a more objective debate."
"As they say in the world of agriculture, you can take a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink."
"There also needs to be a willingness to go into the arguments and to enter into a real dialogue."
"That is the only way for us to make progress."
"As far as the peace clause is concerned, let me remind you that it expires at the end of the year in any case."
"Although this does not mean that the whole WTO agricultural edifice will come tumbling down, there is a possibility that the way we in Europe have implemented our Uruguay Round commitments will come under fire."
"I would also like to sound a warning note: some states see this as an opportunity to set up a variety of panels."
"That would be another means of undermining the actual WTO process."
"We therefore need to consider all this very carefully."
"Lastly, one thing that we must achieve is to get over more effectively our basic philosophy about the purpose of the WTO negotiations."
"The point of negotiating is that there has to be some middle ground that the various parties can move towards."
"It does not mean moving towards an extreme position."
"If you do not take that principle into account properly when preparing for negotiations, the risk of failure in the future will remain fairly high."
"For that reason my advice - if we are not to shelve things but draw the necessary conclusions now - is that we should carry out a careful analysis and debate matters, and then reach a decision in as consensual way as possible about what the next steps should be. That should enable us to get everything back on track again, as it were."
"Following this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure"
"The developing countries are organising and asserting themselves."
"The main lesson of Cancún is linked to the rising power of the Southern 'bloc'."
"The poor countries have had enough of putting up with the arrogance of the world trade giants, the United States and the European Union."
"Even though Mr Pascal Lamy is doing his best to make believe that the failure of the conference is, first and foremost, detrimental to the poor countries, the fact remains that - for lack of the WTO fortress - a protectorate has fallen."
"We have to get away from the cynicism of the 'tit for tat' logic which consists of imposing on the South the profligacy of all-out liberalisation of their most vital sectors, while its people are struggling to survive."
"The Union and the Member States should construct new relations with the South, not despoil it."
"Europe should refuse to toe the United States' line, by leaning, for example, on the authority acquired by the anti-globalisation movement."
"Today, isolated, discredited in its will to invest sincerely in a real cooperation and development policy, the Union needs to pull itself together."
"The so-called 'poor' countries are not poor in terms of demands and proposals."
"It is by considering them as real counterparts that Europe will win a place in the world, in order to help make it more humane."
"The next item is a statement by the Council on the review of the trans-European networks and sustainable development."
"Madam President, I have to start by informing you that I am afraid my colleague, Mr Lunardi, the minister responsible for this matter, has been detained in Rome by important government commitments and will not, therefore, be able to take part in this debate."
"I am therefore going to deliver a brief statement on some of the considerations relating to this major subject instead."
"Firstly, the Council confirms its commitment to the sustainable development strategy established by the 2001 Gothenburg European Council."
"In this regard, our goal is to ensure the sustainability of transport, deal with growing traffic volumes and levels of congestion, noise and pollution and promote the use of environmentally friendly means of transport. We are also aiming at the full internationalisation of social and environmental costs."
"As stressed by the European Council, one essential way of achieving this objective is to develop trans-European transport networks, giving priority, where appropriate, to investment in infrastructure for public transport and railways, internal waterways, short sea shipping, intermodal operations and effective interconnection, in other words to encourage the development of means of transport which are less harmful to the environment."
"The existing guidelines on the development of trans-European transport networks already identify, as one of the objectives of the network, guaranteeing the sustainable mobility of persons and goods while, at the same time, contributing to the achievement of Community objectives, particularly in the field of the environment and competition."
"In this regard, the incorporation of environmental concerns at the planning and development stage of projects has been fixed as a priority objective for the development of the network."
"More generally, Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 places the Member States under obligation to give due consideration to environmental protection during the development and implementation of projects, carrying out environmental impact assessments."
"In addition, an environmental assessment has to be carried out on the plans and programmes drawn up in preparation for these projects, particularly those funded by the Community, under Directive 2001/42/EC of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment."
"Genuine free movement of goods and passengers depends on a perfectly integrated transport network, which links the islands and outer or remote regions with central regions."
"By ensuring a more effective use of transport, a modern, interconnected and interoperable network brings an increase in trade and in the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole."
"Until the necessary infrastructure has been built and until there is a proper legislative framework for the effective management of the network, the concepts of internal market and territorial cohesion of the Union will be incomplete."
"The inclusion of a section dedicated to the trans-European networks policy in the Maastricht Treaty gave the European Community the powers and instruments it needed to develop them."
"Under Article 154 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Community is to contribute to the creation and development of trans-European networks in the field of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructure."
"This will contribute to both the creation of an internal market and economic and social cohesion, although, to this end, we need, first and foremost, to develop the interconnection and interoperability of national networks."
"Over the past decade, we have witnessed not only a disturbing increase in traffic congestion in urban areas but also a new phenomenon of congestion on the major arteries of the trans-European network."
"According to the Commission, the external costs of congestion caused by road traffic account, alone, for 0.5% of the European Union's GDP."
"This figure is even more alarming if we consider that the demand for transport is going to continue to increase considerably in the future."
"If we do not adopt measures between now and 2010 to rationalise the use and maximise the benefits of each means of transport, the volume of heavy road traffic alone in the 15-Member State Union could increase by 50% on the 1998 level."
"This trend is damaging to both the Member States and the countries applying to join the Community, in that we witnessed both the gradual fall in the market share of the railways and, at the same time, a rise of almost 20% in road transport between 1990 and 1998."
"In the new context of sustainable development, the June 2001 Gothenburg Council called for emphasis, in future, on the development of rail, sea and river transport."
"In May 2004, 10 countries are to join the European Union, while Romania and Bulgaria are to join in 2007."
"In the light of this, there is a need for new infrastructure in the corridors serving other countries to link them effectively to the trans-European network of the present 15 Member States."
"The need also arises to improve links between the countries themselves."
"A new network of infrastructure therefore needs to be built linking east to west and north to south."
"It should also be remembered that the Council conclusions on the second review of the Council strategy on the integration of environmental requirements and sustainable development into transport policy, adopted by the Ministers for Transport in December 2002, stressed the importance of analysing new political proposals from the point of view of their environmental impact and of the Community's ability to reduce harm to the environment caused by the transport sector."
"To back this up, I would point out that, during the same meeting of December last year, the Council approved the Marco Polo programme, which is intended to fund improvements to the environmental aspects of the goods transport system."
"The programme provides for the funding of initiatives to transfer goods transport from road to other means of transport such as rail, internal waterways or short sea shipping."
"The goal of promoting sustainable development through endeavours to restore a balance between means of transport which favours those which respect the environment will, therefore, be an essential point of reference for the Council when, in the coming months, it examines the Commission's proposal on the revision of the TEN guidelines and the priority projects it contains."
"From this point of view, the Council believes that the conclusions of the High-Level Group chaired by former Commissioner, Mr Van Miert, follow the strategic approach of sustainable, well-balanced development with due regard for environmental protection and, at the same time, endeavours to strengthen the unity of Europe through the free movement of persons and goods, and with due regard for the need to reduce natural barriers and to maintain a balance between east-west and north-south routes."
"It considers that investment in infrastructure together with appropriate public and private partnership initiatives could be a highly effective instrument supporting economic growth."
"From this point of view, the situation of certain countries which continue to be affected by the problem of passes and whose production systems continue to suffer considerable economic harm as a result, is typical."
"That is why we must continue to urge the Commission to resolve these issues."
"The Council therefore calls upon the Commission to present its proposal for revising the TENs without delay, so that a broad political debate can be held and a common position adopted."
"Madam President, when we debate this issue, anyone can see that, as long as we remain at a theoretical level, we do not have very many disagreements."
"We all agree that efficient trans-European networks linking eastern and western Europe and northern and southern Europe need to be created, we all agree that the issue of traffic congestion needs to be addressed, we all agree that emphasis needs to be given to the environment and to more friendly means of transport and we all agree that greater emphasis needs to be given to the railways."
"The problem is when we start to address specific issues."
"That is where we see that there is a difficulty reaching decisions."
"For example, Minister, we have been talking about railways for a great many years, but the Council is not distinguished, at least not as a whole I think, by its intention to liberalise rail transport."
"Because, without liberalisation and without interoperability in the network, it is obvious that the railways, which are the most environmentally-friendly, will never be able to acquire the required momentum."
"The same applies to priority works."
"We had the Essen Council. You know that 14 top priority trans-European networks were approved and, a few years later, we see that half of them have not progressed."
"Consequently, on numerous occasions you see that we make plans on paper."
"And this becomes even more remarkable if you think that certain of these works concern what we are talking about now, namely respect for the environment and the need to address traffic congestion in certain sensitive areas of our continent."
"Consequently, what is urgently needed is for proclamations and all these plans on paper to find some response in reality."
"And here we have to look at the question of funding."
"In a few days' time, no doubt, the European Commission will come along and tell us that it is proposing a new plan reforming the trans-European network guidelines."
"So we shall jointly adopt a number of priority works."
"But if we do not fund these works efficiently, it is certain that, as the volume of transport increases, in a short time things will be much worse and the entire European network will be even more overloaded."
"In this way development too is undermined."
"Consequently, we need to see how the Member States can assume their responsibilities and how the Union budget will fund the European networks more substantially and what role the European Investment Bank can play in this direction."
"I hope the Italian Presidency, which appears to be particularly sensitive to this specific issue, will manage to take efficient steps in this direction because, believe me Minister, debates such as this have been held on other occasions in this Parliament, but the results were not particularly impressive."
"I trust that you will take the European Union down a different road."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not, of course, have to re-invent the trans-European networks, because we have them already."
"Mind you, they have already lost something of their impetus, considering who has been working on them and for how long."
"From 1996 until today, the TENs have undoubtedly had their ups and downs."
"At the beginning, or as early as at the Essen Council, they were hailed as the magic remedy for the European Union and its development, until the moment came when we realised that what was expected of them was rather unrealistic."
"No, I think that the TENs are a very important tool for the European Union, economic cohesion, the internal market and a modern transport policy."
"The Commission's White Paper again made that clear not long ago."
"As Europeans, we need a transport policy that is technically up-to-date - GALILEO was mentioned as a potential model - and one that is sustainable, that is to say with priority given to rail and water."
"We should now have been a small step further down the road if the Council had also accepted the Commission's proposals, as Parliament has done."
"In 2002, Parliament attempted a small revision of the trans-European networks, to which the Council has not so far provided us with a response; instead, the Van Miert Group has gone on to do its work."
"So then, we do not have to re-invent the wheel. The Van Miert Group has done its work, involving high-ranking representatives from every single Member State, and its reports affirm that the Member States agree with what it has, as it were, thought out and presented."
"It is now, therefore, really up to the Commission to incorporate what the Van Miert Group suggested into a proposal."
"This would then go before Parliament and the Council and, given good will on the part of the Council, we should then have implemented relatively quickly what the Van Miert Group has thought out in terms of projects and, also, financing instruments."
"It is not quite clear to me why, in fact, we are now debating the issue once again."
"The proposals and plans are on the table. It is now just a question of their being implemented and worked on."
"That is why no further pressure should be placed upon available speaking time."
"So then, we have a proposal from the Commission, Parliament is doing its work, and then let the Council - instead of dragging its heels, if it please - very rapidly implements the proposal so that the revision of the TENs can be got rapidly under way."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the review of the trans-European network guidelines, which dated back to 1996, was, without a doubt, necessary, both in order to resolve the increasingly complex infrastructure problems and to prepare for enlargement."
"The work of the Van Miert Group is certainly thorough, but I do not fully endorse its strategic approach, which is biased towards northern Europe to the detriment of the south and the Mediterranean, an area which represents a major opportunity - and also a major European challenge - in terms of the economic, cultural and social cohesion of peoples and countries with which we are called to enter into a new, major dialogue."
"Therefore, if Italy is a major bridge in the Mediterranean between north and south and between east and west, I fail to understand why both the Adriatic corridor and the Mediterranean corridor, designed to satisfy the requirements of intermodality and interoperability, have been removed from the list of priorities."
"Only the bridge over the Straits of Messina, which is a case apart, remains."
"We therefore call upon the Commission to ensure that they are reinstated once again among the priority projects for 2020, and for endeavours to improve relations between the public and private sectors and to implement controls."
"Madam President, we would like to thank Mr Antonione for being with us today, but what we wanted when we requested this debate was to talk to Mr Lunardi and Commissioner De Palacio: however, we have to note that neither of them is in the Chamber today, and we do not believe that this is a coincidence - rather, a clear political gesture."
"The Presidency's speech focused more on the functioning of the internal market than on the achievement of sustainability goals, and the same applies to the Members' speeches: they all talked about transport; no one mentioned sustainability."
"People say that the review of the TENs will contribute to the development of a network which is efficient in terms of quality and sustainability, but that does not necessarily follow and it requires specific political choices to be made."
"There is no mention of incorporating environmental concerns into the current debate on the review of the TENs and there is no sign of any intention to carry out a pre-emptive environmental assessment."
"Here is a practical example. Today, we are faced with the danger that the Commission will bring forward to 1 October the approval of what is known as the 'Van Miert list', which sets out the TEN priority plan for the next 20 years."
"As it admitted itself, the Van Miert Group should have carried out an assessment of the projects' impact on the environment, biodiversity, volumes, transport and climate, but it has not done so."
"Who should shoulder this responsibility, if not the Commission?"
"If the Commission really is going to take its decisions by 1 October, it will not have time to do so; it will merely have time to ratify the Van Miert list, which boils down to nothing more than the product of bartering between different governments."
"We feel that, before the Van Miert list is approved, a proper cost-benefit assessment needs to be carried out on the trans-European networks proposed at Essen; we need to promote a European transport plan which prioritises the restoration of existing lines, reinforcement of regional networks and the fight to achieve decongestion of urban traffic; we need to consult the local bodies and authorities in the spirit of the Aarhus Convention and expose the interests of the economic promoters who are behind major infrastructure."
"There is a lot more that needs to be said, but I hope that we will have other opportunities to say it."
"Madam President, as rapporteur for TENs, I would like to start by thanking Mr Antonione for being here today, and I would like to thank Commissioner De Palacio for her work in general on this renowned project."
"In the few minutes available to me, I would like to say that the experience I have accumulated in the field of TENs has led me to draw two conclusions."
"Firstly, we could say that we are dealing with a pipe dream, something that was decided many years ago but was not then implemented when it came down to it, perhaps because of a lack of resources but perhaps because of a lack of will too."
"Secondly, a series of debates has been launched in the individual States on the different resources, on the reference legislation, on the question of whether to focus the TEN project on rail transport or on priority objectives; ultimately, however, of all the original projects - the famous 14 - 11 have yet to be completed."
"On the other hand, what we are attempting to do - and I would express my appreciation to the Commission here for its endeavours - is, thanks to the work of the Van Miert High Level Group, review the TEN objectives and, in particular, the resources."
"I believe that all the individual States would like this project to be important in terms of the expansion of their economies, of job creation, of attempting to create a genuine network across the 15 nations, soon to be 25."
"It is therefore important to appropriate more funds."
"We must therefore endeavour to achieve about 30 or 40% in non-returnable funds; we must aim not just at EUR 600 million per year but at achieving between EUR 6 billion and EUR 8 billion per year for the next ten years."
"We all hope that this will be possible and I believe that, with the help of the Italian Presidency in these six months, we will be able to succeed."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Antonione for remaining with us thus far."
"I have to say that this debate is not adding anything new to what we already know because, although it is true that there is a general problem where sustainable development is concerned, the fact is that, in this period, we are on the eve of enlargement - partial but major enlargement."
"There will be 25 countries in the European Union and we must equip ourselves so that we can achieve closer relations between the Member States. Closer relations mean more traffic and more cultural, economic and commercial exchanges, for exchanges involve the transfer of knowledge and wealth, which enables Europe to open its doors to successive enlargements, the ultimate goal being to achieve the full unity of our continent."
"That said, I have to note that this evening's debate is based principally on the work of the Van Miert Group and, in particular, on the priorities which have been set according to criteria which, in my opinion, need to be analysed in depth."
"I cannot list them all, so I will confine myself to mentioning the 10 major trans-European corridors planned and the fact that these infrastructures have essentially been assessed, first and foremost, with reference to the present European Union rather than the future EU, in the sense that a great deal of pressure has been exerted by the countries who are already Members while those who are, in any case, already knocking at the European Union's doors had no bargaining power, with the result that we are now essentially in a position where we do need to consider their needs."
"I would mention, not by chance, by way of example, corridor 8, one of the two corridors which concern Italy."
"On the list of these priorities, it has been given almost the lowest urgent status, whereas a large bridge is to be opened providing a link with the Balkans, whose peoples, despite the effects of the recent war, are already displaying an accelerated growth rate and are a model example of how communities such as those of southern Italy, an area inhabited by 20 million citizens who, precisely through relations with the Balkans and the East, can play a major role within Europe, can become leaders in development."
"Madam President, pending the arrival of news which we have not received, please would you forward my observations in the form of recommendations, at least, and, perhaps, concerns."
"Madam President, I regret the Commissioner's absence, as I wished to thank her for indicating she was favourably disposed to the creation of a major central axis through the Pyrenees, with significant railway capacity."
"This would benefit sustainable development too."
"I also regret the absence of Commission representation, because we would welcome a prompt response from the Commission concerning the Commissioner's proposal for the new trans-European networks."
"Finally, I feel obliged to rectify a comment made in the House this morning."
"Mr Mayol i Raynal proposed the recreation of a State of Catalonia extending from Fraga to Mahon."
"I am bound to state I am completely opposed to Fraga becoming part of such a state."
"Fraga has been part of Aragon since the Middle Ages. Consequently, it is not part of Catalonia and never has been."
"I would like this minuted, please."
"Madam President, we are today discussing the trans-European networks, and it is unfortunate that we are doing so in the absence of the Commission and of the Council."
"When we look carefully at matters, the fact is that, according to the calculations, the European Union is foregoing half a percentage point per year in economic growth because, for example, the infrastructure is insufficiently developed and not functioning efficiently."
"If, moreover, we were to achieve - as is probable - an improvement of between 25% and 50% in our air quality - at least in quite a few areas - we should be setting our sights more firmly upon combined transport, that is to say on a combination of rail, road and water."
"When the European Union has set itself two important objectives - the first in Lisbon, concerning the competitiveness of our continent, and the second, which has since been insufficiently implemented, in Gothenburg, concerning the sustainability of economic development on our continent - it is rather strange that there are already many contradictions in transport policy, in terms of many very different investments and trends, and of the fact that - although we hope this will soon happen - roads are, to some extent, still not paying their way in the light, for example, of the Road Costs Directive."
"I hope that the Commission will soon examine the proposals of the committee chaired by Mr van Miert and will present this Parliament with a practical proposal as to how, in the future, the trans-European networks should be developed."
"What is first of all necessary is a list of priorities and, secondly of course, the funding. Mr Goebbels and others have already referred to this."
"Credit financing alone will not suffice."
"Nor is it enough to organise private capital, something that is also incredibly difficult to do."
"What we see in the case of many projects - and Commissioner Kinnock has already submitted proposals in this respect and set up his own group of experts - is that, in actual practice, a private-public partnership really only works in the case of a few such projects if nothing is also done to increase public investment."
"In my view, it should really be considered whether, for example, there is the possibility, in the case of carefully targeted cross-border projects that are priorities specifically in terms of European cohesion, of permitting quite specific exemptions from the deficit calculation à la Maastricht."
"The Presidency's proposals on this subject were very problematic because they were couched in too general terms, and I believe we must give them more specific wordings."
"The Commission and the Council should now be called upon finally to reach decisions and genuinely to propose a realistic funding concept."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that we were to have a discussion with the Council, but, as we are quite aware, we are partly to blame, for we extended our previous work."
"The fact remains - and I, too, agree with the Members who have made this point - that it is a pity that this opportunity cannot be fully exploited."
"There is not much point in holding the debate if the Commission and the Council are not here, but let us, at least, use it to discuss the matter amongst ourselves; in any case, there are very few of us left in the Chamber."
"Before I go any further, I would say to Mrs Frassoni that I, too, am concerned that sustainability should be placed at the heart of the project and that it should, so to speak, be one of the screening criteria for what we want to do."
"However, I am much more concerned at the unsustainable nature of the present situation."
"As the Socialist Member, Mr Goebbels, said - I do not know if you heard him, Madam President - in actual fact, our citizens are already playing an enormous price in terms of quality of life and quality of the environment now, precisely because of the situation in our continent of malfunctions, traffic jams, traffic overloads and the impossibility of smooth traffic flow."
"That said, however, I, too, believe that, at this juncture, we, too, as Parliament, should launch an 'Operation truth' if we do not want the Van Miert report to be just another pipe dream or set of low priorities, for when we start to call priorities 10, 20 or 25 projects involving, as we all know, such huge costs, the likelihood is that none of the projects on our list are actually going to be treated as a priority."
"I am sure Parliament is capable of carrying out this 'Operation truth', starting by making people shoulder their responsibilities and by asking ourselves, if we want a European transport policy and if we want a large-scale infrastructure policy, what price we are prepared to pay for this policy and, in particular, which choices we are prepared to make."
"Otherwise, we will continue to hold virtually useless debates like this and, above all, we will continue to raise the expectations of our citizens and of some of our political leaders too, and it would and will be more damaging to fail to meet those expectations than to fail to implement a project."
"I therefore feel that, while we are waiting for the Commission and, above all, the Council, to explain to us what the actual possibilities are behind the intentions expressed so clearly by the Italian Presidency at the start of its mandate, we can start to lay down this challenge."
"If we are to do it, let us get on with it, but we must do it properly and sit down round a table to work out what it is actually possible to achieve."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that Mr Lunardi will have time to glance at the Minutes of this sitting, for he will find some useful recommendations for his work in the Council Presidency, first and foremost relating to the danger - which has already been pointed out by Mrs Frassoni and which I, too, fear - that, on 1 October, the adoption of this list of 18 projects compiled by the Van Miert Group will be rushed through more in the style of a ratification."
"Clearly, to adopt the list without any strategic assessment of the environmental impact, profitability or practical safety of any of the 18 projects would be merely to rubber stamp it."
"The Commission is being called upon to rubber stamp the 18 projects submitted by the governments."
"I would like the Commission to know that, when Parliament is asked to give its opinion, it will refuse just to give its seal of approval or ratify them, not least because some of the proposals and demands of the Member States are nothing more than whims."
"One example, in particular, which we have discussed at length with Commissioner Van Miert, is the project to build a bridge over the Straits of Messina."
"There is clear, solid opposition to this bridge from all the local communities concerned."
"Its profitability is questionable, there are deep concerns as regards safety and, most importantly, the environmental impact would be terrible if we were to build a pylon taller than the Empire State Building on the outskirts of the city of Messina."
"In response to our objections and to the request for clarification which we put to Mr Van Miert, to find out what the exceptional grounds were for selecting this project, it was explained that the Italian Government had put forward strong arguments for it, to the effect that this bridge would save 5.5 million Sicilians from isolation."
"Madam President, as a Sicilian, I can tell you that this is not true."
"The isolation of the Sicilians is caused by the fact that getting from Palermo to Messina involves a five-hour train journey, not the fact that it is 20 minutes by ferry from Messina to Reggio Calabria."
"We have had to sideline another project - a genuinely key project - corridor 8, which would have made it possible to link southern Europe to the Balkan countries and would, moreover, have helped to confirm our particular consideration for the economic future of the Balkans, in line with the intentions of the Italian Presidency."
"With regard to all these considerations, I hope that Parliament will have the opportunity to return to the subject and to discuss it with representatives of the Commission and the Council here in flesh and blood."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you that we have achieved a great innovation."
"The first reading was at 23.33 on Tuesday evening, and it is now 21.02 on Wednesday evening, so I must say that we have made tremendous progress."
"As far as I know, this is the first time that we have had a second reading on Wednesday evening and then the voting on Thursday."
"In that sense, then, we have taken a step backwards."
"The use of public sector information is naturally a very important issue."
"We talk so often about the re-use of public sector information, saying 'it was agreed in Lisbon that the European Union should become 'the most competitive ? knowledge-based? society in the world'."
"Premiers go home afterwards with tears in their eyes because they have just said that."
"As soon as we get back to reality, however, we feel fierce anger, because what then lies ahead of us is an endless struggle."
"At the second reading, we had to deal with a Council common position containing a large number of comments which, it has to be said, did not have a great deal to do with the ambitious objectives agreed in Lisbon."
"To illustrate: one could say that auctions of third-generation frequencies, for example UMTS, have now fetched so much money for the Member States that they would say 'we are now prepared to make as much information as possible available free of charge'."
"The reverse is true."
"Public sector bodies simply want more money for the use of public sector information."
"My colleagues and I have had to fight extremely hard with the Council in order to take a step forwards on that point."
"I am very happy, therefore, that we have indeed been able to take that step."
"Nevertheless, we have to accept the fact that reality is far more difficult than we should like."
"Then, of course, there remains the point to which I am always referring."
"Imagine that you are an entrepreneur in a small SME in Italy."
"You are not, but imagine that you are."
"Imagine also that you want public sector information that you intend to re-use."
"You must imagine that scenario in a Union that is soon to have 25 Member States all having their own, unpublished, assets lists."
"You then have to contend with a situation in which you have to use a pink form in one case and a green one in the other; in language X in one case and language Y in the other - and you have to keep on top of all of this as an entrepreneur in a small SME."
"That is simply not possible."
"For this reason, I am also very pleased that we have finally been able to convince the Council, too, that there must be an assets list stating explicitly which public sector information is available for re-use and - if this can be done at all in these days of the Lisbon objectives - that it is also available on the Internet."
"We have managed to achieve this at the second reading, and I am extremely happy about that. We have also managed to tighten up the cost principles raised by the Council considerably and to make it clear that it is by no means always necessary to demand reimbursement of costs from citizens or enterprises that want to use public sector information."
"In some cases, however, for example where bodies are concerned which the government has privatised, and which themselves have financial commitments, there is no other way."
"However, express limits then have to be imposed on this. That point proved a very difficult one - including internally."
"We discussed it at great length, but, in my opinion, obtained a good result."
"The Council did not want to use the word 'information' - it only wanted to speak of 'document'."
"I asked the Council, therefore, whether it is a European document society that we have or a European information society."
"Of course, everyone saw the humour in that, and ultimately we did reach the compromise that we could keep the word 'information'; even though 'document' is used throughout the Directive."
"I should like to tell one final anecdote."
"We wanted a situation in which information follows promptly after submission of a request."
"In our enthusiasm, we said that this had to be within three weeks."
"We then spent approximately one hour squabbling with the Council as to whether that deadline should be three weeks or 20 working days."
"I was then convinced by the fact that working weeks are shorter than five days in some Member States."
"Some Member States have a lot more days' holiday than others."
"We finally changed it to 20 working days: this could mean three or four weeks in one Member State, and approximately five weeks in another, but there you have the multiformity of the European Union."
"Finally, I should like to thank my colleagues, in particular, for the confidence they have shown in me."
"I have been able to count on a great deal of support from Mrs Read and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel in my negotiations in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Thanks to them, and to the excellent cooperation with the European Commission, we have come through, and we can in any case present a result that I believe satisfies our minimum expectations."
"We are going to carry out an evaluation in three years' time, and I hope that the Council will then have progressed slightly, and that we are really going to take the Lisbon objectives very seriously."
"I should like to thank everyone for their confidence and for the help they have given me."
"Mr President, I wish to thank my colleague, Mr van Velzen, for his commendable work and his energy in the negotiations he had with representatives of the Council when drafting the compromise amendments."
"Furthermore, at the very start I also want to thank the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen for his expertise and contribution, which made it possible to bring this Directive into existence."
"I support the compromise proposals reached by the rapporteur in conjunction with the Council, because that way we would be spared the laborious and always risky Conciliation Committee debate."
"The European Parliament wants the Member States to implement this directive swiftly, as, when they do, its benefits for the public and business will be indisputable."
"Genuine free mobility in Europe will not come about until its citizens and companies have clear ideas about what documents are available where and at what cost."
"Harmonisation is needed in this area too."
"The compromise amendments take a stand on inter alia the availability of public documents, where possible through electronic means."
"I agree with Mr van Velzen that it would be a lot more logical and realistic to speak about public information rather than documents."
"Not all documents are printed exclusively on paper anymore."
"Various electronic publishing formats are rapidly becoming more common and records are being kept in electronic format more than before."
"It is very important that the public sector sets a good example as we journey towards the information society."
"Many public documents consist par excellence of that intelligent and meaningful content which is so much spoken about, especially in connection with wireless services."
"The various forms have to be available on the Internet."
"Users will therefore definitely come along for different applications, for 3G, 4G or 5G, when there is meaningful content."
"I, at least, can no longer get enthusiastic about ordering merely amusing images for my cell phone."
"Another controversial issue has been how much public agencies can charge for their services, or whether they can demand money at all."
"Right from the outset I have promoted the policy whereby public documents are of universal use and belong to everyone."
"Agencies and institutions paid for out of taxes are obliged to do the job they were originally set up to do, which is to provide a service for those who own and finance them, the taxpayers."
"For basic services, materials and data, however, specialist organisations must be able to recover their costs and make a reasonable charge."
"The question of whether a charge should be made takes on a new aspect when we start talking about customised services produced for individual customers or, in this case, ordinary citizens."
"These are typical chargeable services, for which the public sector also has to be able to demand payment."
"A customised service could include design and preparation work to produce a map, for example, perhaps for a car orienteering competition, as the Commissioner mentioned."
"Compiling basic data the way an individual customer wants it, the compilation of statistics for example, is a customised service."
"In such a case it is only reasonable that the official body undertaking the specialist work should charge for services rendered in accordance with normal market economy legislation."
"The upkeep of specialist organisation know-how, development work and developing new technology must be made possible out of revenue either on taxes or these chargeable services - customised tasks."
"In many Member States many kinds of specialist know-how are in the hands of public institutions, for historical or cultural reasons, for example."
"A final word: this is an area which will take us on towards the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"In which year that will happen none of us know, but this is one small step in that direction."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, who has worked so hard and with his customary thoroughness to get us to the stage of this compromise."
"I particularly want to draw attention to some things that are in the compromise and some things that, quite properly, are no longer there."
"Firstly, I draw attention to the special needs of the trading bodies that apply particularly in the United Kingdom, such as the Meteorological Office, the Ordnance Survey and the British Geological Survey, which, unless they had been protected with the ability to get a reasonable return on investment, would have had their own work and their own positions seriously jeopardised."
"I am grateful to the rapporteur for the way in which he has accommodated this."
"Secondly, the cost calculation method is included in the criteria."
"That is important for all sorts of people and organisations which, we hope, will make use of the ability to re-use public sector documents."
"It is right that libraries, museums, universities and other archives, which would have been covered in the original proposal, are now excluded from the directive."
"Once we all realised what a serious disadvantage they would have, there was an agreement that such a proposal should no longer be included."
"When I took over as shadow rapporteur on this report, I did it with little knowledge of how interesting it would be and how, very soon, it would become apparent that the re-use of public sector documents would prove to be such an important economic motor."
"We can see the limited re-use which currently exists, how it can be extended and how important it is going to be, as the previous speaker said, in the Lisbon conclusions."
"I want to draw attention to just one other thing, namely the review of this directive, in which I hope this Parliament will be involved in future."
"One of the things that rightly concerns many of us is the extent to which this directive would encourage cross-border re-use."
"If we discover in our review period, when the Commission does this, that cross-border re-use has either not happened or been very limited, then we might well have to revisit some of the elements in this particular proposal."
"Otherwise, I commend to you Mr van Velzen's work and the compromise for which my group will happily vote."
"We look forward in the future to seeing how the fruits of this work are going to bring immediate benefits - long-term benefits, employment benefits and business benefits - to the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, of course, wish to compliment my colleague Mr van Velzen on his diligence as a rapporteur."
"He has extracted the best out of the situation."
"Every citizen in Europe has the right of access to information collected and stored by the public sector."
"Indeed, transparency on the part of the public sector is a good thing for democracy, and democracy comes free of charge in Europe."
"In addition, public sector information has significant economic potential."
"The Directive should lead to the emergence of an active trade in public sector information in the European Union, as in the United States."
"There is enormous unexplored potential, which could create a large number of jobs if exploited commercially, particularly via SMEs: small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I envisage a central role for the public sector here in giving impetus to a new market."
"The Commission presented an ambitious proposal; but a number of Member States evidently have little interest in it."
"They have toned it down so much that we are left with the question whether the single market in public sector information will function in the longer term, let alone the short term."
"It has become clear that Member States are not prepared to make public sector information available free of charge, despite constantly making a great song and dance about eEurope and an information society for all."
"Fine words."
"We have to follow things through."
"For information to be generally accessible, it goes without saying that the marginal costs of reproduction and distribution can be passed on."
"Now, however, it is permissible to increase the costs by 'a reasonable' profit margin."
"That is undesirable, as it creates unlimited possibilities for the authorities to make a profit: after all, who decides what is 'reasonable'?"
"The proposal again talks about public sector documents instead of public sector information."
"This means that there is no guarantee that information reproduced electronically is also covered by the definition."
"Thus, public sector bodies are tempted to limit accessibility to printed documents."
"Straightforward access to public sector information, preferably via the Internet, reduces the distance between the European authorities and the citizen."
"The public sector should be encouraged to make as many documents as possible available to citizens electronically, therefore."
"That is a crucial precondition for the creation of eEurope: an information society for all."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like, at this late hour, most particularly to thank my colleague, Mr van Velzen, for the work he has done as rapporteur."
"In the manner we have come to expect of him on the basis of many other such tasks, he has, at second reading too, been very committed and successfully thrown himself into getting his report adopted."
"Until literally the last minute, he has been fine-tuning the compromises in collaboration with the Council."
"In common, I am sure, with the majority of this House and of my political group, I share the view that public information should be made generally accessible in the interests of everyone involved."
"With the approval of the present directive, we are taking a sound and sensible step in this direction."
"The authorities in the Member States have vast amounts of information available, accumulated over long periods of time."
"People and companies ought to benefit from this wealth of information."
"General access to public information is capable of releasing important impulses for growth, competitiveness and employment within the European Union."
"With the help of public sector documents, new services and benefits may be generated in the IT sphere."
"In my opinion, the documents assembled by the administrations are, in any case, being made accessible by this Directive only in a very moderate way."
"The authorities therefore also have the time required to adjust to the new conditions."
"The Council and Parliament have taken account of the corresponding reservations from first reading."
"Let us not forget, in this connection, that differences still exist in the national traditions of administration and have to be taken into account."
"In those cases in which the Member States allow the publication of public sector documents, the directive now provides uniform ground rules on a Europe-wide basis."
"I should like here only to go into a few areas that should be particularly emphasised."
"Specific sensitive areas such as research, the arts and documents containing commercial secrets are rightly excluded from the scope of the directive."
"These exemption regulations guarantee that the directive will not infringe the rights of third parties."
"When funds are scarce, authorities should also, in my view, definitely be entitled to demand fees for making information available, as well as a suitable profit margin."
"Let us not forget that many authorities are, in part, self-financing."
"Moreover, the business of, for example, gathering, updating and looking after up-to-the-minute data also costs money."
"It is important, however, to maintain a suitable balance."
"The costs must not, of course, give rise to any excessive barriers to the re-use of documents, and I think that the directive now also makes this clear."
"Of extraordinary importance to the success of the directive is the preparation of central lists, providing people and companies with rapid overviews of the available documents."
"This, of course, is where, especially, use of the Internet comes in."
"If a particular authority no longer makes documents available or no longer updates them, its decision not to do so should be published as soon as possible."
"This would give those affected a bigger safety margin in terms of planning."
"The long fought-for cross-border use of public documents is to be welcomed."
"Let us not, however, overlook the existing language barriers that make such use more difficult."
"It would, in my view, be completely counter-productive to impose translation obligations upon the Member States in the long term."
"Let us protect ourselves against tendencies of that kind."
"Finally, I have to state that this directive constitutes an appropriate and well-balanced approach that takes account of people's and companies' interests, without however ignoring the national traditions of administration."
"Let us therefore vote tomorrow in favour of accepting the directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr van Velzen has again worked skilfully. He does so smoothly and shrewdly and the results just pour out."
"I wish to thank him for that."
"There are many kinds of information, and public information is one."
"Administrative data must obviously be free of charge to the public and it has to be obtainable from one place, or portal."
"As far as the business world is concerned, it will obviously pay for renewal to be possible at the point where information is created, thus getting a return on investment."
"This is an important area."
"It is estimated that public sector information is worth in the region of EUR 70 billion a year and the content industry employs about four million people in the European Union."
"That is a lot."
"This market is worth more than EUR 400 billion."
"Even the value of the mobile communications industry is set to rise in the near future to around EUR 20 million in terms of its content, and that is content on a relatively tiny scale."
"Knowledge and information are the most important factors in a democracy and an economy."
"The fact that we are saturated with information separates us from the less well-off."
"It is a security factor and an instrument of war."
"'Information poverty' hits the same people as social poverty."
"Would the chance of a little charity not help?"
"After all, information does not shrink at the point from which it is distributed to others, no matter how much of it is shared."
"I would furthermore like to ask the Commissioner whether this could not be one new element in our development assistance programme: the sharing of information and knowledge, because we will not have any less of it even if we share it with others."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0269/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on adopting a multi-annual programme (2003-2005) for the monitoring of the eEurope 2005 Action plan, dissemination of good practices and the improvement of network and information security (MODINIS) [7948/1/2003 - C5-0252/2003 - 2002/0187(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Imelda Mary Read)."
". Mr President, I will not need five minutes, which is not an indication of the importance of this report - quite the reverse."
"The MODINIS programme aims to create a legal base for the continuation of activities for monitoring the eEurope plan from 2003 to 2005 and for the dissemination of best practices."
"It also allows for the launch of preparatory actions for the development of a European policy in the area of network and information security."
"To indicate the sort of actions that are going to be financed in order to reach the goals set out in the programme, it covers things such as data collection, a revised set of benchmark indicators, studies to identify good practices in Europe, workshops and studies, looking in particular at the adjustment of industry to the structural change generated by digital technologies and the transformation of society."
"One interesting activity which is of particular value is the support of the Information Society Forum, consisting of web-based experts and looking at challenges facing the development of the information society and, of course, the normal programme of targeted conferences, seminars and workshops."
"There are many others."
"The question for our second reading is: how is this to be financed?"
"Because the dates are crucial."
"The work is to cover the years 2003 to 2005, and we are already well into 2003."
"The original European Parliament proposal for the budget was EUR 25 million and the dilemma I faced was how to reach some sort of compromise that was not delayed so long that it would prevent the money reaching its necessary targets."
"After some discussion with both the Commission and the Council, I have proposed a compromise of EUR 21 million, remembering that this figure will be adjusted in the event of enlargement."
"This is a good basis for a compromise and I think that colleagues from all sides of the House will support this compromise budget provision."
"When we do that, it will enable the MODINIS programme, which is very carefully and tightly focused on achievable objectives, to help us reach the Lisbon goals."
"I commend both the amendments and the report to you."
"Mr President, as Mrs Read has said, the MODINIS programme plays a central role in the implementation of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan."
"The information society policies in the EU have three pillars."
"The first pillar is the regulatory framework."
"This Parliament has contributed to the adoption of this regulatory framework which entered into force last summer."
"The objective of this framework is to create a pro-competitive marketplace so that different technological platforms will compete with and complement each other in Europe, offering high-quality services at an affordable price to everybody."
"That is the first pillar."
"The second pillar is then the IST programme - the Information Society Technology programme, whose task is to guarantee that we will have state-of-the-art technologies and applications available in Europe."
"That is the very important second pillar."
"The third pillar is the one which binds these two together."
"That is the eEurope 2005 Action Plan by which we try to disseminate best practice throughout Europe."
"This year we have had very successful efforts, especially in the field of e-government and e-health, with two ministerial conferences, in which Members of the European Parliament participated."
"Our Member States and regions are moving from a pure technology focus to solutions, looking at how technology can facilitate higher-quality public services, higher productivity and better tailor-made services."
"MODINIS is the financial instrument to monitor, benchmark and disseminate these best practices."
"It will be important to assess whether national or European initiatives, taking place in the framework of the eEurope Action Plan, are producing the expected results."
"The role of MODINIS will also be to finance preparatory actions in the area of network security, such as awareness-raising actions of Members States and analysis of security risks."
"We - all three institutions - are working on the proposed regulation setting up a European Network and Information Security Agency, and we will have the opportunity to come back to this issue in one of the next part-sessions."
"Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Read, and the European Parliament for its support on this topic, as is illustrated in the budgetary amendment to the proposal."
"I can confirm that the Commission can accept the amendment."
"Consequently, the whole legislative process could be speeded up by facilitating a second reading agreement."
"This would further allow the prompt implementation of the MODINIS programme."
"I look forward to continued cooperation on the implementation of this programme, as has been the case in the past."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish also to thank Mrs Read for a brilliant report which we are able fully to support."
"This is a very important area we are here moving into, as Mrs Read's report also clearly shows."
"Modern society is completely dependent upon our having efficient procedures, well-educated populations, proper security and people who are able to understand how to use the services on offer."
"I think that, as previously mentioned in connection with Mr van Velzen's report, we must, in monitoring progress, also look at what things cost and how cheaply they can be made."
"There are no doubt public sector services within, for example, the spheres of tax and of company registration where it is not perhaps sensible to demand payment, in so far as people themselves answer the questions by using the Internet and keying in their own data. In that way, we should save on the number of public employees, of whom we shall have a shortage in the period ahead of us."
"In Denmark, we have benefited a lot precisely out of getting people to, for example, key in their own tax data using the Internet or push-button telephones."
"It does not cost a penny, and it saves the public sector enormous resources in terms of staff."
"It would also be worthwhile monitoring how we deal with the wireless sector."
"What results would we achieve, and what distribution would we have?"
"In particular, what price are we to pay?"
"In my country, the standard connection to private homes is, in any case, two megabits."
"In Japan, it is eight megabits and, insofar as I have understood correctly, at a very much lower price than we pay."
"We must ask ourselves how we can ensure that the prices we pay, whether in relation to private households or businesses, are not so high as to prevent us from being competitive in relation to the rest of the world."
"This aspect of the monitoring is also, therefore, extremely important."
"Another thing we must also monitor is the use of the teaching material being developed. If we look at use of the Internet and computers today, the development of hardware and high-speed networks may be reasons for their fairly widespread use."
"A still more significant development is, however, the highly teaching-oriented software systems that have come onto the scene. It is therefore worthwhile tracing the development whereby, for example, elderly people can very easily make use of these opportunities."
"Perhaps we should also look for a moment at the early part of children's development and consider the ways in which we monitor how quickly they find their feet."
"I come from a small language area and am therefore able to state that getting computers used depends to a certain extent upon how rapidly our children in the small language areas learn to speak English. That is because all instruction etc. in computing first takes place in English."
"A lot of material is not translated into the small languages, but it is necessary to become familiar with it if there is to be early use of computers and a situation achieved in which the new teaching methods are used in the education system, enabling much more to be learned much faster than has been the case in the past."
"In conclusion, I want finally to say how impressive it is that, within the areas concerned, we have seen quite a few countries combine in making large joint purchases in order to bring the prices down."
"This is something with which we are familiar from the defence area, and it would also be only natural if we were to benefit from such advantages within the administrative areas."
"This state of affairs must no doubt also be part of what the monitoring addresses."
"I wish once again to thank Mrs Read for a brilliant report and for her constructive cooperation, and I wish to thank Commissioner Liikanen for the support he has given to Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0298/2003) by Mr Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on public access to Parliament, Council and Commission documents (implementation of Regulation 1049/2001/EC in the year 2002) [2003/2022(INI)]."
". Mr President, I wish to begin, unusually, by congratulating the institutions and all those who work within the institutions."
"It has become somewhat fashionable to attack the European Union project and its institutions."
"However, I want to pay a sincere tribute to those who work in the institutions and have made the registers and access to documents a reality."
"Today I looked at a briefing from an NGO which said that it was weary of congratulating institutions."
"That mystifies me absolutely."
"We need to congratulate where there is good work, and encourage good practice to spread across every department, DG and institution."
"Before I make some pertinent comments on the report, I want to pay tribute to my colleague, Mrs Maij-Weggen, who leaves this House this month."
"I have worked very closely with her on this report from its very beginning when we were working on Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, and without her contribution we would not have this outstanding regulation."
"Let me begin with some items in my report."
"I do not intend to use my full five minutes."
"As a rapporteur, it is important to listen - something politicians are often accused of not doing!"
"Let me raise some issues that need highlighting."
"We need to have greater and more succinct information on how our citizens can access this right to the information contained within the documents."
"We need common coding amongst the institutions so that the process of accessing information is simplified."
"In relation to the Commission at least, which has a number of registers, I would also welcome the establishment of a single register, even if it is only a single doorway into the other registers."
"We have yet again to reinforce the notion that we are making ourselves accessible to citizens, who may not know about this right or how to access it."
"I also want to talk about the case of exemptions."
"I wish to reinforce that there are no blanket exemptions on access to documents."
"Every request must be considered on a case-by-case basis."
"There have been some criticisms about the blanket refusal to give access to legal opinions."
"Where they fall within the legislative process there should not be a refusal, and, again, every request must be on a case-by-case basis."
"The European Parliament's committees - even the non-legislative committees - must apply the principle of transparency and at present the standard of transparency is not uniform from one committee to another."
"There are a number of sensitive documents which have not been registered with the institutions."
"This needs to be reviewed."
"I welcome Mrs Maij-Weggen's opinion and recommendations and, in particular, her view that the European Ombudsman should give an assessment of the regulation: how it is working and how the exemptions are applied."
"We need a common methodology to be applied by each of the institutions and the agencies - we must not forget that the agencies and organisations set up by the institutions must apply the regulation."
"They should use a common approach in assessing their annual reports, and then comparison will become fruitful and productive."
"Everything I have said may imply that there is much to do."
"Of course there is, because we aspire within the European Union to perhaps defy our critics, to prove them wrong, to connect with our citizens and to prove that the European Union project is one that we should be proud of and should celebrate."
"We have not got it right."
"Sadly, perfection often eludes us in human endeavours, whether by politicians or anyone else."
"However, our commitment to try is there within Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and in the spirit of those people who have worked to make access a reality."
". (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Cashman for his work and congratulate him on his detailed report on the issue we are debating today, namely transparency."
"All three of our institutions are firmly committed to transparency and are determined to honour that commitment."
"I am grateful for this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Commission and provide more detail on some of the key points raised by Mr Cashman."
"Mr Cashman stated considerable progress had been made, and that this should be recognised."
"I agree with him."
"Our annual report has recently been released, and presents a fairly detailed overview of the situation."
"I also agree with Mr Cashman that there is scope for further improvements and that such improvements must be effected."
"In addition, case law is facilitating the interpretation of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"Consequently, the use of this important tool facilitating transparency will improve, and democracy will therefore be strengthened."
"In this connection and by way of example, I should like to refer to the decisions handed down by the Court of Justice at Luxembourg concerning the non-disclosure of legal opinions."
"The decisions of the Court confirm our practice, which recognises the institutions' need to preserve the independence of such legal rulings."
"In other words, time for reflection is needed."
"Clearly, therefore, progress is being made."
"According to this report, a further step towards the aim of maximum transparency should be the creation of a single register of documents to replace the current registers."
"Nonetheless, if what we are about is making it easier for the citizens to search for and identify documents, the crucial factor is not the choice between one or several registers."
"Rather, it is a point of entry to a unified portal, where clear information is given as to which documents are contained in each register. Mr Cashman rightly pointed this out."
"In any case, further consideration must be given to the technical solutions that will enable us to move towards better integration of these instruments in the future."
"I should also like to refer to the significant progress made with regard to the number of documents directly accessible."
"By way of example I could mention the Commission's agendas and the minutes of our meetings."
"It goes without saying that it is our intention to strengthen this approach and develop it further."
"For instance, between now and the end of the year the register of documents concerning comitology will become accessible to the public."
"Further, the practice regarding access to documents concerning infringement procedures has been updated. This was another of the criticisms made by Mr Cashman."
"Now, when proceedings are completed, the assumption is that such documents may be released."
"In this connection, it should be borne in mind that Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 provides protection where it is required, namely for investigations conducted under such procedures."
"In this way, for ongoing, unfinished cases a balance is struck regarding the aforementioned assumption on non-disclosure."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out that the Commission has never refused access to documents without providing suitable justification for its decision. The Commission always invokes Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"Quite simply, the unspecified exceptions referred to in our annual report relate to cases in which access to documents was refused on the basis of a number of the exceptions provided for in the regulation, not on a single one of these."
"It was therefore impossible to be specific."
"Such refusals amount to 12% of the refusals to provide information. In other words, they amount to 38% of 30% of the refusals."
"I would like to thank Mr Cashman for his recommendations on how to improve transparency still further."
"His suggestions are useful for all the institutions, and due account will be taken of them."
"We shall consider possible improvements to allow better integration of instruments for archiving and identifying documents."
"We shall also take up Mr Cashman's suggestion and consider a common methodology for the drafting of annual reports."
"This would facilitate comparisons."
"Mr Cashman's suggestions concerning the evaluation report, due to be presented by the Commission early in 2004 will also be borne in mind."
"The three institutions dealt with all these issues yesterday, at a truly productive and fruitful meeting."
"Some problems remain."
"We have reservations concerning the possible creation of a directive harmonising national legislation in this field, as mentioned by Mr Cashman in his report."
"There is no appropriate legal basis for such a step."
"I am aware that Mr Cashman himself appreciates the difficulties and shares our misgivings. Mr Cashman made this clear at our meeting yesterday."
"In the light of all this, I truly believe that the assessment of a year of implementing Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 has to be very positive. The rapporteur indicated as much."
"Of course, this should not be an excuse for complacency."
"On the contrary, it should encourage the introduction of further improvements to the initiatives and measures adopted."
"All is not perfect, but I do believe it is fair to state that things are going well."
"It should be emphasised that this is an important instrument of transparency."
"It grants clear and unequivocal rights to the citizens of the Union."
"It is worth highlighting, however, that as far as the Commission is concerned this instrument has been used mainly by law professionals. In particular, it has been used by law firms."
"What this suggests is that, generally, the citizens tend to use conventional methods of obtaining good quality, clear, precise and relevant information on activities undertaken by the institutions. They favour this approach, rather than consulting specific documents."
"It is also true, however, that universities and non-governmental organisations, for example, have made considerable use of this facility."
"This is an area closely linked to transparency. We must maintain our efforts to ensure continued improvement of the information made available by the institutions on their activities."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen is leaving the House. I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for the excellent work she has undertaken over the years."
"She has striven to ensure transparency and to improve the quality of the information available to our citizens. In so doing, she has helped to promote effective democracy."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my thanks for the excellent report by my colleague Mr Cashman, and also for the positive commentary by Commissioner de Palacio."
"Mr Cashman and I have worked together on openness a great deal in recent years."
"That cooperation has always been very positive, very constructive and productive, and that way you start to become good friends too."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs made a number of comments on the first assessment by the Council, the Commission and Parliament regarding the implementation of the Regulation in its first year."
"We observed that the number of requests for access to documents that were refused by the Council and the Commission is still too large to be readily acceptable."
"In fact, we should like to see another assessment of the situation by the European Ombudsman for 2004, so that it can be ascertained where further improvements can be made with regard to Article 4, for example, in order to bring about an even greater access to documents; including in the Council, in particular."
"An important point regarding the Council is that it differentiates between documents of Member States acting, on the one hand, in their capacity as Council members and, on the other hand, as individual Member States."
"That leads to unequal treatment, with significant restrictions regarding documents of Member States who themselves hardly have any legislation on openness."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the most appropriate solution is to ask the Member States to adopt open government, too; the Commission would have to submit a directive on this."
"That is the appeal we make to the Commission: to see whether it can submit a directive that ensures that open government is the same in all the Member States."
"That would be a good thing for the citizens of those Member States, and also for the citizens who call on EU documents, because it would mean that they had equal access whether they requested them from Sweden, Greece or Portugal."
"That was my last intervention here in Parliament: I should like to thank Mrs de Palacio, and I should also like to thank the Presidency for its kind words earlier today."
"If I may, Mrs Maij-Weggen, I would like, together with the Members, to thank you for your work in the European Parliament over the past few years."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Cashman on his report. I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Cashman's sustained efforts to promote transparency and access to documents."
"I have had the opportunity of working with him and serving as rapporteur for the group for other reports regarding access to historical archives. Throughout, Mr Cashman has always impressed me with his great commitment to these issues."
"I must also join with previous speakers in congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen and commending her on the example she has set."
"A few minutes ago she was taking her leave of us outside the Chamber. Nonetheless, she is working to the very end of her time as a Member of the European Parliament, and is back on the floor of the House speaking on a serious issue, namely access to historical archives."
"I offer her my congratulations. Further, I am grateful to her for serving as a role model for a young politician like myself."
"All of us working for Community institutions are concerned about access to information. We are also concerned about the image Europe presents to its citizens."
"We tend to be criticised for being distant."
"We also receive complaints that Community institutions are hard to understand."
"In my view, facilitating access to documents is the best way to bring Europe closer to its citizens and enable those citizens to understand us better."
"I believe a suitable policy on public access to documents will prove a vital tool in bringing the institutions closer to all the citizens."
"The citizens need to be convinced of the transparency and efficiency of our institutions and even that they actually serve a purpose."
"As politicians, it is our duty to keep the citizens informed. Further, as European politicians, it is our duty to require the institutions to be as transparent and accessible as possible."
"The rapporteur congratulated the Community institutions on their recent progress regarding access to documents, and on putting in place the technology required to facilitate access to information for the citizens. I would like to add my voice to his."
"It is true that much remains to be done. It is also true that our group endorses many of the complaints referred to by Mr Cashman in his report."
"There is certainly a good deal of work outstanding."
"Nonetheless, it is important to strike a balance between efficiency in transparency and access to that information on the one hand, and the potential cost of such measures on the other."
"Allow me to mention an example of a measure I find too expensive."
"A number of colleagues on the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs asked for video recordings to be made of many parliamentary sittings and committee meetings, and for the recordings to be accessible through the Internet."
"The cost of this cannot be justified at present, though it might be in the future."
"I agree with those who advocate that the measures adopted should include the simplification, codification and unification of the registers of the three institutions."
"I shall now turn to what is perhaps the most controversial point mentioned by the Commissioner, Mrs Maij-Weggen and by the rapporteur himself."
"It relates to access to Member States' documents when the latter are acting as individual Member States and not in their capacity as Council members."
"Mr Cashman's initial proposal is indeed too ambitious."
"It is not possible to go that far."
"Nonetheless, it would be appropriate to draw up some kind of proposal requesting Member States to be just as transparent as Community institutions."
"The citizens would not understand why a Community document should be easier to access than one originating from their Member State."
"Consequently, we shall support Mr Cashman's amendment to his own report tomorrow. I refer to the amendment deleting a few words from section 16 of the report, in the interests of clarity."
"This is all thanks to Mrs Maij-Weggen's proposal in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Mr President, my colleague Mr Cashman has once again had his reputation of being a good chess player put to the test, and his strategy of being perfectly amiable may indeed be the one that in fact leads to success."
"I personally incline more to the 'aggressive journalist' tendency, and, in my professional life, have found, rather, that you only get anywhere by going straight to the point and really piling on the pressure."
"In terms of their content, the points have already been explained by Mrs Maij-Weggen, who has once again gone into a lot of detail, this time in listing the information she possesses about who refuses access to documents - too little information on her part in the case of 'who' - where and when this has happened, and about who is requesting such access."
"Because we are almost experiencing something of a mood of celebration in the House, not least as we mark Mrs Maij-Weggen's departure, we have also been thinking quite constructively in saying: please, Commissioner - and this applies still more to the Council - do not imagine that it is out of any lack of interest that so few journalists try to gain access to documents."
"Journalists have come to believe that they might as well be looking for needles in haystacks as trying to find the documentation they need."
"According to yesterday's Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, 'Nothing is more exciting to the public than what is supposedly not there'. Whereupon, the information enters the public realm through other routes and becomes, sometimes justifiably and sometimes completely unjustifiably, the subject of scandal."
"Might it not be an idea - and one that you could take on board today - perhaps to take the trouble to visit amazon.de or amazon.com?"
"The way it works is that, even if you have something and nothing in the way of information - just a clue as to a book's title or an author's name - you arrive at the relevant page and are immediately told: 'Customers who bought this book also bought ?'"
"With amazon you can go on to make and accumulate purchases, so it might be imagined that, in the case of the European Commission, documents in use might immediately be traceable."
"They are really very well managed, to the point of being childproof, youthproof and, if you like, with a guaranteed future."
"I therefore believe that a standardised portal along amazon lines - partly, but not exclusively, computer-driven and greeting people with the words, 'Hello, you are now at our Brussels premises."
"What do you need? How can we help you?' - would really help matters along, enabling a lot of what we are constantly talking about in this House to be achieved."
"The debate in progress today is, in many ways, reminiscent of the developments surrounding the Freedom of Information Act in the late sixties or early seventies."
"I personally remain an adherent of the principle that someone actually needs to have only an idea that something might be there and does not need to make a specific enquiry."
"That is something which still has to come about, and that is what the revision next year is for."
"This is something one can look forward to with some optimism if one hears as many good intentions as we have heard today."
"Mr President, I, too, wish to compliment my colleague Mr Cashman, in particular, and echo his tribute to Mrs Maij-Weggen."
"Progress has definitely been made."
"More and more documents have been put in the public domain."
"The question is, however, whether citizens can find them."
"Guaranteeing access is not sufficient."
"Accessibility is also chiefly to do with a clear structuring of the data."
"In this connection, Mr Cashman has called for Community codes and a register."
"I think that that is a good idea."
"Accessibility of data is an outstanding means of remedying the negative image of the European Union as remote and bureaucratic."
"In addition, openness and accessibility of data are an important key to democratisation."
"This morning, we voted on the McCarthy report."
"That is an example of tremendous citizens' participation in legislation."
"Citizens must be able to familiarise themselves with the early stage of legislation in order that they may influence it."
"The computer is an incredibly effective means of involving citizens in this."
"On a personal note, I was absent from Parliament for three years, and was able to retrieve a large amount of the data I wanted by computer."
"However, I also frequently ran aground in the soup of links, and ended up empty-handed."
"I think that a good deal more must be done in that regard."
"The computer also represents an environmentally friendly and paper-saving way of working."
"I think, therefore, Commissioner, that we have to set to work in particular on extremely user-friendly computer programs."
"In my opinion, there is still room for improvement there."
"It is a crying shame, however, that the European Council, in particular, is defaulting."
"Countless complaints arrive at our door, especially in the fields of justice and foreign affairs."
"Nor does the lack of clarity over which Member State does what square with openness, or with the new Constitution, which extends obligations to all the institutions and agencies."
"I think that the proposal on this issue was one of the last in a series of good ones by Mrs Maij-Weggen, and I shall gladly support it."
"Mr President, I too want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, and his co-rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen on their assiduous work on considerably improving this regulation, increasing transparency and facilitating people's access to the institutions' documents."
"The result of the review carried out in 2001 is encouraging."
"Clear progress has been made, and the trend is towards a more open attitude which will hopefully also lead to people making better use of their rights."
"Mr Cashman's report clearly shows, however, that there is still a very great deal to be done and that there are still serious deficiencies."
"One such serious deficiency is that, when electronic systems are created, this is in the form of more than one system instead of a uniform system."
"I am grateful that Commissioner de Palacio emphasised this, together with the fact that a uniform and coordinated electronic case handling system is needed, whereby cases might be monitored throughout the whole process."
"Otherwise, it will be impossible for people to acquaint themselves with such a process."
"The Council seems, however, consistently to interpret Article 4 of the Regulation too restrictively, that is to say where general security is concerned."
"Something must be done about this as soon as possible."
"In Amendment No 2, we have proposed a change to paragraph 4 in order genuinely to bring this about."
"Paragraph 16, which talks about a harmonisation of the legislation on open government in the Member States' administrations, worries me a little."
"I do not believe that we would in that way obtain increased openness and greater access to documents. I propose, instead, that you vote in favour of Amendment No 3 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Cashman both for his excellent report and for succeeding in bringing to plenary an extremely important report containing essential provisions with almost unanimous support."
"In my view, over and above the democratic deficit which we all condemn, this debate reveals the existence of a discrepancy between what it is possible to achieve and what is necessary."
"I fully agreed with the first part of Mr Oreja Arburúa's speech, but then he appeared to take a step backwards regarding the need to make committee debates public too, which are much more like proper debates than the debates in the Chamber and are certainly much more of a political exercise."
"Transparency and access to documents are not just a slogan - they mean, first and foremost, democratic control on the part of the citizens."
"If we look now at the possibilities for democratic control of the institutions' work, we see that they are extremely limited."
"In the context of major policies - justice, home affairs, foreign policy, defence - the European Parliament is, as a general rule, merely consulted."
"The national parliaments are informed, the Court of Justice has limited powers and, lastly, of course, the citizens benefit from direct access to documents."
"For example - as has been pointed out - there is no justification for banning the disclosure of which Member State has tabled a particular proposal in the Council or of how it voted."
"We see this as a serious violation of the citizens' civil and political rights."
"The citizens, like we members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, are being denied the right to know what their governments are doing and to express an opinion. Thus, democracy is being prevented from working as it should."
"Moreover, it was the European Ombudsman who noted, in one of his special reports to Parliament, that it makes no sense to keep legal opinions secret when they are not like communications between lawyers and clients."
"I fail to understand why this step towards greater transparency is so feared by the institutions' legal services and is, likewise, concealed by politicians."
"Another positive aspect of the report is the criticism levelled at the Commission for bowing to Member States' refusal to allow citizens access to their correspondence with the Commission in the context of infringement proceedings, whereas, in our opinion, the same regulation gives the Commission a facility to take independent decisions which it is refusing to use."
"Our fear is that, in this way, the Commission is covering up the misdeeds of the Member States and, in so doing, acting unlawfully itself."
"I believe, for instance, that, concerning what happened with regard to the requests for access to Spain and Portugal's correspondence on the infringement proceedings which the Commission intended to instigate against these countries for violation of a taxation directive - given that the Catholic Church is exempt from paying VAT - there is no reason for the public not to know the grounds on which the two States convinced the Commission to file the case despite the fact that genuine infringement had clearly occurred."
"I feel that we need to look at practical cases in order to see what is necessary, not just what is possible, in this attempt to reconcile genuine needs and make good the democratic deficit."
"Mr President, nothing could be more apposite than what is happening this evening."
"A few rooms away from us, fellow MEPs are sitting reading the reports on what has happened in Eurostat, but they have been gagged."
"As a sincere Europhile, it pains me every time I come across this culture of secrecy."
"Why do so many people within the EU institutions continue to believe that it is acceptable to carry on public activities without total and comprehensive public scrutiny?"
"An exhortation to the Commission: do not let the Eurostat scandal sully the good work you have done during the historic years when Europe was being reunited."
"I want to thank Mr Cashman for his report and the excellent work he has done in order to open up the EU and its institutions."
"I should like to make a few brief comments. It is true that a lot has obviously improved, but that is not enough."
"We are not here to stand around hugging one another."
"The rules on transparency should apply to all the institutions, including, for example, the ECB and Eurostat."
"It is worrying that the Council has begun to discover its own methods of classifying documents as strictly secret."
"Simpler and more comprehensive registers are needed."
"The Commission should have one register, not several."
"All documents must be registered, something that does not happen at present."
"The number of refusals of requests for documents has increased."
"That is a completely wrong road to go down and is not in the right spirit."
"Openness must be the rule rather than the exception."
"It is important for the culture of openness to be established before enlargement."
"With this in view, the staff of the EU institutions need to be educated about the regulation and convinced of the advantages of openness."
"Finally, the report should have shed more light upon Parliament's deficiencies."
"We need to improve in this institution too."
"Thank you, Mr Cashman, openness is emphatically democracy's best defence."
"I welcome their comments on this our common endeavour. Actually, we are working together in order to provide a better service for the citizens and to ensure democracy is exercised in a more responsible manner by all those involved."
"I endorse the Vice-President's statement."
"We have engineered a revolution."
"The Vice-President provided most of the leadership in this field in the course of her parliamentary duties."
"Today, we are debating the Cashman report."
"Yesterday, internal discussions were held between the three institutions to consider the progress achieved."
"The Cashman report is certainly helpful in identifying areas where there is scope for improvement."
"We have indeed accomplished a great deal, but we should set our sights still higher."
"I expressed my views at yesterday's meeting, but I believe it is appropriate to reiterate them before the House today."
"Commission records refer to the refusal of 30% of requests for information. It should be stated that the Commission only records requests requiring implementation of Regulation EC No 1049/2001."
"By contrast, Parliament records all requests. If the Commission recorded all direct consultation of information available to citizens where recourse to Regulation EC No 1049/2001 is not required, the percentage of requests refused would be minimal."
"As stated in the Cashman report, it is very important for us to agree on the methodology for recording results. It may prove appropriate for all requests for information to be recorded."
"If that were done, the Commission would appear outstandingly successful in making information available to the citizen, as I said earlier."
"Well over 90% of requests received positive responses."
"We have provided information only on the number of requests for information coming under Regulation EC No 1049/2001 that it was necessary to refuse."
"In each case, individual reasons and justification were provided, with reference to the provisions of the regulation in question."
"No information was provided for other requests."
"Clearly, the process needs to be improved."
"A better quality of service is needed, as the Cashman report rightly points out."
"This too was discussed at yesterday's meeting with the Vice-President."
"All three institutions must adopt a common approach when responding to requests for information and invoking exceptions."
"Yesterday's discussion should prove most helpful in this regard."
"We are to research and assess the feasibility of actually running a joint training programme for officials, especially regarding archives."
"Clearly, at the end of the day, some information simply cannot be provided and is not provided. That is the case here and in all countries."
"It even happens in countries boasting of maximum transparency."
"Some documents are not really documents as such. Rather, they are instruments supporting the exercise of the right to think and reflect."
"They cannot be released."
"The same applies to issues involving the rights of third parties. These rights could include the right to defence, in criminal cases, or economic rights in business cases."
"There needs to be protection in such situations, and they are provided for in the aforementioned regulation."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the whole House for its interest in this subject."
"I do not know if Mr Cashman or Mrs Cederschiöld will be present when the next report on the subject is presented."
"I might not even be present myself."
"Nonetheless, I trust the House will then be able to agree that a step forward has been taken."
"That is our shared ambition and we shall do our utmost to achieve it."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, this summer we had record temperatures all over Europe."
"We also had very high levels of ozone concentrations all over Europe and the two phenomena are unfortunately linked."
"Ground-level ozone, or photochemical smog as it is also called, is the result of three components: VOCs - volatile organic compounds - NOx - nitrogen oxide - and sunshine."
"Ozone is an aggressive gas which attacks our respiratory systems and damages plants, even at relatively low concentrations."
"Member States have committed themselves to achieving significant reductions in VOC emissions in 2010 in order to meet the so-called national emissions ceiling."
"As requested by Member States, this proposal for a directive targets a group of products which contributes significantly to total VOC emissions in Europe, namely paints and varnishes for buildings and products for vehicle refinishing."
"Limiting the solvent content in these products is considered to be the only practicable way to help reduce VOC emissions and, consequently, air pollution from this major source."
"For the sake of clarity, I also want to emphasise what this proposal does not aim to do."
"The purpose is not to establish or harmonise measures for the protection of the health of workers or human health in general."
"Although national or Community measures for these purposes obviously have to respect the general requirements under the Treaty, they clearly fall outside the scope of this proposal and are therefore not restricted or modified by this proposal."
"This proposal has the simpler and broader aim of improving the quality of the air we all breathe, by reducing emissions of VOCs, thereby reducing the formation of ozone."
"We have to act now if we want summer sunshine and fine weather to be experienced as sources of pleasure, rather than sources of air pollution and threats to human health and the environment."
". (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has said, the proposal before us today is a proposal concerning the reduction of organic solvents in paints, and it is a proposal which is part of a wider environmental strategy, namely the attempt to comply with national emission ceilings, in this case VOC emission ceilings."
"The proposal can therefore be considered to be one of the measures necessary for the global improvement of the quality of the air which we, ourselves, breathe, and we cannot fail to give this measure our full support."
"Precisely because we believe firmly in this goal which - as the Commissioner pointed out - has been brought so tragically to our attention this summer, we know that it is in our interest and in the interest of future generations to ensure effective environmental protection."
"For these reasons, I have taken a very simple line on this report right from the beginning of the legislative process: the achievement of the goal of this directive is closely linked to guaranteeing the quality of the products covered by the directive, in other words paints."
"The logic is, indeed, very simple. There is a threshold below which the quality of the products available on the market will inevitably fall and, if the quality - not forgetting that, more often than not, these are paints which are used as protective films, particularly against atmospheric agents - drops below an acceptable threshold, the effect will be the opposite to that which we desire."
"In the medium- and long-terms, there would, indeed, be an increase in the applications of the paint necessary and, therefore, inevitably, an increase in emissions."
"I have therefore attempted to strike a balance between what it is possible to do technically, without going too far below an acceptable level of quality, and what needs to be done, for precisely the reasons just mentioned."
"I will now briefly review the key points of the directive."
"As regards the objective of the directive as such, there were different reactions from the Members, particularly in respect of workers' health and certain national laws protecting workers."
"Just this evening, the Commission explained that the goal of the directive is to protect the environment, and to do so without prejudicing or affecting existing measures taken at Community or national level to protect the health of workers, as, moreover, is stated in recital 14."
"Some of the Members have retabled amendments to this effect in plenary but, after the Commission's comments, I reiterate that we must reject this proposal for expansion and vote against the amendments, in particular Amendments Nos 2, 10, 16, 49, 54, 80 and 82."
"However, I support Amendment No 84, which helps us to define and specify the purpose of the directive more clearly."
"In addition, there is an issue of labelling."
"Personally, I support the Commission's proposal to entrust the labelling requirements for the products in question to a committee, first and foremost because, in the light of the manifold efforts on the part of industry to provide consumers with clear information, the committee can benefit from looking at existing best practice."
"I do not feel it would be appropriate to lay down further requirements, and that is why I call upon the House to vote against Amendment No 20."
"With regard to what is known as the substitution approach, set out in Amendment No 23, I do not believe it is applicable in this context, for the companies and the industrial system we are addressing need facts and certainties - which we are providing in this directive - precisely in order to be able to invest in research and develop the formulas necessary to achieve the objectives."
"Then there are many amendments relating to the thresholds, in other words the percentages proposed by the Commission and changed by Parliament in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I will not go into them all."
"These are proposals which take us below the acceptable threshold I mentioned just now and must, therefore, be rejected."
"Lastly, I would like to mention other points relating to minor derogations for vehicles and historic buildings, monuments and such like, which the Commission has accepted and which I call upon the House to adopt, and a few amendments relating to the definition of solvents and their boiling points, which I believe are going to be covered in this evening's debate too."
"I would like to end by thanking all my colleagues for their extremely valuable contributions in committee."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would thank my colleague Mr Lisi for the report he has presented on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds in paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products."
"His report very sensibly complements the Commission's proposal in many areas, especially when it comes to the sensitive interfaces between economics, ecology, consumer protection and safety in the work place."
"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in this case hydrocarbons, have a considerable part to play in the formation of ground-level ozone."
"Emissions are also formed from components of products containing solvents."
"In many Member States, health problems in connection with ground-level ozone and smog have increased considerably in recent years."
"In the case of sensitive population groups, ozone pollution may lead to irritation of the eyes, sore throats and breathing problems."
"In the environment, account is to be taken of effects upon photosynthesis."
"I support the Commission's initiative to introduce Community-wide measures for reducing VOC emissions."
"I consider the product-related approach selected here to be basically sensible."
"The fact is also to be welcomed that 70% of decorative paints are now water-based."
"I also expressly support the extension of the directive, agreed to by a significant majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, to include dangerous substances in addition to volatile organic compounds present in paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products."
"This approach would combine necessary measures in a single directive and prevent unnecessary bureaucratic expenditure."
"If the dangerous substances are, however, incorporated into the directive, it must also still be possible realistically and sustainably to apply the required minimum standards, that is to say the minimum and maximum values."
"What, then, we are talking about is optimum environmental and consumer protection without, in the process, endangering the competitiveness of our European paint industry, as well as the painting trade that is closely bound up with it."
"That being said, jobs would also be endangered by the attempt, which goes far beyond the Commission's proposal, to replace dangerous substances, either fully or to a greater extent, by the year 2010 Europe-wide."
"That is a threat to the entire paint industry, and first and foremost to small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as a severe setback for our European economic area."
"With a view to protecting the health of users and consumers, volatile organic solvents and dissolvents should not, however, be replaced by substances that are dangerous to health."
"Injury to consumers' health due to problematic new ingredients such as allergens, or long-lasting damage to interiors due to heavily volatile components of decorative paints, must, in any case, be prevented."
"Environmental and consumer protection have the highest priority."
"The quality and usability of products ought not, however, to suffer in the process."
"If the principle of rapid and complete replacement were really to be put into practice, we should have to accept some crucial losses of quality, especially in the cases of paints and varnishes."
"I personally would not expect either myself or anyone else in the European Union to accept a situation in which the varnish on the door of a private house soon flakes just as quickly as the paints on the wall of the house fade."
"We need a reduction in solvents and dangerous substances in paints and varnishes, but we need a plan that can be put into practice."
"It is technically impossible to reduce the proportion of volatile organic solvents to below 300 grams per litre by 2007 and still further by 2010, but it is technically possible and sensible to reduce the proportion of these substances to 400 grams per litre by 2007 and to a permissible maximum value of 300 grams per litre by 2010."
"At the same time, reasonable maximum values need to be applied to limit the side effects caused by the inhalation of paints and varnishes by tradesmen and handymen."
"The purpose of the directive must be to employ practicable measures in order, in the medium term, to reduce the proportion of paint and varnish solvents in emissions Europe-wide."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to say a word of thanks to the rapporteur for his work on the Directive on paint."
"It is an important environmental directive."
"Solvents are one of the main causes of ozone formation, and this has serious consequences, first of all for public health: respiratory diseases and breathing problems can be ascribed to emissions of volatile organic compounds."
"Vegetation and agricultural crops are also damaged."
"We are right to now impose limits on solvents, and, as far as my group is concerned, those limits could be tightened up further."
"The study carried out by the Commission reveals that the environmental gain could be increased further by imposing rather more ambitious limit values."
"For this reason, our group advocates lowering the limit values in line with the study carried out by the Commission."
"We by no means agree with the view of the rapporteur and the previous speaker that a reduction in solvents would also entail a drop in quality."
"Experience in a number of countries has shown that Europe can still have beautiful, good-quality colours even with fewer solvents."
"Precisely because of the imposition of limits, the paint industry has undergone a period of intensive innovation, the end of which is still a long way off."
"It is my firm opinion that innovation is also the basis of employment."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists also has an objection of principle, however."
"The Directive on paint does not say a single word about 'painters' disease': as if there were no one working with paint; as if there were not painters clutching a brush day in, day out."
"Painters' disease is a disorder of the nervous system."
"Exposure to solvents can have serious consequences, such as memory loss, loss of concentration and premature dementia."
"Some countries have taken measures to protect painters against this disease by permitting solvents and promoting sensible use of paint."
"These measures have produced good results."
"Not one single Member State should be deprived of this possibility, either now or in the future."
"The Directive on paint is a harmonisation directive and will without a doubt be a good thing for the industry, which would like to see clear, unambiguous rules in the internal market."
"Harmonisation must not be at the expense of social achievements, however."
"This Directive would result in those Member States who wish to pursue their national policies no longer being able to do so, and that is absolutely unacceptable to my group."
"We have therefore submitted proposals to right this wrong."
"Let me put it very clearly: if the internal market means that the trade unions are deprived of the right and the opportunity to champion better working conditions, then my group will say 'no'."
"I have to say that I find it rather surprising that we have to discuss this here at all."
"For years now, the European Union has been advocating sustainable development."
"The point of departure for sustainable development is reconciling economic, environmental and social aspects with each other."
"Since Johannesburg, the whole world agrees on the necessity of sustainable development and on the necessity of expressing this in the form of tangible policy."
"Sadly, on this, the first - the best - opportunity of bringing together economics, social objectives and environment, social objectives are not being given their due."
"I call on the rapporteur, therefore, to have another good look at the various amendments that strengthen the social aspects of the Directive, and to support these."
"I am joined by a number of fellow Members from various groups in finding this internal market Directive too one-sided by half."
"The veneer of social varnish is really far too thin to offer genuine protection."
"Much greater stress should be laid on working conditions."
"Mr President, notwithstanding the Commissioner's comments earlier today about her eyesight, I have decided to move forward in this rather vast auditorium so that I can at least see her for this evening's debate."
"Two years ago we approved the National Emissions Ceilings Directive and the Ozone in Ambient Air Directive, for which I was rapporteur."
"The former, in particular, set ambitious and legally binding targets for reductions in pollution and improvements in air quality."
"Before us now is a measure requiring the paint industry to make changes in its production methods which will help ensure that these targets are met, at least with regard to the reduction in volatile organic compounds - one of the precursors of ozone pollution."
"It is, as far as I am concerned - and I agree with the Commissioner - very definitely a measure that should address primarily the issue of air pollution rather than that of health problems associated with those who use paints."
"MEPs have been lobbied extensively by industry which, for the most part, wants less stringent restrictions on the use of VOCs than are proposed, and by environmentalists who argue the opposite case."
"I am pleased that in committee we had 110 votes and the Liberal Democrats were on the winning side in 103 of these, striking the balance between the two alternative views."
"In judging the conflicting amendments- I as a mere politician have in general put my trust in the Commission's air quality experts."
"I have been criticised by allegedly greener Members for doing this and for not being sufficiently ambitious by supporting the target limits proposed in the Annex."
"I have worked with the Commission's air quality experts on the ozone matter and I can assure the House that I did not find them unambitious - quite the opposite."
"On reflection, I have decided not to support amendments to raise the boiling point defining VOCs to 280°C, but to stick with the ecolabel standards."
"However, if the Commission can propose a modification or a derogation that allows the continuation of the rather good B&Q labelling scheme in Britain, I would welcome some proposals along those lines."
"Finally, some of those environmentalists within the NGOs, who have called in effect for the complete abolition of solvent-based paints within just a couple of years, should go and spend a little time working in industry and return with a more balanced perspective."
"Environmentally speaking, I want us to move forward quickly but I am conscious that lemmings can move forward quickly and I do not want European industry to have to emulate them."
"Mr President, volatile organic compounds in solvents, which cause ozone pollution, are in particular pumped out by cars, but are also released as a result of painting the woodwork on the exterior of houses."
"The European Commission is right to propose a revision of the existing Directive, which aims to restrict this air pollution."
"One striking feature of this is that the deadlines for the achievement of the standards are very long."
"Economic arguments, in particular, seem to have been decisive in this."
"It became clear during the preparation of this revised Directive that there is a conflict of interests."
"The trade union movement, especially the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers, has experience of the 'painters' disease' Organic Psycho Syndrome (OPS), which is caused by solvents attacking the central nervous system."
"For example, in the Netherlands - a small country - where the use of volatile organic compounds has been severely restricted by law since 1 January 2000, a few thousand workers are still suffering from this serious disease contracted in the past."
"If no new victims emerge there now, it will be thanks to the low limit values that set the standard at a maximum of 100 grams of solvent per litre of paint for a large number of products, and to the compulsory replacement with alternative products."
"The fear is that harmonised regulations at EU level that are not as strict as those in force in the Netherlands will contribute to a renewed growth in the number of victims in the Netherlands."
"What is to stop us from making protection in all the countries of the EU just as good as in the Member State with the most far-reaching measures, so that those who work with paint may stay healthy everywhere?"
"Tightening up the regulations in this way is opposed by the countries that have not yet taken these health-protection measures, and in particular by the industry producing chemical raw materials and the paint industry."
"The chief concerns of the industry are harmonisation and stability."
"International companies want to be free of the obligation to take separate measures for each Member State."
"In their view, the existing rules are not being controlled and complied with as it is, and they use that as an argument for rejecting stricter rules."
"In addition, they want the standards that are to be complied with to be laid down for many years and not constantly tightened up."
"In their view, the use of aggressive substances would actually benefit the environment, as these reduce the frequency with which it is necessary to re-paint."
"They also refer to assurances given by the European Commission and its officials all along that this Directive would exclusively concern emissions into the environment and not the protection of the health and safety of people at work."
"Following on from my contribution to the consideration by the committee, I am concerned with two matters in plenary, too."
"I am concerned firstly with the retention of national protective measures for workers while EU standards are not as strict, and secondly with the improvement of the EU standards now being proposed."
"In a number of amendments, I propose at least following the standards in the Decopaint study."
"That study was carried out at the request of the European Commission, but, sadly, was not then incorporated into the proposals."
"There is still time to correct that mistake now."
"In addition, we should not wait until 2010 to lower limit values, but do it as soon as possible."
"Mr President, the proposal by the European Commission is based on the scientific Decopaint report, which was commissioned by the European Commission and drawn up following long, thorough research."
"I and my colleagues were therefore staggered that the Commission largely disregards the conclusions of that report."
"Without any statement of reasons, newer, higher limit values are proposed, which are not based on any research."
"What they are based on cannot be determined. I should like to hear an explanation of this point from Commissioner Wallström; for it is unacceptable for the Commission to simply brush aside the conclusions of the Decopaint report."
"I have therefore submitted amendments to rectify this, and shall also be supporting other amendments that have the same objective."
"After all, we are talking here about substances that pose a risk not only to the environment, but also to public health."
"Exposure to these substances can result in damage to brain functioning and ultimately to disablement."
"Several Member States have therefore taken legal measures to curb this risk."
"It is important that this protection continue, including in the new Directive."
"The current Commission proposal does not provide for that possibility, and should therefore be amended on that point."
"Surely it cannot be the aim of the Commission to offer less protection to workers than is currently the case."
"It is extremely important that these measures remain permissible now and in the future."
"I also support the amendments with this purpose, therefore."
"Finally, I should like to add that this dossier is further proof that the environment and public health are closely related to each other, and that it is therefore sensible for these subjects to be dealt with by the same committee in the coming term, too."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done so far."
"I am quite sure we can carry on with this work and make sure that we have a good result in the end."
"I also want to start by congratulating the Commission - yes, I do mean it!"
"When we started to look at this proposal we had to bear in mind that it came out of the original discussions on the control of VOC emissions from some years ago when we first looked at the problem: the emission of VOCs from large industrial plants, from large garages, from large petrol stations and so forth."
"At that point we recognised there was a serious problem."
"Yes, we could take action to control large-point sources - and we did."
"We asked the Commission to come forward with some proposals to solve the other problem we had identified at that time, which was the hundreds of thousands of small-point sources across the Union in different places, largely associated with the use of paints, but many other issues as well."
"Sometimes it was small garage paint-shops, sometimes it was domestic use of paint, sometimes it was other substances in other places."
"I wish to thank and congratulate the Commission."
"It has actually tackled this issue as we asked it to do."
"It has brought forward a proposal which is very good, not quite perfect - but nothing ever is - and is taking a proposal from this Parliament seriously and acting on it."
"The Commission has also recognised that this proposal to reduce VOC emissions is going to have an important effect on the environment."
"It is going to reduce ground-level ozone."
"It is going to make sure that we reduce the incidence of asthma caused by ground-level ozone."
"It is going to cut plant damage."
"It is going to reduce other environmental effects."
"It has not been easy to come forward with this proposal."
"It has disclosed a large number of technical issues that we had not originally foreseen. We thank the Commission for tackling those complex issues we did not at first expect."
"Mr Davies has already mentioned that there are some technical issues that we still have to tackle."
"We cannot ignore, for example, some of these issues which are still left on the table."
"I appeal to the Commission to accept the amendments proposed by some of my colleagues on the question of occupational health and the impact upon the health of workers in these circumstances."
"This is an issue we cannot ignore."
"We have to go forward with it."
"We should also mention the importance of maintaining a degree of choice and competition in the marketplace for consumers."
"We should therefore continue to uphold the equal technical criteria for all paints and not give an unfair advantage to water-based paints."
"Let us have those options available to people."
"Let the market be free."
"Let us have some competition."
"Let us stay inside the equal label criteria we already have."
"Finally, we have to recognise the real difficulties of applying these new proposals in every circumstance and on every application that we find in the vast array of options inside the European Union."
"I would ask the Commission to think carefully about some of the exceptions we have looked at here: small quantities of paints prepared in traditional ways, often for traditional uses, whether it be for old cars or for buildings."
"There are many old buildings in Britain."
"It is a place where we perhaps have too many old buildings which in some cases require specialist, old fashioned, old-style paints to maintain their fabric."
"I appeal to you to have some respect, not just for the present environment that we live in, not just for public health, but for the old environment, the built environment, the one we are trying to preserve."
"It would not hurt too much to accept amendments on those questions as well and to give us a rounded proposal we can all be proud of, that we might even get a second-reading agreement on."
"Mr President, firstly, I should have started by thanking Mr Lisi for his work as rapporteur on this important proposal."
"I do it now instead and hope he will forgive me for not doing so earlier."
"Allow me to return to the question of the purpose and the scope of the proposal."
"A number of the amendments adopted by Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are motivated by concern for the protection of the health of workers."
"Some of these amendments - 10, 16 and 26 - aim to emphasise that the present proposal will not restrict or prejudice national or Community measures established in order to protect the health of workers from exposure to solvents in paints and varnishes."
"The Commission agrees with the principle underlying these amendments."
"Measures for the protection of the health of workers fall outside the purpose and scope of this proposal, and the proposal therefore does not prejudice such measures in any way."
"The Commission also agrees that it may be useful to clarify and emphasise this point directly in one of the paragraphs of the proposal."
"However, and for exactly the same reason, the Commission cannot agree to include a number of amendments which directly or indirectly aim to enhance the protection of workers' and consumers' health from exposure to solvents in the paints and other products covered by the proposals - Amendments Nos 17, 20 and 23."
"The Commission finds that these amendments, rather than reducing the risk for human health, might inadvertently serve to create confusion about the scope of the proposal."
"A number of the amendments voted by the committee - Amendments Nos 11, 13, 14, 32, 33 and 34 - contain useful technical clarifications with which the Commission can agree to a greater or lesser degree."
"As an example let me just mention the proposal that the part of the VOCs in the paint which reacts to form the coating film remaining on the painted surface should not be included when assessing compliance with the VOC content limit value."
"That is Amendment No 11."
"This makes sense from an environmental point of view, as it is the part of the VOCs that evaporates into the atmosphere we want to reduce."
"However, there is a practical sticking point: for the time being we do not have any recognised standard or method for calculating the weight of those VOCs which remain bound in the film."
"Such a standard has to be developed in order to allow for this deduction."
"The Commission also finds it reasonable to accept that Member States, under strict conditions and in limited quantities, may grant derogations for special paints, as you mentioned, for the restoration and maintenance of vintage cars and historic buildings."
"That concerns Amendments Nos 6, 19 and 22."
"In total, the Commission can, to a greater or lesser degree, accept 20 of the 83 amendments tabled for the vote in plenary tomorrow."
"Of the remaining 63 amendments, which the Commission cannot accept for different reasons, most are of a fairly technical nature."
"Allow me to make only a few comments on these amendments and our reasons for rejecting them."
"Four amendments - 5, 27, 81 and 83 - aim to oblige the Commission to present tighter limit values and/or enlarge the scope of the present values at some later date."
"Quite apart from the question of principle concerning the Commission's right of initiative, we firmly believe that it would be unwise to guess at what we should do in four or five years in order to improve air quality."
"When we have the results of the Clean Air For Europe programme in a couple of years, we will be in a much better position to assess if, where and what action might be needed in order to improve air quality in a scientifically and economically justified manner."
"Amendment No 12 proposes enlarging the scope of the directive by including VOCs with a boiling point - as several Members have mentioned - up to 280°C rather than the 250°C proposed by the Commission."
"This is not acceptable to the Commission."
"Firstly, because organic compounds with a boiling point above 250°C have a very low volatility: it takes several days for them to dry out and they have a very limited ozone formation potential."
"In other words, they are of little environmental concern."
"Secondly, because 250°C is the boiling point chosen to define VOCs in the EU eco-labelling scheme."
"It would be both inconsistent and bizarre to choose a stricter definition for this proposal."
"Mr Davies, B&Q/Kingfisher will be able to continue to use their labelling scheme."
"No less than 36 amendments - 36 to 53, 55 to 57, 59 to 63, 65, and 67 to 77 - aim to change the limit values proposed by the Commission."
"The Commission is aware that intense lobbying activities have been going on, both from industry and from environmental organisations, with a view to either softening or tightening the limit values proposed by the Commission."
"However, so far the Commission has not been presented with convincing evidence that the values of the proposal are not well balanced, economically justified and technically achievable within the deadlines proposed."
"Therefore the Commission, at this time, finds that it should stand by the limit values, procedures and deadlines proposed."
"Thank you for your explanation, Commissioner."
"There was one thing I did not understand."
"You spoke about Amendment No 11 and Amendment No 13, both of which you consider acceptable."
"If I have understood correctly, Amendment No 11 and Amendment No 13 exactly contradict each other."
"One makes it possible to include diluents under the definition of solvents, and Amendment No 11 excludes just that."
"Could you clarify this for me once more?"
"It is rather a technical question, but it is ultimately important as regards our voting list."
"- (IT) Mr President, while the Commissioner takes note of the matter, I would like to say that I agree with Mrs Corbey."
"This is exactly the sense of the proposal contained in the voting list proposed by the rapporteur: Amendment No 11 and Amendment No 13 are contradictory."
"I would, however, say to Mrs Corbey that this is the result of a mistake on the part of our committee."
"I therefore call upon the House to support and adopt Amendment No 11 but to vote against Amendment No 13, precisely in order to establish a definition of 'thinners' which is consistent with the rest of the legislation."
"Mr President, we are just trying to see whether we have made any mistakes in interpreting the content of these two amendments."
"We have accepted both of them in principle and, as far as we understand, they do not contradict each other, but we are looking into the details of the text."
"Perhaps you can provide us with a better explanation of how you interpret them as contradicting each other."
"We think they have the same content and the Commission has accepted them in principle."
"I do not want to reopen the debate now, so I propose that we proceed with our work."
"In the meantime, Commissioner, our services can attempt to clarify the situation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission (B5-0275/2003) by Mrs Jackson, on the progress report on European Union participation in the plan of implementation of the world summit on sustainable development."
"Mr President, firstly, I too wish to say thank you to Mrs Wallström."
"I am well aware of her commitment to these issues, and the information she provided about what has happened following the Johannesburg Summit was welcome."
"I also wish to thank Mr de Roo for his draft of a sound resolution, which we shall vote on tomorrow."
"We all - or many of us at least - had high expectations prior to Johannesburg, but the outcome fell far short of these."
"To a certain extent, I believe that the difficulties have to do with the fact that the work on sustainable development in a way runs counter to our traditional method of working."
"In this context, we are required to work horizontally, that is to say to integrate the objective of economic growth with those of social development and of the effective protection and responsible management of the physical environment."
"This integration is difficult for many reasons."
"To begin with, we do not have an education system that facilitates an understanding of these horizontal connections."
"On the contrary, most of us have a segmented education."
"In the same way, the research world is partitioned."
"Everyone talks about cooperation across the discipline barriers, but the vast majority of researchers are specialists in narrow areas."
"Few are able to survey the whole scene and few have the knack of seeing systems as an organic whole."
"Our method of organising ourselves in various areas of society is also vertical or divided into sectors."
"We can take this Parliament as an example. We should have a committee on sustainable development, but instead we are divided into sectors."
"There is also a problem with the whole of the economic model."
"It is very short-sighted and does not enable us to incorporate either the long-term or qualitative aspects of development."
"We still measure everything in terms of gross national product, that is to say the total production of goods and services."
"There is no vision of how such production - or, for that matter, consumption - affects the environment or social development."
"Do not misunderstand me, I do not for a moment believe that we could solve these problems through negative growth or by consuming less, when the point is that we must devote much more attention to the forms, content and quality of growth and not just to its quantity."
"Mrs Wallström, I believe this is a great challenge, especially for the Commission."
"The European Union's role in the work in favour of sustainable development is central, especially today when we encounter a lukewarm attitude on the part of the Washington administration."
"Our responsibility in this area has implications both for our internal policy and for our cooperation with the poor countries."
"Where our own policy is concerned, we need to adjust the economic regulations so that we provide sufficient positive incentives for the far more efficient management of energy and materials."
"We also need, step by step, to stop using substances that remain toxic for long periods."
"Allow me to give a practical example."
"When it comes to the supply of energy, which is central in the context of the Lisbon Process, we could agree upon an ambitious target for reducing the consumption of energy in our economies or, if we wished to, for increasing energy efficiency by, for example, 2.5% to 3.0% per year."
"That is entirely possible at a purely technical level, but there is a lack of political will."
"Where our relations with the poor countries are concerned, Commissioner Wallström has already pointed to the water and energy initiatives."
"I can only hope that this issue of the supply of water, with the billion euros earmarked for it, will be resolved shortly."
"One way of doing this would, in actual fact, be to ensure that the European Development Fund, or EDF, was incorporated into the ordinary budget, something which we in Parliament have always demanded."
"When it comes to the energy issue, I am unfortunately rather pessimistic."
"The proposal submitted is very sound, but there is no extra money set aside."
"What is really required - and what is not at all happening - is for priority to be given to the supply of energy and to sensible efforts in this area, not only on the part of the Commission but also on that of the recipient countries."
"I should like to call upon Mrs Wallström to try to release a proper amount of additional money and earmark it for this area."
"The resolution we are to decide about tomorrow requires, and reflects the wish for, ongoing progress reports on the part of the Commission."
"Mrs Wallström has also commented on this, which is excellent."
"I just hope that there is very substantial reporting of what is being done in the developing countries."
"In this area, we at present lack any reporting worthy of the name."
"We lack clear objectives and clear indicators."
"The discussion we conduct on the aid we provide and on how effective our efforts are in this area is therefore couched in very general terms."
"I believe the Commission as a whole needs to commit itself to developing both quantitative objectives and indicators whereby we obtain reporting worthy of the name."
"Finally, I wish, just like Mrs Wallström, naturally to focus upon the issues related to poverty."
"We need more aid, but also better aid."
"For this, reforms to the trade system are needed, as I say."
"From that point of view, what happened in Cancún is of course very unfortunate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now a year since the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg."
"In our decision, supported unreservedly by my political group, we emphasise that measures to implement the Johannesburg programme are necessary."
"That is not something we are now addressing for the first time."
"In Johannesburg, where many of us were disappointed by the results because they fell short of the European Union's demands, we already knew what was required."
"There is, however, a chance, at least in the future, to make up some ground in this area if we can achieve many of the objectives we set ourselves in Johannesburg and if we can really achieve significant progress in a number of areas."
"I admit that we do not at present find specifically the best conditions in relation to our demand that, in particular, the European Union ought, in the future too, to play a pioneering role in issues of sustainable development."
"I am just thinking of the long discussions on chemicals policy and also in other important areas."
"I also know that, in this area, it is not so much the Commission that is putting the brakes on but, without a doubt, the Member States too."
"Nor, however, is the current Presidency, whose representatives in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy painted a very sad picture a few weeks ago - also in connection with the issue of sustainable development - the best advertisement when we at present talk about this topic."
"I was disturbed to learn that the Presidency has apparently either not understood, or not wanted to understand, either the principle of shared responsibility on the part of the developed and developing countries or the principle of different degrees of responsibility according to which, if we cause pollution, we must assume greater responsibility."
"The Commissioner has already mentioned a number of the points I wanted to raise."
"She has informed us about the water and energy initiatives."
"I am already delighted about the comprehensive reports on these subjects, because the very participants in this House's parliamentary delegation were very anxious that the projects concerned were too large or that, for example, renewable energy would be under-represented in the energy initiative and that traditional forms of energy would be accorded undue support."
"I hope that, in the near future, we can count upon a proposal by the Commission on chemicals policy."
"One objective of Johannesburg was, of course, to reverse the trend by 2020 where dangerous chemicals are concerned."
"I believe that the problems with chemicals policy also show that having our own committee on sustainable development does not help us out of the difficulties."
"There are very detailed discussions, and we must work through one topic after another and, in the case of every topic - including chemicals policy - bear in mind the need for sustainable development."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate purely on the issue of sanitation and I apologise to the Commissioner for not giving her advance notice of some questions I wish to pose."
"I would be most grateful if she would try to depart from her prepared remarks and deal with these issues."
"At Johannesburg she, on behalf of the European Union, was successful in securing agreement on ambitious targets to improve sanitation for billions of people within a relatively short period of time."
"The first year has passed and there has been lots of talk and plenty of paper, but if the targets are to be met, we need to see hundreds of wells, thousands of septic tanks, tens of thousands of pipes being laid each and every month."
"At a meeting in Parliament earlier today, the Commissioner reminded Members that EUR 1 billion had been set aside to start projects and she informed us that the Council had blocked the spending of this money."
"Commissioner, can you tell the House, has the Commission being putting forward specific proposals for the use of some of this money on projects to improve sanitation in developing nations?"
"Has any expenditure at all been authorised by the Council or has everything been blocked?"
"Has this refusal to release funds been universal; has it been entirely by agreement of the Council or has it been the case that some Member States have been instrumental in securing the blocking of expenditure?"
"Finally Commissioner, if this is the case, how do you feel personally about the way in which the Council appears to be backsliding on the commitments made by the European Union at a summit where - and we take great pride in this fact - we played a leadership role?"
"Mr President, it has been one year since Johannesburg and eleven years since Rio de Janeiro."
"I was there."
"Environmental breakthroughs were achieved in Rio."
"The Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity were signed."
"Sadly, no consensus was reached in Rio regarding forests."
"Developing countries were fobbed off with the renewed pledge to increase funds for development aid to 0.7%, but ten years later in Johannesburg the contrary was seen: even less development aid."
"The Johannesburg Summit concerned itself more with the problems of poverty than those of the environment; and rightly so."
"25 000 children are dying in our world every day."
"Fortunately, the Johannesburg Summit did not fail like the one in Cancún a week ago."
"Mr Davies has already touched on the point that the practical implementation leaves much to be desired, particularly regarding the European water and energy initiatives."
"Fortunately, however, a partial breakthrough was achieved in the field of energy for the first time."
"A coalition of the willing will now try to promote new, renewable energy. That is a good thing."
"The EU has to learn at world level what it is now doing internally, slowly and laboriously, in the Lisbon process."
"Progress has to be made with the economic, social and environmental circumstances at the same time."
"Improvements have to be made at the same time."
"We have not reached that point yet at world level."
"However, our Green motto is: trade, aid and firm agreements simultaneously."
"We want more fair trade; but that sadly failed in Cancún."
"More aid must also be given for clean water, sanitation and renewable energy sources for the more than one billion citizens of our world that are currently without them."
"New environmental agreements are also needed, particularly for sustainable forest management."
"We must not forget that."
"The path is long, but soft power will triumph."
"Mr President, when we discussed the results of the Johannesburg Summit in this House last year, I concluded my contribution by criticising the optimism about the results of the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development, asking myself whether my grandchildren would be so optimistic in 20 years' time."
"In addition, I said then that realising the objectives should contribute to the desired sustainable development."
"I see sustainable development as an embodiment of the task that God has set mankind to dress and keep the earth."
"It is very important to ensure a balance between social, economic and environmental elements."
"In addition, we must strive to achieve this balance not only for the developed, but also for the developing, countries."
"Sadly, this balance was not given its due at the Johannesburg Summit, because not enough emphasis was placed on the social and environmental elements."
"One year on from Johannesburg, there is already cause for us to worry about the implementation plan."
"It would be good if the European Union were to take more initiatives in this regard."
"It is a good thing, of course, that we are dedicating ourselves to enabling the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force, but more is needed."
"The targets for drinking water and sanitation, chemicals, fish stocks and the reduction of poverty, starvation and child mortality should be followed by tangible action and policy."
"In addition, I am very curious to hear what the European Commission has done over the past year to establish a trade policy that does not hinder the development of poor countries or the environment."
"We must be careful that we do not ask for too much at the same time, or do things that are only indirectly connected to sustainable development."
"The promotion of equality between men and women could serve as an example of this."
"It is not always advisable to get involved, as the European Union, in matters of a strongly cultural nature."
"Where human rights violations are concerned, it is a different story, of course, but these do not fall under the subject of sustainable development."
"Furthermore, I am concerned about the European Union's approach to combating AIDS."
"I am convinced that marital fidelity is a much better means than all kinds of contraceptives."
"Practical experience has shown that campaigns involving contraceptives are not as effective."
"Information campaigns such as those taking place in Uganda are much more so."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sustainable development is a splendid concept."
"Combining economic aspects, environment and the social dimension is a powerful idea."
"These are the three cornerstones of a better world."
"Sustainable development has developed over time."
"Initially, it was chiefly concerned with the environment, and had an additional socioeconomic aspect."
"Nowadays, the environment seems to be accorded a lower priority at international conferences, and poverty reduction takes precedence."
"Whereas Rio was still an environmental conference, Johannesburg was concerned with everything: water, AIDS, schooling, energy, poverty, malaria and environment."
"That makes it difficult to implement sustainable development; for, with all the problems we are tackling, we have the sense that we can never do everything at the same time."
"As far as I am concerned, it is also somewhat apolitical to put so many desires on the table at the same time without making choices."
"In order to make sustainable development a little more specific, I have two suggestions to make."
"Firstly, all of the European Union's policies should undergo a 'Johannesburg check'."
"It seems to me a good idea to examine all of our legislation and policies against sustainable development: primarily policies with clear external implications, but also more internal matters such as the Directive on paints."
"One example is climate policy."
"Our thoughts are chiefly turned to the environmental aspects and the economic costs; while the social aspect - the attention to social inequality - has up to now been left behind."
"Another example is pharmaceutical legislation."
"We are chiefly preoccupied with our industry, the competitive position of European businesses, and our own public health, and we are not looking at the rest of the world."
"It does not have to be this way."
"A Johannesburg check would bring this to light immediately, and also open our eyes to the environmental aspects of medicines."
"With the packaging dossier, Parliament did its best to involve exports to developing world countries in this by means of a prevention policy, and to promote sustainable production and consumption."
"In food legislation, there are environmental aspects and social aspects in abundance."
"The current food legislation would not, at any event, pass the Johannesburg check."
"By showing that it is possible to give flesh and blood to sustainable development, we bring about rejuvenation, and this rejuvenation can also arouse new creativity."
"This brings me to the second point. Sustainable development not only needs flesh and blood, but indeed a face."
"Our common foreign policy is having difficulty getting off the ground."
"Anyone who reflects on Europe's role in the world quickly comes to the conclusion that we are too divided to find a military role of any consequence for ourselves."
"Why, then, should we not put a great deal more emphasis on global public leadership; leadership so that we may tackle problems worldwide in a pragmatic way and in consultation with interested parties, businesses and NGOs."
"We have to commit resources to this and make room for it in our budget, therefore."
"It may also be a good idea to give this leadership, too, a face: a 'Johannesburg Commissioner'."
"There are sufficient commissioners in the coming term of office who would be capable of fulfilling this role."
"Perhaps you, Commissioner, could advance the idea of a Johannesburg Commissioner and a Johannesburg check a little within the Commission."
"Mr President, I listened to Mrs Corbey earlier today and she said that the concept of sustainable development offers a kind of magic, a kind of understanding, and requires a holistic approach."
"Such a concept is also an extremely difficult one because it has to be translated into what Mr Davies mentioned."
"It has to be translated into the concrete number of new wells that have to be drilled or into providing pipes and other items necessary for good sanitation facilities for poor people."
"That is why I like your questions so much, because this is exactly how we have to proceed now."
"What have we been doing?"
"We are, as you know, preparing a report for the end of the year which will explain exactly what this 'Water for Life' initiative means and what it contains."
"The discussion so far in the Council has presented difficulties for some Member States."
"The Council is not fond of the idea of setting up a secretariat for the particular purpose of a water fund - although perhaps you should ask the Council about this, because who am I to say how it discusses the matter?"
"Perhaps the Council wants greater flexibility in the use of this EDF money, at least, that is how I understand the direction the discussion is taking in the Council."
"However, when we discuss the 'Water for Life' initiative, it covers both water and sanitation."
"There are a number of initiatives that range from looking at the approach to river-basin management, to big rivers in Africa, to very concrete projects like drilling wells."
"In our report, which you will receive before the end of 2003, we will show exactly what has been achieved so far and how we can establish ownership in poor countries, for example in Africa."
"We have concentrated on Africa, but we also need to get its people on board and allow them to feel that this is their project, that they can work on it and achieve good results."
"I do not have the figures to give you the exact numbers, but we are compiling them now to provide clear evidence of what has been done so far and of how we think the next steps should be designed."
"Our other problem is that we know each other, perhaps, too well in our discussions on sustainable development."
"However, this matter has to be integrated into all other policy areas."
"This is exactly what you have been saying in all contexts, from trade to agriculture, energy or transport."
"We have to subject the matter to the Johannesburg check that Mrs Corbey has mentioned."
"We should be able to come back and see whether we have changed the time perspective or the geographical perspective."
"We will, of course, continue to ensure that this policy is integrated better in what we do and ensure policy coherence, because that is really the major challenge."
"I cannot agree more with you on, amongst the other issues you mentioned, the need for education and research, which applies across borders."
"The next opportunity for us is to return to it when we provide the report and keep it constantly on our common agenda."
"I should like to thank Members for their contributions."
"Mr President, I recognise what the Commission is doing to prepare for the implementation of our programme to improve sanitation."
"However, I am not clear whether the Commission has actually put to the Council specific proposals for the expenditure of some of this EUR 1 billion or whether such expenditure has in fact been blocked."
"Mr President, I should like to point out to Mr Davies that yes, we have proposed that this should be used for the water initiative which covers what I said: both water and sanitation projects."
"We concentrate on Africa and it covers the whole range, from big plans for big rivers in Africa down to grassroots projects such as drilling new wells or building sanitation facilities."
"We have presented the idea that the water fund should be used for this purpose, and that EDF money should be earmarked for that water fund."
"Normally, funds are not earmarked in such a way."
"That has been a problem within the Council."
"The Council is not so fond of setting up a particular fund and a secretariat to work with the concrete implementation of this plan and the 'Water for Life' initiative."
"We hope, of course, that the Council will be able to overcome these problems and the obstacles it sees, but that is the situation in which we find ourselves at present."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"To conclude the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"I hereby declare that I abstained from voting on the McCarthy report."
"My reason for doing so is that Parliament needs to send a clear signal to the Commission to the effect that the only way to get a majority at second reading is to take Parliament's criticisms seriously."
"The discussion on the patentability of software is extremely controversial. Even those who support this matter in principle and who claim that they are pursuing the same aim contradict one another."
"The rapporteur refers to over one hundred thousand patent applications having been received whereas Commissioner Bolkestein estimates that the number is not quite so high."
"Adopting this text will not remove the ambiguity; the text will instead become a source of further uncertainties and abuses that will benefit the most powerful players in a market that is as unique as it is important both in economic terms and in terms of disseminating knowledge."
"Commissioner Bolkestein's words let slip the mask when he explained that the European Parliament can, through the Community procedure for drafting a directive, participate in the decision-making process, unlike an intergovernmental procedure for revising the European Patent Convention."
"This argument seems to have been crucial in persuading the majority of this House to adopt a directive that it actually considers to be unsatisfactory."
"The Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities representing the CPNT supported the amendments tabled by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which provided invaluable clarification, but not the overall initiative, which they have proposed should be rejected by amendment."
"They cannot accept this procedural sweetener, which could ultimately lead to the adoption of a bad text that is excessively open to risky interpretations."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, before beginning our work, I would like to welcome the former European Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, who will be watching today's proceedings from the official gallery."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for the commitment, reliability and professionalism which he showed throughout the years when he was European Ombudsman."
"I am sure that the new Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, whom I also welcome heartily, will follow his example."
"The next item is the report (A5-0229/2003) by the Earl of Stockton, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2002 [C5-0271/2003 - 2003/2068(INI)]."
"The European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, has the floor."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this House for the first time as European Ombudsman and to present the Ombudsman's Annual Report for 2002."
"The report covers the last full year in office of the first European Ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman, who is present today and who retired in March 2003."
"I would like to pay tribute to his many achievements on behalf of European citizens."
"Foremost among Mr Söderman's achievements is the establishment of the European Ombudsman as an effective and well-known institution, promoting openness, accountability and good administration."
"Other important achievements include the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour approved by a resolution of this House in 2001, a procedural code for complainants under the Article 226 infringement procedure adopted by the Commission last year, and the abolition of age limits in recruitment to the institutions and bodies."
"As an observer at the convention that drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Mr Söderman successfully proposed that the Charter should include the right to good administration."
"As an observer at the European Convention, he succeeded in ensuring that the draft Constitution properly mentions the Ombudsman, provides a legal basis for a law on good administration and informs citizens of their right to a remedy in national courts."
"He also gave me vital advice and support in the establishment of the Ombudsman institution in Greece."
"I will try to live up to the expectations generated by his achievements and to carry on his work by maintaining and further developing the capacity of the institution to serve all Union citizens as efficiently and effectively as possible."
"The Annual Report for 2002 records the progress that has been made in handling complaints, promoting good administration and making the institution better known to citizens."
"In 2002, the total number of complaints rose to 2211, making it the first year in the history of the European Ombudsman that the total rose above 2000."
"The proportion of complaints sent through the website and e-mail continued to rise."
"About half of the complaints received in 2002 were sent this way."
"In addition, over 3700 electronic requests for information were received and answered."
"The Ombudsman opened more inquiries in 2002 than ever before - 8% more than in 2001, including two own-initiative inquiries - and dealt with them more effectively."
"At the end of the year, I am happy to report, all but four inquiries had been closed within the one-year target."
"I am committed to maintaining and enhancing our service to citizens by using the resources as effectively as possible and, when needed, seeking a realistic additional level of resources."
"The Ombudsman also needs the cooperation of other institutions to answer complaints rapidly, fully and correctly."
"The 2002 Report contains many examples of cases in which institutions and bodies took prompt action to settle the matter once a complaint was made, or responded positively to the Ombudsman's proposals and recommendations."
"The Ombudsman also worked hard in 2002 to increase public awareness of citizens' rights to complain - to complain in ways that made a difference."
"We produced a 'Guide for Citizens', published in 11 languages."
"We issued a press release every 10 days on average and there were numerous presentations of the Ombudsman's work at seminars and meetings in the Member States."
"As a former national ombudsman I can testify that the European Ombudsman is certainly amongst the best-known ombudsman institutions in the world, and is probably the best known."
"For example, over 3000 websites now contain an active link to the European Ombudsman's site."
"During 2002, the European Ombudsman also made essential preparations for the forthcoming enlargement of the Union and became one of the first EU institutions to reach out to citizens in the languages of the candidate countries, both on paper and electronically."
"We are now intensifying preparations to manage the transition to handling complaints from 25 Member States as smoothly as possible."
"The preparations include recruitment of legal staff from the new Member States, as well as introduction of an improved computer database to assist in the management of complaints."
"Ombudsman institutions exist in all ten of the states that will join the Union next year."
"They are now fully integrated into the network of cooperation between the European Ombudsman and the ombudsmen and similar bodies in the Member States."
"Cooperation through the network has been enhanced for all members, old and new."
"The online resources of the network now include, for example, a regular 'Ombudsman Daily News' service to members, and a lively internet forum for the exchange of information and ideas."
"The main purpose of the European Ombudsman institution as I see it is to help strengthen the democratic life of the Union by promoting the rule of law, good administration and respect for human rights in the existing and future Members States of the European Union."
"As well as reacting to the complaints that are received, the Ombudsman should also have a proactive role in promoting democratic values, empowering citizens and widening the choices available to them."
"Building on what has already been achieved and making full use of the possibilities offered by new technologies, I intend to work closely with the network of national and regional ombudsmen to enhance the role of non-judicial remedies, to increase the institutional presence of the Ombudsman and to reach out to all European Union citizens, old and new, to inform them of their rights under Union law and how to exercise and defend those rights."
"The resolution adopted by this House yesterday in the Gil-Robles/Tsatsos report will greatly assist these efforts and I am very appreciative of that."
"For the Constitution also to include a reference to the system of non-judicial remedies would be a real and visible achievement for citizens, who too often seem to be left on the sidelines of European integration."
"I commit myself to pursuing this goal vigorously."
"I would like to thank Lord Stockton for his excellent report and the constructive proposals which it contains."
"I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Gemelli, for the encouragement and support which the committee has shown and continues to show for the work of the European Ombudsman."
"Since taking office, I have experienced the willingness of many Union institutions and bodies to cooperate with the Ombudsman."
"I would especially like to mention the positive approach shown by the President of this House, Mr Cox, and by the Commissioner responsible, Mrs de Palacio."
"I look forward to continuing close cooperation with all the institutions and bodies in order both to enhance the quality of the European Union's administration and to reach out to citizens."
"Finally, I would like to thank all the Members of this august House for their confidence and offer them my full cooperation in the often unrecognised work that they perform in helping citizens who have problems."
"Mr President, 'top that!' is a saying in England."
"The Ombudsman has covered my report in as much detail as I could cover it."
"However, I have one or two points."
"It is a great pleasure to see the previous Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, in the official gallery."
"He was enormously helpful in the preparation of my report, as was his successor."
"Some of the recommendations that I make at the end under the subheading 'Where to from here?' were produced as a distillation of their wisdom, and perhaps my nerve."
"It has been a remarkable achievement by the previous Ombudsman to have placed the role so firmly in the consciousness and on the map of administration."
"I am very pleased to learn that after repeated requests, both by the Committee on Petitions and others, that the Commission is now considering very seriously that it will sign up to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour."
"Mr Diamandouros has already reported to me that speed seems to be gathering and that something might be achieved by 2005."
"He has no doubt been cracking the whip behind the Commission very hard indeed."
"There are, however, one or two other points I would like to endorse."
"The investigative role of the Ombudsman in conjunction with Parliament is very important."
"There are frequently issues which emerge not only from a complaint or, in some cases, from a petition to the Petitions Committee, but there are more general points which need to be looked at."
"I would welcome an extension of the powers of the Ombudsman and an extension of cooperation, not just with the Petitions Committee, but with other areas of the European Parliament."
"It is also encouraging that the Ombudsman has initiated the establishment of, and continues to work with, national and regional ombudsmen."
"If I remember rightly, he will be holding a conference in the next couple of years in which he will be bringing the threads together so that European citizens have some commonality of approach to ombudsmen, whether at regional, national or European level."
"I would urge him, if possible, to have at least one member of the Petitions Committee attend that conference, so that there is continuity - a seamless approach."
"We all know how easy it is for matters of importance to individual citizens to fall into the gap between one department, commission or directorate and another. One of the jobs that this Parliament must do in conjunction with the Ombudsman is to ensure that those gaps are as small as possible and as few issues fall into them as we can manage."
"It has also been important in developing the relationship with the citizens of the new Member States."
"We forget, perhaps, how familiar we have become as citizens with many of the institutions and how familiar we are with some of the mechanisms."
"The figures that the Ombudsman quoted show that the European citizen has become very aware of the institutions."
"However, this is not necessarily the case in the new Member States."
"Therefore, perhaps we should concentrate our resources and our efforts into bringing their level of awareness and understanding up to that of the rest of the European citizens."
"Once again, I should like to thank Mr Söderman."
"He was unfailingly courteous to me and, on more than one occasion, showed he had not only a great grasp of his subjects but also perhaps a slightly atypical sense of humour when dealing with the results."
"I would like to commend this report to the House, and thank the present Ombudsman for his kind words."
"It is a compliment, Mr Söderman - the comment on the sense of humour - which, coming from an Englishman, is of particular value."
"Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, Mr Söderman, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is taking place at a key moment, since it relates to a report written and presented by the former Ombudsman, from whom Mr Diamandouros took over in April 2003, on his activities."
"At the beginning of April, the Commission had the opportunity to meet with the new Ombudsman and congratulate him on his election. We also wished him all possible cooperation and collaboration, and every success in his work, not least because his predecessor was a very hard act to follow."
"When the previous act is that hard to follow, one has to pull out all the stops; I am sure, though, that Mr Diamandouros's performance will be a triumph."
"During the last debate of this kind, on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2001, the Commission also had reason to congratulate Mr Söderman."
"On that occasion, it was for his pioneering role in setting up the European mediation system. Furthermore, I have no doubt that we will forge ahead alongside Mr Diamandouros with the same skill, initiative and impetus."
"Like your rapporteur, the Commission can only welcome the Ombudsman's establishment of the network of national and regional Ombudsmen, the notable improvements he has made to the speed at which complaints are processed, his contribution to the Convention and his active preparations for enlargement."
"Regarding the management of complaints procedures, the Commission applauds Parliament's decision which led to European authorities adopting appropriate measures for finding a solution as soon as the problem in question had come to light, in many cases, while a mutually acceptable solution was found in many others."
"We are here to serve the interests of citizens."
"For that reason, the Commission has always made every effort to cooperate with the Ombudsman on the day-to-day handling of individual complaints."
"It is true, however, that there are differences of opinion at times."
"That is understandable, though, and there is always frank and constructive discussion."
"The rapporteur, the Earl of Stockton, whom I would like to thank for his very positive work, referred explicitly to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour. The Commission is working on this area, but we must time things carefully."
"The Commission's code came into force in November 2001. Essentially, it corresponds overall to what we discussed and talked about at the time with Mr Söderman, and to what Parliament adopted."
"The first follow-through dossier has been produced, but not enough time has yet passed to give us a full and complete picture of how the current regulation is working, or, therefore, of how it might be improved."
"There is a second question, moreover."
"The second follow-through dossier is being prepared."
"Although this report will cover all the institutions and should allow us to determine a common direction for all of them, we must remember that we do not yet know the results of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)."
"If the IGC adopts the Convention's text on this issue, we might then have a legal basis for launching an initiative promoting a common code for all the institutions, involving a codecision procedure with Parliament's full participation."
"I would remind you, however, that matters as they stand are governed by Article 308 of the Treaty. Nothing more than a simple opinion - and a unanimous one at that - would thus be required of the European Parliament at the moment."
"With this in mind, it is important to await the final results of the IGC before taking definitive steps in this regard."
"On the question of access to documents relating to the infringement procedure, we should not lose sight of the fact that the infringement procedure is an essential part of the Commission's toolkit for ensuring that Community law is respected."
"The Commission must certainly be able to carry out its investigations and communicate with the Member States with complete autonomy."
"If it is to exert that power, it must be allowed all the room for man?uvre it needs."
"The issue is thus one of balancing the need for transparency with the confidentiality required in dialogues between the Commission and the Member States."
"Furthermore, the case-law of the Court of Justice has established a legal framework for this issue. That framework cannot be ignored."
"For closed infringement procedures, however, the Commission has revised its practice. The documents may thus be accessed, in principle, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank the rapporteur, Lord Stockton, and give him every encouragement. I can also guarantee that we in the Commission will support the new Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, as we supported his predecessor."
"I cannot, however, conclude my speech without giving credit where credit is due."
"Mr Diamandouros said a moment ago that the main purpose of the institution of European Ombudsman is to help strengthen the democratic life of the Union by promoting the rule of law, good administration and respect for human rights."
"With this in mind, we should all thank Mr Söderman for his actions and work over all these years, because, at the head of the institution of Ombudsman, he has worked to achieve that improvement, that strengthening of the rule of law, good administration and respect for human rights throughout the European Union and also in the new candidate countries, which will also be Members of our Union before long."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express my thanks to Mr Söderman for carrying out the role of European Ombudsman when it was set up and for building it up, brick by brick."
"I would like to welcome the new Ombudsman, who is taking on this valuable heritage."
"As Mrs de Palacio quite rightly said, the previous act is hard to follow, and so we now need to continue to raise the legal and cultural status and, above all, raise public awareness of the Ombudsman."
"I must say that we received proof of how wide this awareness is when, at the time of the election of a new Ombudsman, a large number of candidates were put forward to the European Parliament."
"Parliament then chose Mr Diamandouros, who will have our full support in the process of developing and consolidating the role of the Ombudsman."
"We certainly need to promote this role in the Member States - my country and many other Member States have no national ombudsman, unlike many other countries - and in the accession countries too."
"We are also considering giving our support to the forum initiative, proposed by the European Ombudsman and mentioned by the rapporteur, the Earl of Stockton."
"The forum should be open at all levels - local, regional and national - and should provide a great opportunity for communicating and exchanging opinions on the running of the institution."
"I am extremely pleased that the European Ombudsman has made another proposal too - to include among his responsibilities the enhancement of the system of non-judicial means of redress, not least in order to give substance to relations between the institutions and the citizens."
"What we need to do now, as I will mention again, given that I am speaking three times today, is to strengthen the bodies which defend and protect citizens' rights."
"I believe that Mr Diamandouros will be able to accomplish this task. He has shown very willing and his previous experience as a national ombudsman will stand him in good stead."
"I would therefore like to express our thanks and our support for his future work."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Ombudsmen, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to congratulate my colleague, the Earl of Stockton on this report, which my group fully supports."
"The comparison with a pair of scales is sometimes made when talking about the future of Europe and the future Constitution."
"On the one hand, the Union has to be democratic and open, and on the other hand, it has to be efficient and functional."
"We in Parliament have to watch over those scales and ensure that they do not tip at the expense of openness."
"I extend my greetings to the first European Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, whose last report we are discussing today, and thank him once more, on behalf of my group, for his work over many years."
"He has never ceased to emphasise that transparency and openness are the cheapest means of ensuring good administration and combating fraud."
"I shall not embark on a discussion of the Eurostat question here: that would lead us off on too much of a tangent."
"In addition, the annual reports by the Ombudsman have shown us how complaints by citizens regarding maladministration can lead to tangible improvements in the way in which the institutions work."
"In most cases, the institutions have reacted positively to the Ombudsman's comments and solutions have been found to the complaints."
"Sometimes, however, there is reluctance on the part of the institution concerned to change bad rules and practices."
"In that case, the Ombudsman can go to Parliament with a special report."
"Two matters of this kind are currently at issue."
"There is need of a common Code of Good Administrative Behaviour for all the institutions."
"Parliament decided on this on the basis of the Perry report."
"I still do not see why it should be so problematic, especially for the Commission, the very ones that should be setting a good example in this."
"Why are we waiting for the IGC when we could be taking the lead ourselves?"
"The other report, for which my colleague, Mrs Lambert, was rapporteur, concerns data protection and its use for the purposes of requiring confidentiality in matters that should actually be of a public nature."
"Two fundamental rights are at odds here: the right to information on the one hand, and the right to the protection of personal data on the other."
"I should like to ask the Commission, in this connection, how it intends to resolve this matter and the problems between our institutions."
"Mr President, I would like to respond very briefly."
"Let me begin by thanking the Commissioner, the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions and the Members of this House for their remarks, and particularly for their very warm words for Jacob Söderman and for the office that he built up and left behind."
"Let me very quickly say, in reply to Lord Stockton, that the Ombudsman has always extended invitations to Members, and has always had series of meetings with national ombudsmen."
"We had a meeting in Athens in April 2003, and we will be having another meeting of national ombudsmen in The Hague in 2005."
"So there are regular meetings being held on a biennial basis."
"At the Athens meeting the Chairman of the Petitions Committee, Mr Gemelli, was invited and attended and made a very valuable contribution."
"We intend to continue this pattern in the future as well."
"I also agree that it is vital that individuals feel there is someone going in to bat for them and we intend to do so and will continue to do so, as we have done in the past."
"With respect to the Commissioner's remarks, I would like to thank her for her kind words."
"In my position as Ombudsman I am very eager to work closely with the Commission in trying to promote the eventual adoption of what I would call 'a European administrative law'."
"I appreciate the fact that this has to be done in time so that what will come out will be applicable and will be best practice."
"I would urge the Commission to do this as quickly as possible."
"Certainly the IGC is important; we can start doing a number of things in preparation for that, so we can complete this task which would be a very welcome one."
"It would also complete the whole process of creating uniform administrative law as early as possible."
"I thank Mr Gemelli again for his remarks from which I retain the need for cooperation at all levels."
"It is very much my intention to work with people at the regional and local level."
"I have already been to Mr Gemelli's home country, I have also met with the original ombudsman and petitions committee of the Federal Republic of Germany."
"I have also been in Spain during the past week."
"Therefore, I have already visited three of the six countries in which there are a large number of regional and local ombudsmen, and I intend to continue to do so."
"I also very much welcome Mr Gemelli's strong endorsement of the idea that the IGC might deem it advisable to include in Part III of the draft Constitution an explicit recognition of non-judicial means of redress to complement the judicial means which, of course, are already explicitly recognised in that particular document."
"Let me also say with respect to the very important point that Mrs Thors made - and I would like to thank her again for her remarks - that I agree there is a legal vacuum and it needs to be examined."
"I would very much hope to be able to work with the Petitions Committee to improve this."
"The Statute also needs to be looked at again after the IGC and I will ensure that this is done."
"I am always on the lookout for areas where the Ombudsman may take initiatives to defend the rights of citizens."
"I also wish to take a judicious approach in this kind of matter;"
"I particularly do not wish to compete with Parliament when it comes to issues which pertain to its own political competence which ought to be left to the House itself to decide."
"Leaving that aside, I am very eager to work with Parliament in taking initiatives designed to strengthen the rights of citizens throughout the Union."
"Thank you very much for these suggestions."
"Thank you, Mr Söderman"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentleman, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, for all her input in the Committee on Petitions and the great understanding that she showed in dealing with all the Members and with me personally, in her work in the Committee on Petitions."
"She has now chosen to take the office of minister in the Asturias regional government, and we congratulate her on this appointment and wish her every success in the work that I am sure she will carry out with her usual sensitivity."
"I would also like to pay tribute to Mrs de Palacio, and to the Commission as a whole, for relations between European Commission officials and the Committee on Petitions have gradually been normalised and regularised, with the members of the Committee on Petitions becoming increasingly involved in Commission issues and with the officials working on the issues raised by the public ceasing to use bureaucratic language."
"This is testimony to the growth of the institution of petitions, the increase in citizens' awareness in approaching this body to make their problems known, in other words in the increase in awareness of European citizenship and of the European dimension that is gradually filtering through to the citizens."
"The statistics and data provided by Mrs González Álvarez show that the number of petitions, and the number of people signing them, has increased dramatically."
"This growth in the number of petitions and in the number of signatories shows the extent to which this House and the European Institutions are providing increasing guarantees where citizens' problems are concerned."
"The citizen is dwarfed by the gargantuan nature of the institutions and of globalisation."
"I believe that we certainly need to make the right to petition a reality and to make proper use of the institution of the Ombudsman and anything else that can help to increase the stature of the citizens in the face of the huge undertakings of the present and the future."
"We have also carried out a mission in Italy - the country currently holding the Council Presidency - calling for strengthening of this body, not least as part of the overall programme of the European Presidency."
"We met the minister, Mr Buttiglione, the deputy-ministers, Mr Caldoro and Mr Nucara, and the vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies, Mr Fiori, but, most importantly, we met with the four presidents of the bodies which, to some extent, take the place of a national ombudsman, that is Professor Rasi for privacy, Professor Ranci for energy, Professor Tesauro for competition and Professor Cheli for communications."
"We asked them to focus on the fate of the citizens in their areas of competence rather than resolving conflicts between companies and between institutions."
"Indeed, very often, these institutions are distracted by the need to resolve conflicts between powers."
"We, on the other hand, have an issue to resolve that is greater than conflict between powers: ensuring that these institutions are genuinely representative of the citizens."
"There must, therefore, be continual checks to monitor the adherence of the institutions to the mandate conferred on them by the citizens, and this will only be possible if we succeed in strengthening the role of these bodies designed to protect the citizens."
"I would like to add very briefly that, as the Committee on Petitions, we need to create an organic system within Parliament for consultation with other Committees, and this will probably be achieved by means of an internal parliamentary regulation."
"Furthermore, there should never be any conflicts of competences; rather, we must work together and cooperate."
"As regards own-initiative reports, I would like to say briefly that perhaps we should amend the Rules of Procedure in this regard too, for the own-initiative reports decided by the Conference of Presidents should certainly reach plenary, having already been processed at Committee level with the appointment of rapporteurs, the drafting of the report, and so forth, and they must not be blocked by any organ."
"If there has to be a filter, I believe that this should be applied as early as when the proposal to draft such a report is being considered."
"The third and final point relates to the restructuring of the Committee on Petitions."
"I am not in favour of nominalism."
"If the Committee on Petitions is not to remain as it is but is to perform other tasks, then it is absolutely necessary to provide for a restructuring of its secretariat; otherwise, this will not be possible."
"If the secretariat is to remain, with the same structure, then the Committee on Petitions cannot deal with anything else."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has been wonderful to start the day listening to people here actually trying to outdo one another with regard to the heartfelt praise that has been lavished on my fellow countryman, Jacob Söderman."
"I wish all the best to those continuing this work."
"As a fairly new member of the Committee on Petitions, it has been especially interesting for me to become acquainted with its work, which includes familiarising myself with its annual report."
"Particularly now, when we are having a debate on the future of the Committee on Petitions, it is excellent that we should have a report which, once you read it, makes you realise that the special position the Committee on Petitions has among the committees as a whole really cannot be emphasised enough."
"It is important, however, that good legislation should be enacted at European level, particularly in such areas as environmental protection, where problems do not recognise international borders."
"How, though, will it benefit us or the environment if Member States apply European legislation only when it does not clash with other interests?"
"Although the national authorities, and ultimately the courts, have the principal obligation to monitor compliance with Community legislation, there is also a need for European legal redress when citizens do not fulfil their obligations."
"As an ordinary citizen is not generally in a position to submit a matter to the Court of Justice of the European Communities to decide on, the options he or she is mainly left with are either to make a complaint to the Commission or to petition the European Parliament."
"It is, of course, primarily the task of the Commission to monitor compliance with EU legislation on behalf of the EU, but then again it does not always seem over-anxious to interfere in the affairs of the Member States."
"Petitions do not come from us in Finland or the other Nordic countries in any large numbers."
"One isolated case, which threatens the diversity of nature in Finland, is the Vuosaari Harbour Project in Helsinki, and that came under Community scrutiny having gone through this very petition process, an exercise the Finnish authorities have regarded as futile."
"Vuosaari is an example of a case in which the Commission has been unable, for one reason or another, to intervene."
"When you read Laura González Álvarez's report, you can, however, say that the Committee on Petitions has proved to be an excellent route to open democracy and real concrete results."
"Of course Mrs Aaltonen, depending on the example given, all points of view are understandable. If you had been present in the House when we discussed a very important 'national' issue - the notorious situation of a French company - you would have understood that the Commission does not deal with such matters."
"It is, however, true that many phrases were directed at Commissioner Monti that are normally not even used in Parliament debates."
"I am saying this to show that, in some cases, national issues do, where necessary, receive a lot of attention from the European Commission."
"Mr President, as Members know, it is customary in our speeches to congratulate the rapporteur."
"That I readily do in this case, but, like Mr Gemelli, the chairman of the committee, I want to go beyond what is conventional and especially place on record my appreciation of the work carried out over many years by Mrs González in the Committee on Petitions."
"She and I come from quite different points on the political spectrum but, in the Committee on Petitions, we all find that we share a common interest, regardless of nationality or politics, in protecting the rights of the individual citizen."
"Mrs González has undoubtedly been a doughty fighter for the citizens of Spain and particularly for the environment of her beloved country."
"The European Union is often accused of having a democratic deficit."
"Sometimes that is a fair criticism, sometimes perhaps it is over-stated, but the Committee on Petitions is a very real route by which citizens can bring their complaints to this Parliament and have them fully and properly addressed."
"I sometimes say that, in the Committee on Petitions, 'all human life is there'."
"I shall take some examples from my own country, the United Kingdom."
"We have British pensioners who retired to Spain - who is to blame them! - but the British Government did not want to give them the winter fuel allowance that they had paid for all their lives."
"It was only after petitioning this Parliament that they got that allowance."
"There is a German citizen currently living in my constituency who thought that he was entitled to a pension from the German Government."
"It refused to pay."
"He petitioned Parliament and the German Government consequently agreed to pay."
"Furthermore, the pension was back-paid to 1995, so that was a very welcome addition to his income."
"British customs services tried to stop British citizens using their rights to go to France to buy the fine wines for which that country is rightly renowned."
"As a result of petitions, that has been stopped and British Customs and Excise has been told that it must stop confiscating not just the wine, but also the cars of British citizens."
"Petitioning is a way of getting issues onto the floor of this House."
"Later on this morning, there will be a debate on the Lloyd's of London petitions."
"I too congratulate the Commission staff and officials."
"They respond very well to our requests."
"Unfortunately, the Council is not quite so agreeable."
"I look at the empty seats over there and see that the Council appears not to be interested either in the work of the Ombudsman or in the work of the Committee on Petitions."
"That is a shame."
"It is not the Italian presidency's fault; it is a long-standing problem involving all Councils."
"Before we are too congratulatory I would, however, draw attention to the problem of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour."
"I heard what Commissioner de Palacio said."
"I am sure her heart is in the right place, but it is high time that we had a code of administrative behaviour that was binding on the institutions, not voluntary, and a code that was uniform across each of the institutions."
"I do not consider that 2005 is remotely good enough."
"We have waited far too long to get this code and if the Commission would only adopt it, I am sure many of the problems the institutions currently face could be resolved."
"I thank Mrs González for her work."
"This committee may not rank as the greatest committee in Parliament but, in terms of protecting the citizens, it is the best."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Petitions certainly deserves our full attention. It often takes centre stage in the House, although it has actually been threatened with extinction at times."
"I should therefore like to take the opportunity provided by this latest overview to stress that this committee is the best indicator of a number of the difficulties experienced by citizens. It serves as a channel through which citizens can make us aware of their concerns and expectations."
"Unfortunately they sometimes also need to use it to express their disappointment with the European Union. The vast majority of petitions come from citizens who believe in European integration and in the hopes it awakens."
"I would not presume to lecture the House on the many objectives contained in existing and draft treaties."
"The report before us is excellent in that it endeavours to provide practical and sensible ways of achieving these objectives."
"In the report, the Committee on Petitions and its members state their clear commitment to direct democracy and demonstrate the strength of this commitment by assuming the role of citizens' representative."
"The Committee on Petitions, its members and its secretariat are an example to us all. They are constantly striving to improve their internal organisation so as to respond to the needs of the petitioners."
"I am sure all those present in the House today will be aware that my group and I are not inclined to mince our words when it comes to the European Commission. We never turn a blind eye towards it."
"I must, however, emphasise in this connection that the Commission's staff have provided a consistently high quality of service in relation to the Committee on Petitions. They produce concise and straightforward responses in plain language."
"It would be wonderful if these same qualities of humility and responsibility informed all of the work undertaken by the College of Commissioners and its services."
"Of course, differences and divisions do exist. However, rather than ignoring them, the Committee on Petitions has shown itself capable of overcoming them to find practical ways forward."
"For instance I could mention consideration of the report on the monitoring of the implementation of Community law. On that occasion, the Committee on Petitions twice requested the European Commission to seek political solutions acceptable to all and in particular, to seriously consider the need to draw up proposals for the review of those Community rules that are most often incorrectly implemented or appealed against."
"It is far more relevant to ensuring implementation of the law than engaging in an increasing number of legal proceedings. The latter only result in an unhelpful exaggeration of difficulties."
"Misunderstandings must be resolved first. The citizens want to be heard in a Europe that respects the democracy and diversity flourishing within it."
"They do not want to fall prey to a Europe in thrall to judges and procedures. The Committee on Petitions is all too often undervalued, as are the Ombudsmen."
"Mr President, with regard to a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour for all three institutions, the Commission is completely in agreement. I would insist, however, that it is best for us to wait until we know what is decided at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"That will make discussions a great deal simpler. It will also make it much simpler for the three institutions to adopt such a code and, above all, to do so with Parliament's full participation."
"At the moment, according to Article 308 of the Treaty, Parliament only has the right to give opinions and produce reports. It has no right of codecision, however."
"As I said a little while ago, I would insist on the need to postpone discussion of this issue for the moment."
"Moving on to the next question, I would say to Mrs Thors - I think it was her that asked me - that we in the Commission are prepared to review the current Interinstitutional Agreement."
"It is more accurate to call it an exchange of letters than an Interinstitutional Agreement, since that is what has governed the petitions procedure since 1989."
"I would remind the honourable Member, however, that it is actually Parliament's services which should take the initiative in revising this agreement. We are, therefore, waiting for them to come to us with a proposal, which we will then examine with the utmost interest, in the constructive spirit which I believe we have shown in recent times and which has been acknowledged by various honourable Members, such as Mrs Mathieu and Mr Gemelli, Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, in their speeches."
"I agree entirely with what both of you said, because I believe that tools such as this are key to safeguarding active and effective democracy in Europe."
"The democratic system relies on these tools to enable its citizens to enjoy their rights fully, to complain, in some cases, when they are wronged, and to do so not necessarily by following every twist and turn of the legal route, but by using simpler systems, which may sometimes be more effective."
"I thank all the honourable Members for their work."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
". Mr President, in 1997, an English lady, who is so fearful that she still has to remain known as Madam X, submitted a petition to this Parliament."
"She simply questioned whether the British Government was properly regulating Lloyd's of London in accordance with Insurance Directive 73/239/EEC."
"The same question or allegation has subsequently been made in other petitions, some signed by hundreds of Names and several on behalf of thousands."
"Since being appointed rapporteur I have come to know Madam X and she has told me her story."
"She recognised that by investing with Lloyd's and becoming a 'Name' - I should explain, for non-Anglophone listeners, that means a passive external investor whose affairs were managed by Lloyd's as approved agents - she recognised that she was exposing herself to unlimited liability."
"But she told me that she only took on that risk because she believed Lloyd's was regulated in accordance with British and European rules."
"Earlier this year Sir Nigel Sheinwald, the United Kingdom's Permanent Representative to the EU, sent a strongly-worded letter to Mr Gemelli, Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, effectively seeking to block this Parliament's right to get to the facts."
"I am pleased that our own legal services - who say Parliament must be very wary of attempts from representatives of other institutions to limit our powers - have confirmed that there is nothing in the rules to stop us having a parliamentary inquiry, so long as the terms of reference differ from any question before the courts in a Member State."
"Commissioner Bolkestein will speak for himself, but what he has said to the Petitions Committee, and his actions, clearly indicate that he has concerns about the regulation of Lloyd's. He sent long questionnaires and received responses."
"Unfortunately, those letters and responses have never been made public or made available to the Petitions Committee or to Parliament."
"The key question that the petitioners pose is this: does Lloyd's have the reserves to cover their liabilities, as Directive 73/239/EEC requires?"
"Answering that requires an audited statement of the reserves and an authoritative estimate of the liabilities."
"Perhaps the Commissioner can give us the figures - in particular with reference to the old liabilities at Lloyd's that they sought to separate in the scheme known as Equitas."
"The petitioners are not questioning this Parliament about the present regime, which the Commissioner now thinks may be satisfactory."
"They have asked us about the period from 1978, when the directive should have taken effect, to 2000, when they submitted their petitions - or, in Madam X's case, 1997."
"Was the directive being applied then?"
"The Commission so far is seeking to remain silent about that period, a period when the assets of the petitioners were being seized and some were being made bankrupt, when policy-holders were at risk if the reserves were not there and when other insurance undertakings across Europe were having to comply with the directive, a period when the English courts in various rulings said that Lloyd's did not have a system in place for making proper reserves."
"In 2000 Mr Justice Cresswell pointed out that the catalogue of failings and incompetence in the 1980s by underwriters, managing agents, members' agents, and others was staggering and brought disgrace on one of the City's great markets."
"I do not ask the Commissioner to take action against the British Government for any failings in that period."
"He has to bring a Member State into compliance."
"I simply ask for an authoritative answer - yes or no."
"Between 1978 and 2000 was the British Government correctly applying EU Insurance Directive 73/239/EEC?"
"I respect the Commissioner, I know him to be an honest man."
"I hope that we will be able to get a straight answer."
"There has been great pressure applied by the British Government, but this must not be a case where a big country is let off the hook."
"If the Commission can assure us and explain how the regulation respected the directive, that is an answer we can give to the petitioners."
"However, if the Commission believes that, prior to the adoption of the Financial Services Act, the British Government was not in compliance, it must say so."
"We need to get to the truth of what happened and why thousands were ruined."
"I hope the Commission will give formal answers."
"There should be no need to have a committee of inquiry."
"That is why I have tabled an amendment giving the Commission six weeks to give a full, authoritative and written answer to this House."
"However, failing that, Parliament must reserve its right to have the fullest inquiry into this lamentable case."
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for this new invitation to address the House and to provide you with the latest report on the progress of the Commission's investigations into this complex and very sensitive file."
"As many Members of Parliament will know, this is in fact the fourth time that I personally have had the opportunity to discuss the case with Members of Parliament, and in particular with Members of the Petitions Committee."
"In addition to my own appearances before Parliament, we have also kept Parliament fully informed of developments by regular, written updates supplemented by oral presentations made by my staff at meetings of the Petitions Committee."
"Furthermore, I have also responded to an extensive postbag from Members on the subject."
"In this way the Commission has sought to keep Parliament fully informed to the greatest extent procedurally possible."
"Given these extensive antecedents, I do not propose to go over the general background to this case."
"Rather, I would propose to focus on developments since I last spoke to this Parliament, which was at the Petitions Committee hearing on 22 January 2003."
"By letter dated 24 March 2003, the Commission received a comprehensive reply from the UK authorities to the supplementary letter of formal notice sent by the Commission on 23 January 2003 which expressed some residual concerns about the new regulatory regime for Lloyd's established under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000."
"After analysis of this reply, and further written and oral clarifications provided by the UK authorities, the Commission services consider that the new arrangements are compatible with the requirements of Directive 73/239/EEC - that is to say the First Non-life Assurance Directive, as amended."
"These requirements related primarily to the verification of solvency, the auditing arrangements, the adequacy of the administrative and accounting procedures and the internal control mechanisms."
"In order to respect the procedural rights of complainants, in the second half of July 2003 my services wrote to all complainants, as well as to petitioners who had not lodged a formal complaint, explaining the results of this preliminary analysis and indicating the intention of the services to propose that the Commission should close the case."
"My services are now completing their analysis of the responses received from complainants before preparing a proposal for a final decision on the case by the College of Commissioners."
"In accordance with Parliament's wish, we shall be seeking to take this decision as quickly as possible, before the end of October 2003."
"Most of the comments received related to the past situation, before the introduction of the FSMA 2000."
"As I have already explained to this Parliament and to complainants, the objective of infringement proceedings under Community law is to ensure or restore the compatibility of national law with Community law, not to rule on the past compatibility or incompatibility of the prior regime."
"That is a task - I say this in particular to Mr Perry - for national courts to address."
"From the beginning of our investigations into this complex and sensitive file, we have repeatedly made it clear to complainants that any action for damages must be undertaken before national courts."
"Indeed, I understand that, currently, such an action has been instigated by a group of complainants before UK courts."
"Therefore, in accordance with the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice, the task of the Commission is to examine the compatibility of the new regime with the requirements of the insurance directives."
"During our investigations, access to the file has been a hotly-debated subject."
"From my opening comments I trust Members will recognise that, throughout the conduct of its enquiries, the Commission has always sought to keep Parliament fully informed to the greatest extent possible."
"As the report by the Petitions Committee recognises, the Commission is bound by point 1.5 of Annex III to the Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission."
"This provides that information on infringement procedures remains confidential until a final Commission decision is made."
"Clearly, after a final decision, the Commission will make documents available, subject to any remaining confidentiality constraints."
"Assuming a decision is taken by the College of Commissioners to close the case, the Commission will, in response to a formal request from Parliament, provide file access in accordance with the Framework Agreement subject to the respect of any confidentiality requirements imposed by the UK on documents which it has prepared."
"Furthermore, general public access to the file will be granted in accordance with the terms of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"Lastly, I would like briefly to touch upon an issue which, in the light of the extensive contacts we have enjoyed with Parliament, I had hoped would not be necessary."
"There are those who imply that, in the conduct of its enquiries, the Commission has exposed itself to accusations of maladministration and unnecessary delay."
"Let me be clear."
"Despite the complexity and sensitivity of the case and the considerable volume of correspondence received, the Commission has always sought to carry out its investigations as rapidly as possible, consistent with due process and thorough investigation, while subject to real constraints on resources."
"Petition 318/2000 runs to seven lever-arch A4 files."
"The Commission has carefully examined complaints and entered into substantial and sustained communication with complainants."
"Two press releases were issued and sent to all complainants and petitioners."
"Furthermore, as I have just said, in accordance with the procedural safeguards for complainants, the Commission services have written to all complainants informing them of the results of the Commission's preliminary analysis and seeking their comments."
"Finally, an allegation of Commission maladministration has recently been examined by Mr Diamandouros, the European Ombudsman, and rejected by him."
"In particular, may I respectfully remind Parliament that Mr. Diamandouros specifically considered allegations of Commission maladministration regarding access to files and examination of the current regulatory regime, as opposed to the past, pre-FSMA 2000 regime."
"In both cases Mr Diamandouros found no maladministration."
"I have spoken somewhat longer than I would have preferred but, given the importance of the case and the tragic stories that surround it, I wanted to be crystal clear in my statement to this Parliament."
"In closing, let me again assure you, President, of the willingness of the Commission to cooperate fully with Parliament."
"This cooperation is, however, always subject to the legal constraints imposed on the Commission."
"As on previous occasions, I would be very happy to try and answer any further questions you might have."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to thank Mr Bolkestein, for whom I have no questions."
"I would merely like to retrace our steps in this debate for a moment to, when talking about petitions and the gargantuan ventures brought about by globalisation, I made an analogy: the citizen and the giant."
"There is an enormous discrepancy between the citizen and the giant."
"Parliament should now ask itself what it can to do protect citizen's rights."
"This is a situation - as Mr Perry has made very clear by mentioning a case in point - which affects many citizens who have gone bankrupt."
"There are a large number of trials under way in the United States and some in Europe too with many in the United Kingdom."
"How can we not wonder what the solution to this situation is and how it will develop?"
"How can we not ask Parliament, how can we not even ask ourselves what we should do to resolve this situation?"
"Lloyd's of London is a large institution, which still enjoys worldwide credibility, but clearly, at some point, something happened, there was some error, because, otherwise, there would not have been this proliferation of cases reported by the citizens."
"There are now those who are calling for a committee of inquiry to be set up and those who oppose this, but it is not a problem that must be resolved in court, not least because we do not want to start legal proceedings, because we are not qualified to start proceedings and because we do not want there to be adverse parties."
"All we want to do is respond to the requests of the citizens, because this is our mandate: a mandate of representation that we must fulfil completely by representing both the citizens and institutions such as Lloyd's of London."
"Instead, I want to understand why this situation exists."
"If the Commission's reply, when it arrives, is not comprehensive, then only an inquiry which we can carry out without any pressure will reveal the crux of the matter, the gap, the loophole through which this great mistake, which has caused so much harm, managed to slip."
"Mr President, it is very easy to react on emotion but this House should not react on emotion, it should react on facts."
"That is why I cannot support this report."
"I believe it to be highly selective and deeply flawed."
"It fails to give a balanced assessment."
"The quotes used in the report are highly selective and outside the context, and therefore fail to give a fair summary of the legal situation."
"There are errors of fact, for example relating to the Lloyd's accounting system."
"Closed accounts do not, as is suggested, come back to life. Rather, as with all insurance, claims are made against a policy after it has ended."
"The report states that directives have not been implemented."
"This is an opinion."
"It has not been proven."
"Also, the report does not detail the substantial efforts made by Lloyd's to alleviate the Names' losses."
"But there were also problems within the Committee on Petitions."
"I repeatedly pointed out that the way Mr Perry was trying to set up a committee of inquiry was not the correct way, was against the Rules of Procedure and, indeed, the Treaties."
"Sir Nigel Sheinwald did not seek to block an inquiry, but pointed out quite rightly, that any inquiry should be within the Rules of Procedure and indeed our Treaties."
"Let me quote the relevant section of his letter."
"He believes that 'they do not permit a committee of inquiry to be established where the alleged facts are being examined before a court and while the case is still subject to legal proceedings'."
"As we have heard from the Commissioner, there is now a case before the Appeal Court of the United Kingdom, and it is right that we should be very careful and considered before we set up a committee of inquiry."
"Again, Mr Perry has used comments and quotes from the Jaffrey case in the Court of Appeal selectively."
"I could go on and on, but let me reassure Mr Perry."
"The PSE Group will vote in favour of his amendments."
"I believe his amendments actually tie up some of the problems that we have been dealing with."
"Indeed I am pleased that at my suggestion Parliament's services have called for other changes and, in particular, the deletion of Mr Perry's insistence in paragraph 5 that his explanatory statement should be incorporated into the resolution."
"These are just some concrete examples of changes that had to be made to a deeply flawed report."
"I will finish on this."
"If, in this Parliament, we raise expectations for citizens and petitioners that we cannot meet, we do so at our peril."
"Mr Perry's process throughout has been genuine and sincere, but I believe he is raising expectations that cannot be met."
"He is demanding documents that he knows cannot be supplied."
"I am the author of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"Mr Perry is making demands of the Commission for an inquiry which he knows the Commission cannot make."
"Finally, the PSE Group will support this but, in all honesty I have to say to the House, with my hand on my heart, I cannot support this report and therefore I will not."
"Mr President, along with many British Members of this House, I have received a large number of personal letters from constituents like the petitioners in this case."
"I welcome Mr Perry's dogged work on behalf of those petitioners, and confirm that my Group will support the report."
"However, there is a wider issue at play here, which affects the good functioning of Community law."
"I was a rapporteur for the last two years on the reports on the implementation and monitoring of Community law."
"As a Parliament we then called on the Commission to improve its infringement procedures and its dealings with complainants, calling in particular for correspondence passing between the Commission and the Member States to be made available."
"This is the area that any committee of inquiry should, and can, examine: the Commission's carrying out of its supervisory duty in implementing Community law."
"This need have nothing whatever to do with the current English High Court proceedings."
"It is about getting an answer for our citizens."
"Any committee of inquiry must get to grips with this central question about the efficiency of infringement proceedings."
"It must be said that this history goes back a long way to 1997."
"With the greatest respect to the Commissioner - and I have the utmost respect for his work - to say that everything is in order now is not entirely satisfactory."
"If the Commission cannot carry out its role as Guardian of the Treaties, this is really very serious and the whole legal framework of the Union can accordingly be brought into disrepute and called into question."
"We have to provide answers for our citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my group supports the report by Mr Perry."
"The EU Treaties acknowledge that it may be necessary to subject European matters to parliamentary scrutiny."
"In so doing, it is not the intention to call into question the work of the Commission in monitoring the proper application of EU law by the Member States."
"Sometimes, however, the Commission does not want to tread on the toes of the governments of some Member States."
"What worries me, however, is that I sometimes have the same feeling about our own Parliament, for example in connection with the Prestige."
"Why should we give up our right to expose incorrect application of EU law by authorities and governments of Member States?"
"Reading the report about the Lloyd's Petitions left me, in the first place, with the impression that matters remain which require further clarification."
"In the second place, it seems to me that neither the government of the United Kingdom nor the European Commission wants to go into this in more detail, although you have made an overture."
"We are curious."
"In the third place, some fellow Members seem more keen on protecting their own governments than adopting a responsible attitude towards citizens and demonstrating that the law is the same for everyone."
"Mr President, I would like to thank most sincerely our rapporteur Mr Perry for his report on the Lloyd's Petitions which date back to 1997."
"The issues, arising from multi-billion-euro losses in the '80s and the '90s, many related to asbestos, can only be dealt with satisfactorily through the establishment of a committee of inquiry."
"This matter is not going to go away."
"A resolution is clearly overdue and the question of compensation cannot be side-stepped."
"At the heart of the issue is the failure to implement properly the 1973 First Non-life Assurance Directive and subsequent relevant directives."
"Many investors were bankrupted, some committed suicide and we need to know why, who was at fault and why there was a delay in the implementation of European Union law."
"The petitioners and complainants invested in what they thought was a properly regulated market according to UK and EU law."
"Would they have invested if they had been aware of the undisclosed liabilities?"
"We have to take seriously the claims that a proper audit into the firms was not carried out."
"If it had been carried out, then the extent of the potential losses might have been discovered."
"The huge losses and the needless human suffering might have been avoided."
"The Lloyd's petitioners are not only from the UK: they come from my country, Ireland, as well, and indeed also from Denmark and Germany, not to mention the investors who brought cases before the courts in the United States."
"Still there is no resolution of the problem at European Union level, still the Commission sits on the fence and speaks about the complexity of the issue."
"Complex or not, the petitioners have a right to know why European Union rules for the regulation of Lloyd's were not properly implemented."
"An in-depth inquiry is needed to answer all these questions; after all we are dealing with investors who, if catastrophe strikes, have to pay and pay to the point where they can lose their businesses and their homes."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his careful, accurate and detailed analysis of this case."
"While I am now reasonably content with the outcome of Mr Perry's report, I must, in the interests of balance, make some comments."
"Mr Perry's explanatory statement does not give a fair and balanced account of the circumstances surrounding the underwriting losses of Lloyd's members in the 1980s."
"I would cite in particular its highly selective use of material and its failure to reflect the full findings of the UK Court of Appeal in the Jaffrey case, including its view that it was only with the benefit of hindsight that reserves established by syndicates for asbestos liabilities in the 1980s proved to be inadequate, given the unanticipated way in which those liabilities developed."
"Of course I have tremendous sympathy for the Names who suffered these underwriting losses, among whom are a number of my friends, including the godparents of one of my own children."
"Yet, since I became involved in this case, I have been subjected to a torrent of abuse and vituperation, including anonymous abusive telephone calls to my home accusing me of being a paid agent of Lloyd's. Since 97% of the Lloyd's Names have accepted the renewal plan of 1996 and they have been able to reduce their liabilities by significant amounts, this issue has by and large been covered fully."
"As stated in all the advertisements: you cannot guarantee that past profit is an indication of future gain."
"The focus of Mr Perry's report and the real allegation of the petitioners is, as I understand it, that the UK Government failed to implement the terms of EU insurance law correctly in its supervision of Lloyd's. The UK Government denies this allegation."
"The real place to adjudicate, therefore, is in a court of law."
"That is exactly what is happening, as there is now such a case before the English High Court."
"These are complex legal issues."
"Parliament should let the legal process run its course and allow the Court to reach a proper decision."
"Meanwhile, I encourage the Commission to respond to those issues raised in this report and to reply as fully as possible."
"While we need answers as soon as is reasonable, I would caution against a rush to judgment."
"In conclusion, I urge this House to support Mr Perry's amended report and, until the due process has been exhausted, go no further."
"Mr President, Mr Perry has drafted a report and has presented certain elements of the Lloyd's case to us."
"The Commissioner has given us a series of enlightening explanations today which are indeed valuable."
"And Mr Cashman contests Mr Perry's information."
"What emerges from this?"
"That our concern at this moment in time is not the substance of the matter, nor are we a court."
"Our concern at this moment in time is this, and only this: after five years of reports, we want to maintain the credibility of our committee and, consequently, our problem is whether we shall receive a definitive answer as to the extent to which the directive was or was not applied."
"That is our only concern."
"I am seizing this opportunity to generalise this concern, because today we had the reports from the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions."
"The Lloyd's issue came to the Committee on Petitions with petitions from citizens."
"The Ombudsman was also involved, as the Commissioner said, in the issue of the extent to which the Commission did its job properly."
"And, of course, it is a question of the application of Community law."
"What emerges from this?"
"That the two twin rights, of accusation and petition, are interlinked."
"They should not therefore be debated separately."
"Secondly, with these two reports, the whole issue of the proper application of Community law is involved; in other words, the extent to which this report should also be jointly debated today."
"I therefore propose to Parliament, the Commission and my honourable friends that we look at the possibility of examining these reports jointly because, materially, they are the only reports which directly concern the European citizen."
"As, therefore, we are all interested in reinforcing the participation of the European citizen, I think we should give some emphasis to this debate and I even think that we should declare the day of the debate in Parliament to be the day of the European citizen."
"Thus, we shall be reliable and we shall say that we really are interested in their rights."
"Now, what we are calling for, after five years, is a clear picture at least of what is going on."
"So what we want is to obtain this clear picture in a short space of time because Mr Cashman may in fact be right."
"However, we do not know at this moment who is right."
"And the Commission has indeed been neglectful."
"Thus, I shall raise the more general concern."
"The Committee on Petitions often delays its final conclusions because we have a time-consuming procedure on the part of the Commission on the question of petitions."
"Could it not shorten this period of time so that we too are more credible in the eyes of the European citizens who come and say to us, it has been eighteen months and we have not had a reply?"
"These are the more general concerns that are being aired in today's debate and I think it is a golden opportunity for us to use them in the interest, naturally, of the European Union, but more importantly, for us to give European citizens to understand that we stand by them."
"Mr President, I should like to support the proposals in the Perry report, but first I should like to point out that Commissioner Bolkestein has indeed provided a great deal more recent information and clarification on the subject."
"However, the problem remains, as my honourable friend Mr Koukiadis has highlighted in such a proper and constructive manner, that we do not have clear answers to the following: the British government was obviously very late in transposing into national legislation the directive which should also have applied in Great Britain to the issue of the private insurance which would also cover the Lloyd's case."
"Similarly, there is doubt as to whether it transposed it correctly."
"In addition, questions arise as to if it is applying it correctly and consistently ensuring it is complied with."
"A large number of names, who are, as it were, the shareholders - it is a very particular regime - were obliged, because they were not informed or information was withheld from them and as a result of the omissions by the British government which I referred to earlier, to use all their assets to pay compensation for insurance risks of which they maintain they were ignorant."
"Thus, many of them were ruined, we are talking about huge assets, while despair led some of them to suicide."
"The victims include some of my fellow countrymen, Greeks, the dramatic protests of whom have been accumulating for 2-3 years now in my office and in the Committee on Petitions of which I also have the honour of being a member."
"The efforts by the Committee on Petitions to be fully enlightened by the Commission about this tragic affair and by the British government - we have held a meeting in camera - are not bearing fruit, at least not when it comes to informing us."
"Adequate answers are not being given to the questions which we have repeatedly formulated and this silence on the part of the British government, which refuses to notify its answers to the Committee on Petitions, has also been supported by the Commission."
"Thus, we cannot form a clear and full picture of exactly how this complex affair stands and to what extent there is responsibility by reason of negligence and/or abuse on the part of the British government as the result of delay, imperfect transposition and erroneous application of the directives on private insurance."
"The above comments, which may wrong the British government and the European Commission, do not appear to have affected either one or the other to date."
"The European citizens believe that their voice should be heard and it is an opportunity to restore the credibility and validity of the European Union and of our institution vis-à-vis the citizens."
"If we move without transparency and without account being taken of the citizens' side, then we fail as a European institution at a crucial turning point in the overall development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all three rapporteurs for their excellent work, but especially Mrs Laura González Álvarez, whom we miss greatly in the committee."
"The role of the Committee on Petitions is to ascertain whether national and local authorities are implementing and applying EU directives properly."
"We are therefore obliged constantly to enter into disputes with national governments or ministries, and sometimes the European Commission also launches infringement proceedings."
"Obviously this is not to the advantage of the government concerned, but we are here - and that is how I understand my work in the committee - to protect the public."
"These Lloyd's petitions are unpleasant, not only for the former and current British governments, but also for the European Commission, which hesitated as early as 1978 to take steps against the United Kingdom."
"The circumstances surrounding the exchange between the Commission and the British Government on Lloyd's were very curious."
"But just what is the so-called Lloyd's scandal?"
"Lloyd's had recruited Names without making these people aware that it was facing huge insurance losses, mainly due to rulings in the USA on asbestos cases."
"The Lloyd's management then passed these losses on to the Names."
"As a result many lost their assets and some the only provision that they had made for their retirement."
"It was not only Britons that were affected but also Belgians and Germans."
"A few even took their own lives."
"Now we could say very coldly, 'Well, hard luck!'"
"But no, these people were confident that the insurance market was regulated and that British and EU law would be respected."
"I am standing between two highly esteemed British colleagues, namely Roy Perry and Michael Cashman."
"I am very pleased that a compromise has been reached, but I also deeply regret the fact that this report has caused such a political upheaval."
"I welcome the compromise and hope that it will enable us to bring justice to the petitioners and help to ensure that such a tragedy does not happen again."
"Mr President, I shall try to be brief in my reply to Members of Parliament and their questions."
"Mrs Wallis asked whether the Commission is really the Guardian of the Treaties in this case."
"I would like to reply to her and other Members that yes, we are, and that is the reason the Commission has sent two letters of formal notice."
"The Commission did not send those letters of formal notice for nothing, there were reasons for doing so."
"The UK Government has reacted and now, as I said earlier, the legislation is brought into line with European law."
"It is the duty of the Commission to ensure that this happens."
"At the centre of this debate is the question as to the role of the Commission."
"The role of the Commission, as I have said time and again, is to see that present legislation is in line with present European law."
"Let me give another example that also concerns the United Kingdom."
"The United Kingdom has instructed its customs authorities to impound quantities of alcohol and cigarettes in excess of what it thinks is reasonable for personal consumption."
"The Commission has judged that these actions are disproportionate to the purpose sought."
"Therefore the Commission has sent two letters of formal notice, the process of negotiation and discussion with the UK authorities has started and the UK authorities have brought their instructions into line with what the Commission thinks ought to be done."
"However, the people who have had their cars impounded have still not received any redress for the loss that they have suffered."
"Mr Perry and Mrs Wallis might well say that the Commission should do something about it, see to it that those who have had their cars impounded get compensation for their loss."
"My reply to them would be the same as my reply in this case - that is not the job of the Commission."
"Therefore the matter of compensation for previous losses must be left to the national judicial authorities and, as has been remarked this morning, there is now a lawsuit which has been brought before the High Court in London."
"Therefore, with all the sympathy I have for people who have undergone these tragic occurrences, some of whom have taken their own lives, I cannot go further than the law allows me to."
"Therefore, it is not true, as Mr Collins said, that the Commission is sitting on the fence."
"The Commission is not sitting on the fence, but it cannot go beyond the bounds of what it is allowed to do."
"That is what I would like to say."
"It is not a question of David versus Goliath, as Mr Gemelli said, it is a matter of what the legal bounds of the Commission are."
"The Ombudsman has dealt with the matter of transparency and I have nothing more to add, except to say that the matter of the committee of inquiry is something I must leave up to Parliament."
"It is not for me to judge whether the circumstances are present for such a committee, nor whether the process hitherto has been correct."
"That I must leave in the hands of Parliament: I will respect its outcome."
"Mr President, in his speech Mr Cashman made various quite serious allegations."
"I concede that he has been consistent throughout in seeking to block this report by every means and at every turn."
"I would simply ask you to confirm that the action of the House in receiving this report is fully in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and that it is acceptable."
"As regards paragraph 5 concerning the accompanying explanatory statement, I am more than ready to make an oral amendment to my report that the explanatory statement, in accord with our usual practice, should not be included with the report."
"It is the report that is important, but I would welcome your confirmation on that point."
"Mr Perry, I can confirm that Parliament's services have carried out careful checks as to whether this report is acceptable, and have come to the conclusion that it is indeed acceptable."
"Mr Cashman has the floor."
"Mr President, I agree that the report as it stands is now admissible, but that is because changes were made that I and Parliament's services asked for and which the services upheld."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.59 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)"
"The next item is the vote."
". Mr President, following discussions between the PSE Group and the PPE-DE Group, I would like to put forward the following oral amendment to Amendment No 152: 'The Commission shall assess the need to lay down, at a European level, definitions of central counter-party and clearing and settlement systems."
"On the basis of this assessment, the Commission shall submit a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.'"
"It is my great pleasure to welcome to the Official Gallery today a Delegation from the Russian Federal Assembly, led by the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma and Co-Chairman of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, Mr Vladimir Lukin, and Mr Alexander Evstifeev of the Federation Council."
"The delegation has been attending the sixth meeting of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee in Strasbourg."
"We now continue with the vote."
"Report (A5-0292/2003) by Giorgio Lisi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in decorative paints and varnishes and vehicle refinishing products and amending Council Directive 1999/13/EC (COM(2002) 750 - C5-0632/2002 - 2002/0301(COD))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution"
"Mr President, the oral amendment regards the replacement of almost all of paragraph 22. The whole of the first part should be replaced with the following: The European Parliament 'undertakes to organise, at the beginning of 2004, in cooperation with the Inter-parliamentary Union, a new parliamentary conference on the WTO with a view to discussing?'"
"The rest remains unchanged."
"I believe that this text is clearer and I hope that all the Members will be able to accept it."
"Mr President, before moving on to the Cashman report, I would like to point out that we have received an erratum which is not really an erratum at all."
"It makes a correction to the Cashman report in respect of Parliament's support for the T-84/03 proceedings against the Council for reasons of transparency."
"The erratum uses the phrase 'discuss the European Parliament's participation', while the original text says 'support' such participation."
"I do not understand how this erratum came about, given the fact that, as far as we are concerned, the original text stands."
"Mr President, before we vote on the resolution as a whole, could you please confirm that the President of Parliament has ruled that the words 'and accompanying explanatory statement' in paragraph 5 may be deleted?"
"It was a positive step that at second reading of this draft directive it was recognised that traditional practice in public sector bodies with regard to the use of public sector information has developed in very disparate ways, and this should therefore be taken into consideration."
"It was also a positive step to recognise the right of any citizen, any natural or legal person residing in a Member State, to have access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents."
"When adopting rules on the scope for commercial re-use of these documents, however, it must be ensured that it is not the market that sets prices."
"Allowing the market to set prices prevents them from rising excessively high, which is positive; however, it means that access to information by certain interested parties may be impaired."
"Hence, it is important that the Member States should find ways of making basic information available free of charge, ensuring that it is accessible to all, especially via the Internet and other accessible means, and paying particular attention to people with disabilities."
"I reiterate my support for Mrs Read's proposed amendment to the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on the multi-annual programme (2003-2005) for the monitoring of eEurope, dissemination of good practices and the improvement of network and information security (MODINIS)."
"She wishes to ensure a minimum sum of EUR 21 million for this programme."
"It is in Parliament's interest to have valid initiatives with at least the resources they need to achieve their objectives."
"Despite the budget restrictions to which we are subject, we have to guarantee the efficiency and effectiveness of the measures we want to implement."
"The Commission wants to update the legislation that has governed the financial markets since 1993, a central, structural element in the creation of a European capital market, the final objective of the financial services action plan included in the 'Lisbon Strategy'."
"The report supports the main thrusts of this directive, despite the differences in ISD model championed by the investment capital lobbies - between the choice of a model known as the 'Anglo-Saxon' model, in which investment firms compete fiercely with the stock exchanges, backing the City of London and opening the door to US investment capital, and a system known as the 'continental' system, more firmly based on the stock exchanges and preferred by French investment capital."
"What is at stake, then, is market domination by the investment capital of one country or another, while the degree of liberalisation of such capital and its various operators increases, raising enormous amounts of capital through pension funds and the privatisation of social security."
"At the same time, elementary prudential rules and the transparency of operations are also at stake because of their cost."
"This objective, which we reject, is supposed to be efficient, but has contributed to the increased instability and volatility of the financial markets, with impacts on the real economy and consequences for economic growth and jobs."
"Nowadays, much more than ever, there are large amounts of money lying around throughout the world: money belonging to individual savers, small banks, insurance companies and pension funds."
"Internationally operating companies that offer high returns have taken a large proportion of that money for themselves and with it gained control over the pension funds, too."
"This kind of company does not produce anything, but has obtained a dominant position by forming a bridge between those wanting to receive interest or dividends and those who need capital for their activities."
"These are chiefly US companies with a branch in London."
"Ten years ago, a directive was adopted for investment services such as this, and that now needs to be updated."
"The question is, then, what purpose that modernisation serves."
"Will it result in better protection for savers and pension funds against financial adventurers, or, on the contrary, in greater freedom for those who administer so much money?"
"The rapporteur wants to reduce bureaucracy and costs, and creates a string of exemptions to the transparency she accepts only with difficulty."
"The obligation to seek out the best deals for clients, as well as low transaction costs and investment products suitable for the client fades into the background."
"The large groups are divided on account of national interests, and so the investment companies get their own way."
"The Commission's proposal for a directive aims to protect investors (by setting harmonised requirements for the activities of authorised intermediaries) and help investment firms to operate at European level."
"As this is a framework directive, it confines itself to defining the general high-level obligations that the Member States' authorities should fulfil."
"It tries not to impose a specific market structure but to be flexible enough to accommodate the diversity of market structures in the various countries, as well as facilitating and promoting innovation in an environment of cooperation among national authorities."
"It clarifies and completes the list of financial instruments that can be negotiated on the regulated markets and between investment firms; it updates and harmonises the regulatory conditions that investment firms must fulfil, both at the time of the initial authorisation and subsequently; and it enhances the practical implementation of the 'single passport' for investment firms, reaffirming and extending the principle by which companies should be able to operate throughout the European Union on the basis of the authorisation and supervision provided by the competent authorities in their Member State of origin."
"The proposal touched - and touches - on sensitive, delicate issues, as was quite clear during the debates in the specialist committee, but in view of the balanced compromise position put forward by the rapporteur, Theresa Villiers, whom I warmly congratulate, I voted for it."
"Mr President, we voted against this report as British Conservatives because although we are in favour of much of what is in the report - we are particularly pleased to see that classic and vintage vehicles will be exempted - we are concerned about the principle of substitution."
"This means that a product could be banned if another product that is safer or more environmentally benign is proven to be so."
"The problem is that sometimes these judgments are marginal."
"Also, it is a big threat to research and development."
"Companies will not bring products to the market if they think that at the stroke of a pen their product will be removed from the market."
"Lastly, it is very dangerous for consumers, as it will create a monopoly situation in the product market with subsequent price increases."
"We voted against to register our displeasure about this particular aspect and this is something that we will also need to fight a big battle on when it comes to the forthcoming Chemicals Directive."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"I am opposed to the amendment which aims to increase the maximum boiling point for a volatile organic compound from 250°C to 280°C. Since this has practically no environmental benefits, and since it is even doubtful whether it complies with the eco-labelling rules, this amendment may have highly negative repercussions for paint-manufacturing SMEs."
"I congratulate Mr Lisi on his excellent report."
"The high level of public health protection to which the European Union aspires means that great care must be taken when placing on the market and/or distributing products containing substances that are hazardous to human health."
"On the other hand, the commitments to sustainable development, the introduction of national emission ceilings and the adoption of 'cross-compliance' ideas (aiming at greater environmental awareness by industry) are furthered by this type of proposal."
"I particularly welcome the fact that representatives of the industries affected have been following the progress of this dossier, handled so well by Mr Lisi, an essential arrangement if we want operators to be fully aware, to take part and to accept their responsibilities - after all, the proposal may affect some 50 000 plants in the Community."
"I also agree with the proposed two-stage approach to reduce the volatile organic compound (VOC) content in decorative paints and varnishes covered by the directive, so as to leave the sectors affected enough time to adapt."
"It was also a positive step, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, to allow the Member States to establish and implement their own market control mechanisms."
"Parliament's adoption of certain excessive amendments contrary to the rapporteur's views led me, however, to abstain in the final vote, although I voted for the legislative resolution."
"The report's analysis of the first year of implementation of the regulation is relatively positive, with great progress having been made by the European institutions."
"I welcome the fact that an increasing number of documents has been made available to the public, that registers have been created and that the citizens are becoming increasingly aware of their right of access to the documents."
"This regulation is important in that it lays down new rights for public access to the documents of the Community institutions, and it is a major step towards establishing greater openness and transparency regarding their activities, strengthening the democratic principle on which the European Union is based."
"There still remain countless problems of access, the main one of which is the relatively high percentage of documents refused, with access to certain types of documents being systematically refused."
"It is regrettable that in 38% of cases the Commission invoked 'unspecified exception' as the reason for refusal."
"The necessary measures need to be put in place to achieve full compliance in the implementation of the regulation and to ensure complete transparency and the right of access to documents by the citizens."
"This right of access has been confirmed in the draft Constitutional Treaty, which extends the obligation to transparency to all institutions, agencies and bodies."
"In connection with the request by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to 'support the European Parliament's participation' in the T-84/03 proceedings against the Council, the Legal Service has, with the consensus of the political leaders in the European Parliament, put forward a text for adoption which aims to 'discuss the European Parliament's participation' via an erratum."
"The proceedings I instigated against the Council relate to issues of transparency, including, not least, the secrecy of legal opinions, and concern not only the rights of citizens to access documents to carry out democratic scrutiny of the behaviour of the institutions, as they are entitled to do, but also the rights of the Members."
"The umpteenth trick of the Legal Services, with the collusion of the political leaders of the European Parliament, has been to overturn the decisions taken by a parliamentary committee which were to be put to the vote in plenary."
"The Legal Services of the European Institutions are a corporation which enjoys the greatest freedom to act and whose initiatives are not subject to any control."
"The impunity which the Legal Services enjoys is detrimental to the rights of the institutions, of Parliament, of the Members and of the citizens, while the actions of the political leaders of Parliament are typical of a bunch of cronies seeking protection."
"The Spanish delegation of the Group of the Party of European Socialists voted against Amendment No 7 to paragraph 11."
"This delegation cannot accept this text's mention of an agricultural product - cotton - and its recommendation that assistance to that sector be reviewed and restricted."
"It would have a direct impact on more than 10 000 Spanish farmers and their families, and would generate an unjustifiable and intractable socio-economic problem."
"It is a positive step to try to achieve the millennium development objectives, which include eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; guaranteeing universal primary education; promoting equality between men and women and giving women a voice; reducing infant mortality; improving mothers' health; fighting HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; guaranteeing environmental sustainability; and promoting a global partnership for development."
"It is a positive step to underline the importance of the new commitments made at Johannesburg, even though they are so limited."
"One must not, however, forget that the failure of the negotiations at the Fifth WTO Ministerial Conference at Cancún was due to the refusal of the more-developed countries to find solutions that were fair to the developing countries."
"They continued to ignore the need to forgive the less-developed countries their debts, and held out for their own priorities, particularly the Singapore issues, rather than the need for fair trade and sustainable development."
"We therefore demand that the European Union should not take up the four Singapore issues again and should immediately withdraw all the requirements it imposed on other countries during the negotiations on services, particularly the liberalisation of water and other public services."
"In the past, the west coast of Europe became rich as a result of colonial conquests and of controlling the economy in the Third World."
"Instead of being able to achieve self-sufficiency in agriculture, mining and industry, Third World countries were forced to gear production towards an export economy."
"The Third World had to supply cheap raw materials, and subsequently buy expensive industrial products from Europe."
"That was the formula that kept those countries poor."
"They have since obtained political independence: the Latin American countries almost two centuries ago now, and the South Asian and African countries half a century ago."
"They can now offer some resistance."
"They tried this in the 1960s with the Non-Aligned Movement."
"Following a long interval, they did it again during the Cancún WTO Ministerial Conference."
"I by no means share the indignation at their actions which prevails here."
"The European Commission and a large proportion in this Parliament are still assuming that protests from the Third World have only delayed an inevitable development towards international free trade and protection of foreign investments, and that the desires of Europe and the US still have to be complied with."
"In the meanwhile, we continue with export subsidies for our agricultural surpluses and tobacco cultivated solely for export."
"It is time that we made room for another economic development model."
"For these reasons, I am casting a 'no' vote."
"No leadership will last if it is not credible."
"Thus, a year after we led the Johannesburg Summit, our credibility now depends first of all on our ensuring that the goals and timetables of the implementation plan that came out of Johannesburg are achieved through our action at home."
"The truth is that, one year on, the European Union Member States that have begun to transpose the Johannesburg commitments into their national policies are few and far between."
"Secondly, it depends on our action abroad, to endow the Johannesburg commitments with monitoring, assessment and enforcement methods that are transparent and binding."
"Transparency and commitments are two sides of the same coin."
"Thirdly, it means we must launch an international debate on reforming institutions."
"We have new goals and new timetables governed by old institutions."
"If we want to regulate globalisation, it is essential to reform some of the existing institutions - such as the World Trade Organization, the World Bank and the United Nations - giving them the social and environmental ambition that they do not have at the moment, and also to create new institutions, such as a World Environment Organisation and an International Court for Environmental Crimes."
"I congratulate the Earl of Stockton on his excellent report on the annual report of the European Ombudsman for 2002, to which I give my support, in particular as regards the need for all the institutions of the Union, especially the Commission, to adopt the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour."
"In this context, I should like to highlight the role of the Ombudsmen in the democratic process of Europe, in ensuring that all people have the right to have their affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union; access by citizens to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents; and the right to refer cases of maladministration in the activities of Community institutions or bodies (with the exception of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance acting in their respective judicial roles)."
"I should also like to congratulate Mr Söderman on concluding his term of office, which he has exercised in such a way as to enhance the role of the European Ombudsman in the process of European integration."
"Mr President, I cannot support the Perry report."
"This is an internal British squabble."
"Continental taxes should not be spent on trying to sort this out when a British court is already hard at work trying to solve the problem."
"I am amazed to see British Conservatives attacking a national British institution when I do not believe that Frenchmen, Spaniards or Germans would do the same to their own national institutions."
"They should be ashamed."
"Secondly, this is about posturing, spin and leading on the Names - who, I admit, are unhappy about this - by making them believe that something can come out of this, when nothing can."
"This is going to run into the sand."
"It would be much fairer to tell them - as I have done in replying to letters I have received - that we are very sorry but we cannot help them."
"We should not be spinning and pretending otherwise."
"EPLP members abstained on the Perry report because we do not believe the report to be a balanced view or assessment of the facts."
"The report also contains errors of fact."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0244/2003) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Council's Fourth annual report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports (2003/2010(INI))."
"Mr President, first of all we should ask ourselves why we are debating issues to do with European defence in this Chamber, which is not particularly full, in the European Parliament."
"I am particularly pleased that Commissioner Barnier is here, because he was the one who brought the issue of European defence to the fore in the Convention."
"Right at the outset, I should like to explain briefly why we are addressing defence issues here in this Parliament."
"In 1999, the Heads of State and Government decided to establish a European crisis intervention force of between 50 000 and 60 000 troops."
"Since then, this crisis intervention force, which was actually a virtual force and not a regular European Union army, has however been deployed in two cases, first in a small operation in Macedonia, and then also in Bunia in the Congo under mainly French leadership."
"I come now to the European Parliament: on 10 April of this year, on the basis of the Morillon report, the European Parliament set out its views on defence policy, and in particular proposed a two-stage plan."
"At the time we had asked ourselves what we could learn from Maastricht."
"We learnt from Maastricht that first and foremost you only make progress in Europe if you set clear goals and deadlines for achieving them."
"We said that by the year 2009 we wanted to have made sufficient progress to be capable of carrying out an operation of the intensity and difficulty of the Kosovo conflict on our own, independently, or together with our allies."
"As a first step, the call was made in the Morillon report, and subsequently endorsed by a substantial majority in the European Parliament, for us to have a 50 000-strong crisis intervention force by 2004, a permanent crisis intervention force to be available around the clock for rescue operations and humanitarian duties."
"That then is what the European Parliament is calling for."
"I now turn, however, to arms policy: after the operations in the Balkans, we were told repeatedly by the American side that Europe only spent 50% of what the Americans spend on defence, but that measured in terms of efficiency it was only 10%."
"Why is that the case?"
"In the United States there is only one buyer of arms and that is the Pentagon."
"In the European Union, there are not one but 15 buyers, which procure more or less the same things, but according to different criteria and using different methods, and cooperation in this sector leaves a great deal to be desired."
"We do not therefore have a common armaments market here, but continue to have 15 sub-markets."
"Our goal now must be - if we wish to move forward and spend European taxpayers' money more efficiently in this sector - actually to form a common market, which means dismantling barriers to trade between the Member States in this sector too."
"However, if we wish to dismantle these barriers to trade, we first need to ensure not only that there are common rules for the export of armaments, but also that these common rules are applied in the same way by the 15 Member States."
"Anything else would mean that the exports would first be transferred within the European Union to those countries with the laxest provisions, and that must not be allowed to happen."
"The European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is undoubtedly our most developed body of legislation."
"But firstly it is only a code and it has only been transposed into law in some countries."
"The first demand that is made in my report is for this code to be made legally binding."
"That is the first issue."
"Member States may also declare unilaterally that the provisions are legally binding."
"In addition, we have to ensure, as soon as they are legally binding, that the authorities in the 15 Member States apply these provisions in exactly the same way, because that is the first and most important precondition for success."
"Secondly, the report calls for arms brokering to be better regulated."
"There is a certain element here of deals taking place in a grey area, brokered by people who should surely not be involved in this activity."
"That is why we are calling for all of those engaged in brokering activities to be registered, and think that a Europe-wide system of authorisation should be introduced for this activity."
"Thirdly, we note that it is relatively straightforward to ascertain who has manufactured the arms, and often this also tells you who owns them."
"It is unclear, however, how they are passed from one to the other."
"That is why we are calling for an international system to be set up that will make it possible to ascertain who has passed the arms to the end-users."
"There is a French proposal on this subject and we are calling for this to be used as a basis for ensuring that we obtain a full account of how the arms reach end-users, which is of decisive importance for security."
"Mr President, the clear and balanced report drawn up by my colleague, Karl von Wogau, deserves my warmest thanks."
"The report analyses the situation at present and proposes consistent action for the future."
"It is important to take account of the enlargement of the Union in this connection too, as the considerable market in conventional weapons still focuses on the countries included in the accession now and those countries bordering on them."
"A review and standardisation of EU practices must be undertaken without delay, and we must ensure there is compliance with the EU Code of Conduct in the countries that are to be the EU's new neighbours and in countries with which the EU has concluded a stabilisation and association agreement."
"The rapporteur rightly states it is a fault of the current Member States that data on exports to stable countries - to other EU countries and the United States of America - is given in minute detail but there is a lack of such data on exports to less stable countries."
"The remedy proposed in the report, greater transparency and a more multilateral approach, is the only way to correct these defects and prevent transfers of arms that pose a threat to human rights, regional stability or sustainable development."
"The development and harmonisation of legislation as well as a register of transactions and an authorisation system regarding the export of arms are both essential, and the idea also presented in the report with regard to establishing a European arms export control agency should be seriously considered as a logical next step towards a joint European armaments and procurement policy and the establishment of a common market in armaments."
"One piece of information in the explanatory statement in Mr von Wogau's report needs to be corrected, however."
"The legislation in force in Finland on the export of armaments is in accordance with the recommendations laid down in the UN Firearms Protocol and in the OSCE Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons."
"The control of armaments brokering in Finland aims to thwart the circumvention of bans on arms exports imposed by the European Union, the UN Security Council and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and other international agreements and undertakings concerning the control of exports."
"The aim too is to prevent the illegal manufacture of, and trade in, arms."
"We can therefore anticipate that my country will support the policy being proposed by my colleague, Karl von Wogau."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports Mr von Wogau's report, and I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur for his very good analysis of the successes and deficiencies in the control of arms exports in the European Union."
"In the Convention and the draft constitution we have said that Europe needs to shoulder more responsibility in the world."
"Our clear intention is to not only be a large market but also a political unit, which takes on responsibilities beyond the borders of the European Union, and the issue of arms exports has a central role to play here."
"We hear of some cases of completely irresponsible behaviour: of arms being exported to crisis regions causing conflicts to escalate, instead of arms exports being reduced or stopped, which would help to take the heat out of these conflicts."
"The arms trade is one of the reasons why it is often in the poorest regions of the world that there is armed conflict and, as we see, it is very often child soldiers who are deployed there."
"The arms trade, as we all know, is, like the drugs trade and trafficking in human beings, a multi-billion-pound business."
"The profits are huge, and that is why this shady market is so attractive to operators."
"The Code of Conduct has proved its worth - there has been some improvement - but the report also notes that exports are still being sent to crisis regions in contravention of the Code."
"We have not yet achieved our aim; we do not yet have this issue fully under control."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that if we want a common arms policy - meaning that individual countries do not do their own research or manufacture their own arms but that we do this together at European level - we not only need a common armaments market internally, but also a common arms export policy."
"Just as we have a common trade policy for normal goods, so we also need a common policy for arms exports, and I agree with what we say in paragraph 3: the data available is insufficient."
"The type of arms that are supplied, the total value of exports, the number of licences refused, more precise information on the country of destination and the end-user - we need all of these data, otherwise we cannot exercise control of the market and spot when something is wrong."
"Brokers in the arms trade are quite unique agents."
"We are familiar with the various scandals."
"As I have already said, there is a lot of money to be made."
"That is why I very much welcome our call for a register of arms brokers and also for an authorisation system of some kind."
"We urgently need a common position here, and this Parliament calls on the Council to bring about an agreement amongst the Member States."
"I also wish to mention that the EU cannot shoulder this burden alone."
"We need our neighbours, but we also need Russia and the United States of America."
"We would be pleased if the French initiative were successful."
"It is in the interests of the credibility of the EU's external policy for us to stick to our principles in this sector too, and I very much welcome Mr von Wogau's report."
"Thank you very much, Mr Leinen."
"We hope your work in the Council of Europe also goes well."
"Mr President, the report under discussion refers to an issue of huge strategic, political and economic importance."
"Indeed, the production of and trade in arms secures huge excess profits for multinational big business which, with privatisation, now controls these sectors."
"However, quite apart from the profits, by supplying arms, producer countries also safeguard political control of purchasing countries, both through the rake-off paid by the arms industries to the governments of these countries and through control of their equipment."
"Thus, all means are being used to promote the creation of conditions of demand and consumption of arms, by fomenting tension, armed clashes and massacres of or infighting among peoples."
"The demand and consumption of these products also concerns the producer countries."
"In fact, as we know, our governments are constantly strengthening both the repressive mechanisms used against the burgeoning demonstrations by our peoples against the anti-grass roots policy and conflict prevention, crisis management and the fight against terrorism, in other words military intervention the world over."
"All this, which is expressed through the constant militarisation of the European Union, in ever closer cooperation with ????, calls for huge quantities of arms."
"That is why Mr Solana proposes increasing the military forces."
"These developments, of course, are fraught with huge dangers for the peoples of the European Union and for mankind as a whole within the framework of intra-imperialist rivalry."
"However, they satisfy the speculative appetites of the political-military-industrial network which, especially after September 11, now has absolute control over US policy and is also strengthening its influence in the countries of the European Union."
"The report being debated, however good the rapporteur's intentions may be, does not refer to these questions, or rather it conceals them."
"Like all the previous reports, it formulates wishes and proposals which will never be applied."
"That is why what is needed is not codes of conduct, compliance with which depends on the good will of the Member States, but the introduction of mandatory rules and controls and the gradual reduction in the production, movement and use of arms, pending their definitive prohibition."
"We need to convert war industries into peace industries."
"These are the demands of the movement for peace."
"We support them, which is why we shall not vote for the report."
"Mr President, I should like to say first of all that I share the hope that the Code of Conduct, when applied in the long term, will mean that fewer arms are manufactured, whereas Mr von Wogau gave the impression in his speech that the aim was for less money to be spent on manufacturing arms."
"Secondly, I have to say - and I would ask the President to send a note to this effect to the Council - that a discussion is being held here between the European Parliament and the Council, which means that the Council Presidency is actually who we should be talking to because it has 100% responsibility for implementing the Code, and I am disappointed that it is not represented here at all."
"Thirdly, given that the Council Presidency is not taking its responsibilities seriously, I actually think that it would be sensible for the Commission to share that responsibility, namely where integrated instruments apply, which would also give the European Parliament a better opportunity of contributing to improving the Code of Conduct."
"One of the key issues that we need to address is the Europe-wide registration of arms with the involvement of all Member States, and I think that entrusting the Commission with these tasks would be an important institutional step forward."
"The main problem - and this has already been mentioned - is that the Code is not binding and cannot therefore be applied effectively."
"This is therefore another central issue that urgently needs to be resolved."
"Nevertheless, we also still have the problem - and this too has already been mentioned - that this Code is insufficient to ensure proper surveillance of arms movements."
"That is why we urgently need registration, firstly of the product, secondly of its movements and thirdly of the end-user."
"It is also necessary to have a register of how the arms are intended to be used when they reach the end-user, and for this purpose we need a joint surveillance office in the European Union."
"Even better would be an arbitration service, an ombudsman, to deal with questions and criticism from the public, because arms can still end up in the wrong place and because arms from the European Union still lead to conflicts today."
"I think that it has become clear that the main problem with the Arms Code is implementation."
"In terms of implementation, we still fall far short of meeting our actual standards, and we also know that arms exports still lead to fresh violence in latent conflicts, to the violation of human rights and to situations of war, where we then have to invest more money and personnel to restore peace to the region."
"That is why one of the key tasks of a common foreign and security policy is to ensure that arms exports are tracked and restricted and that those who violate the Code are punished accordingly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, so much is clear."
"You spoke about a politically binding code, but this is not enforceable."
"We cannot jolt our governments' consciences."
"That is a sad thing in connection with arms, because these are not everyday goods."
"Nevertheless, they are all too easily used in this way."
"As regards the report by Mr von Wogau, I think that he is right in noting, on the fourth opportunity we have had to give our reaction to the Council's annual report, that progress can be noted once more, on paper, in reporting and transparency."
"As regards the effectiveness of the agreements, I have the impression that these are chiefly concerned with preventing unfair competition and with not tormenting each other."
"Brokering, too, is to be taken rather more seriously."
"I must say that I am not so optimistic in practice."
"European arms exports are clearly rising instead of falling."
"Many believe that military expenditure should be increased; while we, on the contrary, are inclined to think that it should be reduced."
"The military-industrial complex is organising in order to lobby Brussels intensively."
"Large parts of the world continue to be inundated with arms that are used not only against the people living there, but also against our own peacekeeping forces."
"I saw a BBC report in which French peacekeeping forces in Eastern Congo were fired at with arms supplied with the express complicity of Rwanda or Uganda."
"When I look at the list of suppliers, I see that there are still European countries that either directly supply arms or let arms be purchased using budgetary support, which amounts to the same thing."
"I should also like to point out that, in recent weeks, refugees from Uganda have been arriving in Chad."
"NGOs on site have reported to us that the proliferation of small arms in that area was the direct cause of the outbreak of armed conflict."
"I read here that inquiries have been made into how arms can be supplied for humanitarian purposes."
"I think that it is a bit much to state that this could be possible."
"I do not acknowledge that possibility."
"In my country, the Arms Act was very strict, and, back then, it was said that no arms were to be supplied to regions of conflict."
"Nevertheless, people found an opportunity to export them to Nepal, and now we even have regionalisation of the arms trade."
"At European level, the Code of Conduct may have been adopted, but there is a problem of interpretation, and, as our fellow Members have already said, the grey area is extensive."
"Exporting arms to regions that are somewhat unstable of course means exporting to the best customers, because willing buyers do not discriminate."
"Irrespective of whether the country is rich or poor, arms are being bought and apparently paid for, if necessary with raw materials stolen from the country itself, as is the case in Eastern Congo."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the European Union and the campaign against torture."
"Commissioner Barnier has the floor."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with two forms of torture, which it is equally important to combat."
"The first works on the pretext that it is necessary to find out certain information, for example in the case of dangerous terrorism."
"The other form of torture quite clearly seeks to destroy and break people."
"Obviously we reject both forms of torture in equal measure. Unfortunately it is the case that many people think that torture is something out of the Middle Ages and a problem that in our advanced age we had overcome at the latest by the Enlightenment."
"It was, however, precisely the twentieth century that in a very particular way produced cruel forms of torture and the cruel torturous regimes of Communism and National Socialism, and we have to recognise that, even at the beginning of the twenty-first century, torture regrettably continues to be a reality in many parts of the world."
"In Latin America, torture has thankfully declined considerably since the 1970s and 1980s."
"In Africa, there is hardly any country where torture is not practised."
"In Asia, it is often precisely important European Union trading partners - who otherwise appear in pinstripes as business associates - who have perfected various forms of torture and unfortunately the issue is still relevant here in Europe."
"Just a few years ago there were particularly cruel cases of torture in Kosovo."
"Or look to the East, for example: thankfully the situation in Central Europe has improved - next to me is sitting my friend Figel from Slovakia, a human rights campaigner - and happily 12 years ago these nations overthrew the cruel regimes that practised torture in a democratic revolution, but in the Member States of the Council of Europe, which is meeting concurrently at the other side of the Ill, the problem still exists."
"In Chechnya, for example, the Russian military is responsible for committing brutal acts of torture, and no one is talking about it."
"Tomorrow in the Council of Europe, they will discuss whether to introduce monitoring for Liechtenstein."
"Liechtenstein is an exemplary democracy, while in Russia, in Chechnya, torture continues to be used."
"Compared with Liechtenstein, however, it is a large country, and that is why no one dares to tackle the issue."
"Or take Turkey, a candidate country: it is finding it very difficult to cope with the issue of torture, and yet it also belongs to the Council of Europe and has an association agreement with the European Union."
"This is not just about far-away third countries or past periods of history; it is about the reality of our foreign policy."
"That is why I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that the Commission is making this issue such a high priority."
"I welcome the fact that it is determined both to raise this issue at international level and to actively help the victims of torture, wherever they may come from - we still have a large number of traumatised torture victims with us in Europe precisely from the Balkans - and above all to work in the field of prevention."
"I should like to lend my strong support to this initiative."
"Our foreign trade policy and our human rights policy need to be joined up; the same applies to our development policy."
"The time of human rights clauses in our treaties being just window-dressing is over; they must also be applied and if they really are violated then of course measures must also be taken, because just complaining, just lamenting, just criticising does not do any good."
"Quite simply, practical, substantial steps also need to be taken and I do actually believe that a country in which torture continues to be used on a daily basis for the purpose of administering justice simply cannot be an appropriate economic partner for a democratic Europe."
"That is why I am in favour of a dynamic policy in this field."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of recent events, I should like first of all to express my joy that Amina Lawal, who had been condemned to be stoned to death in Nigeria for adultery, has won her appeal and is no longer facing this threat."
"I believe that the European Union also had a hand in this success, because it campaigned vigorously to ensure that this horrifying act did not happen."
"This gives me grounds for optimism about the willingness to debate and discuss this issue within the ACP partnership, because as you know it is one that we unfortunately have to deal with in these countries."
"It has, of course, been pointed out that there is no doubt that in Africa too torture is practised and that we need to address it."
"What has happened in Nigeria can be seen as a kind of victory for humanity, and our cooperation with the ACP countries, which is, of course, very important to us in this House, contributed to it, as did the European Parliament's resolve."
"This shows then that our policies can achieve real results."
"But to comment on the issue in general: the European Union's commitment to speak up for the respect of human rights and to guarantee the inviolability of human dignity is recognised the world over."
"We also spend considerable sums of money on this, but unfortunately it is never enough, given the misery prevailing in the world."
"That is why, on behalf of my group, I should like to speak in favour of ensuring in particular that reliable provision is made for both prevention and rehabilitation in the future."
"The world really is waiting for the European Union to continue to stand by what it has practised and to stick to its commitment, which cannot be expected from anywhere else."
"It is precisely the rehabilitation centres that have been mentioned here, both within the European Union, but also outside, that must be able to have confidence that their future is secure."
"They must not be allowed to get into a situation where they have as it were to live from hand to mouth and worry every year whether their work, which is tremendously important for the victims, will be able to be continued."
"I should like to stress here that it is not only about offering victims somewhere to stay, a shelter, but also quite specifically about giving them access to legal assistance and psychological treatment."
"This is particularly important for women, who are, as we know, subjected to particularly perfidious methods of torture."
"In Bosnia, but also in other countries, we really exposed to public attention how women are victims of rape, where rape is used as a political weapon, not only as an individual shameful act, but also as a political weapon."
"These women are completely broken both physically and emotionally and they need reliable support."
"We are called on here to offer these people real security and therefore not only to continue the European Union's policy, which must undoubtedly be welcomed, but also to develop it further."
"I will say it explicitly: this applies to both areas, to prevention and to rehabilitation."
"Some aspects clearly overlap."
"It is certainly right to check how cooperation is assured on an individual basis, but there should be no doubt about the European Union's commitment to providing victims of torture with a refuge here."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to express thanks on behalf of our group to you - and also to Mr Patten, who cannot be here today, and his staff - for the great readiness you have shown in the past, and are also showing today, to enter into discussion with Parliament regarding the serious problem of torture."
"You yourself pointed out the important distinction that is currently being made between rehabilitation of the victims on the one hand, and prevention on the other."
"It is extremely important that we continue to take the rehabilitation of the victims to heart; yet we have reduced the appropriations for this by 45%."
"We should like to ask you, however, whether you can assure us that we can continue to count on the funds that are currently available."
"If not, we shall find ourselves in the unpleasant situation in which those involved in rehabilitation have to compete for budget resources with those working on prevention, when of course prevention, too, is an absolute necessity."
"Systematic rape as a weapon in warfare is, sadly, a widespread practice."
"Also, it seems that the situation in which the police consider it normal to torture in order to extract certain information is still the order of the day, even in countries which are applying to join the European Union such as Turkey."
"It is unacceptable that the police consider torture a normal means to an end."
"I think that it is particularly good that we are also devoting attention to educating the police in this sense."
"Good methods, in which humanity is the primary consideration, must be our guiding principle at all times."
"I should also like to draw attention to the fact that children are being used as weapons against their parents."
"I am talking here about the appalling problem of child soldiers, where a child is taken away from home in order to be subsequently used as a means of oppression, as a weapon against its own mother and father."
"Commissioner, we want to work together to prevent this kind of abomination."
"While this is an important tool in conflict prevention, we also want to continue to urge you not to let us lose sight of the rehabilitation of victims."
"Mr President, torture in third countries can comfortably be condemned in this House - the Taliban's treatment of women is the classic example of that."
"However, nobody can deny that the real test would be to match our rhetoric with concrete acts to deal with the endless stream of torture in one of the Member States - the Kingdom of Spain."
"During the last four years, I have raised this issue several times and nobody in this House has reacted to support my complaints."
"Particularly regrettable was the behaviour of our former President, Mrs Fontaine, firstly in January 2001, when I asked for a statement against the pardon of 15 police torturers who had already been sentenced in Spain."
"The President ordered that the speaker be cut off."
"That happened twice in two different sittings of this House during January 2001."
"And secondly, in December 2001, when I brandished a poster photograph of a tortured woman, the President reacted in the same way."
"Commissioner, we have to make sure that the European Union will speak up and act to answer any complaint on torture."
"It is up to the Commission to make sure that Member States comply with European law to win credibility from European citizens."
"Political realism has led the European institutions to the conclusion that it is not appropriate at this stage to do anything that might endanger the political architecture of the European Union."
"However, I am convinced that the majority of Europeans do not share this tolerance towards torture."
"We ought not to pretend that we are doing something serious to oppose torture so long as we do not set up a more ambitious compromise, particularly denouncing by name those responsible for torture."
"Unfortunately, to that extent, nothing has changed in the European Union despite a few courageous reports."
"We await proposals from the Commission seeking to put in place a sensible piece of legislation to reinforce the point that torture cannot under any circumstances be tolerated."
"Political and legal actions must be taken soon, because finding solutions to torture is a matter of urgency."
"I very much support the emphasis of the Commission statement, though I generally believe that many people in the Basque country would consider that it does not go far enough to meet their concerns."
"Mr President, I have asked for the floor because I cannot remain indifferent to the speech made by the Member who has just spoken, and I do not think there is a Spanish Member present to respond."
"I cannot help feeling indignant at what I heard him say, and the best interpretation I could put on the Member's words is that it was a case of vice paying tribute to virtue."
"In the end, however, it was not that."
"The Member who has just spoken does not condemn torture; he does not condemn the violence that the organisation he defends metes out in Spain, kidnapping people and putting them in veritable holes, oppressing them and turning them into objects."
"He protests against possible acts of torture by the Spanish state."
"Mr President, the Spanish state will certainly be condemned if it commits any act of torture, and proceedings have already been brought in Spain against police and authorities who used torture against members of that organisation."
"That is correct practice, democratic practice."
"I cannot listen to what the Member said without protesting, because in fact what he said is the opposite of what he actually means."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would appeal to you not to begin debating this issue."
"A Spanish Member of this House has asked for the floor."
"I am also a Spanish Member of the House but, as President, I have tried to keep calm and will do so."
"I listened to Mr Gorostiaga carefully for more than three minutes, without interrupting him, but I must tell you that I also feel indignant, because it is quite clear to all of us that Mr Gorostiaga does not condemn these attacks - do not worry, Mr Gorostiaga, you will have the floor - and what is more, he used to belong to an organisation that was, to put it politely, disbanded by the authorities of the democratic and lawful state, because of its links with a terrorist organisation."
"I will say no more, but this must be included in the Minutes."
"As a Spanish Member of this House, I take responsibility for my own words."
"I would ask my fellow Member from Spain to leave the floor because this is the wrong type of debate for speeches like his. Mr Gorostiaga now has 15 or 20 seconds to say whatever he sees fit, even though he has taken it upon himself to point his finger at people who are not present in the Chamber."
"Mr President, on a point of order, firstly I cannot agree with the procedure followed by the President, so I protest."
"Secondly, I denounce all torturers without any exception and I would like to see our Spanish colleagues doing the same thing, namely denouncing the pardon given to torturers who have been condemned as torturers."
"The Spanish Government has pardoned them, so they can torture with impunity in Spain."
"All our words will be included in the Minutes."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, as you all know, everyone has a right to speak in this Chamber - which is called, sometimes rhetorically, a temple of democracy - and everyone assumes the moral responsibility for their words."
"Mr President, I also say what I wish to say, and that is why I should first like expressly to thank Mr Posselt for not only criticising and condemning the practice of torture as such in the abstract, but also for naming specific states that sponsor torture."
"I believe that this is one of the most important political points, and we should not forget it."
"In our relations with third countries we should also name any states that practise torture."
"He mentioned Russia and Turkey, and I am rapporteur for Iran, but that does not stop me from saying that regrettably in Iran too torture still takes place."
"We address this publicly, for example in the human rights dialogue that is underway with this country."
"That is why, Commissioner, I think it would have been good if you not only addressed this in individual political dialogues, that is behind closed doors, but if you too had given the names of countries that are associated with torture."
"In this context, if we have evidence of torture, I think it is very important for us to withdraw privileges, for example the trade privileges enjoyed by many ACP States in the context of the Cotonou Agreement, in accordance with the precautions that we have taken in the treaties."
"We have mechanisms for doing this, but it does not seem to me that we are using them in respect of the 77 ACP States, except in the case of Zimbabwe, where we have taken quite modest measures."
"You mentioned a further point, namely the treatment centres for torture victims."
"If I interpret what you said correctly, you were saying that you intended to stop funding these treatment centres."
"You only qualified this by saying, 'not overnight', but the policy is clear."
"You did also mention that there are other potential sources of funding."
"This is a clear indication that this is obviously your intention."
"I would urge you to rethink."
"As a matter of principle, we can only withdraw if we have information that the torture has stopped or lessened, but not without that information."
"That is why I am supporting a proposal that I have heard is being tabled by the Socialist Group, namely to increase budget item B5-813 by EUR 1 million."
"I am also trying to enlist support for the proposal in my own group."
"So we are asking for the opposite of abolishing the budget item: unfortunately at the moment a further increase."
"I would ask the Commission to act in concert with us."
"Mr President, I too, as chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, should like to welcome the release today of Amina Lawal, the Nigerian women sentenced to death, to a terrible death by stoning, on charges of adultery, and I should like to congratulate the Commission and my committee for putting up a fight and influencing to a very large degree the decision issued today."
"We exerted the greatest possible pressure."
"Nonetheless, this woman will not cease to symbolise the fight of all women the length and breadth of the planet, who are fighting for protection of their fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"As far as torture is concerned, I should like, Commissioner, to warmly congratulate you on the initiatives you have taken, especially on the prevention of torture and on the funding of rehabilitation centres for the victims of torture."
"Nonetheless, I trust you will allow me to philosophise a little on this issue."
"Two thousand five hundred years ago in Athens, Aristotle stressed that confessions extracted under torture should not be admitted."
"Another Greek sage and rhetorician, Antiphontas, also said that people subjected to torture only say what pleases their torturers."
"Naturally, our contemporary experience has taught that any confession can be extracted under torture."
"Victims say what the investigating magistrates want to hear and sign anything which will put a stop to the pain and torture."
"It is a fact, however much of a cliché it may sound, that September 11 marked an important turning point in human rights."
"Acts of violence and terrorism, the fear and insecurity which were once confined to certain corners of the planet became a daily reality in many other areas, including in the western world."
"Commissioner, a few years ago, we ran campaigns against the torture used by totalitarian and dictatorial regimes."
"We were certain that there was no place for torture in the western world."
"However, we soon realised our mistake."
"We realised it when we saw Afghan prisoners with masks covering their eyes and ears in gaol on the American base in Guantanamo in Cuba, under conditions which were tantamount to torture in accordance with the opinion of one expert, Maria Kalli, the Greek president of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims to whom you referred."
"At the same time, we were horrified to hear arguments from supposedly enlightened people maintaining that torture should be used in the fight against terrorism."
"In other words, we are going to re-debate what we have known to be true for 2 500 years."
"Nonetheless, no-one doubts that the war against terrorism produces even greater terrorism."
"Unfortunately, the war against terror has turned into a war against freedom, against the freedom to travel in safety, to walk in the street, to meet people and to lead a daily life without fear and terror."
"The most vivid and recent example of how violence generates even greater violence was the attack on the UN offices in Baghdad."
"Today, human rights fighters and voluntary humanitarian organisations are in the line of fire as if they themselves were terrorists."
"Nonetheless, Commissioner, our fight to combat violence and protect victims must not stop."
"From this point of view, I congratulate you on any initiatives you take."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Oral Question (B5-0276/2003) by Astrid Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on difficulties encountered in European beekeeping."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that Mrs Lulling is not only the European Parliament's queen of wine but also its queen bee."
"I should like to thank her very warmly for this commitment, because we should be aware that this has been a matter of concern to the European Parliament for decades."
"Back in the 1980s, the Bavarian Member of Parliament and pan-European, Heinrich Aigner, who sadly is no longer with us, brought together hundreds of Bavarian beekeepers to inject some impetus into this issue."
"We have been working on it for 30 years, and unfortunately we have not made a great deal of progress."
"I have to say quite clearly, Commissioner, that I am grateful to you for your precise answers and for taking this important issue so seriously, because an ecological crisis is slowly developing in this sector."
"In Bavaria and Austria huge numbers of bee colonies died in the spring frosts, but also of course because of insecticides and diseases, and we are feeling the ecological effects very keenly, for example with our fruit."
"That is why I really believe that now is the time to promote something that is under serious threat, namely passing on beekeeping to the next generation."
"A very high proportion of beekeepers are old, because fewer and fewer people from the younger generation are prepared to take on this arduous, but ecologically necessary, task, not least because the financial rewards are ever more meagre."
"That is why I should like to say quite clearly that I - like Mrs Lulling - call for all measures to be taken to support the marketing of natural European honey ahead of cheap, undeclared artificial honey, with which we have repeatedly had to contend, or honey from abroad."
"I would also call for something that is always the subject of some ridicule, but which is ecologically important, namely the pollination premium for colonies of bees, so that we promote this activity by giving beekeepers more support."
"I should particularly like to thank you, Commissioner, for your examples from France, which plays a leading role in this sector."
"Your country also has a former agriculture minister for president and it is a country, which, thank God, takes healthy eating and delicious food very seriously."
"I actually believe that we in Europe should finally see this issue, which is regarded by some perhaps as a bit of a joke, for what it is, namely a health issue and a prerequisite for a functioning environment and ecological system."
"Mr President, I will respond briefly to the few comments that have been made."
"Contrary to what may have been said, the Commission takes very seriously this question that Mrs Lulling has vehemently and competently defended and that Mr Souchet put with her."
"Frankly, if some of you have the impression that no serious scientific work has been done on plant protection products and their consequences for bees, then I believe you are mistaken."
"Work on the substances in question has been going on for several years."
"The International Commission on Plant-Bee Relations, whose particular brief it is to examine the dangers threatening bees, has just held an international symposium in Bologna on the subject."
"Its findings are that the deterioration in the health of bees and the reduced performance of colonies observed in a number of countries probably do not have such a simple, single cause."
"Other potential sources - certain parasitoses, certain farming practices and weather conditions - may have harmful effects on the health of bees just as much as plant protection and veterinary products."
"You mentioned the ecosystem, Mr Berthu."
"I would remind you that I have a longstanding commitment in this area."
"As a former environment minister in my country, I am sensitive to this question."
"The symposium agreed to form a working party to look into the deteriorating health of bees."
"The working party will report to the next symposium, which will be held in 2005."
"I confirm that the Commission will be following this work closely and will draw a number of definite conclusions from it."
"Mr Posselt, whom I thank for his opinion, regretted that fewer and fewer young people are taking up this wonderful rural occupation of beekeeping."
"I simply want to confirm that national programmes concerning honey provide funding for technical assistance to encourage young people to become beekeepers and improve their results."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Mrs Lulling wishes to provide the sting in the tail."
"Mr President, the Commissioner has said that the Commission has no scientific proof of the correlation between bee mortality and the use of new generation pesticides."
"I would like to tell the Commissioner that I have at his disposal the report of the Scientific and Technical Committee on the Multifactorial Study of Disorders of Bees, to which I referred in my introduction and which demonstrates that correlation."
"This report is at your disposal, Commissioner, and we shall meet again on 9 October, when we will be discussing the draft resolution on which the Committee on Agriculture will be voting next week in conclusion of this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be on 9 October 2003."
"I should like to inform the House that Lord Bethell has informed me of his resignation, with effect from 30 September 2003."
"In accordance with Rule 8(3) of the Rules of Procedure, the House takes note of this vacancy."
"Mr President, I do not want to delay the House, but it would inappropriate if I did not mark that particular announcement on behalf of the whole House."
"Lord Bethell has been a popular and hard-working Member of this House for very many years."
"His service has been appreciated by all sides of the House."
"We recall his work on human rights in the Soviet Union when it was at the height of its powers."
"He brought the plights of Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov to widespread public attention."
"This Parliament's Sakharov Prize is something he played a key role in instituting."
"He also had a direct role in air liberalisation, so he has had a direct effect upon consumers throughout the European Union."
"I believe that every politician would hope to be in a position in which, in their lifetime, they could have made at least some difference on behalf of their constituents."
"For the people of Europe, Lord Bethell can say that he has been a politician who has made a difference."
"He will be greatly missed by all sides of the House."
"I should also like to inform the House that Mrs Maij-Weggen has been appointed Royal Commissioner for North Brabant Province in the Netherlands."
"She has informed me of her resignation with effect from 1 October 2003."
"I should like to congratulate her on her appointment."
"In accordance with Rule 8(3) of the Rules of Procedure, the House takes note of the vacancy."
"I have been informed by the competent Slovak authorities that Jozef Heriban has been appointed as observer in place of Imrich Béres, with effect from 9 September 2003."
"The next item is the vote."
"Report (A5-0244/2003) by Karl von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Council's Fourth annual report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports (2003/2010(INI))"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"
"President."
"That concludes the vote."
"The von Wogau report therefore proposes regulating arms exports and making them more ethical."
"One might as well try to make murder, plunder or abduction more ethical."
"The simple fact that the great powers are wasting enormous sums of money on weapons of mass destruction shows that the present organisation of society is barbaric."
"The governments of the great nations, who are responsible for criminal wars from Iraq to Afghanistan and accomplices of state terrorism in Palestine, would like to deny a number of smaller countries, whose regimes they do not like, access to weapons. They would like to do the same to certain organisations described by them as terrorist, and to the world of organised crime."
"Even that, however, is proving impossible."
"In an economy where arms dealers are willing to sell the rope to hang themselves if it makes them a profit, how can they be prevented from bypassing government controls?"
"When the report welcomes the French initiative concerning the submission of a proposal for an International Code on Transparency, moreover, or refers to the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, that is both odious and ludicrous, since those countries are among the world's leading arms exporters and are periodically shaken by politico-financial scandals involving highly placed politicians and arms dealers."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m.)"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 25 September 2003.(1)"
"I am delighted to have the opportunity this afternoon to extend a warm welcome to Dr Jong-Wook Lee, the recently-elected Director-General of the World Health Organization, and his colleagues, who are in the official gallery this afternoon."
"It is Dr Lee's first visit to the European Parliament."
"I should like to thank you for being here, Dr Lee, and, through our respective mandates, I very much look forward to working with you in the future."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I would also like to welcome to our official gallery the Swedish Riksdag's Committee on the Constitution, its Chairman Mr Gunnar Hökmark and Vice-Chairman Mr Göran Magnusson."
"Our colleagues from the Swedish Riksdag are very welcome here."
"I know they have already had a busy round of meetings this morning which will continue this afternoon and tomorrow morning."
"I should like to point out to you that this is the tenth committee delegation this year to come to the European Parliament from the Riksdag."
"We have great pleasure in welcoming you here, and our door is always open to do business with parliamentary colleagues.(1)"
"A corrigendum to the agenda of the sittings of 8 and 9 October 2003 has been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"– Mr President, the next item on the agenda is the oral question on the liberal professions."
"At the Conference of Presidents no agreement could be reached on a motion for a resolution to accompany this oral question."
"There have since been further discussions, and I think there is now a majority in this House in favour of an accompanying resolution."
"I would therefore like to propose voting on a resolution in the next Strasbourg week and would suggest that we set a deadline of 12 noon on Thursday of next week for the submission of motions for a resolution."
"(1)"
"Mr President, I would like you to join with me in welcoming the 'Responsible consumption' week that is taking place in Brussels this week, and which is being promoted throughout the European Parliament's buildings."
"Responsible consumption means that consumers are able to exercise choice in favour of ethically produced or fair-trade products, where the rights of workers are respected and where a social premium is paid to aid poor farmers and other producers in developing countries where goods are sourced."
"This Parliament has played a major role in forcing the issue of corporate social responsibility onto the European agenda, and fair-trade is a very important part of that."
"President, would you please thank the Quaestors for agreeing that this should take place in the Parliament this week, Oxfam World shops for running the stalls around Parliament and also other organisations such as the Fairtrade Foundation and Tradecraft Exchange from my own country who are supporting it."
"Would you please join with me in encouraging all Members of this House to choose fair-trade coffee and other food and goods that are temptingly available to us in the bars and restaurants of this Parliament throughout this week."
"Mr Howitt, we shall pass on your gratitude to all those you mentioned."
"Mr President, with reference to Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure of this House I want to draw attention to a statement made quite recently in the Scottish Parliament in which a Conservative Member of that Parliament said, in relation to the chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries, that ‘it is incumbent upon him to represent the views of the UK Government in relation to the Constitution, and the fact that it might enshrine the common fisheries policy’."
"This was in relation to the draft Constitution and Mr Stevenson's rapporteurship of a report on the subject."
"Can you perhaps confirm, Mr President, that under Rule 2, no member may receive a binding mandate, and further that it is certainly not incumbent on the chairman of any Committee to receive a mandate from any government - be it Edinburgh, London, Madrid or wherever."
"Could you perhaps also confirm that Mr Stevenson is in fact free to stand up for Scotland if he wishes to."
"I can certainly confirm, as you remarked, that Rule 2 deals with the independence of the mandate of Members of this House, and that Members of this House exercise that mandate independently, as I know our colleague Mr Stevenson normally does."
"Mr President, as I have already pointed out in this Chamber, there is a ban in Latvia on the activities of the Communist Party, on communist propaganda and on the use of communist symbols."
"Five hundred thousand Russian-speaking residents, or 40% of the population, who have no citizenship, are excluded from political life."
"Anyone who failed to leave the Communist Party of Latvia eight months before the break-up of the Soviet Union does not have the right to stand for election or to work in the public sector."
"Thus, for example, the communist leader Alfreds Rubiksx, who is today chairman of the Socialist Party, is prohibited from standing for election, despite the fact that his party is represented in parliament."
"Finally, monuments to the SS are being erected with public aid and support at a time when the veterans of the anti-Fascist war are banned from wearing the decorations which they won in the war and some of them are being jailed precisely because they took part in the anti-Fascist war."
"I wanted to take advantage of the presence in the Chamber tomorrow of the President of the Republic of Latvia and her celebratory speech, to highlight this unacceptable state of affairs, which I had the chance to see for myself, and to call on you to refer to this state of affairs during the discussions which you will be holding with her."
"Mr President, as you will be aware, two days ago, an Italian missionary, Annalena Tonelli, was barbarically killed in Somalia in Africa."
"This woman had, for 30 years, dedicated her life to helping the sick, for which she received praise and support from the entire population and from the Islamic community itself."
"This barbaric murder has had an enormous impact in my country, particularly because of the extraordinary humanitarian work done by the victim."
"I would like to ask you, Mr President, if you would convey the condolences of this House both to the family and to Italy’s institutions on this tragic, sudden death."
"Today, on behalf of Parliament, I issued a statement on this matter."
"I shall provide you with a copy and I am happy also to communicate with Ms Tonelli's family."
"Mr President, I should like to express surprise that in this plenary session we are not able to discuss the severe blackout that recently occurred in Italy."
"Citizens throughout the Union, and especially those affected by such an event, would expect the matter to be raised as a matter of urgency."
"We have now asked Mrs De Palacio to come and discuss this with us in committee, but that is no substitute for a statement from the Commission or, indeed, in the light of the trans-frontier nature of what happened, from the Council."
"We need to address the question of the security of electricity supplies and the single market as a matter of urgency."
"I just wanted to register extreme surprise that we were not able to discuss the matter in this plenary session."
"As a result we are not serving the citizens of the Union."
"Nobody raised this during the Order of Business today, which could have allowed us to test the will of the House on the matter."
"We may, however, be able to discuss the wider implications of it during the debate on the preparation of the European Council on 16-17 October, because it is clearly a cross-border issue."
"Colleagues may thus, during that debate, make some points on this matter if they wish."
"Mr President, I just want to take a minute to introduce the House to Kanga, a very special guest from Australia."
"She is a very cute toy kangaroo, but she has come to the European Parliament today with a very serious message: to raise awareness about sudden unexplained death in children over one and adults."
"Many of you will have heard of cot death, which is when babies die unexpectedly, but you may be less aware that many other people die, after the age of one, and often the families get no explanation of their deaths."
"In my own country alone, eight people die each week in this manner."
"The family is left with questions as to why that person died and what should they do about it."
"They get very few answers."
"What we can do in the European Parliament is ask the World Health Organisation and I am pleased that the Director-General is here in Brussels today to give this syndrome a recognised name and a recognised code so that more research can take place across borders."
"We could find out how many people are dying in this way and perhaps come up with reasons why."
"I will be sending colleagues a copy of this letter, addressed to the World Health Organisation, requesting this code."
"I hope they will sign it."
"This will mean that many families across Europe will have some comfort that some research is going to be carried out into this tragic illness."
"After today, Kanga is moving on to the Scottish Parliament and to parliaments and elected assemblies all over the world with her message that we must do something more to get to the bottom of why people die in this manner."
"Mr President, I am asking for your intervention in order to stop the threats against the lives of the journalists Sener Levent and Ali Osman of the Turkish Cypriot newspaper by members of the Grey Wolves extremist organisation in northern Cyprus."
"The and its editor are being threatened with muzzling and this is a serious blow to the freedom of the press and of expression in the Turkish Cypriot community."
"There are well-founded fears that, in the run-up to the elections in occupied Cyprus in December, this type of attack will intensify and that terrorism and fear will prevent the democratic, Europhile voices of the Turkish Cypriot community from being heard."
"I call for your intervention, with the special sensitivity which you, as a veteran journalist, also have on issues of freedom of the press and, likewise, I call for Parliament to be informed systematically by the European Commission and its representation in Cyprus about similar issues."
"I am happy to follow that up positively, Mrs Zorba."
"Thank you for raising the matter."
"– I would like to draw this House’s attention to the fact that a military coup took place not long ago in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. This coup was carried out against an elected president."
"Any coup or movement against a democratically elected political representative must always be condemned unequivocally."
"Admittedly, the situation in Guinea-Bissau was already abnormal, since the People’s National Assembly had been dissolved and the process of electing a new assembly was proving increasingly difficult."
"A transitional charter had been laid down, however, as had an undertaking to restore democracy in Guinea-Bissau, that small and almost unknown country in the Gulf of Guinea."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you and the Community institutions not to neglect this small country entirely, and to provide a substantial aid package in order to restore democracy and for democratic elections to be held."
"Guinea-Bissau needs aid in order to hold these elections, because there is a shortage of everything there, even of money to finance the electoral process. More than that, though, this small nation also needs aid for development, peace, progress, and to ensure that its people will no longer suffer from violence and uncertainty about the future."
"Mr President, last Sunday a demonstration took place in Zaragoza against the National Hydrological Plan, one of the many we have been organising in Aragon."
"Almost 100 000 people attended."
"It was the first demonstration at which more than a third of the population – almost 35% of the inhabitants of Aragon, including people of over 90 years old and babies of under a year – were present to demonstrate their rejection of the National Hydrological Plan."
"As a native of Aragon, I would ask you to communicate to Commissioner Wallström our gratitude for her willingness to enter into dialogue and her constant work."
"Nevertheless, this has not been the attitude of the Spanish Prime Minister."
"I would ask you to communicate to the Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, that we want him to change this intransigent and authoritarian position, and to sit down and talk to the legitimate representative of all Aragonese people, the Government of Aragon."
"Mr President, the overwhelming majority of Aragonese people do not want to be plundered."
"We therefore defend, and will continue to defend wherever necessary, our position of ‘no diversion’."
"That concludes the item."
"The next item is the Commission communication on the full integration of cooperation with ACP states into the budget of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the European Development Fund (EDF), which provides aid to countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region, and its integration into the European Community budget, is not new to this House."
"Parliament has repeatedly called for the Fund to be integrated, and has always supported proposals in this direction."
"It therefore gives me great pleasure to be able to inform you that today the Commission has adopted a communication proposing a complete transfer of the European Development Fund to the Community budget with effect from the next financial perspective."
"The Commission is proposing this move because we are convinced that budgetisation will help to increase the effectiveness of aid given to ACP countries, speed up and improve the implementation of that aid, and provide efficiency gains for all parties involved in the process."
"The proposal is fully in line with the promises made by the European Union at various summits over the past year."
"At Monterey, for example, the European Union committed itself to increasing total aid to developing countries and to improving processing and coordination, thereby increasing effectiveness."
"Parliament is very familiar with the subject of integrating the European Development Fund into the Community budget, and has repeatedly spoken in favour of such a move, one that the Commission has also favoured for a long time."
"The first proposal on the subject was tabled back in 1973 – 30 years ago – and the idea has been raised several times since, most recently in 1993."
"The Member States, however, were never able to agree on how to transfer this special instrument, which has been in place since 1958, to the budget."
"The Development Fund is special because it is financed directly by the Member States and in accordance with a specific formula."
"Nevertheless, it is the Commission that is responsible for the administration of the Fund."
"Here too, however, different rules apply to those used for other foreign policy instruments."
"Whilst Parliament has the right and the obligation to give discharge to the Development Fund, it is not involved in determining the amounts involved or what the aid is used for."
"Why are we again proposing integrating this non-budgetary fund structure into the Community budget now, in 2003?"
"There are two basic reasons."
"Firstly, the proposal will benefit all parties, in particular the recipient countries."
"Secondly, the Commission is convinced that now is the right time, the right opportunity, for this proposal to reappear on the agenda."
"I would like to deal with the second of the two reasons first: the right time and circumstances."
"Three factors have come together."
"Firstly there is the proposal for reforming the Treaties; the preparatory work carried out by the Convention specifically supported the budgetisation of the EDF, and the constitution it proposed would allow this to be done."
"The second important factor is enlargement of the European Union."
"It was agreed in the accession negotiations that the new Member States would not yet contribute to the existing Fund but would participate in negotiations on its successor."
"The third element is the proposed new EU financial framework for the period following 2006, which is currently under discussion."
"The communication agreed on today is therefore a practical feature of the new financial package that the Commission is proposing."
"Just as important as this window of opportunity, however, are the considerations that I shall now set out."
"Inclusion of the EDF in the budget would benefit the ACP countries; it would boost the political effectiveness of EU aid and help make the administration of the aid more efficient."
"The current system of five-yearly negotiations outside the budget system increasingly carries the risk of ACP states being somewhat sidelined politically."
"The advantage for ACP countries is that with integration in the budget, the aid would instead repeatedly be on the agenda."
"The development programmes included in the budget with their annual performance reviews – including by Parliament – actually encourage more efficient processing of aid."
"It would be also easier to account for existing staff within the Community budget rather than under the current Fund system."
"How would this make EU aid more effective?"
"Within the framework of the EDF, a strong partnership approach has been developed, which should definitely be maintained, as should the principle of ownership and the principle of focusing on eradicating poverty, but it would be far better to create synergies between the various programmes which the European Union budget funds and which also benefit ACP countries."
"In addition, funding for global aid programmes such as the Global Health Fund could be used better if the Fund were included in the budget."
"Administrative procedures would be simplified since there would no longer be two separate systems existing in parallel with each other, with two different financial regulations, two sets of implementing rules, and two different accounting standards. Instead, by harmonising the systems, we would increase efficiency, not only within the Commission services, but also for the authorities in the beneficiary countries and for all those who are involved in implementing the aid."
"You see, we have to be aware that non-governmental organisations, for example, have to deal with two separate systems, which obviously generates a great deal of paperwork and inefficiency."
"What arguments could be put forward opposing the proposal?"
"The ACP countries could possibly be worried that their particular concerns would be forced into second place by other foreign policy priorities, such as crisis situations."
"We have to allay these fears and the Commission has indeed done so in its communication."
"For one thing, the aid programme will be guaranteed by a regulation, to be enacted using the codecision procedure, which would include details of the resources to be provided over a given period."
"Our experience with the budgetary programmes has also shown that the pluriannual approach to aid and the principle of annuality definitely need to be reconciled."
"The Commission has not made any firm proposals today about budget figures for the next few years."
"These will have to be fixed during the forthcoming discussions on the next financial perspective."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has proposed a number of important measures to protect future funding levels."
"The current level of aid, for example, will set the minimum for the future, while future economic performance should determine further developments."
"Obviously the finance ratios will also feature in future debates – especially in the Council, of course."
"The financing ratios have to be renegotiated for each new Fund."
"Consequently the current ratios do not represent any guarantee of future EDF spending."
"One major benefit the Commission foresees in integrating the EDF into the European budget is that there would no longer be these separate negotiations on the funding ratios for each new Fund."
"The European Union provides half of all public development aid worldwide."
"Last year the European Union provided EUR 31 billion of a total EUR 60 billion in development aid, a figure that includes aid from the Member States along with Community funding."
"There are currently three sources of Community aid: the Community budget, the European Investment Bank instruments and, of course, the European Development Fund."
"By including the European Development Fund within the Community budget, European aid would become more visible, and could be more coherently presented; this would represent another important step in the process of strengthening the European Union’s international role."
"In order to take this step, a range of proposals for the necessary legal and political implementation need to be submitted and approved in the coming months."
"The Commission is relying on Parliament’s support for these proposals."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, as the Commissioner knows, the European Parliament very much welcomes the analysis that she has given us here today."
"However, what I feel is missing, Commissioner, is a lack of a clear assurance or guarantee about the protection of EDF funds within the Community budget."
"One thing that was also missing from your remarks was a reference to the need to have the agreement of the ACP to this arrangement."
"I would not expect the ACP countries to accept any situation that they felt gave them less leverage and less influence over decision-making as regards the EDF."
"I would like to know how you intend to ring-fence."
"You said you were not quite ready to do this, but the diversion of EDF money towards other European priorities is something that we have been used to in the past."
"We have experienced it and we are very keen to avoid that happening in new circumstances."
"Commissioner, would you consider a new additional heading for development in the financial perspectives?"
"Also, would you be prepared to suggest this in the proposal on the next financial perspectives for the end of 2003?"
"It is, of course, essential that this proposal be discussed in detail with the ACP countries, and such discussion should also cover many features of the EDF that are laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, for example, I would suggest, the partnership approach and also the principle of concentrating on poverty eradication."
